In a poignant scene from the movie, John Chacha says to Belu and Bhola, the two children labourers, “Someday, this night will end. It will definitely end. My heart says that there will be a morning.” Nearly seven decades later, many Belus and Bholas still await that morning. After 20 years, child labour appears to be growing substantially in India again. Apart from the loss caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, India is at the cusp of another catastrophic loss — that of the many successes towards curbing child labour. It is against this backdrop that the Government of Delhi appointed me chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), an independent statutory institution tasked with protecting child rights in the Capital. Based on the consultations of the past three months with several stakeholders, I believe we have identified the most important yet under-appreciated and under-utilised leverages to eliminate child labour. Students’ attendance data can be the strongest predictor of children’s adversity. I analysed Delhi’s government school students in the 2019-20 academic year and found that nearly 35% students were absent, on an average, daily. This translates into over half a million students missing school on any given day. There could be several reasons why children are absent from schools for even longer periods. Their families may have migrated back to their villages, temporarily or permanently. However, this alone does not explain such large, glaring gaps in attendance. We find that children are often absent from schools because they’re going through some sort of personal adversity. It may be serious health conditions such as a disability, bullying at school, the death of a loved one, being pushed into labour or early marriage among other reasons. The absence of students indicates that they are going through severe adversity, and some of our early analysis bears this out. Identifying at-risk children assumes more importance given the fact that 97% are currently enrolled in schools. Unfortunately, the focus on attendance has not got the attention it should in our governance discourse. The Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) data collection framework, the largest annual database of our schools, does not even gather information on students’ attendance.Therefore, DCPCR has started building an early warning system that will trigger a series of actions and interventions based on attendance. If a student is absent for more than seven days at a time, or more than 50% in any month, the warning system will generate Short Messaging Service/Interactive Voice Response (SMS/IVR) calls to the student or her parents as the first step, and then schedule home visits. The dashboard will help the district and state officials reorganise their priorities and work to improve students’ attendance. The Delhi government has brought in a series of pivotal educational reforms which have produced outstanding results. Independent surveys have established that most Delhi parents feel more satisfied than ever in sending their children to government schools. More than 500 government school students cleared the IIT-JEE this year, and the schools also recorded the best-ever class XII board results. These reforms are being internationally appreciated. Schools are better prepared than ever to impart education and shape children to become smart citizens of a modern world. The key here is making sure that all children attend schools regularly. The story of Belu and Bhola in Boot Polish is from a time when the primary and secondary Gross Enrolment Ratio was at 42% and 13% respectively. Today it has reached 99% and 93% respectively. The attendance data can alert us if Belu and Bhola are not in school or are experiencing adversity. This would ensure that Belu and Bhola do not ever have to polish boots again.

20-10-2020||News||From 1962 to 2020, India’s China error | Analysis||October 20, 1962, is embedded in collective Indian memory as a day of national humiliation when Beijing “surprised” Delhi and Chinese troops launched what the then defence minister, VK Krishna Menon, described as “an aggressive war” over disputed territory in the Ladakh region and NEFA areas (now Arunachal Pradesh). At one point in the month-long war, it seemed as if Assam was being abandoned by a bewildered, panic-stricken Delhi and many inadequacies in India’s higher defence management and military preparedness were laid bare.Fifty-eight years later, there is a correspondence of events, wherein India and China are currently engaged in a tense military stand-off along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh region and a large number of troops have been amassed by both nations. While 2020 is not 1962 and history may not quite repeat itself, some rhythms merit scrutiny for the strategically policy-relevant lessons of that war which Delhi has not learnt.The current ground situation in Ladakh is brittle, but there is guarded optimism that quiet diplomacy is underway and that a modus vivendi may still be arrived at, especially with India having gained a tactical advantage on the southern banks of Pangong Tso. However, in whichever manner this military build-up is resolved, there is an irreversible change in the nature of the India-China bilateral relationship after the Indian Army lost precious lives in a violent attack by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops in the Galwan Valley. In a recent conversation, external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, described the bilateral relationship as one that is now “profoundly disturbed”.Could this exigency have been avoided or better managed? An objective review of the last 58 years would suggest that while Delhi was jolted out of the Jawaharlal Nehru-Krishna Menon make-believe framework that led to October 1962, the immediate response was tactical. The scapegoated army was re-organised at the senior level, and Prime Minister (PM) Nehru personally took over the defence portfolio for a brief period. But alas, the inadequacies in the higher defence management of the country were swept under the political carpet.This inability or reluctance to comprehend the fine print of strategic geography, the lessons of history, the abiding relevance of credible military capability and the correlation of these strands to national security have led to a series of “surprises” that peak with an all too familiar post-crisis Delhi fumble. This was evident in October 1962 (Nehru), Kargil 1999 (AB Vajpayee), Mumbai 2008 (Manmohan Singh) and now Galwan 2020 (Narendra Modi).In relation to China, a fundamental policy flaw over the last six decades-plus has been the make-believe frame of reference that the Indian political apex has chosen to inhabit. In 1962, the Nehru-Menon perception of the China issue was the assiduous creation of a simulacrum — where the imagined reality becomes “the reality” for its adherents. Nehru’s conviction about post-colonial Asian solidarity and Menon’s theological faith in the virtues of communism created a virtual “China issue” for a fledgling India. The received wisdom was that China, with Mao at the helm, could be managed by high politics and eloquent diplomacy at the United Nations.The hard and unpalatable reality of the rubber hitting the road was visible in the ill-equipped, poorly-clad Indian soldier having to defend national sovereignty to the last man — as the Battle of Rezang La demonstrated. A huge political blunder and a grossly inadequate higher defence management were at the heart of the debacle, but it is moot if the right strategic lessons have been learnt by Raisina Hill.After the historic Rajiv Gandhi visit to China in 1988, the post-Cold War period saw India and China engaging more robustly at the bilateral level and the PV Narasimha Rao to Manmohan Singh trajectory (1991-2014) was one of stabilising the relationship and enhancing the trade-economic engagement. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the foreign office were the lead players in shaping and implementing India’s China policy — from agreements about the LAC to the Dalai Lama, Taiwan and more. An element of wishful thinking permeated this China policy, which believed that a visible demonstration of Indian good faith to the one-China policy and respect for China’s core sensitivities would allow the LAC to recede into the background. As part of this “appeasement”, Delhi lived with the anomaly of Beijing supporting Pakistan in relation to terrorism and undermining India in international fora.On the Modi watch, the China issue morphed into a problem over the Chumar intrusion (September 2014) and festered through the Depsang-Doklam-Galwan continuum. In retrospect, it is not evident that Nehru’s policy errors were rigorously internalised by the current dispensation. Hence, comprehensive national security capability in relation to China was a low priority and the political oxygen was focused on Pakistan with its domestic electoral subtext. The mistaken assumption (the new simulacrum?) appears to have been that high-level summit meetings and frequent bilateral meetings between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping would help resolve the very complex territorial dispute summarised as the three-letter LAC.The reality of China’s intent in relation to India has tested the perspicacity of India’s higher defence gene-pool to make an objective and effective assessment of the Xi gameplan and arrive at policy options that are viable and sustainable in the long-run.A post Covid-19 world is struggling to emerge and it may be prudent for the Modi government to do a Vajpayee a la Kargil and go back to the drawing board. The central objective would be to objectively comprehend the nature of the China challenge for India from October 1962 to 2020, beyond just the LAC impasse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/from-1962-to-2020-india-s-china-error-analysis/story-2x1ACo1KvSJUSEz6zjTC7H.html
20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Animal activists accuse Chandigarh MC of botching up dog sterilisations||After a second community dog was returned by the municipal corporation with its entrails spilling out of his body, the animal lovers in the city have accused the municipal corporation (MC) of botching up sterilisation surgeries.A complaint has been made to the police regarding this and the animal activists say they will write to the higher authorities about this.The sterilisation drive or animal birth control (ABC) programme began on October 1 this year after nearly a year of inactivity. A fresh tender for the project was recently allotted.Nandini Kakkar who runs the city-based Animal Lovers Association said, “The dog which is around 10 months old was picked up by the MC last week from Sector 16 and returned on Sunday. The surgery to spay the dog had been botched and its intestines were hanging out. We have lodged a complaint with the police and I have taken the dog home with me to get it treated by a private vet.”City-based animal activist Neeru Saharan said this was the second such incident this month. “Another dog was found with its intestines hanging out in the first week of October. The authorities say that the dogs fight among themselves, but it happens because they are releasing the dogs too soon,” she said, adding that the activists had complained to Maneka Gandhi about this.Another city-based animal activist Simran Bani added that the authorities were not sterilising the dogs properly: “Last year, five dogs died of similarly botched-up surgeries. The MC is careless when they pick up the dogs. Many times they end up displacing them and we have to look for them.”District animal welfare officer, who works with the Animal Welfare Board of India, Inder Sandhu, said, “Transparency is needed to ensure such incidents don’t happen again. The sterilisation programme hasn’t been successful, which is why the population of stray dogs has increased in the past few years. Animal volunteers need to be involved for picking up and dropping off the dogs. The age of the dog has to be checked before it is operated upon.”Police officers of the Maloya police station, where the complaint was made, said they had taken the statements of the doctors and the animal activists involved and had lodged a DDR which had been forwarded to the MC.MC slaughterhouse in-charge, Dr MS Kamboj, who is also in-charge of the sterilisation drive, said, “When stray dogs are kept in the shelter after surgery, sometimes they fight with each other, which can cause injuries. Our doctors had examined the wounds of the dog in question and it appears that a human has hurt it.”“We want to work in tandem with animal activists. If any such incident happens, we wish they would inform us and let us take care of the dog,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/animal-activists-accuse-chandigarh-mc-of-botching-up-dog-sterilisations/story-u1vFZ3k2o4wnL7NlWF7cxL.html

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 8,151 new Covid cases, caps prices of masks||A day after reporting its lowest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases (5,984) in 104 days, Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded a slightly higher 8,151 infections, pushing the count to 1,609,516. After a steady fall for over a month, active cases have also slightly increased to 174,265. It comes to 10.82% of the total cases reported so far. On Monday, active cases reported were 173,759.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has fixed rates for masks — double and triple layer one would be available between ₹3 and ₹4, while N95 masks can be sold between ₹19 and ₹49, according to an announcement by state health minister Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra will be the first state to cap prices of masks in the country.On Tuesday, the Covid-19 death toll went up to 42,453 after 213 casualties were reported. Of them, 144 were in the past 48 hours and the rest 69 deaths were from the period before last week, health officials said. Maharashtra has continued to get relatively fewer fresh infections compared to last month. This has resulted in a drop of 127,487 active cases over a month. On September 17, the state’s figure of active cases had reached 301,752. Tope recently said the state has hit a plateau, in terms of cases, and they were looking at positive outcomes. However, officials are wary about the festival season of Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali. If basic precautions are not followed by the people then the situation may reverse, officials felt.“The situation is definitely improving and it is a positive sign. Despite projections of a surge in cases, the infection rate of the state is on decline since the last four weeks. But maintaining this trend is more important, considering the festive season. If people become careless while celebrating festivals and don’t follow social- distancing norms, then the situation will overturn in no time. It’s all up to the people on what they want,” said a senior health official, wishing not to be named.In terms of Covid-19 cases, the current situation is quite similar to what it was in August. In the first 20 days of August, the state clocked 221,610 cases, which is close to 226,224 cases recorded in October so far. However, compared to the number of casualties, the state is in a much better position at present. Between August 1 and 20, 6,365 deaths were reported, whereas this month’s tally is 5,578 casualties.Public health expert Sanjay Pattiwar, too, was of the view that festive season may push the state back. “Lockdown will have to go and that’s where the problem lies. Now, discipline by the people at large is going to play a significant role as the state is relaxing most of the restrictions and many festivals are also lined up. All these are likely to contribute, which could ultimately lead to a rise in Covid-19 cases,” Pattiwar said.“For now, we have to keep our fingers crossed. We have to monitor the situation at least for two incubation periods (each of 14 days), which comes to around one month. In my view, if the trend of low count continues till November end then only we can say that things have come under control,” he added.Mumbai recorded 1,091 fresh cases and 45 deaths, taking the total number of cases in the city to 244,260 and total deaths to 9,864. The number of active cases in the city has come down to 19,553.On Tuesday, Nagpur city recorded 874, second-highest number of cases across the state, pushing its case count to 74,427.Pune district contributed third-highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 605 cases, taking its tally to 73,882.Along with fresh cases, the state is also experiencing a decline in Covid-19 casualties. However, Maharashtra still has the highest number of casualties across the country.State’s CFR was recorded at 2.64% and is at second position after Punjab in the country. The CFR of Punjab was 3.15% (with 4,029 deaths) till Monday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.On Tuesday, the state has conducted 65,456 tests and total tests conducted till date are 8,251,234. The state’s overall positivity rate stood at 19.51%.The number of recovered patients also reached close to the 14-lakh mark as 7,429 recoveries were recorded in the last 24 hours, taking the tally up to 1,392,308. The recovery rate was recorded at 86.5%.On the capping of mask prices, the determined prices will be applicable to all manufacturing companies, distributors, and retail sellers till Epidemic Diseases Act is enforced in the state. They also have been mandated to put up a board specifying minimum prices of the masks, Tope said.The state has already made wearing of a mask mandatory at public places and has also found that mask manufacturing companies are charging much higher than the regular prices.Following this, the state has formed a four-member committee headed by Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer, state health assurance society, to determine prices of various types of masks and give its recommendations. The committee has submitted its report recently.The state has also mandated manufacturers to supply masks at 70% rate of the maximum prices fixed by the state to all the government and private hospitals, nursing homes, Covid centres, dedicated Covid centres etc. Private hospitals have also been barred to charge 110% the procured price from patients.Maharashtra has already capped rates of all types of Covid-19 tests, Covid treatment at private hospitals and ambulances run by private operators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-8-151-new-covid-cases-caps-prices-of-masks/story-N8umA34Vh6wJMo3sDMpIqJ.html

Earlier the project was put to halt in Ludhiana in 2018 after objections were raised on the working of the company and payment of bills. The MC was spending over Rs 70 lakh per month on mechanical sweeping at that time and had spent around Rs 16.5 crores in the past, which was a heavy financial burden on the fund starved civic body. One of the committee members chief sanitary inspector and nodal officer for Swachh Survekshan Ashwani Sahota said that the company that was earlier allotted the contract of mechanical sweeping in the city, was working in Mohali. The company needs to improve its functioning and meet the demands of the industrial hub, he added. A report regarding the same will be submitted with mayor Balkar Sandhu and the MC commissioner on Wednesday, who will take the final decision. The mayor said that a meeting had been scheduled for Wednesday wherein the project will be discussed and all aspects would be considered before reintroducing mechanical sweeping in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-team-visits-mohali-to-learn-about-mechanical-sweeping/story-nJKGncGMXwRjXYl5dBIgSI.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||At 100% cut-off, no admission in Eco (hons) at LSR college||Delhi University’s (DU) Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College, which had announced a 100% cut-off for admissions to three courses this year, has got zero enrolment in one of these programmes --- BA (Hons) in Economics--- under the first cut-off list, as per the data uploaded on the college’s official website on Tuesday. According to the data, till October 17---when admissions were closed for the first cut-off list and the second list was announced ---- there were zero admissions in BA (Hons) in Economics. The other two courses for which college had set 100% cut-off in the first list -- BA (Hons) in Political Science and Psychology--- have witnessed 20 and three admissions, respectively. As many as 35,500 of the 70,000 seats have been filled under the first cut-off list across DU colleges this year. In the second list, all colleges, including LSR, have dropped their cut-offs marginally by 0.5 to 1 percentage points. The college has dropped one percentage points for admission in Economics, and 0.5 percentage points in Political Science and Psychology in the second cut-off. An official, who wished not to be named, said, “The college set the 100% cut-off keeping the past record in mind when we had witnessed over admissions in the same course.” College principal Suman Sharma said, “We had received around 25 applications under the first cut-off list for Economics (Hons). But we had to reject them all as they did not meet the cut-off. It’s really surprising since every year, we see a rush for Economics.” Meanwhile, admissions across DU colleges picked up pace under the second cut-off list on Tuesday, with around 6,024 new applications being approved and 8,422 students having paid their fees to complete the process. With this, around 46,000 out of 70,000 undergraduate seats available across DU colleges have already been filled. The admission process proceeded slowly on the first day of the second cut-off list on Monday, when only 2,602 students managed to complete the formalities. The admission process under the second list will conclude by 5pm on Wednesday, with the third cut-off set to be released on Saturday. According to the data provided by the university, as many as 4,882 students had applied on the second day of admission in the second cut-off across 61 colleges (excluding St Stephen’s and Jesus and Mary) by 8pm on Tuesday. Of them, 6024 applications were approved by the colleges. At least 8,433 aspirants, including those whose applications were approved on Monday, completed the admission process by paying their fees. Many colleges have witnessed withdrawals and cancellation of admissions as well in the last two days. In Aurobindo College, around 400 students have taken admissions and 235 have withdrawn admissions between Monday and Tuesday evening. In Ramjas College, while around 60-70 have withdrawn admissions in the last two days, over 240 new students have enrolled. In Aryabhatta College, 40 students have withdrawn admissions and 192 new students have enrolled in the last two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-100-cut-off-no-admission-in-eco-hons-at-lsr-college/story-4W1NFalM49vdT0CUdT5cCK.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Hydrogen-enriched CNG plant opens at Raj Ghat depot, Delhi soon to get 50 hydrogen-powered buses||Soon, the national capital will have 50 buses running on hydrogen-enriched CNG(HCNG), a fuel that experts claim is more cleaner and efficient. The announcement was made at the inauguration of India’s first semi commercial HCNG plant and dispensing centre at the Raj Ghat bus depot on Tuesday. The facility was inaugurated opened by Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan and Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot. During the ceremony, officials said a pilot project will be launched soon to run 50 HCNG buses for six months to test the latest eco-friendly fuel technology in terms of economy and emissions. Pradhan said the central government is looking to scale up HCNG commercially so that its price eventually comes down. According to a preliminary assessment by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), which has developed and patented the technology for the efficient and cost effective production of the fuel, the cost escalation for shifting to HCNG buses will be about 72 paise per kilometre. The IOCL hopes would this rate would come down once the fuel is used on a large scale. “I will not call this a pilot project. I am certain that we will scale up HCNG to such a level that all state-run buses in Delhi will soon be powered by this cleaner fuel. The trial run of 50 HCNG buses will be a major breakthrough in India’s journey towards hydrogen economy. This will be a major leap also in tackling air pollution in the national capital,” Pradhan said. In the pilot project, IOCL plans to test the performance of buses and reduction in emissions after using CNG mixed with 18% hydrogen in each bus. Senior transport officials said the best thing about HCNG is that it does not require any modification of the engine or retro fitments -- only some recalibration is required. The plant at the Raj Ghat depot has a capacity to produce four tonnes of HCNG daily. Gahlot said the Delhi government has provided ₹15 crore for setting up the Raj Ghat plant and are conducting a study of the new fuel. “The good thing is that the ministry of road transport has also notified HCNG as a fuel starting from September 2020. When tested by the Automotive Research Association of India, the blended fuel showed a 70% reduction in carbon monoxide and a 25% reduction in hydrocarbon emissions as compared to baseline CNG. Scaling this up will majorly reduce pollution in a city which has over 10 million registered vehicles,” he said. Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) chief Bhure Lal said the cost of HCNG production by IOCL is about 22% cheaper than conventional physical blending. “Initial trials have also shown that it increases the vehicle’s fuel economy by 4%-5%. Completion of trial is expected by April 2021. International Centre for Automative technologies (iCAT), Manesar, an independent certifying lab, will be undertaking periodic assessment of the select buses’ performance on HCNG fuel. On completion of the trial, a detailed performance report will be submitted to the Supreme Court through EPCA,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hydrogen-enriched-cng-plant-opens-at-raj-ghat-depot-delhi-soon-to-get-50-hydrogen-powered-buses/story-tYzOdCcEvFfRfOAWQlBM9K.html

While the humble potato is priced at Rs 55 to 60 per kg in the retail market, onions are being sold at Rs 70 per kg. The wholesale rates of these vegetables are Rs 28 per kg for potato and Rs 60 a kg for onion.Vegetable market arhtiyas say that the onion rates have shot up due to shortage caused by crop damage in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra following incessant rains. Area under veggie cultivation dipsMeanwhile, vegetable farmers are also bringing down area under cultivation. Mohd Gafoor, who cultivates vegetables on 63 acres in Patiala, said that he had suffered a loss of nearly Rs 30 lakh as the mushrooms, cucumber, baby corns and pumpkins which used to sell like hot cakes perished in his field during the lockdown. But this summer, he cultivated vegetables only on 12 acres and used the rest for paddy farming.“Vegetables used to be in huge demand. But the market window for these is limited. And in the absence of proper mechanisms for refrigeration and storage, we had no choice but to switch to paddy. But now that the vegetable prices are hitting the roof, I am receiving rich returns for my produce,” he added.Manpreet Singh Grewal, president of crop residue management wing of PAU Kisan Club, said that currently hoarding of potato and onion is leading to price rise. “As fresh crops are yet to arrive, the prices of potatoes will further rise in the coming weeks. The prices will crash by the end of the year or in the beginning of next year. With the passing of new farm laws, the central government has lifted government restrictions on hoarding, and such price variation will be common in the coming days,” said Manpreet.Gurkanwal Singh, president of Sabzi Mandi Vegetable Arhtiya Association, said that prices of both onion and potato are set to rise. “We are expecting the next set of onions crop by the next month. This will likely bring some respite to residents. However, the prices of other vegetables are also going to rise due to less cultivation,” said Gurkawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/potato-onion-prices-leave-ludhiana-residents-jittery-no-respite-till-next-month/story-dK7llfUYoDpRHHWDJ1BvuO.html

Apart from the nine, a juvenile has also been apprehended in the case, police said.Police identified the arrested persons as Deepak alias Boonda, Surender alias Sheru, Saddam Gauri, who is lodged in Rohini Jail, Deepak’s wife Neha Kakkar, Surender’s wife Sonia, Kuldeep alias Sonu, Raj Kumar, Shiva alias Bholu, and Satish aka Kallu.A motorcycle, three pistols, three cellphones used for making the extortion calls and a car were recovered from them, deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said. According to the West Delhi-based businessman’s complaint, on September 2, three persons had opened fire at his office in an attempt to intimidate him into paying up protection money, police said. Two of the suspects, Deepak alias Boonda and Surender alias Sheru, were arrested by a special cell team following an encounter in Vikaspuri a fortnight ago. The juvenile suspect was later detained in connection with the shooting, police said.Police said the juvenile and the other seven persons were apprehended over the past 20 days by the Rajouri Garden police station team, which has been probing the extortion case lodged on the businessman’s complaint. The same team was also probing a similar case, in which Deepak and Surender, on September 21, had allegedly shot at their rival, Raju Khan, after he refused to pay “protection money” to them, said a senior police officer associated with both cases. “The mastermind of this extortion syndicate is Gauri, who is currently lodged in Rohini Jail in connection with a MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) case and on charges of murder and attempt to murder. He was running the racket from inside the jail. This gang has created terror among traders in west Delhi. They made extortion calls through the internet and various mobile applications to avoid detection,” said DCP Purohit.Director general, Delhi prisons, Sandeep Goel said, “Search operations and surprise searches are being carried out in the barracks to confiscate cellphones whenever any information regarding the use of phones is brought to our notice. We take strict actions against inmates from whose possession the phones are recovered. Also, action is taken against jail officials who smuggle in phones and other banned items to inmates.”The west Delhi businessman, in his complaint, had said that was not present in his office when around 6.30pm on September 2, Deepak and Surender arrived and fired three shots at his office, shattering the glass door. Three people who were inside at the time escaped unhurt as they had rushed out of the office. The duo then picked up the digital video recorder of the CCTV cameras and fled, said an investigator, quoting from the complaint. Police said the following day, the wives of the two suspects reached the businessman’s office and threatened that they would kill him if he did not pay ₹70 lakh as protection money. The businessman went to the Rajouri Garden police station on September 4 and filed a complaint. “While the special cell team arrested Deepak and Surender, the local police caught the remaining suspects,” added the officer. Interrogation of the arrested persons, the officer said, revealed that Deepak and Surender fired the shots and demanded extortion money on the directions of Gauri, who had been making the extortion calls from jail. The other arrested persons provided logistical support and safe hideouts to Deepak and Surender, DCP Purohit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/extortion-racket-being-run-by-gangster-from-rohini-jail-busted-nine-arrested-juvenile-detained/story-1qMvBGKw9UJmV4HsUAzMNM.html

20-10-2020||Gurugram||Health department to install digital temperature data loggers for vaccines||To preserve the quality of the vaccines administered under immunisation programme, the district health department has started the process of installing temperature data loggers — digital devices for accurate monitoring of temperature of vaccines at cold chain points. Studies conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) in India show that vaccines are exposed to different temperatures in the cold chain supply, affecting their quality. Generally, vaccines are supplied from the medical depots to primary and community health centres. In this process, temperature at which a particular vaccine has to be kept varies. On Tuesday, a temperature logger was installed at the Primary Health Centre, Daulatabad, by the district health department. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “There are 38 cold chain points in the district, where temperature loggers are to be installed by November 1. There are always chances of vaccine quality to be affected due to variation in temperature. With the help of loggers, health department officials will be informed about any change in the temperature on their mobile phones or mails.”The task was earlier performed a pharmacist twice in a day. “The exercise was earlier manual; now it is digital,” said Yadav. According to him, the temperature will be recorded every hour by the machine. “If due to some circumstances, temperature fluctuates, officials will be alerted through SMS or email,” he said.In Haryana, 661 cold chain points are functional in 22 districts. In all the cold chain points, temperature loggers will have to be installed by November 12. According to the statement issued by the health department, the project is funded under United Nations Development Programme. In 2015 Electronic Vaccine Intelligent Network was launched in 508 districts of 21 states for proper management of supply and storage of vaccine to streamline immunisation. It provides real time information on vaccine stocks, storage temperature across all cold chain points.Earlier, HT had reported that in anticipation of a possible vaccine for Covid-19, the district health department will be also conducting a thorough assessment of the available ‘cold chain’ infrastructure. The exercise is meant to take stock of available cold chain equipment (CCE), such as walk-in freezers, walk-in coolers, ice-lined refrigerators and temperature-monitoring devices, which are used in the storage and transportation of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-to-install-digital-temperature-data-loggers-for-vaccines/story-rji4Nu9qDj8GFshH8Qo4BK.html
20-10-2020||Gurugram||Traffic diversions at Kanhai crossing to ensure smoother flow||In a bid to solve traffic congestion on city’s main roads, the Gurugram traffic police have blocked a major exit at the Kanhai crossing, around 500 metres before the Huda City Centre (HCC). The Kanhai crossing is one of the most congested junctions in the city and it takes commuters 15-20 minutes to cross during peak hours.The junction was identified as a major bottleneck as it leads to major road networks — the Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road, Golf Course Road (GCR), St Thomas Marg, Golf Course Extension Road (GCER), Vikas Marg and Netaji Subhash Marg.As per the new plan, the stretch leading from Vikas Marg/Netaji Subhash Marg through Kanhai village towards GCR and GCER has now been permanently blocked. The Gurugram traffic police, earlier this week, placed jersey barriers and boulders at the spot.Commuters travelling on this road can no longer head straight towards GCR or take a right to head towards GCER. Instead, they have to take a mandatory left turn, and then take a U-turn opposite Shani Mandir to head towards any of these directions.Traffic police officials said that the rationale behind this move was to cut off the need for a traffic signal at the junction, thereby reducing the waiting time for vehicles on other traffic signals as well as decreasing the traffic build-up at these points.Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, in January and February, traffic police officials used to block this exit during peak traffic hours whenever the congestion at the junction started spilling over to the nearby HCC junction. However, the route used to remain open at other times.Traffic police officials said that with the volume of vehicles once again returning towards normalcy and the junction witnessing heavy congestion again, they decided to make the feature a permanent one.“In a bid to reduce traffic congestion, we keep undertaking makeshift trials at various intersections. These are mainly temporary in nature so that we can revert to the original design if the experiment doesn’t work. In the case of Kanhai crossing, the experiment has worked after several successful trials on the stretch and hence, we have made it a semi-permanent feature. We’ll be undertaking more such changes across the city if the need arises,” said DK Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gurugram.Commuters who travel through the junction on a regular basis said the move has helped them save around 10 minutes of daily travel time.“It was only after the traffic signals turned green on the third or fourth occasion would I manage to cross the junction during peak hours. It used to take me around 15 minutes to cross the stretch. With the changes, I am able to make my way through after a maximum of two signals, in under five minutes,” said Rakesh Kapoor, a resident of DLF-5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/traffic-diversions-at-kanhai-crossing-to-ensure-smoother-flow/story-fJaFN3Nw5TB93rovq8zaxN.html
20-10-2020||Gurugram||Air quality picks up, experts say respite temporary||The air quality in Gurugram improved to ‘moderate’ level, clocking an air quality index (AQI) of 192 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin, after languishing in the ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ levels over the last week. The city had last reported a ‘moderate’ AQI, of 187 on October 11. Experts, however, said that the improvement is a temporary relief, with the air quality likely to deteriorate in the last week of October. The air quality had improved on Monday as well, recording an AQI of 245 (‘poor’) in comparison to the AQI of 273 (‘poor’) recorded on Sunday.The three air monitoring stations set by the Haryana Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) recorded ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ air quality. The monitor at Sector 51 recorded an AQI of 246 (‘poor’), while the monitor at Vikas Sadan (within the Mini Secretariat complex) recorded an AQI of 234 (‘poor’). A third monitor at Teri Gram on Gurugram-Faridabad Road, however, recorded an AQI of 131 (‘moderate’). An air quality monitor set up by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) at the National Institute of Solar Energy in Gwal Phari recorded an AQI of 169. As per the CPCB’s categorization of air pollution, an AQI between 0-50 is considered ‘good’. From 51-100, it is ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 is ‘moderate’, 201-300 is ‘poor’, 301-400 is ‘very poor’ and 401-500 is ‘severe’. Prolonged exposure to ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ air quality leads to breathing discomfort and respiratory illness.Sachin Panwar, a city-based air pollution consultant, said that Tuesday marked the beginning of winter, as the minimum temperature dropped to 11 degrees Celsius. “North-westerly winds are blowing at the speed of 6-10 km/hour, which is not allowing particulate matter to stick to the fog, except the particles which are released through stubble burning or sugarcane thrashing. It is a temporary relief till October 25. PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter) concentration will, though, remain high from 4am till proper sunrise.”According to IMD’s weekly forecast, the minimum temperature will fluctuate between 11-13 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature will remain in the 29-33 degrees Celsius range. To tackle poor air quality in the city, various government agencies are focusing on the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). On Tuesday, nearly Rs 75,000 was imposed as fines for dust from construction and demolition waste from three defaulters, following inspections at 15 different inspection sites. Fines of Rs 1 lakh have been collected from polluting vehicles, while Rs 20,000 has been collected from those burning waste in the open. The prosecution in only one of these cases is related to unauthorised brick kilns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-picks-up-experts-say-respite-temporary/story-PLpQYP3fIgJW3vA80DgP4H.html
20-10-2020||Gurugram||10% of recovered Covid-19 patients report secondary infections as air quality worsens||A 48-year old resident of Manesar, who recovered from Covid-19 in August after undergoing treatment in a hospital, recently developed symptoms like breathlessness, which made him visit the Medeor Hospital on Tuesday. He was prescribed medicines by the doctors, who told him that the choking sensation has been due to an increased exposure to fine particulate matter due to the poor air quality in Gurugram.According to doctors, quite a few people who have recovered from Covid-19 are being negatively impacted due to poor air quality in the city that is aggravating chest infection. “Nearly 5-10% of recovered Covid-19 patients are visiting OPDs, reporting shortness of breath and secondary infection over the coronavirus pneumonia,” said Sanjay Gupta, senior consultant and head of department, internal medicine, Medeor Hospital — a dedicated Covid-19 hospital for tertiary care in Manesar.“The secondary infection is mostly allergic bronchitis or bacterial infection. This is due to the high level of particulate matter, dust in the air, and the change in temperature. These are particularly impacting patients, who have recovered from Covid-19,” said Gupta, who asked his 48-year-old patient to avoid going out until necessary.Since last week, the air quality in Gurugram has entered the ‘poor’ category with high levels of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air. Since they are concentrated in the atmosphere at a level where it is easily breathable, doctors suggest those with compromised lungs due to Covid-19 are vulnerable to the pollution. In the district at least, 25,872 people have been tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Of these 2,370 are active, 193 have succumbed to the illness, while 23,309 have recovered till now. “Overall patients complaining of chest infection have almost increased by over 40% with nearly 5% of them being recovered Covid-19 patient,” said Manoj Goel, director, pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute.“During winters, there is usually an uptick in patients with severe asthma, bronchitis and chest infection. Seasonal variations and pollutants in the air increase the severity of the infection. Exposure to particulate matter for long time and the presence of bacterial and fungal infection leads to a choking sensation in patients. This is also seen in the recovered patients of coronavirus disease,” said Goel.“It is being seen in the patients who had moderate or severe symptoms of Covid-19 and were admitted to hospitals. Covid-19 primarily impacts the lungs, the condition of which can be worsened by high pollution levels. Even Covid-19 patients who have recovered six months back are coming with secondary chest infections,” said Goel, who said that the increased footfall is also due to the unlock measures, which are enabling people to visit hospitals.According to doctors, recovered patients, who are reporting of symptoms like breathlessness, heavy cough, sore throat and fever should visit a doctor for consultation. Other hospitals like Paras Hospital and Columbia Asia Hospital are also witnessing a spike in the footfall of patients with lung infections. Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant and head respiratory medicine/pulmonology, Paras Hospital said, “Most of the chronic respiratory diseases like asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) tend to get worse with lowering temperature and rise in pollution. We are seeing a rise in COPD and asthma patients by up to 15 % over the last 10 days. Rise of PM2.5 level is clearly associated with lung health. This year, we are dealing with both Covid-19 and pollution-related illnesses”Doctors also said there is also a tendency for an underlying allergy to flare up in this season. Dr Nevin Kishore, head of bronchology and senior consultant, respiratory medicine, Max Hospital, Gurugram, said these patients face increased sneezing and coughing during at night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/10-of-recovered-covid-19-patients-report-secondary-infections-as-air-quality-worsens/story-nF2hnL2MffrxDvIrEpg7sJ.html

20-10-2020||Gurugram||Residential societies in dark over diesel genset exemption||A lack of clarity over exemption on diesel genset ban in Gurugram has left many residential societies that do not have power connections in the lurch, with developers reluctant to operate gensets in view of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). Ramprastha City in Sector 37 is one such residential society that suffered a power outage on Tuesday as the developer, citing anti-pollution measures, turned off the diesel gensets. around 1,000 families residing here have been affected.Officials of the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) on Tuesday confirmed that there was still no direction from the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca) on the ban, as a result of which they are now seeking undertakings from developers to get exemptions on a case-to-case basis.The Epca’s directions earlier in October stated that diesel genset ban would be enforced, without exemption for residential societies, from October 15. However, the Haryana government had sought an exemption for condominiums that do not have regular power connections.The Epca, however, is reluctant to give any relief to the violators this year. Dr Bhure Lal, chairman, Epca, said on Tuesday that no exemption has been granted and their order in this regard is clear. “We will not give any relief as exemption has already been granted to essential services. We have asked the state government to explain the matter,” he said.TC Gupta, additional chief secretary, power department, Haryana, did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking a response on this matter. According to the DHBVN, 23 residential societies in the city have been impacted by the ban on diesel gensets. Officials also said that around 60 residential societies in total, particularly in developing sectors, are partially affected by this genset ban.Manoj Yadav, superintending engineer, DHBVN, Gurugram, said that an application for seeking exemption from Epca would take place on case to case basis. “If the developer completes formalities and infrastructure, DHBVN a give regular connection within a month,” said Yadav.Vinita Singh, chief engineer, Smartgrid, also confirmed that exemption on the operation of gensets has not been announced yet. “We have not received any direction in this matter,” she said.DHBVN had said that 20 of the 23 societies have submitted undertakings to Epca so far. However, none of these societies has been granted an exemption so far, as the Epca awaits a response from the state government in this regard.Ramprastha CityAfter the developer of Ramprastha City cut off power supply, delegations of residents approached the DHBVN, Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) and the district administration to find a solution to the issue.Ramprastha City in Sector 37 does not have a regular power connection and is dependent on a temporary connection, taken for construction purposes, and diesel gensets to meet the electricity shortage.In order to defuse the crisis, DHBVN officials said that they are seeking an updated undertaking from the developer of Ramprastha City on the timeline for installing the power infrastructure so that a regular connection can be issued to them. “The developer has been asked to submit an undertaking in this matter and this will be submitted to the Epca for seeking exemption on genset ban within next one or two days. I have also directed officials to ensure minimum power is curtailed on temporary lines so that power cuts don’t take place,” said Yadav.Officials of the DTCP, meanwhile, said that they have taken asked the developer to work with the residents’ welfare association (RWA) and DHBVN so that exemption is granted in the short term and electricity infrastructure is also upgraded at the earliest. “All efforts are being made to help the residents,” Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said.A senior official of the pollution department, on the condition of anonymity, said that with no clear directions from Epca on the exemption, residents should directly file an application with Epca and seek relief from the authority. “The relief in this matter can be granted by Epca alone,” the official said.Residents of Ramprastha City said that they would call on the Epca to seek help in this matter. “We met the authorities on Tuesday and apprised them of the problems being faced by over 1,000 families due to lack of clarity on this matter. A large number of people are working from home, students are taking classes online and senior citizens living in the colony. We are all suffering due to power cut, as supply from gensets has been stopped,” said Pradeep Rahi, president, Ramprastha City RWA.Nikhil Jain, chief executive officer of Ramprastha Developers, did not respond to calls and messages from HT, seeking a response in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residential-societies-in-dark-over-diesel-genset-exemption/story-ZgRsYiTSTv2PwUUH80LSrN.html

The police said the suspect suffered a gunshot injury in his leg and was admitted to Civil Hospital for treatment, the police said. According to the police the suspect has been identified as Somber alias Chand alias David — a resident of village Kamas Khedi in Jind. He was wanted in over two dozen of cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, posession of illegal weapons, theft, robbery, and loot cases in Biwani, Jind, Gurugram, Sonipat and Rohtak. Joginder Singh, inspector, crime investigation agency of Palam Vihar, said that they had received a tip-off at about 2am on Tuesday that a criminal was soon likely to cross Carterpuri Road towards Dharam colony near Palam Vihar area. “We immediately formed teams and barricades were put up at suspected areas. We then zeroed in on those areas and a trap was laid to arrest him,” he said. Around 2.40am, a motorbike was seen coming towards the checkpost. When the police teams asked him to stop, he allegedly started firing at police teams and tried to flee from the spot. “The suspect then started firing. When the police team rushed towards him, he again opened fire. In retaliation, the police shot at him and the suspect suffered a bullet injury in his leg. He lost control and rammed the motorbike into the police control room vehicle and fell down. He tried to run into the fields but the police teams surrounded him. More police personnel were called in who surrounded and arrested him,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). According to Sangwan, a total of 30 rounds were fired. The suspect fired five rounds and the police fired the remaining in self-defence. The police have allegedly recovered one countrymade pistol, two live cartridges and one motorbike from his possession. He allegedly confessed to the crime and is currently undergoing treatment at Civil Hospital. The suspect is allegedly a member of Sandeep Badwasni gang. “In 2017, one inspector Sonu Malik’s uncle, Satyawan, was shot dead by some gangsters in Rohtak in retaliation to the killing of a gangster Badwasni in Sonepat. Malik’s uncle was one of the accused persons in Badwasni’s murder and after his murder they wanted to take revenge by killing Malik,” said Sangwan.On September 6, inspector Sonu Malik, who is presently posted at the Commando Complex at Newal in Karnal, was walking to his car after meeting a relative in Palam Vihar area. The police said as he reached near his car, at least two armed suspects intercepted him and fired at him. The police officer suffered a gunshot wound in his right shoulder and in retaliation, he fired at the alleged shooters, who managed to escape. A case of attempt to murder was registered at Palam Vihar police station on September 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sonipat-based-gangster-arrested-after-a-shoot-out-in-palam-vihar/story-nLNVIPj4mNiwD7aBFMUycM.html

20-10-2020||Bhopal||‘Ramdev’s institute won’t get Covid centre for clinical trial’: Madhya Pradesh health dept||Madhya Pradesh health department has directed the district health offices not to allow Ayurvedic drug for Covid-19 patients ‘in view of the absence of any fact on inter-related effect and side-effects of Ayurvedic and allopathic medicines on such patients” without its approval.AYUSH department of Madhya Pradesh has been conducting a trial on Covid-19 patients at Ayurveda medical college in Bhopal and various district hospitals for several months, as per the department. The first casualty of the order, issued on October 16 and made public on Tuesday by the directorate of health, imposing a ban on Ayurvedic drugs trial, was Swami Ramdev’s Haridwar based Patanjali Research Foundation Trust. The institute was making efforts to conduct such a trial in Madhya Pradesh. The Trust has not been able to get any hospital in the state to conduct a trial on Covid-19 patients through its institute even after four months of having got the permission from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government. The health directorate initiated a process to allot just one centre to the Trust in the state for the trial and instructed chief medical and health officer (CMHO) in Indore Dr Praveen Jadia on October 3, 2020, to allot a Covid Care Centre in Indore to the Trust for the trial. Also read: ‘Lockdown may be over but Covid-19 is still around’ - PM Modi in address to nation“I have received the order from the directorate of health regarding the ban. We have not allotted any Covid Care Centre to Patanjali Research Institute so far. In light of the latest order from the directorate, we will now not allot any centre to the institute”, said chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Indore, Dr Praveen Jadia. The order issued by additional director (Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme) Dr Veena Sinha states, “Trial of Ayurvedic medicines on hospitalised Covid-19 patients not TO BE conducted in view of non-availability of any fact regarding inter-related effect/side-effect of Ayurvedic and Allopathy medicines.” The order, based on the state technical advisory committee’s recommendations that came during its October 7, 2020 meeting, was issued to all the district collectors, chief medical and health officers across districts, civil surgeons at all the district hospitals and deans of all the medical colleges in the state. Deputy director, department of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), Dr PC Sharma said, “We are yet to receive the order. However, we are a conducting clinical trial at Pt. Khushilal Sharma Government (Autonomous) Ayurveda College & Institute, Bhopal and government allopathy district hospitals in at least 31 districts of the total 52 districts.” Vice-president, Patanjali Research Institute, Haridwar, Dr Anurag Varshney said, “We are not aware of this particular order. However, no Covid Care Centre has been allotted to us till now. We have been told the process is going on.” When contacted, additional director (Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme) Dr Veena Sinha said, “The order was based on the recommendations by the state technical advisory committee but it was meant for ensuring that any permission for any such drug trial is not granted at the district level. We will clarify if there is any confusion in any district due to want of an elaborate order in this regard.”However, a health official who didn’t want to be named said, “The health department authorities would have to issue an amended order if Patanjali Research Institute has to be allowed a clinical trial in the state if the government really wishes so. For any individual or organisation can challenge the government’s decision in the court of law in view of the latest order if the government and the institute go ahead with the clinical trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/ramdev-s-institute-won-t-get-covid-centre-for-clinical-trial-madhya-pradesh-health-dept/story-jDDs4NKsYNFBVbN5LBQY7I.html

They demanded that the government should postpone the entire process of disposing of cases pending since 2013-14 as arranging the required documents is a lengthy process.President APMA, Gurpargat Singh Kahlon said, “The industry is the backbone of the economy and efforts should be made to revive the industrial activity in the state. Arranging the documents being demanded by the department is a lengthy process. The government should not create hurdles and instead allow the industry to focus on production. We are not demanding that the sales tax department should roll back the notices, but the process should be postponed for at least three months.”Earlier on October 17, members of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal had staged a protest over the issue and demanded that the state government should roll back the notices.They also gave an ultimatum to the state government to roll back the notices by October 25 or face intensified agitation.State general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra said, “Traders are already reeling under losses and the government, rather than helping them, is harassing them by issuing notices. Around 70,000 notices have been issued in the state pertaining to the year 2013-14 and of those over 23,000 have been issued in Ludhiana. We will raise an agitation against the government if the sales tax department fails to roll back the notices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assessment-notices-ludhiana-traders-seek-govt-intervention-warn-of-agitation/story-Hp73Wh28XtNBE9aGzoXZhJ.html
20-10-2020||City||Ludhiana: Modern abattoir yet to be made functional despite completion||With the modern abattoir at the Haibowal dairy complex yet to be made operational despite its completion, illegal slaughtering of animals being carried out near residential areas in the city continues to irk residents.The construction of the ₹19.5-crore project, hanging fire for over a decade, was completed in January. The finance and contracts committee (F and CC) of the municipal corporation (MC) had also approved a resolution to appoint the only contractor, who had offered ₹35 lakh to the MC per annum for a 10-year contract in June. Officials had then claimed that it would be inaugurated in January but it is yet to be made functional.Meanwhile, residents and councillors have been raising a hue and cry over the illegal slaughtering of animals in different parts of the city including Shivpuri, Khud Mohalla, Metro road, Vijay Nagar, Haibowal, Dugri among other areas. Leader of BJP councillors in the MC general house, Sunita Rani said, “Illegal slaughtering of animals and a fish market near Shivpuri puli of Buddha Nullah emit foul smell which is creating a lot of nuisance for residents. The civic body had also removed the vendors recently, but some have again established their vends. Making the slaughterhouse functional is the only solution as the MC would then be able to stop illegal slaughtering completely.”A resident of Shivpuri area, Deepak said that the illegal fish market emanates a foul smell and it is difficult to pass through the area. “The MC should take strict against violators or at least shift the illegal markets away from residential areas till the time, the slaughterhouse is made operational,” he said.Requesting anonymity, an MC official said that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also directed the civic body to make the slaughterhouse operational and stop illegal slaughtering. He said that illegal slaughtering results in unhygienic conditions and the waste, including blood, is also dumped in the sewers.In August, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had also directed the MC to install a rendering plant at the site for disposal of waste, but the officials said that the plant can be set up side by side and temporary arrangements can be done to deal with the waste. MC senior veterinary officer, Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “The process got delayed as the demand for meat nosedived during the lockdown. I have recently assumed the charge and a final decision regarding allotment of contract has to be taken by Mayor Balkar Sandhu, but it is expected that the facility would be made operational soon.”Despite repeated attempts, Mayor Balkar Sandhu was not available for comment. The facility is capable of slaughtering 2,000 poultry birds per hour in two shifts of eight hours each; and 1,000 goats, sheep and pigs. The MC House has fixed ₹150 for slaughtering a goat/sheep, ₹10 for a poultry bird and ₹100 for a pig.The officials said the facility also has an effluent treatment plant, preservation and chilling facility, and a blood processing unit.The MC would also provide five shops to the contractor for selling the slaughtered meat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-modern-abattoir-yet-to-be-made-functional-despite-completion/story-7989q8ttaFDbyrSs88SfyM.html

The court has directed the Special Investigating Team (SIT) to arrest the accused and produce him before the court by October 19, acting on the application submitted by Mataur SHO Rajiv Kumar for issuance of open warrants against the accused. The special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula stated that the accused was nominated in the May 6 FIR and it has been established that the accused is right now in Canada. The counsel placed on record, the travelling details of the accused as per which he boarded a flight to Canada on October 9, demanding that for the purposes of extradition proceedings, open warrants be issued against him. The court observed that as per the arguments addressed and documents placed on record, it is apparent that the accused inspite of an FIR against him chose to leave India without any intimation to the investigating agency or taking permission from the court. “In the present case, the investigating agency will not be able to execute arrest of the accused without getting his extradition. Therefore, non-bailable warrants (open) of the accused be issued,” the court said. KIP Singh is accused of executing the orders of then SSP Sumedh Singh Saini, leading to disappearance and elimination of Balwant Singh Multani, the public prosecutor said. Multani was allegedly picked up by two police officials in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, in which four policemen deputed in his security were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from its custody in Qadian, Gurdaspur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-disappearance-case-arrest-warrants-issued-against-former-chandigarh-inspector/story-14ikhEEQiy03q3CZMq9XzH.html

The police believe he staged a carjacking to claim the insurance amount.The accused’s driver was also involved in the crime and a search is on to nab him.On October 16, the accused, identified as Aman Aggarwal of Bhamiyan, told the police that he was carjacked when he was going to Kadian village at around 8 pm to purchase a machine.Inspector Gopal Krishan said that the police became suspicious when Aman gave different statements during questioning.On Tuesday, the police arrested the accused and also recovered his Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza car from his possession.During the investigation, Aman told the police that he wanted to claim the insurance amount, so he hatched the conspiracy of car-jacking. According to his plan, he would sell the car in some other state after getting the insurance money. The police said that on Friday, Aman had handed over his car’s key to his driver and asked him to go out of town for a few days.He concocted a story of carjacking and told the police that while he was going to Kadian village, five men riding two motorcycles intercepted him and started hurling abuses at him. This prompted him to step out of the car and as he opened the car’s door, the men pulled him out and started assaulting him.

On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, Ghaziabad municipal corporation provided at least 100 dust bags to each of its 100 residential wards. Cleaning staff were deployed in each ward with vehicles and tasked with collecting dust in the bag. According to the official records duly verified at its construction and demolition (C&D) plant, the corporation has so far received 12,536 dust bags each with 6kg dust. The records showed that 2,647 dust bags were collected from Vasundhara zone, 3,123 from the city zone, 2,152 from Mohan Nagar zone, 2,349 from Vijay Nagar zone and another 2,265 from the Kavi Nagar zone. “Overall, we have so far collected about 12536 dust bags with about 75 tonnes of dust lifted from various city roads through collection drives on October 2, 9, 16 and 23. Each of the bag was shifted to the C&D plant where proper entries of bags received from different zones was recorded after verification,” said MS Tanwar, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner. “In February/March next year, we will also start with green paving of roadsides with grass so that dust emission is considerably reduced. The collected dust is now being used for making mud bricks and other items.”According to officials, the corporation maintains about 3200km of road network in Ghaziabad and includes lanes in localities, city roads and major roads. Tanwar said that results from the four-day drive were “encouraging” and that now they will conduct the drive on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of ever week, while the RWAs have also been asked to pitch in on Saturdays. “We will collect dust in our ward from Saturday as reducing polluted surroundings is a collective responsibility,” said SK Maheshwari, councillor of ward 94 of Surya Nagar. The UP-pollution control board (UPPCB) officials said that they have no quantifiable percentage of contribution of dust to city’s air pollution. “But, the component of road dust and also dust from construction sites contributes majorly to PM10 levels which remain on higher side throughout the year,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP pollution control board. A recent study by UP pollution control board also found high levels of dust mass on 18 city roads and also found major proportion of dust particles up to 75 microns which have lesser tendency to settle down. Medical experts said that the dust on roads, which may result due to unpaved roads, construction/demolition sites etc, contain PM10, PM5 and even PM2.5 pollutants. “Out of these PM2.5 is a respirable material which has the highest potential to penetrate into the lungs while breathing. Entering through the airway, it can lead to nasal allergies, have long term effects in the lungs, like COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), fibrosis etc. Apart from the respiratory tract, eyes are the second vulnerable organs, and the dust may cause conjunctivitis, irritation and redness,” said Dr. Sharad Joshi, principal consultant (Pulmonology), Max Hospital at Vaishali. “Dust particles that do not settle on the road are a huge contributor to air pollution.

20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Bills pose new challenge for Khattar govt||Punjab government’s political push against the Centre’s contentious farm laws is sure to embolden the critics of the Haryana government in the run-up to the November-3 Baroda assembly bypoll. The Congress-ruled Punjab government’s move of passing Farm Amendment Bills, which pledge minimum support price (MSP) to farmers and stipulate that those found selling and purchasing paddy below MSP can be jailed for three years, has the potential to put the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government on the back foot. Since the Bills counter the Union government’s farm laws,they will have to cross numerous hurdles before becoming a law. Thus, it is uncertain whether the Bills will see the light of the day. Dismissing the Punjab Bills and dubbing them a ‘political drama’, Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said the Congress government in Punjab was ‘misleading innocent farmers.’ “Congress should stop playing politics over MSP,” said Dalal, who has been canvassing in the Baroda segment, adding, “The Haryana government procures a range of crops, even bajra, on MSP. Even Rajasthan does not procure bajra on MSP. Punjab is resorting to political gimmicks.” ‘Pressure to mount on JJP’ Political watchers in the region say the pressure will intensify on BJP’s coalition partner JJP, which banks on the support of the farming community. Panjab University, Chandigarh, political science professor Ashutosh Kumar agrees that in light of the developments in Punjab, pressure will mount on deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. “Right now, I don’t see any immediate problem for the BJP in Haryana due to farm laws,” said Kumar, pointing out that the farmers’ protests had already lost momentum in Haryana. On the other hand, a veteran political journalist observed that the anti- BJP-JJP discourse will get louder in the state, which could hurt the BJP during the Baroda bypoll, while pushing the JJP into a corner as the farm laws are an emotive issue for farmers. “The Baroda by poll outcome will settle the debate on whether Haryana farmers are against or in favour of these farm laws,” he said. Khattar should follow Punjab’s lead, say farmers It is evident that BJP-JJP troubleshooters have their work cut out for them as farmer unions that were on the forefront of recent agitations in Haryana were quick to demand that Haryana follow Punjab’s footsteps. Bhartiya Kisan Union’s (BKU’s ) Haryana president Gurnam Singh Charuni said non-BJP state governments across the country should follow ‘the path shown by the Punjab government.’ Ratan Mann, state president of BKU (Tikait), said the Haryana government should mount pressure on the Union government to withdraw the controversial laws and upon failing to do so should follow Punjab’s lead. Endorsing Mannn’s views, another farmer leader, Sewa Singh Arya, said, “The Punjab chief minister has taken a bold step. Khattar should follow him.” As per reports, the discourse of the Opposition while canvassing in the Baroda assembly segment also revolves around the farm bills. Even as agitations against the Centre’s farm laws dissipated in Haryana, Punjab’s move has given ammunition to peasants and the Opposition to target the BJP-JJP government. Thus, the Punjab Bills could be bad news for Haryana ahead of the Baroda bypoll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-bills-pose-new-challenge-for-khattar-govt/story-020IFnQUXw0D2UQPpNWxpN.html
20-10-2020||Noida||Study identifies CISF Road as major pollution spot, pollution control board fines contractor ₹50,000||The CISF Road in Indirapuram that serves as lifeline for thousands to connect to NH-9 is turning out to be a major source of air pollution due to work for a pipeline laying project. So much so that the UP pollution watchdog has recommended a fine of ₹50,000 on the project contractor.In a recent study by the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB), the road emerged to be the stretch with the most concentration of dust in the city. It also had the highest concentration of dust that are up to 75 microns in size -- these remain suspended in air for a longer time than larger particles.The pipeline project being executed by the UP Jal Nigam will channel of water treated by three sewage treatment plants (STPs) to the river Hindon. The work was initiated in February and was scheduled to get completed in July, but was delayed due to lockdown. “As part of the project, 2.5 km on one side of the CISF-Road from Kanawani to NH-9 was dug up and it has turned out to be major source of dust pollution for residents who are living in about 20-25 highrises located in vicinity of the road. It has also become a traffic choke point,” said Kapil Tyagi, secretary of Divyansh Pratham highrise, adjacent to the CISF-Road near Ahimsa Khand-2 in Indirapuram. He claimed that authorities failed to respond to their requests to deal with the situation.“The vehicles which move on one side of the road cross to the other dug up side and bring in lot of dust to our internal roads. The internal roads of Ahimsa Khand II are also broken due to high movement of vehicles including the commercial vehicles. So, there is a lot of pollution in our area,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners and resident of Ahimsa Khand II. The UPPCB decided to act against the contractor of the project.“On account of the dusty conditions prevailing at the CISF-Road, we recommended a penalty of ₹50,000 on Monday against the contractor,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. “The contractor has been given 24 hours to comply with dust control norms, else we will be forced to levy an even heftier fine of ₹5 lakh.” The pipeline project is under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. “We have already directed for water sprinkling at the site and if there is any laxity on part of our contractor we will issue appropriate directions and also check up the penalty issue with pollution board. About 80% of the work is complete and we are likely to finish it by November next month. We have to complete work at at least five points where the drainage, sewer and Ganga water pipelines are crossing the CISF-Road,” said GS Srivastava, chief engineer of UP Jal Nigam. He added that once the work is complete, the dug up road will be relaid by the Jal Nigam and will be handed over to GDA. “The other side of the CISF-Road is also broken as it is presently catering to both sides of traffic. But we will issue its tenders for repair once the Jal Nigam completes their work. Otherwise, the road will again get damaged. We have also issued tenders for reapir of other internal roads in Indirapuram and the works will start soon,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of the Ghaziabad development authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/study-identifies-cisf-road-as-major-pollution-spot-pollution-control-board-fines-contractor-50-000/story-zJ5p4Sg1VqdSLST3J5DwpO.html

With his arrest, the total number of people arrested in the case is now 17. Lalit Bhati is unrelated to alleged mastermind of the scheme 40-year-old Sanjay BhatiRaj Kumar Mishra, additional SP Noida STF, said, “A join team of Noida STF and EOW received information about movement of suspect near a private university in Dadri. The police team conducted a search and arrested the suspect from the spot.” During interrogation, the suspect revealed that he had joined Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited (GIPL), which ran the Bike Bot scheme, as director in 2017. “He was actively involved in networking and duping scores of customers,” Mishra said. Lalit Bhati has been absconding since cases were filed against the company and the racket was busted in June 2019.One of the first complaints about the fraud was filed by Kitab Kaur, a resident of Hisar in Haryana in March 2019. She said that a neighbour had introduced Bike Bot mastermind Sanjay Bhati to her. “I had paid ₹ 34 lakh in multiple transactions to Bhati and did not get returns. On repeated request, they had sent a bank cheque of ₹ 50 lakh which bounced,” Kaur said in the complaint. She suspected foul play and filed a complaint in Dadri police station. Alleged mastermind Sanjay Bhati, his two brothers 35-year-old Sachin Bhati and 33-year-old Pawan Bhati were arrested in the case. Sanjay Bhati had allegedly set up the company in 2010, and floated Bike Bot scheme in 2017. The suspects would seek ₹ 62,000 investment per bike from people. The investors were promised ₹9,765 monthly return from their investment. This accumulated to ₹1.17 lakh per annum income. The offer was so lucrative that soon over 2.25 lakh people made payments for multiple bikes and were cheated to the tune of ₹ 3,500 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/one-more-arrested-in-bike-bot-scheme/story-nvftElWwoY6qp3p30rp0aO.html

According to the data, between January 1 and September 30, as many as 377 people have been arrested in the district under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.“There have been 361 registered cases against offenders who were involved in either smuggling or peddling narcotics. Most of the products are brought from the eastern belt of the country that includes states like Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand,” said Luv Kumar, joint commissioner of police (law and order).Police officials said that the demand is more in the rural parts of the district as compared to the city areas.“We are working on identifying narcotics hot spots. So far, we have found that drugs are easily available in and around educational institutions, slum areas, industrial belts and various bus and auto stands,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1.Singh said that the movement of narcotics suppliers has gone up following the easing of lockdown norms and every day peddlers are being nabbed. The officials are seizing nearly 6.5 kg drugs every day while as many as three peddlers are being arrested every second day. Till October 15 this year, about 1,750 kg narcotics have been seized by the department, they said.However, the police believe that the amount of drugs in circulation will be much higher than the estimated figures.“Noida acts as a transit point for drugs like marijuana and cannabis to be smuggled to Delhi. We have as much peddling as smuggling happening in our district. The police department is also working on creating guidelines for parents and educational institutions to break the chain to some extent. A few months ago, a family filed a case against classmates of their son alleging that they had got him hooked up to serious drugs under the Sector 20 police jurisdiction. We need to tackle the situation before it worsens,” said the additional DCP.The police officials said that there are 40-50 small and big gangs operating in the district. Some of them are repeat offenders who are then booked under the Gangster Act, they said, adding that the department is working on eradicating as many of these gangs as possible.Marijuana is the most widely circulated narcotic in the district and about 1,490 kg of marijuana has been seized so far. However, the officials said that hard drugs like heroin and cocaine and are not prominent in the district.On September 11, the Noida police nabbed five people for supplying narcotics through online orders to exclusive clients and drugs worth Rs 27 lakh were seized from them. On June 27, one of the largest drug hauls of 300 kg worth Rs 36 lakh was seized in Jewar which was being smuggled from Vishakhapatnam to be taken to Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-40-narcotics-gangs-active-in-noida-shows-data/story-sIdd87DfjLozHQQmGyaG2L.html

20-10-2020||Noida||Homebuyers set to take over Sampada Livia project as tribunal rules against promoter||The Uttar Pradesh real estate appellate tribunal on Tuesday rejected PSA Impex Private Limited’s appeal against the UP real estate regulatory authority’s (UP-Rera’s) order of September 30, 2019 deregistering its Greater Noida housing project -- Sampada Livia -- and handing it over to the homebuyers’ association to finish construction and deliver the project. Homebuyers said they are happy with the verdict and said they will begin the process of hiring a contractor for the project. PSA Impex had launched the project in 2011 with assurances that the flats would be delivered in 2014-15. The project was launched on 5 acres land and had planned for 10 towers with 24 floors each and a total of 726 units in Greater Noida’s sector Chi V. When the developer failed to deliver, completing only 10% of the project till date, homebuyers under the Sampada Livia buyers’ (SLB) welfare association banner filed a plea in the UP-Rera in June, 2018. The same year, the developer’s chief executive officer (CEO) Diwakar Sharma, who was booked in several cases for cheating and fraud, among other, was jailed.On September 30, 2019 the RERA put the developer into defaulters’ category and cancelled the registration of the project. On June 6, 2020 it allowed SLB welfare association to take over the project so that they could finish it. However, this could not take off as, on June 26, 2020, PSA Impex filed an appeal against the Rera order in the tribunal.“... we don’t find any substance in the submissions of learned counsel for the appellant (promoter) on issue no. 5, hence rejected and issue is decided against the appellant,” read the order issued by the tribunal’s three-member bench headed by tribunal chairperson justice D K Arora. “In view of the aforesaid analysis, we are of the considered view that the impugned order dated 30.09.2019 passed by the regulatory authority under section 7 of the act of 2016 is well reasoned and speaking order. We further found that regulatory authority followed due procedure of law while passing the same and there is no illegality, infirmity or perversity in the impugned order. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.”Homebuyers hope that they will finally get the justice after a long fight.“It was our hard earn money; a few buyers had taken out money from their provident funds for their home. SLB welfare association will fight for justice till the end. We are ready to start the construction on site as soon as possible,” said Dr Akanksha Aggarwal president of Sampada Livia buyers’ welfare association.As per the Greater Noida authority audit, the developer had sold 355 of the 726 units. It estimated that the unsold flats would go for ₹233.50 and unsold commercial space could rake in ₹6.4 crore. Representatives of the promoter could not be reached for comment despite several attempts. “We allowed homebuyers to take over the project because they can arrange funds and deliver the project. The reason is all buyers trust them and will pay remaining flat cost,” said Balvinder Kumar, member of UP-Rera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/homebuyers-set-to-take-over-sampada-livia-project-as-tribunal-rules-against-promoter/story-nbDqlqFMbcFgiHgOaIIM0J.html

20-10-2020||Noida||30-year-old man held for rape, murder of 2-year-old girl in Ghaziabad||A two-and-half-year old girl was allegedly raped and murdered in Ghaziabad’s Kavi Nagar area late on Monday night, with police booking and nabbing a 30-year-old man as the prime suspect in the case based on a complaint by the minor victim’s family.Investigators identified the suspect as Chandan Pandey, who worked in factory with the minor’s father. Police claimed that the minor’s father, Pandey and one other person were consuming alcohol before the incident, after which the suspect went to the house of the victim. “The man came to our house and went upstairs. He then came down with my niece sitting on his shoulders around 8.51pm (this was captured in a CCTV). He then took the girl out saying that he wanted t buy her some treats from a local shop. later, when they failed to return for a few hours, the family launched a search. After searching for them for a while, we informed the police. During the search late at night, my mother finally spotted the man lying on a bed in a shop,” said cousin of the minor. The family immediately nabbed the suspect and handed him over to the police. “We kept asking him about the whereabouts of the girl, but he steadfastly refused to reply. He was then taken away by the police. Around 11.30am on Tuesday, the police baited him by telling him that he would be let off if he told them the whereabouts of the girl. At this, he told the police that he had left the girl in a nearby industrial area in a forested area,” she, added. Family said that there were a bunch of huge iron sheets, used as raw materials in factories, that were stacked on the roadside in the industrial area, where the suspect allegedly violated the minor. The crime spot is around a kilometre away from the minor’s house.“The suspect took the girl to the spot and allegedly raped and murdered her there. The spot is isolated and shielded from the gaze of passersby, thanks to the iron sheets that are stacked in the area. The body of the minor was sent for post mortem,” said the uncle of the victim.Investigators said that they found three packets of namkeen and some currency coins, with which Pandey allegedly lured the minor. The suspect is a colleague of my brother-in-law (girl’s father) and they have both worked together at the same factory for past 10-12 years. Pandey used to often visit our house and was known to the girl,” he added. The police said that based on the complaint given by the family, they registered an FIR under IPC section 376ab (for rape of woman under twelve years of age) and 302 (murder), besides levying provisions under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Kavi Nagar police station. Investigators suspect that the rape, murder might be linked to an altercation that the man had with the minor’s father around two years ago.“We have registered an FIR based on complaint given by the family and are awaiting the post mortem reports of the victim. We have arrested the suspect and deployed teams for collection of forensic evidences,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/30-year-old-man-held-for-rape-murder-of-2-year-old-girl-in-ghaziabad/story-73MEQ1B3RBeNGLUqeKayVO.html

20-10-2020||Lucknow||‘Largest and toughest to clinch’: Aam Aadmi Party now sets eyes on Uttar Pradesh||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is all set to take a plunge in Uttar Pradesh’s, which is already an overcrowded political arena, after testing turbulent waters in the northern state of Punjab after winning Delhi. The assembly elections in the state are scheduled in early 2022 but AAP has already launched public campaigns on various burning issues in different parts of the state and had also made its presence felt in Hathras. However, they have a year’s time to form and galvanize teams in a state with 403 assembly constituencies.Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, “We have ambitious plans for Uttar Pradesh but the national leadership will make the announcement at the right time.” Singh has been spearheading the party’s connect with the masses and had earned the wrath of the chief minister Yogi Adityanath by getting a survey done to prove caste bias in the governance of the state. About a dozen of FIR’s have been lodged against him.Singh says they had won Delhi within a year’s time after the formation of the party in 2012 and that people, by now, are familiar with its flag, symbol, issues and leadership, the fact remains that UP is not only the largest state but also the toughest to win. Also read: Slippers hurled at Tejashwi Yadav during poll rally in BiharThe AAP started its public outreach programme via panchayats. Coming handy are about 10,000 oximeters provided to the party cadre to test oxygen levels of people during the pandemic. The oximeters are creating curiosity as well as a local connect with the people. As of now, the party has reached 3,500 gram panchayats in 345 assembly constituencies, each having a 25-member committee, according to Vaibhav Maheshwari, state spokesperson of the party. Challenges ahead The BJP had swept the 2017 assembly polls independently winning 312 of the 403 seats, decimating Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party that had dominated the state’s political scene from 1993 to 2017. Second, 302 political parties - including six national, two at the state level, five from other states and 289 registered but unrecognized - had contested the 2017 elections. Only eight parties had managed to open their account amid the BJP wave. The AAP will be thus another recognised party testing its fate in the complex state.While SP leader Akhilesh Yadav has always welcomed parties contesting polls saying “more the merrier,” the BSP and the Congress have maintained a silence with their leaders, perhaps, waiting for the announcement. Akhilesh also shares camaraderie with Kejriwal. The ruling BJP, upset with a telephonic survey done by the AAP on the caste leanings of the chief minister, was quick to retaliate. Secretary Chandra Mohan said, “They neither were able to control tomato prices nor Covid. Yet they have the cheek to indulge in theatrics in UP. They are free to dream but more than their UP entry, they should worry about Delhi which they are set to lose. Yes, but they should come to UP to learn governance from chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji.” Political expert Badri Narayan said, “the AAP is a party in the making and may attract aspirational activists from the opposition parties.” Also read: Chirag Paswan’s LJP to fight on 137 seats, releases 3rd list of candidatesTracing the electoral trajectory of new parties in the state, Narayan said, “It’s a long-drawn battle and requires consistent efforts as the first election is often contested to lose, second to damage others by cutting into their votes and third and fourth to defeat and finally win.”UP’s assembly’s 403 seats are more than five times of Delhi’s (70), which are more urban in character. The state has a huge rural base and each region has distinct issues and complexities. AAP’s movesThe AAP has been making sporadic noises in the past - this is the first time that it will contest the panchayat elections in this vast state. The party has about a year to prepare for the country’s most complex election in the largest state. Sanjay Singh confidently says, “One year is enough. Now we have a governance model to showcase.” Although east UP may be oblivious to the work done by Kejriwal in Delhi - from mohalla clinics to schools - western UP districts, adjoining the country’s capital, are aware of his performance. He will be a face to reckon with but can he win elections? Indeed, elections in UP have been driven either by a personality or caste and religion. The AAP has Kejriwal but its biggest challenge will be to find the right face in the state and correct the caste calculus. Though the opposition is in disarray, AAP has to create its own political space and cultivate vote base. This will be a gigantic task. Amongst the opposition parties that got decimated in 2017, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav still holds a decent amount of goodwill. Much would depend on how it gets converted into votes and how he holds his prime base vote of Yadavs and Muslims in the heat of the BJP’s aggressive Hindutva agenda. He has activated the party organisation, which for the past few months, has been holding demonstrations on unemployment, law and order, poor development work, et cetera. However, he has yet to find a counter to BJP’s growing appeal of Hindutva among the masses. Similarly, Mayawati has a core vote bank of Jatavs but her party has been invisible on the ground although her cadre, though disillusioned, can be activated anytime. After the AAP highlighted caste leanings of the chief minister, Mayawati deployed its veteran leader Satish Mishra once again to win back the disgruntled Brahmins.Mishra has already held about 67 meetings with Brahmins, somewhat on the lines of his about 27,000-kilometre journey in 2007 organising the Dalit-Brahmin ‘bhoj’. It had paid dividends with Mayawati breaking the coalition jinx to become the chief minister without any crutches. As for the Brahmins, they do crib about the neglect by the administration but find solace in the fact that the Ram temple in Ayodhya will be a reality. The BJP still remains their first choice. Coming to the Congress, which of late has been in the forefront of all public movements, it has more leaders than workers. The organisation had weakened in the state decades before the party slumped at the central level. Other national/state parties like RLD, CPI, CPM, NCP and other smaller ones have caste-based or regions of influence. Their outreach is not statewide. On the other hand, the BJP has a robust organisation, energetic cadre and popular face of the Prime Minister besides the RSS network. Mahant Yogi Adityanath has emerged as a hardcore politician after becoming chief minister. He is skilled in the art of elections and is hardworking, now called the 24x7 chief minister. He not only wears saffron but believes in hardcore Hindutva. A known turfOn a smaller scale, the AAP has contested elections in some other states, including Uttar Pradesh. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the popular face of the party, Arvind Kejriwal, had thrown down the gauntlet in Varanasi contesting against Narendra Modi, the then prime ministerial candidate of the BJP. Kejriwal saved his deposit, other opposition candidates had lost theirs. The party was then riding high as it had defeated Congress heavyweight chief minister Shiela Dixit in the Delhi polls. The scenario, however, is different today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/largest-and-toughest-to-clinch-aam-aadmi-party-now-sets-eyes-on-uttar-pradesh/story-PhX8YnN7Xa4FGtN5jqwDwM.html
20-10-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER initiates study on persistence of Covid antibodies||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has initiated a study on how long Covid-19 antibodies persist in recovered patients.The study is an extension of the plasma-therapy trial conducted at 39 hospitals across the country. “The study is important so we can find out for long a person is immune to the infection. So, as part of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) trials, we have also collected samples from 60% of the patients who were either donors or recipients of the plasma trials. The aim is to check whether antibodies fall or persist in patients who once surely developed them,” said Pankaj Malhotra from the internal medicine department, PGIMER, and principal investigator of the study said.The samples collected will be sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, to study the effect of antibodies on the live virus.“It will also have an impact on how the vaccine will provide safety. If antibodies persist for a long time, we can safely assume that it will have a long term impact. Also, since a huge population has recovered, it will be better for us to understand for how long they are immune,” Malhotra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-initiates-study-on-persistence-of-covid-antibodies/story-koVQCkSV8QRAubFsp1llLI.html
20-10-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata Durga Puja organisers move HC with review petition, cite ‘practical problems’||Citing practical problems in implementing the Calcutta High Court’s order to put up barricades outside Durga Puja pandals, a section of the most prominent puja organisers in Kolkata filed a review petition in the court on Tuesday. The petition is likely to be heard on Wednesday. On Monday, the Calcutta HC, while hearing a PIL, had banned the entry of visitors inside the pandals declaring them as ‘no entry zones’ to check any gathering which could lead to a surge in Covid-19, as doctors have warned. While pandal-hopping has already started, Durga Puja starts from Thursday. “We have filed a review petition in the court citing some practical problems which may arise if the orders are implemented. The matter is likely to be heard on Wednesday,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab. The forum represents more than 350 pujas in the city, including prominent ones some of which are patronised by ministers and senior leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress.Also read: ‘If a girl goes out in the evening…’ - Jharkhand leader’s shocker on rape“The applicants state that the court may appreciate that the directions, as given in the order dated October 19, may not be workable in view of the variable in-situ issues which the individual organisers are required to address holding the Durga Puja in the locality,” the petition states, adding that Kolkata’s Durga Puja has been nominated for UNESCO’s 2020 list.The HC on Monday had directed that while the city’s big pujas need to put barricade at least 10 metres away from the outer end of the pandal, the smaller ones can barricade at a distance of five metres.“There are some practical problems as nearly 80 percent of the pujas in Kolkata are held in lanes which are not more than 18–24 feet wide. If they put up barricades, there would be no space left for the visitors to pass through and people will virtually have to go back participating in the puja,” said Basu. Puja committees claimed to have made elaborate arrangements for managing the crowd based on the guidelines issued by the Mamata Banerjee administration in September. This year, more than 37,000 community pujas would be organised across the state, including more than 2,500 such pujas in Kolkata. Around 1,700 pujas are organised by women in the state. The list, however, doesn’t include pujas which are held inside housing societies and houses. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had even announced a donation of Rs 50,000 to each of the puja committees. “At all puja pandals, entry and exit gates have been kept separate. Barricades have already been set up accordingly. Now, if we put up new barricades, in some pandals, visitors would have to make a U-turn and go back the same way. It would lead to chaos and crowd would accumulate. Earlier, we had plans to allow a restricted number of visitors in specific time slots,” said Partha Ghosh, an executive committee member of the forum. Instead, the organisers, in their 18-page review petition, have said that security arrangements would be made so that not more than 50 persons remain inside the pandal at a time. There would be a continuous flow of visitors and no crowding. Pandals would be sanitised twice daily among other precautions.“The court has allowed only 25 puja committee members inside the pandals. This means no resident would be able to perform ‘Anjali’ and attend other rituals such as ‘sandhi puja’ except for the 25 members. This would create a rift within the locality amid the festive season,” said Ghosh. Citing examples of Kerala where Covid-19 cases had shot up after Onam festivities, doctors had earlier warned the Mamata Banerjee administration that Covid-19 infection in Bengal could increase up to four-fold if restrictions were relaxed during the festive season. “The only reason behind filing the PIL was to ensure that safety protocols to stop Coronavirus are maintained. The court had observed that the state government has pious intentions to stop the virus but it would be hard to manage the puja crowd. Monday’s order is basically the modalities, which the court has laid down, to manage the crowd,” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee, the lawyer who had filed the original PIL on behalf of Ajay Kumar De.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-durga-puja-organisers-move-hc-with-review-petition-cite-practical-problems/story-dCQKI731OoSCXHHwuu8U6K.html

These centres did not have female attendants to take care of the women patients. The authorities did not even bother to check the antecedents of the male attendants who were employed to take care of the women patients. This is gross negligence,” said Sharma. “I have asked them to install CCTV cameras and ensure female staff for women,” she added.Sharma met with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari at Raj Bhavan and also met chief secretary Sanjay Kumar and Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh. She asked Kumar and Singh to take punitive action against the guilty.Sharma, however, did not personally visit any Covid-19 centre as she said she had just recovered from the virus.Also read: Ex-cop sues Arnab Goswami for defaming Mumbai police, asks court to gag himIn addition, Sharma also pointed to the rising number of cases where women were forcibly converted in Maharashtra. She cited the case of a woman in Aurangabad who she said was kidnapped and forcibly converted. However, she was unable to provide figures for the increase in such incidences to substantiate her claim. “I have asked the authorities to collect figures,” said Sharma.Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik, who had to face the ire of Sharma last month, described it as selective targeting. “We condemn the sexual harassments at the Covid-19 centres but at the same time, we feel that the NCW targets the non-BJP parties. They turn a blind eye to the atrocities on women in BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh. The Hathras rape is the biggest example of this,” said Sarnaik.Last month, Sharma had condemned the threat by Sarnaik to actor Kangana Ranaut and asked the Maharashtra DGP to arrest him.However, Sharma denied any bias saying even BJP leaders who made sexual comments had to face the ire of the NCW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/women-s-commission-raps-maharashtra-govt-over-cases-of-sexual-harassment-at-covid-19-centres/story-ZShCcqSkck4ZaQtUkOHOTO.html

The Central ministry earlier said that healthcare workers to be prioritised for vaccination will include front-line workers, nurses, paramedical staff and also clerical staff. The guidelines suggested by the Central ministry states that all healthcare workers, including those from private facilities, will be prioritised. The letter from the ministry to the state health secretaries states: “The database from the facilities should be uploaded on Covid-19 Vaccination Beneficiary Management System (CVBMS). The database must be uploaded on the system before the end of the month.” The letter includes various healthcare providers and those working in both private and public healthcare facilities, including frontline health workers - auxiliary nurses, midwives, multi-purpose health workers (male and female), Asha supervisors/ facilitators, nurses and supervisors, staff nurses, public health nurse, LHV, CHO, health supervisors, block extension educators, medical officers, Ayush doctors, dentist, paramedical staff, all technicians, pharmacists, physiotherapists, radiographers, other paramedical staff, scientist and research staff, medical, dentist, Ayush students, nursing and paramedical students working in the facility.

The chief minister said the move would “adversely” affect the basic spirit of the state’s cooperative banks.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gehlot asked the PM to reconsider the amendments and restore the previous system wherein the state cooperative departments have regulatory control over cooperative banks.“The amendments made in some provisions of the Banking Regulation (BR) Act would adversely affect the basic spirit of the state’s Cooperative Banks and Cooperatives,” Gehlot said in an order.Rajasthan has 29 central cooperative banks which provide banking services across the state and are major contributors for disbursing farm loan. Gehlot said sections 10 and 10A have been inserted in the recently passed banking amendment law which regulate the cooperative banks. “Through these amendments, 51 percent members of the governing board of cooperative banks should have professional experience, which is practically not possible,” Gehlot stated.He added that in view of the majority of the members in cooperative banks coming from a rural background, the Centre should restore the earlier system and the condition of professional experience should be eliminated.He said the amendments overrule the provisions of the Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act, 2001, which authorises registrar, co-operative societies to dissolve the Board of Directors if there is an error in the duties and norms set by the committee’s officials.Now, the registrar, co-operative societies can dissolve the board only on the recommendation of the RBI in the case of financial irregularities, he said, adding that it would make the office of registrar cooperative societies redundant. “After the amendment, all these rights have been given to the RBI. Due to the changed system, cooperative banks will not be able to effectively control the cooperative department of the state government,” the CM said.Gehlot said many amendments contradict the basic principles of cooperatives and urged the PM to review the amendments.BJP spokesperson and MLA Ram Lal Sharma said it is a habit of the Congress to oppose any bill introduced by the BJP. They should let it implement and see its result and decided whether it’s in people’s interest or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/will-adversely-affect-rajasthan-opposes-rbi-getting-control-of-cooperative-banks/story-X5BIGnx3USmJO2QOwgbFjN.html

However, due to complications, she delivered a preterm baby within eight months of pregnancy and the baby faced breathing issues. To add to her woes she received a piece of shattering news that she had tested positive for Sars-Cov-2-virus which causes the Covid-19 infection and would have to be shifted to a government facility.Robinson is one of the 498 new mothers who tested positive for the virus and sought treatment at various stages of pregnancy and even for post-delivery care at the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) Sonawane hospital, Bhavani peth.The hospital is declared as a dedicated Covid-19 maternity hospital since May this year.Julie says that her experience at the hospital completely changed her opinion about government hospitals.“I was sent in our private car from the private hospital on the next day after the C-section operation when I tested positive for the virus. They did not arrange for an ambulance even after such a major operation. We had to go in our car and I didn’t even get to see my child,” she said.“I was admitted at Sonawane hospital for ten days as I was asymptomatic. They took great care of me and other mothers who were admitted at the hospital. We not only received treatment but also emotional support,” she said.The 80 bedded hospital was turned into a 50-bed hospital to make sure all safety norms were strictly followed. Out of the 50 beds, 30 are reserved for pregnant women while 20 for the babies.Dr Madhuri Rokade, resident medical officer, Sonawane hospital, said, “We had mothers who faced pregnancy complications and also tested positive for Covid-19. For such mothers, we have to provide emotional support.

Out of the 123 women who delivered babies at the Sonawane hospital in Bhavani peth, only four babies tested positive for Covid-19 and were successfully discharged without any complications. Out of the 123 deliveries that took place in the hospital 93 were through C-section and 30 were normal deliveries. The hospital also attended to 66 babies born to Covid-19 positive mothers from other hospitals for observation and treatment.Dr Madhuri Rokade, resident medical officer, Sonawane hospital, said, “The hospital was declared a dedicated Covid-19 maternity hospital only in May, but even in March and April we had conducted a few deliveries of Covid-19 pregnant women.”“When the first Covid-19 positive person was detected we sent the patient to Sassoon but she had stayed in the hospital for two days and during those days the staff and the nearby patients also got exposed. Following that incident, the entire hospital had to be shut down and our staff of 53 people had to undergo tests for the virus. The hospital was also shut for 21 days. Since it was a new disease the staff also panicked and the other patients were also sceptical of the situation,” she said.Dr Rokade also added that only four babies out of the 123 deliveries tested positive for the infection. “None of the babies reported any complications related to growth or weight,” she added.“While earlier few international studies did indicate the transfer of infection from mother to baby in the womb or even complications like abortions and preterm deliveries.

20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Former Julana MLA Parminder Singh Dhull quits BJP over farm laws||Former two-time Julana MLA Parminder Singh Dhull quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the recently enacted farm legislations on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference at Jind, Dhull said he had resigned from the primary membership of the saffron party:“ I am quitting the BJP as farmers are my top priority. I am a farmer first then a politician. I had joined the BJP, ahead of assembly elections in 2019, hoping that the party would implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and ensure monthly pension to farmers and labourers. However, far from implementing the recommendations, the Union government has passed three laws that are equivalent to death warrants for farmers,” he said.Dhull said he had written an open letter to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar saying that he had failed to stand by farmers and was acting like a ‘clerk’ on the directions of the Centre.“ The CM has no concern for the farmers. I will campaign against the BJP in the Baroda constituency for enacting the laws.

The customs officers, however, acted arbitrarily on September 14, and refused to process Let Export Orders (LEOs) even before the notification was issued, stated the petition.The counsel for the petitioner association, senior advocate Darius Shroff, had pointed out that the notification was released in the evening of September 14, but the customs officers refused to process LEOs from the morning of September 14, even when the consignments were brought to the parking plaza outside the customs area.The high court found merit in the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner body. It observed that the generation of shipping bill is not an empty formality. “It has a definite meaning assigned to it under the 2019 Regulations. It sets in motion the process of export of goods. The 2019 Regulations only reinforce the sanctity attached to a shipping bills,” said the bench.The judges also took note of a clarification issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Customs, declaring that wherever procedural or policy provisions are modified to the disadvantage of exporters, they shall not be applicable to consignments already handed over to the customs for export till the time the change is notified and published.The high court has admitted the petition for considering the challenge to the ban on export of onions and posted the petition for final hearing in the first week of December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-held-up-onion-shipment-to-be-exported-bombay-high-court-to-customs/story-YEeYMUPHPTMLUJI0MybB2J.html
20-10-2020||Patna||‘Bundle of lies’: Congress dismisses Bihar’s special package announced by PM in 2015||All India Congress Committee general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Tuesday dubbed Rs 1.25 lakh crore special package to Bihar, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during 2015 assembly elections, as a ‘bundle of lies’ to take the people for a ride. Talking to media, he said that schemes only worth Rs 1,559 crore of the package could be executed in the last five years and wondered why was the BJP trying to trumpet it as a success story. A media clip, juxtaposing PM Modi’s announcement of the package and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s counter wherein he had then dismissed it as ‘making mountain out of a molehill’, was also displayed during the media conference. Surjewala further alleged that work on 27 out of 44 national highway (NH) projects, which were part of a project worth Rs 54,713 crore under the special package, remained unfinished, while 17 projects were still waiting for the detailed projects report (DPR). The Congress leader also released the list of road projects, worth Rs 27,000 crore, which are still waiting to get a go-ahead. He said that the Union ministry of road transport and highway (MoRTH) had made a submission to this effect in Parliament in February this year. Also read: India’s daily Covid-19 cases less than 50,000 for first time in 3 monthsSurjewala said that work on Rs 2,000 crore Manihari-Sahebganj road bridge over Ganga was yet to begin. “Foundation of the central university in Bhagalpur, costing Rs 1,500, crore, could not be laid as the state government could not allot Rs 500 acre for it. The skill development university, which was to be built in Bihar under the special package, is now being shifted to Varanasi,” said the AICC general secretary. The Congress leader said that Rs 10,000 power project at Buxar, with a capacity to produce 1300 MW, remained a distant dream, even as the memorandum of understating to execute the project was signed during the UPA government in 2013. He claimed that the Centre had put this scheme in the special package. Claiming that the people of Bihar would be giving a befitting reply to the BJP-JDU’s bid to cheat them, Surejewala said that the proposals to build civil airports at Patna, Raxaul and Purnia at the cost of Rs 2,700 crore were still waiting for completion. “Similarly, the ambitious scheme to revive Barauni refinery plant (at the cost of Rs 21,476 crore) and a 22,500 kilometre-long network of rural roads (costing Rs 13,820 crore) could not get completed,” he added. The Congress leader also took a swipe at Union home minister Amit Shah’s claim that Bihar progressed significantly due to the Central package and said that what better could people expect from the BJP-led dispensation which refused to allot even a penny to Bihar out of Rs 100 crore allocated under Ramayan circuit. Referring to the law and order condition in Bihar, Surjewala alleged that the state witnessed the most heinous crimes, such as gang-rapes of minors, since the Independence. “Instead of penalising the perpetrators, the JD(U)-BJP combine has offered a ticket to those involved in the case,” said the Congress leader, alleging that leaders of the ruling dispensation, who thrived on scams, had started burning files in the secretariat after smelling the change. Dismissing the charge that the Congress had become a pillion rider to the RJD, the AICC leader said that he trusts Tejashwi Prasad Yadav because of his youthfulness and energy to work. “The Congress has the experience and the vision for governance to lead the state for a better future,” he added. AICC spokesperson Pawan Khera, AICC media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra also spoke on te occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bundle-of-lies-congress-dismisses-bihar-s-special-package-announced-by-pm-in-2015/story-1Y5IEo0orYAZwLdjnhEWWO.html
20-10-2020||Dehradun||Wildlife board declines Uttarakhand forest dept’s request to modify tiger reserve road||National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), in its 59th standing committee meeting on October 5, declined the Uttarakhand forest department’s request to modify conditions imposed by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for the road passing through the buffer area of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, an ecologically sensitive area in terms of movement of wildlife. The minutes of the meeting, which were released on Monday, were accessed by HT.After NBWL gave its nod for the construction of Laldhang-Chillarkhal road through the buffer zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve based on recommendations by NTCA, Uttarakhand forest department wrote to the board in July, requesting modifications like reducing the length of underpass for wild animals and reducing the height of underpass from 8m to 5m. Also Read: Assam’s Kaziranga national park to open for tourists from October 21: Know the guidelinesDuring the meeting, the board sought NTCA’s view on the requests, which declined them as the “area has high density of wildlife.” The minutes of the meeting state, “The Chief Wildlife Warden, Uttarakhand, has now requested to modify three conditions imposed by the NTCA as follows: Forest Clearance not required since road exists prior to 1980 as per the guidelines of Forest Conservation Act. Reduce the length of underpass for wild animals to 470 m at the rate of 100 m per km instead of 705 m as recommended by NTCA. Reduce the height of underpass for wild animals from 8m to 5m due to geological conditions.” The NTCA responses stated it would “obtain views of Forest Conservation Division with respect to applicability of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, but did not agree to the request made by the chief wildlife warden for the other two conditions as the area has high density of wildlife.” Speaking on the issue, JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand said that the work on the road will be done according to the recommendations of NTCA. “We will be building the road as per the norms, following all recommendations of NTCA, but no other state has a cap on the height of underpasses; such a recommendation has been made only for Uttarakhand,” said Suhag. In January, after going through the recommendations of NTCA regarding the building of underpasses for animals and forest land transfer, NBWL had approved the proposed road. The board had then approved the project based on conditions like, “Permission for starting the work on the project shall be granted by the state government only when road design is modified as per animal passage plan prepared by project proponent in consultation with state chief wildlife warden on the basis of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) guidelines named Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts on Linear Infrastructures on Wildlife.” The NTCA had recommended that as per the guidelines set by WII, “construction of an elevated road (underpass for animals) with substantial clearance for elephants (8m above ground to provide safe passage) needs to be undertaken for the central stretch of 4.7km from Chamaraia bend to Siggadi-sot.” The recommendations further mentioned that “While planning the elevated road it should be ensured that at least 100m of passage ways per 1km is provided. However, being an elephant dense area, it is suggested to provide one and half time more permeability which entails a permeable space of 705 m.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/wildlife-board-declines-uttarakhand-forest-dept-s-request-to-modify-tiger-reserve-road/story-GFlR6DVF7BWFKzclXUveOP.html
20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Faridkot royal dispute: Supreme Court allows caretaker trust to operate bank accounts to pay salaries||The Supreme Court has allowed the Maharawal Khewaji Trust that manages the ₹20,000-crore worth property of the last ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Faridkot, Harinder Singh Brar, to operate its bank accounts for making payments till the final judgment. All bank accounts of the trust were frozen after the Punjab and Haryana high court declared Brar’s will of June 1, 1982, in favour of the trust as forged. On June 1, the high court had upheld a Chandigarh court’s order, awarding a majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property to Brar’s daughters Amrit Kaur, who challenged the will in 1992, and Deepinder Kaur. The trust has filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the high court order. The apex court ordered status quo till the judgment, allowing the trust to continue as caretaker. During the hearing on the SLP, the trust filed an interlocutory application praying that during the pendency of petition, it be permitted to operate bank accounts for paying salaries, taxes, utilities and maintenance of the royal properties and towards expenses of the charitable hospital. The application has given details about the expenses that are due for four months from June 1 to September 30, which amount to Rs 2.8 crore, including Rs 80 lakh for monthly salaries of 244 employees in Faridkot, Mashobra, Manimajra, New Delhi and Dhana. The trust has also given details of 12 bank accounts through which the expenses and expenditures are to be met. The trust argued that the banks have frozen its accounts as a result of which the activities undertaken by it are getting affected. However, the defence opposed the application, claiming in the name of expenditure towards fulfilling the objectives of the trust, the amounts are being misused. COURT ORDERS PERIODIC UPDATE ON EXPENSES The double bench of justice Umesh Lalit and justice Ravindra Bhat said since the activities undertaken by the trust are in the nature of running a hospital and philanthropic causes, at this stage, it is permitted to operate the accounts strictly for purposes enumerated in the application. However, the maintenance, repair and upkeep of properties, including the Raja Mahal and the fort at Faridkot, were not included in this. “The details of the expenses incurred and the credits received shall be placed on record periodically. The first report shall be filed on October 30 and the second on November 30,” the double bench ordered The apex court also directed the managers of these banks to send the statement of accounts from June 1 to October 30, which shall be furnished in the court on November 10. The next hearing on the SLP challenging the high court order is on November 4. LONGSTANDING DISPUTE Crowned maharaja at the age of three in 1918, Harinder Singh Brar was the last ruler of the Faridkotestate and was married to Narinder Kaur. The royalcouple had three daughters, Amrit Kaur, Deepinder Kaur and Maheepinder Kaur and a son, Harmohinder Singh. The son died in a road accident in 1981. One of the rulers of the seven Sikh princely states, Harinder died in 1989 and left behind prime properties in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana and Chandigarh. Maheepinder Kaur died a spinster, while Deepinder died while the legal battle was on. Amrit Kaur lives in Chandigarh. The property dispute started soon after Brar died in October 1989 after a will surfaced in which he had bequeathed his properties to the Maharwal Khewaji Trust, with his daughter Deepinder as its head. The property dispute reached the high court in 2018 after a Chandigarh court declared the trust void and gave property to the daughters. In June, the high court upheld the Chandigarh court’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/faridkot-royal-dispute-supreme-court-allows-caretaker-trust-to-operate-bank-accounts-to-pay-salaries/story-BEQiy7IALj03yjL1qedIPK.html

An FIR in the case has been registered at Kandivali police station.Shaikh has moved a suit for defamation against Goswami and the channel for making comments against the police force in connection with the TRP scam. The suit is likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday.

Republic TV is one of the three channels accused by Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh of manipulating television ratings. Six people have been arrested by the Mumbai Police in the scam, which allegedly involves bribing homeowners whose TV viewing is monitored to ensure that certain channels get higher ratings. The ratings are a key influencer of advertiser preferences while placing commercials. The police claim this is a “multi-crore” scam. The channel moved the high court seeking quashing of the FIR registered in the case and its transfer from Mumbai Police to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-scam-former-cop-files-suit-to-restrain-arnab-goswami-republic-tv-from-airing-material-related-to-the-case/story-i79Dw0YhbJ5SCFkCXbgn9J.html

Good health and safety of their spouse, is what a wife wishes for her husband, and this thought is being manifested in the latest mehendi designs this wedding season amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Mehendi artists tell us about this new trend. ‘It’s a new design, and also trending’A mehendi artist from Gurugram, Karan Nayak says he’s been making such masked figures in mehendi designs for the brides-to-be of late. “Yeh design maine isi month banaya for a bride; ekdum naya hai aur khoob chal raha hai (I made this design this month itself for a bride. It’s a new design and is trending). We first showed this design to a girl who was to be married, and then dulhan ne kaha bhaiya ‘Mujhe aur mere pati ko mask pehne huye banao’. Karwa Chauth pe yehhi bana ne ki karenge is baar (We’ll be mostly making this new design for Karwa Cahuth this year).”But the prices aren’t fixed, and will depend on the day of Karwa Chauth.“Corona ki wajah se bahut mandi hai. Kaafi dino se khaali baithe hain, bas shaadi ke jo order aaye hai. Ab toh jo customer de de Karwa Chauth ke din,” adds Nayak.‘Mask Wala Design Chahiye’Anil Kumar, another mehendi artist who has made a bridal mehendi where both the bride and groom adorn the mask, says, “Aaj kal ladkiya bolti hain ‘Mask wala design chahiye bhaiya’, aur hum bana dete hai. This one was priced at ₹7,100. Koi bhi design ho customer ko pasand aana chahiye bas. Toh phir hum ussi hisaab se bana dete hai ki unko sundar design bhi mile aur message bhi ho jaaye. Brides want ki acha message jaaye apne mehendi design se (We make mehendi patterns that are beautiful yet send out a positive message).” ‘Corona hain toh masks ban rahe hai’“Jab Raksha Bandhan aata hai toh rakhi ka design bana diya. Ab corona hain toh masks ban rahe hain (For Rakshabandhan we make Rakhi specific designs, and now since there’s corona, masks are taking over mehendi designs). We are in a pandemic and a mask is a must, so women want it in their mehendi designs, too,” says mehendi artist, Mansingh, adding, “Karwa Chauth pe hum customers ko batayenge ki yeh bhi likh sakte hain: Stay Safe.”‘Humari shaadi corona mein hui thi’Anuj Kumar, a mehendi artist from Tilak Nagar feels this trend will continue for months to come. “Shaadi season will pick up from October 23, uske baad se hi start karenge banana. We have put up some designs on our website and that’s where people saw it and have started demanding it. Yeh ek memory ke liye hoti hai; log sochte hain baad me photo dekh ke ki ‘Humari shaadi hui toh corona chal raha tha’. I charge ₹11,000 for bridal mehendi on both hands. Bride and groom ki jo image banegi woh mask ke saath banegi aage aane wale mahino mein (Clients who have made bookings for coming months, have shortlisted designs that have figures of the bride and the groom wearing masks),” she says.

The court has directed Koshyari to submit his response regarding non-compliance of its earlier order on payment of dues. The former chief minister’s counsel, BD Upadhyay, said, “We will reply to the notice within four weeks.” On May 3, 2019, the court had directed four former CMs to pay within six months the market rent -- amounting to Rs 2.8 crore -- for the buildings occupied by them. It had also directed that all amount payable towards amenities, such as electricity, water and petrol, be recalculated within four months and the same be intimated to the former chief ministers who shall, within six months, pay said amount to the state government. Also read: Former Uttarakhand CM, 250 Congress workers booked for violating Covid-19 normsThe court had delivered the order after hearing a PIL filed by Dehradun-based NGO, Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra, that challenged free residence, car, security and other perks to former chief ministers in 2010. The single bench of Justice Sharad Sharma heard the contempt petition filed against Koshyari on Tuesday. “We apprised the court that the petition is fully maintainable even if the respondent is a sitting Governor. We have completed the requirement provided under Article 361(4) of the Constitution of India and already given sixty days’ notice to Koshyari before filing the present contempt petition. The court heard the matter and issued notice to Koshyari, granting him four weeks to reply to the same,” said the petitioner’s counsel. According to Article 361(4) of Constitution of India, “any civil proceedings in which relief is claimed against the President, or the Governor of a State, shall be instituted during his term of office in any court in respect of any act done or purporting to be done by him in his personal capacity, whether before or after he entered upon his office as President, or as Governor of such State, until the expiration of two months next after notice in writing has been delivered to the President or Governor.” The other three former chief ministers from whom the court had sought a response earlier in September this year are Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Vijay Bahuguna and Bhuvan Chand Khanduri.

On Tuesday, a three-member HC bench, comprising Chief Justice (CJ) DN Patel, Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh, said that the blanket order was passed because of the Covid-19 outbreak.On Tuesday, the Delhi government, through advocate Rahul Mehra, a standing counsel for criminal cases, told the HC that a total of 5,581 inmates were released on interim bail and emergency parole. Also Read: Over 77% non-Covid-19 ICUs in Delhi now occupied, data showsThough the total capacity of jails in the national capital is 10,000, around 16,000 inmates were lodged because of an acute space crunch.The Delhi government told the HC that 216 jail employees had tested Covid-19 positive, of which 206 had recovered from their viral infection.Sandeep Goel, director-general (D-G) of Delhi’s Tihar Prison, informed the HC some of the employees live in jail quarters and others don’t commute to work from outside.“At present, only three inmates are undergoing treatment at hospitals after they had tested Covid-19 positive. The contagion was contained in jails because adequate measures were undertaken by the authorities concerned,” Goel said.Amit Prasad, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), told the HC that 25 prisoners arrested in different cases of north-east Delhi riots, which had erupted in the end of February, were out on interim bail and emergency parole because of the blanket order.Also Read: Confessions not in public domain cannot be published: Delhi high courtCJ Patel said that the HC intended to end the blanket order and was not concerned with the jails’ lodging capacity. He cited that the order was passed because of the Covid-19 outbreak. “While passing the order, it was not taken into consideration the capacity of the jails. We had only passed the order due to the outbreak of Covid-19,” CJ Patel said.Mehra opposed the move and stated that it would be against the spirit of the orders passed by the Supreme Court (SC) for decongestion of jails and correctional homes. He pointed out that Delhi was still in the grip of Covid-19 pandemic and even a panel of the Delhi government, constituted following the apex court orders to decongest the jails, had also passed guidelines to release the prisoners on interim bails or emergency paroles.However, the HC bench maintained that “Covid-19 order should end now and it should be back to the situation as it was earlier”.Prisoners would be allowed whatever remedies are available to them under law, they added.Justice Singh suggested during the hearing that the order be modified for those accused of heinous crimes. He cited that several inmates had misused the order in their bid to extend interim bail and emergency parole on multiple occasions.CJ Patel weighed in and pointed out that the HC was not concerned about the nature of the crime concerned. He said he would pass the order later on Tuesday afternoon following deliberations with his other two member judges of the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-intends-to-end-interim-bail-parole-of-all-prisoners-out-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-A86NW79WKr4AprryS5ZR3M.html
20-10-2020||Mumbai||Congress questions BJP over delay in allowing women in local trains in Mumbai||The Congress, which is a part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government that also comprises the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are locked in a tussle over the reopening of temples and suburban trains, despite the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The BJP had tried to corner the MVA coalition government over the reopening of temples in Maharashtra last week, but now the Congress has questioned the railways’ refusal to give entry to women in suburban train services –a lifeline for the densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) – despite the state government’s order that was issued on October 16. Sachin Sawant, general secretary, Maharashtra Congress Committee (MCC) and a party spokesperson, on Tuesday raised the question and alleged that the Railways has deliberately barred women from availing suburban train services at the Centre’s insistence.Also Read: Covid-19: Active cases in Maharashtra drop by 127,000 in over a month“The state government held four meetings with the Railway officials regarding allowing women commuters to travel by suburban trains in the MMR during non-peak hours from October 17. However, on October 16, railway authorities expressed their inability to give permission. There is a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place as far as train services are concerned. Why does Railways want a fresh permission?” Sawant questioned.On October 16, the state government had announced plans to allow all women commuters to travel by suburban trains from the following day. However, both Central and Western Railway authorities intimated the state government at the last moment that permission would not be granted without carrying out an assessment of the additional burden of passengers in train services. The Congress alleged that it was a deliberate attempt to stop women from commuting by trains and blamed the Union Minister for Railways Piyush Goyal for the “arbitrary decision”.Sawant said women commuters were being forced to use other modes of conveyance, which were not only causing them inconvenience but had also raised safety concerns. He took potshots at the BJP’s state leadership for its radio silence over the issue even though it is vocal about the reopening of temples. He cited the ongoing Navratri festival, as a celebration of women power. Also Read: Expect thunderstorm with lightning today in Mumbai: IMDEarlier last week, the BJP had cornered the state government over the reopening of temples and had staged statewide protests outside shrines. The BJP state unit’s top brass had tried to put the MVA coalition government on the mat by citing that the latter was oblivious to the public’s faith even though it had allowed liquor shops to reopen amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had also written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray taunting him over his intransigence about reopening places of worship. Central Railway authorities have responded to Sawant’s allegations. “Railway is in full preparedness and is running 1,406 special suburban services. We have added 419 services to the existing 987. State government authorities are requested to finalise the modalities because of the Covid-19 pandemic and convey them to us,” Central Railway authorities tweeted.However, Sawant was not assuaged by the Central Railway authorities’ explanation. “There are around four lakh people, who belong to essential services and commute by suburban trains daily. A Covid-19-related SOP is in place. No new directives are needed. Besides, railways has the data about estimated women passengers,” he argued.Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar has written a letter to Central and Western railways instructing them to implement the decision at the earliest. “As per the decision taken during joint meetings with all the stakeholders, we have requested you to allow all women commuters to travel during non peak hours from October 17. The decision is yet to be implemented. The women commuters may be allowed to board the trains at the earliest,” the letter read.Keshav Upadhye, BJP spokesperson, said, “The BJP or any of its leaders have nothing to do with the issue. Railway Board will take its decision in due course and following all procedures. We do not take allegations by Sachin Sawant seriously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-questions-bjp-over-delay-in-allowing-women-in-local-trains-in-mumbai/story-63jq6xO1QEoah7zbmPFRYI.html

The bulk of Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases are in the age group of 50 to 59 years (45,779 cases), followed by 30 to 39 years (42,433 cases), and 40 to 49 years (42,345 cases). These form 53% of Mumbai’s total Covid-19 cases which stood at 241,939, as of October 18. As of Monday, Mumbai has 243,169 cases; 9,819 deaths due to Covid-19, and 19,906 active cases. Though cases in senior citizens are relatively fewer than in the working age group, case fatality rate is the highest in the age group of 70 to 79 years, which has recorded 2,181 deaths in 17,009 cases, and a case fatality rate of 12.8%. This is followed by 60 to 69 years, which have recorded 2,789 deaths in 32,483 cases, with a case fatality rate of 8.5%.

A senior civic officer from the public health department said, “Even among this, we have noticed there is a slightly higher percentage of men being infected than women, especially in the age group of 20 to 59 years. Our sero survey results indicated the same. This is because in a working middle class household, men venture out more. Senior citizens are more prone to severe symptoms and already have co-morbidities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bulk-of-mumbai-s-cases-aged-30-59-years-5-are-children-and-teenagers/story-etr3h8J9uvEQamCwAtaaKO.html
20-10-2020||City||Srinagar office of Kashmir Times sealed by Estates department||The Jammu and Kashmir authorities on Monday evening sealed the Srinagar office of Kashmir Times, one of the erstwhile state’s oldest and prominent English language newspapers, triggering outrage in the Valley. Politicians termed the action as the Central government’s effort to silence those speaking out and an attempt to muzzle press freedom in the region.The sealing comes a week after a flat allotted to the newspaper’s editor in Jammu was allotted to the brother of a former legislator by the Jammu and Kashmir’s Estates Department. “Today, Estates Deptt locked our office without any due process of cancellation & eviction, same way as I was evicted from a flat in Jammu, where my belongings including valuables were handed over to ‘new allottee’,” tweeted Anuradha Bhasin, 52, executive editor of the Kashmir Times.“Vendetta for speaking out! No due process followed. How peevish!” she wrote.Today, Estates Deptt locked our office without any due process of cancellation & eviction, same way as I was evicted from a flat in Jammu, where my belongings including valuables were handed over to "new allottee". Vendetta for speaking out! No due process followed. How peevish! pic.twitter.com/J5P0eKxvbxBhasin has been a vocal critic of the government’s over communication curbs when the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was revoked and the region put under lockdown last year on August 5.She had filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding the restoration of modes of communication and the taking of necessary steps for ensuring free and safe movement of journalists and media personnel. It was because of her petition that the court in January had directed the administration in Jammu and Kashmir to review the curbs on communication every week.The newspaper, on its website, wrote that its office in a government building in Press Enclave that houses several other newspaper offices in similar type of buildings was “sealed without serving any cancellation or eviction notice to Kashmir Times or following any due process of law.”“The Estates Department employees who came to the office to lock it out told the Kashmir Times staffers working inside to move out. When the Kashmir Times management asked for the orders, the Estates Department officials said that they had no orders and asked them to approach the senior officers instead,” it said in a news report.Also Read: Amid stiff opposition, J-K LG Manoj Sinha says no plans of imposing property taxDeputy Director Estates Department Mohammad Aslam said that the newspaper was occupying two quarters in the Press Enclave, of which one was taken over by the department “amicably”.He said that this quarter had actually been allotted to late Ved Bhasin, the founder of Kashmir Times and father of Anuradha Bhasin, in his individual capacity, and after his death its allotment expired and was cancelled.“Their office is running in another quarter while this quarter was not in the name of Kashmir Times. It was being used for residential purposes by its employees and we had requested for its vacation some two-three months back. Yesterday they themselves handed over the facility,” he said.Journalists have come out in solidarity with Kashmir Times and Anuradha Bhasin.A group of 11 journalists has even offered their professional services free to the organisation to support the Kashmir Times editorial team to “sustain the paper in these difficult times”.“We are aware that Kashmir Times, and its editor, has been at the forefront of fighting against government curbs on communications and press freedom in Kashmir, especially post August 5 clampdown last year, when the majority of the local press was found wanting in reportage, choosing silence over speaking truth to power.In view of these government-sponsored intimidation attempts to silence an independent newspaper, we express our solidarity and support to its editors and our colleagues there,” they said in a statement.The sealing prompted Jammu and Kashmir’s political leaders’ harsh reaction against the government.“This explains why some of our ‘esteemed’ publications have decided to become Government mouthpieces, printing only government press handouts. The price of independent reportage is to be evicted without due process,” tweeted former chief minister and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah.Anuradha was one of the few local newspaper editors in J&K who stood upto GOIs illegal & disruptive actions in the state.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Barely any rain yet Uran village flooded again; Environmentalists blame wetland burial||The village of Kunde in Uran taluka of Maharashtra’s Raigad district was flooded early on Monday. While the area has received just 8.6 mm rain over the past 48 hours, according to the district administration, environmentalists allege that this unseasonal flooding was caused by blocking of tidal waters in other areas of Uran.A similar flooding was reported last year also in Kunde and 19 other villages, affecting 1,236 families between September and October. Local residents said this has happened for the first time this year.Kunde resident Sanman Patil said, “Four homes were completely flooded early Monday morning and it took about five hours to remove the water. Even though our village is located closest to the creek and there have been episodes of heavy rain, this kind of flooding wasn’t witnessed last year or this year. Neither has there been very heavy rain nor did the water gush in during high tide. We are confused about what happened.”Also read: Mumbai’s Aarey flooded for the 1st time, walls blamed for choking floodplainsRaigad sub-divisional officer Dattatray Navale said, “We are investigating the source of flooding and have directed the Uran revenue officer to check and present his submissions.”Environmentalists, however, point at the burial of wetlands and destruction of mangroves by various infrastructure projects being developed in the taluka.Satellite maps of the site show large scale landfilling at adjacent plots that have been marked for development under the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd’s (Cidco) Dronagiri node development plan (DP). Apart from this, Uran-Ulwe is witnessing the development of the Navi Mumbai International Airport, container terminal construction by the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), and other residential and industrial projects.“It is due to the callous attitude of state planning agencies such as Cidco that the Uran villagers have to suffer every year,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head, environment group Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan.In February 2019, the Maharashtra Cabinet gave its nod to convert 1,250-hectares (ha) of land, which includes large tracts of mangroves and wetlands, for industrial and residential construction. At least 12 zones, including Kunde, across 1,250-ha have been notified for development under the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ). This constitutes nearly half of the 2,700-ha Dronagiri node. Cidco, the planning agency for the area, holds a 26% stake in NMSEZ while the rest is shared by private companies.“Landfilling has been confirmed by the Raigad collector’s office and the forest department,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, adding that repeated directions by the wetland and mangrove redressal committee (constituted as per the Bombay high court’s orders) for restoration of areas where construction debris was dumped in Uran have allegedly been neglected .A 2019 report by environment group Vanashakti using satellite images said 1,281-ha of wetlands (the size of 1,740 football fields) had been lost to reclamation, and over 10,000-ha of mangrove forests had either dried up or been destroyed over two years. “Large mangrove and wetland stretches have been recklessly buried. Any further reclamation would spell ecological disaster for the entire Uran taluka,” said Kumar.According to Cidco’s Dronagiri DP, 233-ha area marked as wetlands under the National Wetland Atlas, Maharashtra,has been earmarked as sectors numbered 16 to 28. These include wetland patches identified as important bird areas by Bombay Natural History Society.An NMSEZ spokesperson said they were unaware about the flooding but Cidco would know.“Neither are Cidco, NMSEZ and JNPT constructing anything at the moment at Dronagiri nor has there been any debris dumping. We are clueless as to what caused the flooding. Any future construction plans within Uran under any of the projects have been stopped because of the pandemic,” said Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-barely-any-rain-yet-uran-village-flooded-again-environmentalists-blame-wetland-burial/story-w4GyA8Idy0e2wqd12Ni0XN.html
20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM presents draft resolution rejecting farm laws, urges Centre to make MSP statutory||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday presented a draft resolution rejecting the Centre’s farm laws and the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill, with an appeal to all parties in the state to rise above political interests in the spirit of “saving Punjab”.The draft resolution presented on the second day of the special assembly session seeks annulment of the farm laws and the proposed Electricity Bill, as well as promulgation of “a fresh ordinance making the procurement of foodgrains on the minimum support price (MSP) a statutory right of the farmers and continue with procurement by the Government of India through Food Corporation of India and other such agencies.”Regretting that several legislators indulged in frivolous activities on Monday to gain political mileage, with some coming in tractors and some spending the night in the assembly precincts in protest against the non-receipt of his government’s Bills, the chief minister said he had signed the same at 9.30pm after extensive discussions and consultations with experts. “Such delays in sharing copies of Bills happen in an emergency session,” he said, pointing to something similar happening when his government had brought in the Punjab Termination of Water Agreements Act during his last tenure in 2004.BILLS BASIS FOR STATE’S LEGAL BATTLECaptain Amarinder Singh said the Bills being presented on Tuesday would form the basis of the state’s legal battle ahead and, hence, needed to be thoroughly vetted before presentation.The draft resolution expresses the regret of the assembly over the “callous and inconsiderate attitude of the Government of India in attending to the concerns of the farming community on recent farm legislation enacted by them.” It reads that the assembly is constrained to unanimously reject the three (farm) laws and the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020.Referring to The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, the draft resolution notes that the Union Government had converted the relevant farm ordinances into Acts and notified the same on September 24 and 26 even though the concerns and sentiments of the House were conveyed to the Prime Minister through a letter by the chief minister on September 14.‘FARM LAWS ENCROACH ON STATE SUBJECT’“These three legislation along with the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, are clearly against the interests of farmers and landless workers, and time-tested agriculture marketing system established not only in Punjab but also in original Green Revolution areas of Punjab, Haryana, and western UP,” it said, adding that the Government of India had enacted trade and not farm legislation.Further, said the draft resolution, these laws are also against the Constitution, which comprises agriculture as a subject of the state. These legislation encroach upon the functions and the powers of the states, as enshrined in the country’s Constitution, said the draft resolution, read out by the Speaker.CENTRE WANTS TO FINISH PDS, CLAIMS SIDHU Amritsar East Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu also questioned Modi on implementing the MS Swaminathan report recommendations. “What happened to the promises? These new laws have snatched the basic rights of farmers. They will be helpless,” Sidhu said, alleging that the Centre’s intention was to finish the public distribution system (PDS).Shiromani Akali Dal legislators, led by Bikramjit Singh Majithia, burnt a copy of the Centre’s new farm laws outside the Vidhan Sabha. AAP MLAs STAY IN ASSEMBLY COMPLEX OVERNIGHT The two-day special session began on Monday with the opposition Aam Aadmi Party MLAs holding a dharna and spending the night in the assembly complex, demanding copies of the Bills the Congress government was to introduce. The 13 AAP MLAs, who sat in the Well of the House till late on Monday evening after which they moved to the gallery outside the assembly, confined themselves within the complex. On Monday, finance and acting parliamentary affairs minister Manpreet Singh Badal said that the state government is consulting constitutional experts on the issue of legislation to counter the new farm laws and added copies of various Bills to be tabled during the session will be given to the opposition parties by the evening. Even after the adjournment of the session for the day on Monday afternoon, AAP legislators continued their dharna, demanding copies of the Bill to counter the legislation enacted by the Centre. Late at night, the Leader of Opposition and AAP leader Harpal Singh Cheema said, “We will sit here through the night and continue the protest as we are yet get copies of this and other Bills to be tabled during the session. “The AAP will support the legislation against the farm laws but the government should have given us its copies. We haven’t got copies of other Bills as well. How can our legislators discuss and debate important issues?” Cheema said. As the assembly area had to be sanitised and sealed overnight in view of the Covid-19 situation, the AAP MLAs, including the women legislators of the party, were asked to shift outside the House. Earlier, the AAP members were persuaded by the Speaker, deputy speaker and Vidhan Sabha officials to end their protest, but they remained adamant on their demand. WHEN CONGRESS MLAs SPENT NIGHT IN ASSEMBLY Four years ago when Congress was in opposition in Punjab, their party MLAs had spent the night in the Punjab assembly seeking a debate on the no-confidence motion against the ruling SAD-BJP combine, which was defeated by voice vote, and had refused to vacate the House till the government gave an assurance that a discussion will be allowed on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-to-table-bill-against-centre-s-farm-laws-in-assembly-today/story-lOPBUIFxPkgJQv0ewM4vqK.html

20-10-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata Durga Puja pandals put up barricades to ban entry of visitors||Several Durga Puja committees in Kolkata on Tuesday have started putting up barricades to ban the entry of revellers to pandals a day after the Calcutta high court’s (HC) order, while a few others said that they had done it even before the legal directive was issued. On Monday, the HC while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) had banned the entry of revellers inside pandals and declared them as “no entry zones”. The move aims to prevent overcrowding and curb the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The HC order has come as a setback for many community puja organisers and revellers, who were all set for pandal hopping while braving the contagion.Also read: Mumbai artist creates 6-feet portrait of Goddess Durga with 31,000 push pins“We have banned revellers’ entry to our pandal. Only local residents will be allowed in a bid to restrict overcrowding. We will follow the HC order and only a few club members will be allowed,” said Sahal Ghosh, secretary, Santosh Mitra Square, one of the prominent community pujas in central Kolkata and a major crowd-puller. Debdaru Fatak puja, another attraction in the western parts of the city, has also put up barricades to ban the entry of revellers. The organisers have put up a giant screen at a distance from where pandal hoppers can take a look at the idol, the pandal and the decorations. “Local residents organise this puja. They will only be allowed to enter the pandal this year because of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic,” said Gautam Halder, one of the puja organisers. The HC on Monday directed the authorities to put up barricades outside pandals. Barricades must be installed 10 metres away from the outer end of the pandal for large community pujas. The corresponding rule is five metres for smaller pujas.Kolkata Police personnel and some puja committee members were seen measuring the distance of barricades late at night on Monday. “We have coordinated with the Anandapur police station authorities and have put up barricades to bar the entry of visitors. On Tuesday, we will put out a list of 15 organisers, who will be allowed to enter the pandal during puja days,” said Pradip Biswas, one of the members of a small local community puja in eastern Kolkata along the Eastern Metropolitan (EM) Bypass. The HC has directed 25 and 15 community puja members be allowed entry to larger and smaller pandals, respectively. The names of the entrants will have to be decided in advance and cannot be changed daily. The puja organisers have been directed to display the list of entrants. “We have put up barricades at a distance from the pandal.

20-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Seven-month-old in need of surgery dies after being denied admission by major hospitals||A seven-month-old baby with a brain abscess -- a pocket of pus in her brain -- died after being refused admission by at least three prominent government-run hospitals in the national Capital. Her parents moved the Delhi high court (HC) and filed a writ petition to get her admitted to Safdarjung Hospital on September 3, where she was operated upon on the same day, but unfortunately died hours later. She was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital days after her parents ran from pillar to post to ensure proper medical treatment for her. Also read: AIIMS reports first case of Covid-19-related brain nerve damage in a childThe matter is still pending in the court and the hospitals have been asked to respond about the reasons for their refusal of admission.Initially, the baby was taken to the emergency department of Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital on August 17. She was suffering from fever, vomiting, seizures, and altered sensorium or an inability to think clearly. A day later, the baby was referred to a higher centre for proper healthcare management. She was admitted to Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar (BSA) Hospital at Rohini on August 18, where doctors gave her antibiotics, fluids, and anticonvulsants for the seizures. The doctors suggested neurosurgery after they conducted an ultrasound of the brain. Her family was asked to approach hospitals such as Ram Manohar Lohia (RML), Kalawati Saran, and Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya for the surgery.The parents approached RML, Safdarjung, GB Pant, and Kalawati Saran Hospitals, but were denied admission orally in all these healthcare facilities. The baby continued to remain admitted to BSA Hospital over the next three days without any treatment, despite the authorities pleading their helplessness to perform the surgery. A computed tomography (CT) scan, which was done from a private diagnostic laboratory four days after the child was admitted to the BSA Hospital, showed that she had developed brain abscess. BSA Hospital authorities decided to shift her to a better healthcare facility, as her condition had worsened. An ambulance was provided along with a resident doctor. However, both RML and GB Pant hospital authorities denied her admission, and she was brought back to BSA Hospital. Then, the parents moved the Delhi HC, which ensured her admission to Safdarjung Hospital on September 3. Though she was operated upon the same day, unfortunately she passed away following the surgical procedure.Safdarjung Hospital authorities in their affidavit have maintained that they never refused admission to the patient.The authorities at Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, which is one of the two biggest standalone paediatric hospitals in Delhi, claimed that they did not have the facility for paediatric neurosurgery. RML Hospital authorities insisted that the baby was given “proper medical assistance by the attending staff” and was referred to paediatric neurosurgery emergency, where she not allegedly brought for admission.Contrary to the RML Hospital’s assertion, the patient’s registration card showed “no bed is available” was the excuse offered by the former. The court has directed RML Hospital authorities to file another affidavit to explain the discrepancy in their statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-seven-month-old-in-need-of-surgery-dies-after-being-denied-admission-by-major-hospitals/story-UMhB5iqw5tn9e9aj1Cf9sI.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||AIIMS reports first case of Covid-19-related brain nerve damage in a child||The New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has reported its first coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced brain nerve damage in a girl (11), which has led to her blurred vision.The doctors in the child neurology division are preparing a report on her health condition that they plan to publish soon.“We have found Covid-19 infection-induced Acute Demyelinating Syndrome (ADS) in an 11-year-old girl. This is the first case that has been reported in the paediatric age group,” said the draft of the report.The nerves are covered with a protective layer called myelin that helps messages from the brain move quickly and smoothly through the body. ADS include health conditions that damage myelin, brain signals and affect a gamut of neurological functions such as vision, muscle movement, senses, bladder and bowel movement etc. Also Read: 5 worst-hit states have seen decline in active Covid-19 cases: Health ministry“This girl had come to us with a loss of vision. The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) showed ADS, which is a new manifestation. However, we now know that the virus majorly affects the brain and the lungs. We plan to publish this case report since we have established that her condition was Covid-19 induced,” said Dr Sheffali Gulati, chief, child neurology division, department of paediatrics, AIIMS, Delhi.The girl was undergoing treatment under Dr Gulati’s supervision. Her condition improved with immunotherapy, and she was discharged from the hospital after about 50% of her vision was regained.AIIMS authorities are also treating another Covid-19-positive teenager (13) girl after she had complained of fever and encephalopathy (swelling of brain). She is undergoing treatment and the doctors are still trying to ascertain whether her condition was induced by Covid-19.Epilepsy, encephalitis, Kawasaki-like disease, Guillain-barre syndrome etc are the other commonplace health complications that children, who tested Covid-19 positive, are known to suffer from. Some of these brain conditions may adversely affect the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. As a result, these children need a regular follow-up treatment that can be a challenge for a resource-strapped country such as India.In a review published in the journal Pediatric Neurology, Dr Gulati, said, “…the challenges faced by paediatric neurologists in a developing country are distinctive. Only a few centres, including ours, run round-the-clock child neurology tele-helpline and tele-consultation services, but restricted availability of video-calls and internet facility at rural households limits their efficient use. Besides, specialised facilities such as dietary therapy and surgery for drug-refractory epilepsy, etc. are offered at only a few centres only.”The treatment gap for neurological disorders is going to increase in India in the near future.“We can sense the problem, as our telemedicine helpline meant for children with neurological issues is receiving around 25 calls a day on an average, as compared to about 10 calls earlier. This is going to be a huge problem, as we are also treating non-Covid-19 children with neurological conditions, who need immediate attention. Our healthcare workers on the ground need to undergo training to identify neurodevelopment issues among children, promoting tele-consultation in a bid the public can at least call with their problems etc. We cannot talk of allotting more funds because of the prevailing situation, but it needs more thought,” Dr Gulati added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-reports-first-case-of-covid-19-related-brain-nerve-damage-in-a-child/story-qDP9Nqg7doOveNs18yB0FL.html

The wind speed was around 12 kilometres per hour (kmph) and the sky remained largely clear on Monday morning accompanied by mist,” the early warning system said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-aqi-remains-in-poor-category-today-as-well/story-er8o1kTX2nRd9PSJkajxFM.html
20-10-2020||City||8-member SIT to probe HRTC conductor recruitment paper leak||The Himachal Pradesh Police on Tuesday formed an eight-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) conductor recruitment exam leak case. Deputy inspector general (crime) Bimal Gupta will head the SIT with Kangra superintendent of police (SP) Vimukt Ranjan, Shimla SP Mohit Chawla, cyber crime SP Sandeep Dhawal, CID SP Sandeep Bhardwaj, Solan additional SP Ashok Kumar, Hamirpur DSP Renu Kumari and Mandi DSP (headquarters) Karan Singh Guleria as its members. State director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu said that the SIT members have been selected from different districts as the investigation has statewide ramifications. “It will ascertain the involvement of any organised gang or group. The SIT shall also probe any irregularities/lapses in holding the exam,” he said. So far, three people have been arrested in the case. They are Lucky Sharma and Sunny Sharma, both from Rohru in Shimla, and Manoj Kumar from Jawali in Kangra. ACCUSED SURRENDERS IN KANGRA Manoj Kumar, 26, one of the accused, surrendered before Kangra police at Shahpur police station on Tuesday. A resident of Bhali panchayat in Jawali subdivision, Manoj allegedly sneaked a phone into the exam centre at Shahpur. He clicked photos of the question paper and shared them on social media minutes after the exam started on Sunday. The exam was being conducted by the Himachal Pradesh Staff Selection Commission (HPSSC). The HPSSC secretary filed an online complaint at Shahpur police station, stating that a candidate who appeared for the exam at the Himachal Institute and Technology (HIET) had shared photos of the paper on social media. Police had been raiding his possible hideouts since Sunday. “Manoj Kumar has been booked under Section 7 of the Malpractices Act,” the Kangra SP said. The leak was first detected at a Shimla centre where a candidate was caught clicking photos by an invigilator. He had sent the images to his brother on WhatsApp but was yet to get a response. The candidate, Lucky, was arrested from his house in Rohru on Sunday. Later, investigations showed the question paper circulating on social media was leaked from a Kangra centre. This was detected from the serial number and code on the question paper. EXAM NOT TO BE CANCELLED: HPSSC Meanwhile, the HPSSC, in a meeting held on Monday, decided not to cancel the exam. HPSSC chairman Brigadier (retd) Satish Sharma said that of more than 60,000 applicants, 71% had taken the exam. Cancellation of the exam won’t be in the interest of the candidates, he said, adding that the malpractice was detected at only two centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-member-sit-to-probe-hrtc-conductor-recruitment-paper-leak/story-vBZfVqMOX1VMl5clW2PY0K.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||100 years of a Delhi education icon||On May 24, 1912, the khazanchi (treasurer) of the Imperial Bank of India, Rai Bahadur Lala Sultan Singh, wrote a letter to his 17-year-old son after touring Cambridge University in England. Remarking that there were about 20 “first-class colleges” there, he wrote: “The sons of rich people mostly come to the university (Cambridge) as it is rather expensive and it is they who take the most prominent part in the affairs of the British Empire. They are not like our rich people who say, parh kar kya karna hai... koi naukri thori karni hai (What is the use of studying… it’s not like one needs to find a job).”Eight years later, his son, Raghubir Singh, started a school in a haveli in Daryaganj right across the road from freedom fighter Dr MA Ansari’s home. Singh, then in his mid-20s, was clear about what he wanted from the school: it must be co-educational; the girls were to be given the same opportunities as the boys; the arts were as important as the other subjects; training in English was mandatory, so was a rootedness in home-grown, traditional systems of knowledge. But Singh’s agenda was also set: a new generation of Indian leaders, who would take charge of the country some day, had to be built.  Today, 100 years later, Modern School is located across three sites, with a combined strength of 6,000 students: Modern School Barakhamba Road came up in 1933, the Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School on Humayun Road came up in 1961; and Modern School Vasant Vihar came up in 1975. In the past decade, it has also come to manage two schools in Faridabad and Kundli.Several noted artists, writers, diplomats, legislators, members of the judiciary, sportspersons and businessmen and women are alumnae of the school, from former West Bengal governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi to from NITI Ayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant, contemporary artist Nilima Sheikh and Shekhar Kapur, who directed the Oscar winning film Elizabeth, to journalist and former Hindustan Times editor Khushwant Singh. Both the World Cup winning cricket teams had a Modernite: Kirti Azad in 1983, and Gautam Gambhir in 2011. Even former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi studied at the school for a brief period soon after it was first established.What’s more, the connection between Modern School and the Capital is intricate. Many of the Indian engineers and contractors who worked with Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker — lead architects of the imperial team tasked to build New Delhi from ground up — supported Raghubir Singh’s quest to build a school.This included Sobha Singh and Teja Singh Malik — both of whom were later knighted — as well as Baisakha Singh, Narain Singh, and Rai Bahadur Devi Singh, all of whom were responsible for many of the structures on the Central Vista, as well as the laying of the roads and sourcing the material for much of the construction. Another early proponent of school was Sushil Kumar Rudra, then the principal of St Stephen’s College.The school started with six students; by the end of the first year there were 12. Among them were Raghubir’s three children, Malik’s son and daughter Kaval (the only girl in the first batch), Devi Singh’s two sons, and Sobha Singh’s two boys, including Kushwant Singh. Kamala Bose, formerly the principal of a girls’ high school in Dehradun, was the principal of the new school.“No location could be imagined more suitable than Delhi so rich in historical associations, and yet — as the hub of the country’s political life, and a notable centre of its intellectual activity — so progressive in its outlook,” Raghubir Singh wrote in his records.After more than a decade after operating from 24 Daryaganj, the school moved to an exposed red-brick building on Barakhamba Road designed by Charles George Blomfield (who was part of Lutyens’ team) and his brother, Francis. Educating Indian youthBetween Sultan Singh’s letter of 1912, and the setting up of Modern School in 1920, much happened. The decade was a period of major policy decisions by the British with respect to education, writes Ajay Sharma, author of A History of Educational Institutions in Delhi. For instance, at the Delhi Darbar itself — held in December 1911 to mark the shifting of the capital from Calcutta — “it was announced that Rs 40 lakh would be distributed for the promotion of popular education in India”. When the Capital Committee was formed, a plan was also proposed to create education institutions for people from all around India to receive “instruction in modern subjects”, thus laying the ground for the setting up of Delhi University in 1922.However, after the events of 1919, which saw a draconian Rowlatt Act passed and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre take place, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi gave a call to boycott government-run schools and colleges. In 1920, the Congress formally passed a resolution of non-cooperation, which advised ‘the gradual withdrawal of children from schools and colleges, owned, aided or controlled by government and in place of such schools and colleges, the establishment of national schools and colleges in various provinces.’Thus, private entrepreneurs with means and deep community ties, propelled by the desire to see an independent India, turned to creating institutions. Indian philanthropists were also imbued with the nationalist spirit, with an idea of a composite India,” said Professor Rakesh Batabayal, who has written The Modern School (1920-2020): A Century of Schooling in India. For instance, Lala Sultan Singh didn’t just advance Rs 5,000 to his son to start Modern School; back in 1902, he had also saved Hindu College from losing its affiliation with Punjab University by housing it in one of his buildings in Kashmere Gate.“It was in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s appeal that Modern School was born. In the same year, certain other institutions were established: National Muslim University of Aligarh (later Jamia Millia Islamia), Gujarat Vidyapith, Bihar Vidyapith… they worked independently of the official system, trying to revive the ideals of the ancient Hindu or Muslim education,” writes former Planning Commission member and Modern School alumna, Syeda Hameed, in A Dream Turns Seventy Five, a book that she co-edited with alumnus Kushwant Singh on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Modern School. Yet, as Hameed points out, there was little in the public school mould which was accessible to the common people until Modern School. “The founder was barely 25-years-old when he started the school, but he visualised that one day, India would be independent. At that point in time, it would require a cadre of people who believed in India for India and also had the necessary education to be able to help in the governance and administration of a newly independent country,” said Ashok Pratap Singh, senior trustee of the school and grandson of Raghubir Singh.A provision for the arts“I don’t remember studying at all. My memory is permeated entirely with my participation in theatre and arts. The school taught me the interconnectedness of practice and theory, and this is something that I took with me to the National School of Drama. The pyramid was not built in a way that the exam was on the top,” said Anuradha Kapur, former director of the National School of Drama, who studied in Modern School from 1955 to 1968. She recalled, in particular, the plays that noted Hindi writer and theatre director Ved Vyas — a faculty member who joined in 1948 and went on to become the first principal of the Vasant Vihar school — put up. Alumnus justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who served as a chief justice of the Madras and the Punjab & Haryana high courts before he became a Supreme Court judge, said that he earned his acting chops in Hindustani theatre under Om Shivpuri, a former faculty member of the Barakhamba Road school. Justice Kaul (61) joined as a kindergartener in 1964. In ’76, his final year of school, he played Moliere’s miser in the Hindi adaptation, Kanjoos. “The Arts did not used to pay well at the time, but the school would pick the best people in the field as members of the faculty. Our principal [MN Kapur] would say, apart from a good academic record, each student should have one hobby and be good in one sport. So it was not unusual for us to stay back and practice for functions. Each student was encouraged to participate,” he said.One of the first appointees of the school was Sarada Ukil, a proponent of the Bengal School, who went on to design the school’s crest. Ram Kinkar Baij created a sculpture that still rests in the school, and Sukumar Bose painted a mural that adorns the Hall of Religions, the prayer hall of the school, which was inaugurated by Rabindranath Tagore in 1936. All three taught art in the school. Later, well known artist-couple Kanwal and Devayani Krishna, and modernist sculptor Amarnath Sehgal, noted photographer OP Sharma among others, also taught there.“Modern School offered an education system that would not only make girls and boys competent enough to work wherever they wanted but also awaken them to the need of the times in terms of their participation in the freedom struggle,” said Manju Rajput, principal of Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School.The push to focus on issues beyond the classroom is strong even today. Meenakshi Sahni, principal of Modern School Vasant Vihar, says that in 2015, students, parents, alumni and teachers from all branches of the schools took out a march to India Gate to protest against air pollution. “It happened much before this whole debate on air pollution in Delhi had begun. The environment has been one of the key areas we do work on.”“Our students are representing the country internationally in other games as well including squash, swimming, and golf. We have been judged as one of the best schools in sports,” said Barakhamba Road principal Vijay Datta.Most alumni have a busy social calendar — from sport competitions to theatrical productions, felicitation ceremonies to dinners — all organised by the Modern School Old Students’ Association (MSOSA). The association was formalised in 1967, but it came into being a decade before, said former president Sunder Hemrajani. The idea was to “bring old Modernites from different walks of lives together and carry on a relationship with the school, develop a bond with the current students. It’s become a part of the school’s legacy”. “There are 20,000 alumni of which at least 16,000 are active,” said alumna Ketaki Sood, president of the board of trustees.Justice Kaul, the chairperson of the Modernites Trust, which provides scholarships to students from economically weak sections and even runs various programmes for retired teachers, admits that “for a day school, such bonding is unusual.” “There is great loyalty to the uniform. The joke went that Modern School students don’t get out of it even when they go home,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/100-years-of-a-delhi-education-icon/story-i6Rbhp6xn1LknqpdliQPvK.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Celebrating two lives||Kavita Arora, 47, is a psychiatrist. Ankita Khanna, 36, is a psychologist. They occasionally share their 8th floor apartment, in Gurugram, with residential complex pigeons or with Zuzu, the neighbour’s dog. Ms Arora’s elderly father, who resides in south Delhi’s Alaknanda, stayed with them during the early uncertain days of the coronavirus pandemic. Ms Khanna’s parents, who live in Dehradun, visit them annually.Ms Arora and Ms Khanna have been living together for eight years. They first met at work, in the child and adolescent mental health clinic that Ms Arora co-founded with two other mental health professionals. Chatting to this reporter on WhatsApp video from their drawing room, both women vividly recall the fateful morning in January, 2012, when “Ankita, holding on to a cup of tea in her hands, was too jittery to take a single sip from it.”Though Ms Arora and Ms Khanna share a common passion for Harry Potter novels, there are things that set them apart. The former is fond of Gulzar poems; the latter likes Mary Oliver’s poetry. The former loves salads and sandwiches; the latter has a preference for home-made desi khana. The former is always happy to connect with people; the latter prefers books over people.“Despite how different we are, the space we have created together feels complete,” declares Ms Arora. While Ms Khanna reveals that “no matter how frazzled I am, Kavita is always steady and calm, and able to see humour and optimism in every situation.”Then, there are aspects about each other that they have learnt to tolerate. Ms Arora has grown resigned to Ms Khanna’s penchant for “phenko, phenko,” or “decluttering” the house. One morning, Ms Arora found her beloved CD player, the one she had bought from her life’s first pay, lying outside, in the trash area, waiting to be picked up by whoever wanted. As for Ms Khanna, she gets exasperated by Ms Arora’s tendency to “never say no to anyone who wants to talk, ask for help, chew her brains, teach a class, etc., etc.”And now, the most delicate question that can be put to any couple—who among them spends more time on mobile phone and social media?Ms Arora says: “She does!”Ms Khanna says: “She does!”Earlier this month, they, along with another same-sex couple, filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking to get married under the Special Marriage Act, stating that the lack of formal acceptance of their union under Indian laws is a violation of their constitutional rights. The next hearing is in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-celebrating-two-lives/story-bt4X0ceHtakNS08d0mvaoL.html
20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Two held for robbing goldsmith in Chandigarh’s Sector 23||Two days after a goldsmith was robbed at knifepoint at his rented house in Sector 23, Chandigarh Police on Monday arrested the mastermind and his aide.However, one of the two men who executed the crime was found to have died of heart attack while the other is absconding. Those arrested have been identified as Bikash, 40, of Kumaun Colony, Nayagaon, Mohali, and Kamlesh, alias Kamal, 25 of Dhanas in Chandigarh. While Bikash is also a goldsmith, Kamlesh is a photographer.Two men had fled with 150 grams of gold, a wallet and some documents from victim Samrat Thakur’s house on Saturday afternoon after threatening him with a knife and locking him in a room. The 20-year-old victim works from home and makes gold ornaments on order from different jewellers. In his complaint, he had raised suspicion on Bikash, who had visited his house before the robbery.On being interrogated, Bikash confessed that he had planned the robbery. Bikash told police that he used to supply raw gold to Samrat to make jewellery, and suspected that he had started misappropriating the gold. In order to teach him a lesson, he hired two men, Rahul and Chotu, to commit the robbery.On Saturday morning, Bikash had gone to Samrat’s house, and on finding that he was alone, he tipped off Rahul and Chotu. Co-accused Kamlesh had picked up and dropped off the duo, said police. Police on reaching Rahul’s house in Nayagaon found his family mourning. He reportedly had died of a heart attack. Meanwhile, Chotu, a resident of Dhanas, is absconding.Police have recovered 60% of the raw gold stolen from Samrat besides the knife and motorcycle used in the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-held-for-robbing-goldsmith-in-chandigarh-s-sector-23/story-1m27kKctkOwP2mqWCSqAIK.html

20-10-2020||Chandigarh||French technical experts to help restore heritage buildings in Chandigarh||Teams of technical experts from France will help the Chandigarh administration in the restoration of heritage buildings and renovation of heritage furniture. A meeting in this regard was held with a French delegation, which is on a visit to the city.The French team said that technical experts will hold online sessions, as physical visits will not be possible amid the Covid-19 pandemic. After technical exchange of ideas online, the French technical team is expected to visit the city next year for execution of the restoration work.The heritage buildings that are to restored include the high court, civil secretariat and legislative assembly at the Capitol Complex. Currently, the administration has taken up the restoration of exposed concrete facade of government buildings in Sector 17, including the Central State Library and DC office, besides Pierre Jeanneret house and Le Corbusier Centre. It also plans to start restoration work on private buildings in Sector 17.In February, a high-level delegation comprising Brigitte Bouvier, director, Fondation Le Corbusier, and French embassy officials had visited various heritage sites to review the restoration work in Chandigarh.On Sunday, the delegation that included French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain, had met UT administrator VP Singh Badnore to discuss the matter.In the Monday’s meeting with administration officials, the French delegation comprised cultural attache Isabelle Vierget Rias, second counsellor and chief of staff to the ambassador Antoine Chausson, and cultural counsellor and director, French Institute of India, Emmanuel Lebrun Damiens.Will help stop auction of smuggled heritage itemsDuring the meeting, the administration also took up the issue of illegal auction of Chandigarh’s heritage items abroad.French embassy officials assured the administration that it would explore legal provisions to help stop such auctions in their territory and elsewhere.Concerns have been raised over the administration’s inability to preserve heritage items, with their trafficking becoming rampant. Stolen heritage and smuggled items from Chandigarh have repeatedly found their way to foreign auction houses.In the last 10 years, heritage artefacts worth around ₹30 crore have been auctioned around the world. More than 50 auctions have been held in different countries, including the US, UK and even France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/french-technical-experts-to-help-restore-heritage-buildings-in-chandigarh/story-lYhe2qHxXomoVhrYq1n7bK.html

Protesters started gathering outside Reliance stores in Phases 7, 10 and 11 since Sunday night, and did not allow them to open in the morning. Farmers also forced the closure of Reliance petrol pumps in Kharar and Banur. “We have boycotted multinational companies for invading Punjab markets and snatching the share of poor farmers, pushing them towards poverty,” said one of the protesters.Balwant Singh, another protesters, said: “Central government is forcing MNCs on us, which act as crocodiles and will eat farmers, who are a small fish. We will not allow them to do business in Punjab till the government rolls back the new legislations.” Meanwhile, the Mohali administration has issued orders to the police department to make adequate arrangements at the railway stations in Mohali and Kharar, where farmers are suspected to be planning rail blockade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-force-closure-of-reliance-stores-in-mohali/story-3L8TFdKfFUBedhD7rLYg2K.html

20-10-2020||Election:||‘Nitish Kumar was unfair’: RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav supports Chirag Paswan||A day after attacking the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) as the B team of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Monday expressed his sympathy for LJP leader Chirag Paswan and said chief minister Nitish Kumar had been unfair to the young politician ahead of the upcoming state polls. Without going into the specifics of how exactly Nitish Kumar had been unfair to Chirag Paswan, the RJD’s chief ministerial face noted that Paswan had recently lost his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan.“What Nitish Kumar Ji did with Chirag Paswan is not good. Chirag needs his father today more than ever before but Ram Vilas Paswan Ji is not among us and we are sad about it. Nitish Kumar did injustice with Chirag Paswan, his behaviour is unfair,” Tejashwi Yadav said. Chirag Paswan’s father passed away on October 8. Citing ideological differences with Nitish Kumar, the politician has pulled the LJP out of the National Democratic Alliance in Bihar while insisting that it supports the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre. He also said the BJP and LJP would form a coalition government after the results of the three-phase election are declared on November 10. On Sunday, Yadav took a swipe at the LJP in electoral rallies ahead of the assembly elections. “They are vote katwas (vote splitters),” he said, urging voters to beware of the BJP’s B-team The LJP thanked Yadav for his expression of support on Monday. “Everybody has been approving what Chirag Paswan’s views at one point or the other. First they criticise, later they toe his line,” said LJP spokesperson Ashraf Ansari. Also Read | Farewell, Ram Vilas PaswanBoth Tejashwi and Chirag are facing the state elections without the presence of their fathers for the first time. RJD president Lalu Prasad is serving a jail term and cannot take part in elections; Ram Vilas Paswan’s death has deprived Chirag Paswan of an experienced political mentor. Tejashwi Yadav’s conciliatory comments towards Chirag Paswan sparked a new round of speculation about post-poll alliances. “You cannot rule out a post-poll alliance this election. Not only Chirag, other parties have kept their options open as the election may witness a low turnout. A slight swing will become a deciding factor,” said D M Diwakar, a politicval expert and former director of the AN Sinha Institute for Social Studies. On Monday, Chirag Paswan again reiterated that a BJP-LJP government will be formed in Bihar after assembly poll results are declared on November 10, and asked BJP leaders not to use terms like vote splitter against his party “just to keep Kumar happy”. “Ultimately, a BJP-LJP government will be formed in the state after November 10,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/nitish-kumar-was-unfair-rjs-s-tejashwi-yadav-supports-chirag-paswan/story-4GzOo4z60pbva5HG2BEbQK.html

Rather, the MC should sort out the old pipes first and fix leaks before charging more taxes.”FOSWAC chairman Baljinder Bittu added, “An average person is paying 60% of his income in the form of various taxes already. The city has a huge population of retired pensioners, which the MC should take into account.”Bittu said MC elections were scheduled for next year and the people will remember this decision, adding that more protests will be organised if their demands were not accepted.Devinder Singh Babla, MC’s leader of opposition, spoke about how the people in power were neglecting the demands of the people.Police were deployed in large numbers at the site of the protest, however, social distancing was not maintained. Many protesters could also be seen wearing masks improperly or not all.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Central Administrative Tribunal asks Maharashtra government to reinstate auditor||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has issued an order reinstating an auditor who was allegedly relieved from his post arbitrarily last year, by Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik. The order was passed on September 22 and Saunik has since got a stay on CAT’s order. On August 30, 2019, senior departmental accounts auditor GD Thakare from the public works department (PWD) was asked to discontinue auditing, by Saunik and the superintendent engineer. Thakare challenged this instruction and approached CAT. This year, on September 22, CAT issued an order saying the state must permit Thakare to audit and relieving him of his duty was in contravention of the Public Works Accounts Code. In response, Saunik filed a review petition and has since got a stay on the order reinstating Thakare. “I have done no wrong. I immediately obtained a stay order against this [CAT’s] order. I have asked for the review of this order,” Saunik told HT.However, activist and advocate Pravin Wategaonkar has written to Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, seeking action against Saunik. Wategaonkar said, “PWD headed by Saunik had no right to relieve Thakare and that he had acted unlawfully was confirmed by the ruling given by CAT.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-administrative-tribunal-asks-maharashtra-government-to-reinstate-auditor/story-Z4KdEMvhdwVb4g6gduveuL.html

A yellow alert had been issued for Monday, too, but no rain was recorded in the city and suburbs between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Heavy rain warnings with thunder and lightning have been issued for Thane till Thursday, for Palghar till Wednesday, and Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg till Friday. The weather bureau said the formation of a fresh low pressure weather system over Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify rain activity over central India, interior Maharashtra and the Konkan coast. “Currently, a well-marked low pressure area persists over west-central Arabian Sea, and as a result of this, an associated upper cyclonic circulation may lead to rain over the next 24 to 48 hours over the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). However, rainfall during the latter half of the week is due to the low pressure forming over Bay of Bengal,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. Meanwhile, owing to the cloud cover early on Monday morning, the minimum temperature in Mumbai was 3 degrees Celsius above normal at 26.2 degrees Celsius. However, a partly cloudy sky throughout the day helped in bringing the day temperature 2 degrees Celsius below normal to 31.6 degrees Celsius. South Mumbai recorded the minimum temperature at 26.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degree Celsius above normal, even as the maximum temperature was recorded at 32 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius below normal.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Late actor’s house help moves Bombay high court, seeks compensation of ₹10 lakh for ‘illegal detention’ by NCB||Dipesh Sawant, the domestic help of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, has moved the Bombay high court (HC), seeking compensation of Rs10 lakh on the grounds that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NBC) had kept him in illegal detention before producing him in front of a metropolitan magistrate. Sawant, 25, has been accused of interacting with peddlers and accepting deliveries of contraband material, allegedly on behalf of Rajput, for the late actor’s consumption. “There is gross violation of fundamental rights of the petitioner by the NCB officials by not producing the petitioner to the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of taking into custody,” stated Sawant’s petition. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik has posted Sawant’s petition for hearing on November 6. In the petition filed through advocates Aamir Koradia and Rajendra Rathod, Sawant has stated that the NCB took him in custody from his Chembur residence on September 4, around 10pm. He, however, was produced before a holiday magistrate 36 hours later, on September 6 around 1.30pm. The petition adds that in the interregnum, one of co-accused in the case, Kaizan Ibrahim, was produced before a magistrate on September 5, and was immediately granted bail by the magistrate. Sawant, however, was not produced along with Ibrahim, and was instead shown arrested on September 5 at 8pm. Sawant has alleged that NCB kept him in illegal detention for over 36 hours, which violated the mandate of Article 22 of the Constitution of India. Besides, Sawant has also alleged that the agency intimated his brother Vivek about his arrest only on September 6 at 11.40am, thereby violating the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in the DK Basu judgment, pertaining to the guidelines on detention. Apart from the allegation of illegal detention and breach if Supreme Court guidelines, 25-year-old Sawant also claimed that all the offences for which he has been charged were bailable, having purportedly involved small quantity of drugs. However, this ground had been negated by a single judge bench of the HC earlier. While granting bail to Sawant and some others arrested by NCB, the single judge held that all offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, were non-bailable. Sawant is charged under sections 8(c) with 20(b)(ii) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport, ware-house, use, consume, import, export of cannabis other than ganja), 23 (import, export or trans-shipment of contraband material), 29 (abetment) and 30 (preparation for offences punishable under sections 15 to 25) of the NDPS Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-late-actor-s-house-help-moves-bombay-high-court-seeks-compensation-of-10-lakh-for-illegal-detention-by-ncb/story-VENDs69GIgchciE49uxOPJ.html

His right arm has ‘NEERAJ SANG’ tattooed on it, though the last few alphabets are not clear, the police said. The body was found on October 17, but police are still trying to ascertain the man’s identity.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Why no action against media trial in Sushant Singh Rajput death case? Bombay HC asks Ministry of Information and Broadcasting||The Bombay high court has asked the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) why no action had been initiated on the complaints related to media trial in the death case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a bunch of petitions filed by individuals, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and a group of former top police officers, seeking a restraint on media trials. The court was informed by senior counsel Arvind Datar, representing the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) and the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), that the self-regulatory mechanism for channels was doing its work diligently. NBA also implored the Bombay high court (HC) to not give in to the requests of the petitioners – who sought directions for the formation of a statutory authority to regulate the electronic media – as it would lead to an end of the independence of media. NBA submitted that the self-regulatory mechanism which is in place has been very effective in redressing complaints against channels and all the members have strictly adhered to its regulations, with the exception of Republic TV and its Hindi channel. NBA informed the court that Republic TV did not want to abide by its regulations and hence, left the association, and went on to form its own self-regulating authority. The two authorities were responding to allegations by the petitioners that the electronic media was conducting media trials during which they resorted to police bashing, disclosed vital details of the ongoing investigations and tried to influence the opinion of viewers. The petitioners had stated that independent self-regulating authorities in the form of NBA and NBSA were not taking sufficient steps to curb channels from conducting media trials. Datar, however, refuted the allegations and submitted that they had time and again taken disciplinary action, and at times stringent action, against errant channels by banning its airing for three days to three months. He submitted that though the two authorities did not have any statutory powers, it was adjudicating complaints based on the programme code as directed by the MIB. Datar concluded by coaxing the court to not grant the requests of the petitioners to have a statutory body to regulate the electronic media, as it would become difficult for the media to function independently. He also cited the Supreme Court judgments in which the Apex court had refused to interfere or direct the legislative to form a statutory mechanism to regulate the electronic media. In light of this, Datar requested the court to not exercise its discretionary authority. After hearing the submissions of NBA and NBSA, the bench sought to know from MIB if the two independent authorities were formed without any statutory powers so that channels could afford an escape route by invoking Article 19(2) of the Constitution and approaching the courts when they were pulled up for irresponsible and objectionable reporting. Datar, however, clarified that though the two independent authorities were allowed to address complaints against errant channels, the MIB was not restricted from taking action simultaneously as per the Cable TV Regulation Act. The court then asked MIB to inform it on Wednesday as to why no action had been initiated by the ministry with respect to the complaints related to media trial in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-no-action-against-media-trial-in-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-bombay-hc-asks-ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting/story-nrCMNrZEJQtsjUaQSrFEgI.html

20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh district courts resume physical hearing to poor response||After staying shut for more than seven months due to the Covid-19 outbreak, district and sessions judge allowed the physical hearing of cases on Monday, but was met with cold response.The judge has allowed physical hearing provided both parties give their consent. As per advocates, “no two parties will give consent hence, this clause will not be of much help as defence party would want to delay hearings by withholding consent”. For the consent of both the parties, a joint application has to be submitted at the special counter on the ground floor of the complex in Sector 43. On Monday, the court was sanitised, however, majority of the courtrooms remained locked and the hearing of most of the cases was done via virtual hearing.Advocate NK Nanda, president, District Bar Association (DBA) said, “There was no physical hearing. I had three cases today and all were heard via videoconferencing. At least judges should start sitting in courtrooms. They can adjourn some matters, but they should hear the advocates in urgent cases.”“When judges in Mohali and other places can sit inside courtrooms, then why not in Chandigarh district court?” he questioned. Nanda said they have added a clause that both parties should give consent. “When did two advocates have agreed on one case? One will never give consent, hence, there will be no physical hearing.” For the inspection of judicial records, only advocates or their clerks are allowed to inspect the documents in the courtroom on the working day.A senior public prosecutor said, “Most of my cases are in the final stage, but the other party will never give consent. Hence, I will have to wait until this condition is removed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-district-courts-resume-physical-hearing-to-poor-response/story-7hoUd3BL1jIzRnXsdGzmNM.html

Heavy rain warnings with thunder and lightning are in place for Thane till Thursday, Palghar till Wednesday, and Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg till Friday.The weather bureau said the formation of a fresh low-pressure weather system over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify rain activity over central India, interior Maharashtra and the Konkan coast. “Presently, a well-marked low-pressure area persists over west-central Arabian Sea, and as a result of this, an associated upper cyclonic circulation may lead to rain over the next 24 to 48 hours over the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). However, rainfall during the latter half of the week is due to the low pressure forming over the Bay of Bengal,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.Also read: SSR death case - ‘Why no action against media trial?’ HC asks I&B ministryMeanwhile, owing to cloud cover early Monday morning the minimum temperature in Mumbai was 3 degrees Celsius above normal at 26.2 degrees Celsius.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||14-member panel set up to propose amendments to Maharashtra Public Universities Act||The Maharashtra higher and technical education department on Monday set up a committee to make further amendments to the Maharashtra Public Universities Act (MPUA), which was amended previously in 2016. According to a government resolution (GR) issued on Monday, the 14-member committee will study MPUA and suggest amendments to improve the Act as well as to incorporate the central government’s National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. The committee will be headed by Sukhadeo Thorat, economist and former chairperson of the University Grants Commission, and comprise current and former vice-chancellors of major universities in the state. “The committee has been directed to study the existing Act, and suggest changes keeping in view rules and regulations at national and international levels,” read the GR, adding that the proposed amendments should be practical, easy to implement and student-friendly. The MPUA, which governs all non-agricultural universities in the state, was amended during the winter session of the state Assembly in 2016 and came into force on March 1, 2017. Changes were made to sections of the Act to improve the functioning of universities and reintroduce student elections in over two decades. “It has been four years since the Act was last amended. We need to have a fresh look at the Act and make improvements to enhance the performance of our universities. At the same time, we need to make changes to the Act to integrate the guidelines of NEP,” said Rajeev Jalota, additional chief secretary, higher and technical education department. The state has asked the committee to submit an interim report of its proposals within three months. “The state has sought amendments for the better implementation of the NEP 2020. A meeting will soon be convened by the chairperson, during which the terms and conditions for the committee will be defined,” said Rajan Velukar, former vice-chancellor of the University of Mumbai and a member of the committee. Earlier this year, the Union education ministry announced a complete overhaul of the country’s school and higher education in NEP 2020, which is India’s first education policy of the 21st century. NEP was passed by the Union cabinet on July 29. Education activist Santosh Gangurde said that the formation of the committee was a welcome step. “For the past five years, there have been discussions about some lacunae in MPUA, such as a rotation system in reservation policy, which is unconstitutional. The Act also lacks clarity about the regulation of autonomous colleges. Also, there needs to be proper coordination between NEP and MPUA,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/14-member-panel-set-up-to-propose-amendments-to-maharashtra-public-universities-act/story-FOqbLUms3vIKYJmmjE5VIN.html

20-10-2020||City||After months of verbal jostles, Speak for India enters last lap||New Delhi: Following months of intense verbal duels between college-goers from across the national Capital on contemporary topics, the grand finale of the Federal Bank Speak for India — Delhi Edition, in association with Hindustan Times and Hindustan, will be conducted on Tuesday. This is the first time the event is being organised in the National Capital Region (NCR).The event provides a platform for the youth to debate contemporary social, political, and cultural issues and explore opposing perspectives, while preparing them to take on the role of change-makers in society.Over 62,000 participants from across Delhi and the NCR registered online, and over 1,000 students took part in the preliminary auditions. The initial rounds, which took place in January and February, were conducted in various Delhi University (DU) colleges, including Hindu College, Kirori Mal College, Aurobindo College, and Daulat Ram College.Though the finale was slated to be conducted in March, the event was postponed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the disease.Finalist Priyanshi Sharma, 21, who will graduate in Economics from Daulat Ram College this year, said, “The experience has been different from DU debating circuits, because it was very well-organised and managed. Since the participants were from good debating societies, the level of competition has also been great. Debates like these give us the chance to see multiple perspectives of an issue and ponder over a stance that might be completely opposite to ours. It helps us learn how to function with logic in life.”The initial screening was done through auditions at the sub-zonal level across more than 10 centres in Delhi-NCR, following which shortlisted candidates competed at four zonal auditions. The eight finalists who will debate on Tuesday were selected from the 36 semi-finalists and are from institutes like FORE School of Management, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), and various DU colleges.Rajan Bhalla, chief business officer and CMO, HT Media Ltd, said “Federal Bank’s Speak for India Delhi Edition 2019 in partnership with Hindustan Times and Hindustan is truly India’s biggest debate competition for youth. The multi-state competition engendered a massive response from collegians who participated with great fervor. And, we’re all geared up for the grand finale.”Federal Bank MD and CEO, Shyam Srinivasan said, “These are challenging times. When we set this out almost a year ago, nobody had a clue that we would be faced with such a change in events [due to the pandemic]. But we are excited to be able to do the first event in Delhi with our partner Hindustan Times.”While former parliamentarian and national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party Baijayant Jay Panda is the chief guest, renowned athlete and paralympian Deepa Malik and Aam Aadmi Party legislator and spokesperson Raghav Chadha are the guests of honour. The jury comprises senior journalist Barkha Dutt, founding member of DU’s National Democratic Teachers’ Front Inder Mohan Kapahy, and Shri Ram College of Commerce professor Abhinav Prakash Singh.The winner will get a cash prize of ₹1.5 lakh, a scholarship of ₹50,000 and a college reward worth ₹25,000.

20-10-2020||City||26-year-old booked for HRTC paper leak||A 26-year-old man was booked in connection with the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) Conductor Recruitment paper leak.The accused, Manoj Kumar, a resident of Bhaunka village in Jawali sub-division of the district, is at large. The paper was leaked on social media minutes after the exam started on Sunday. The exam was being conducted by the Himachal Pradesh Staff Selection Commission (HPSSC). Around 60,000 candidates had appeared for the exam conducted across 304 centres. Kangra senior superintended of police (SSP) Vimukt Ranjan said the HPSSC secretary filed an online complaint at Shahpur police station stating that a candidate who appeared for the exam at the Himachal Institute and Technology (HIET) near Shahpur had shared photos of the paper on social media.“The accused has been booked under section 7 of Malpractices Act, 1984,” said Ranjan , adding that efforts were on to nab him. Photographs of some pages of the question paper had started circulating within half-an-hour of the start of the exam.The leak was first detected at a Shimla centre where a candidate was caught clicking photographs by an invigilator. He had send the images to his brother on WhatsApp but was yet to get a response.Later, investigations revealed that the question paper circulating on social media was actually leaked from a Kangra centre. This was detected from the serial number and code printed on the question paper.The candidate who leaked the paper from the Shimla centre was arrested from his home in Rohru on Sunday.Another candidate was caught with a phone at the Solan centre. His phone also had photographs of the question paper but he had not shared them when he was apprehended.Meanwhile, HPSSC has banned the accused from appearing in any exam for three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/26-year-old-booked-for-hrtc-paper-leak/story-BMIc2FeBfDMrlrXLQBOCxK.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Total Covid-19 tests in Capital cross 4 million-mark||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests conducted in Delhi crossed the four million-mark, even as the number of tests dipped to just 36,000, according to Monday’s daily health bulletin. On average, over 55,000 tests were conducted each day during the week barring Sunday, higher than the average of 51,000 during the previous week. The Capital added 2,154 cases of the infection, and conducted 36,445 tests in the 24-hour period pertaining to the Monday bulletin. To be sure, new cases and tests usually dip on Monday, owing to a lull on the weekend. The bulletin also added 31 deaths on the day, taking the city’s total fatality count to 6,040.In Delhi, after reaching a peak of over 4,400 cases being reported in a day during September third week, the numbers started dipping slowly, reporting fewer than 3,000 cases since early October. However, the numbers started increasing again when the government increased the number of more accurate RT-PCR [reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction] tests. Rapid antigen tests are cheaper, easily deployed at clinics and dispensaries, and can give results within 15 minutes. However, they also tend to throw false negatives for people who might have the infection. “Of course, if we do more RT-PCR tests, we will detect more cases as it is a more sensitive test. This is the reason it is suggested that the less sensitive rapid antigen tests be used in containment zones for screening cases, but the RT-PCR tests be used elsewhere,” said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija, professor of medicine and head of department of neurology at Lady Hardinge Medical College. Experts, however, worry that there might be an increase in the number of cases after the festive season. “There is likely to be an increase in the number of cases as people meet during the festive season. The increase in the number of cases will be seen 10 to 14 days after the festival. By then, it will also be the time for Diwali,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Dr Khilnani also warned that the increase in the pollution levels may cause more severe disease, with many needing treatment in intensive care units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/total-covid-19-tests-in-capital-cross-4-million-mark/story-Zk3eunIqNc0HSQR1NKhieM.html
20-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Woman found dead inside home; husband, minor son missing||The body of a 25-year-old woman was found at her rented accommodation Sunday night, located under the Phase 2 police jurisdiction. The woman’s husband and their eight-year-old son are missing, said the police.According to the police, they received a call on the police helpline on Sunday night from a neighbour of the woman, who said that she was lying dead in her rented accommodation in Yakubpur village.“A team was rushed to the spot and the woman was found lying down. She was taken to a nearby hospital where she was declared brought dead, after which her body was sent for an autopsy,” said Anita Chauhan, station house officer, Phase 2 police station.Police officers said that prima facie, it seems that the woman was strangled to death as there were no other visible injury marks on her body. “However, we will be sure only after the autopsy report comes in and based on the findings, we will register a case and take necessary action. Meanwhile, a probe in the case is underway,” said the station house officer.Police officers said that the husband was seen by the neighbours the day before the incident. Officers said they suspect that he may be behind the woman’s death, and then probably fled with the child. However, the neighbours did not mention any fights or disagreements noticed between the couple recently, which might suggest a domestic dispute.“The landlord hadn’t done any verification for the family and it is unclear where they are from, although according to the neighbours they worked as daily wage earners. We are working on tracing the rest of the family and informing them about the woman’s death. So far, no one has filed a formal complaint regarding her death but a case will be filed based on the autopsy report,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-woman-found-dead-inside-home-husband-minor-son-missing/story-jpzccSLDwOkDE7WW4XHpgO.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Over 77% non-Covid-19 ICUs in Delhi now occupied, data shows||The number of patients visiting hospitals with ailments other than the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has reached the same levels as before the lockdown enforced on March 25. As a result, almost 75% of the beds in non-Covid-19 intensive care units (ICUs) are occupied, compared to 54% of Covid-19 ICU beds. The Delhi government has started updating information on the availability of non-Covid ICU beds in its ‘Delhi Corona’ app after the Delhi high court asked the state for information of ICU beds available for the treatment of non-Covid-19 patients. The court issued the order when Delhi government’s decision to reserve 80% of the ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals to ensure availability of Covid-19 beds was challenged. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAt Safdarjung Hospital, the wards that used to be empty are filling up rapidly. “Most of the ICU beds are needed for patients coming in to our emergency department with ailments like meningitis, pneumonitis, stroke and heart attack. Of course, the number of cases might not have gone down but people were not travelling to get treated at our hospital in June and July,” said Dr BK Tripathi, head of the department of medicine at the hospital. “There were wards that remained empty, but now the number of patients has gone up to the pre-lockdown levels. Plus, we are also getting more patients who would have gone to hospitals like Lok Nayak that have completely suspended services other than Covid-19.”At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the road, almost all the patients in the ICUs come in through the hospital’s emergency department, with routine surgeries having been put on hold. “Our non-Covid ICU has again started running at about 90 to 95% capacity; almost the same as what it used to be before the lockdown. With the fear of Covid-19 reducing in the minds of people, travel resuming, and border closures having been lifted we are getting more and more patients every day,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent at AIIMS. The emergency at the hospital is running in full swing. Apart from that, semi-emergency surgeries like those needed for cancer are also being routinely performed. In fact, it is the cancer patients who are taking up most of the non-Covid ICU beds in the city hospitals. At Indraprastha Apollo hospital, most of the patients admitted are from the departments of cancer, cardiology, neurology, and orthopaedics. “In comparison to June and July, the number of hospital admission have doubled. And, most of the patients are coming in with complications after avoiding going to hospitals for long periods. For example, I had a patient with both shoulders dislocated, but only one had been aligned and treated. People are coming in with cardiac complications as well. This has driven the increase in ICU occupancy,” said Dr Yash Gulati, senior consultant from the department of orthopaedics at the hospital. “Just because there are Covid-19 cases doesn’t mean that the burden of other diseases has reduced. Yes, people are delaying some of the planned procedure, but we still need as many ICU beds. If more ICU beds are needed for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, we need to create more beds rather than diverting from the existing ones,” he said. An expected increase in the pollution levels will further drive demand for ICU beds. “Every winter when the pollution levels go up, we see an increase in the number of patients coming in with heart attacks and aggravation of respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and they need ICU care, especially the elderly,” said Dr Gulati. At Max hospitals, orthopaedic admissions saw the highest increase in September of 78% over July. The biggest share of non-Covid ICU beds are occupied by cancer and heart patients. “If you look at the number of admissions for September, it is almost the same as previous year. And, most of the ICU beds are being utilised by cancer and heart patients, both of which specialities tend to perform complex surgeries in older patients or those who are weak after chemotherapy and need intensive care. Our department does about 150 surgeries a month, of which 45 to 50 patients (33%) need ICU care,” said Dr Harit Chaturvedi, chairman, Max Institute of Cancer Care. With fewer ICU beds available, many surgeries have to be deferred. In case of “quaternary surgeries like cancer, heart, neurology etc, the doctors have to be assured that there is an ICU bed available before they can take up the surgeries. If more beds are diverted for Covid-19 treatment, it will hamper the treatment of patients with other diseases and lead to a lot of deaths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-77-non-covid-icus-in-delhi-now-occupied-data-shows/story-KQ8SsP62QkeptMTRq2kDYJ.html
20-10-2020||City||Tonnes of flowers at Kalyan APMC market thrown away for want of buyers||Tonnes of flowers that arrived at Kalyan’s APMC market for sale this Navratri were found thrown away at the market premises on Monday morning. Flower vendors who usually sell tonnes of flowers during Navratri and Diwali festivals claimed that lack of buyers due to the pandemic has affected their business badly this year.Tonnes of marigold and sevanthi flowers were thrown away by vendors due to lack of sale.“This year, there is no business as temples are shut and no celebrations are happening. Even the amount of flowers that arrived at the market was only 50 per cent this time as many flowers were spoiled due to rains. Whatever arrived in the market could not be sold due to very less buyers and had to be dumped,” said a 40-year-old flower vendor from the market who did not wish to be named.In order to sell the flowers, the vendors also reduced the cost of the flowers drastically from ₹80 to ₹20 per kilo.Every year, a day before Dussehra, around 400-500 people visit the market for flowers all the way from Kalyan, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Shahad and other areas. As soon as the Navratri festival begins, the Kalyan APMC market is ready with lot varieties of flowers which is used through the festival and during the rituals for Dussehra festival. “Every year people come to the market to purchase flowers at wholesale rates. However, this time, only retail flower vendors came to buy flowers in fewer quantities,” added the vendor. Satish Fulare, 41, who has been selling flowers at the market since last the 25 years, claimed that more than the vendors, the farmers were worse affected.“I bring one or two trucks comprising around 1,500-2,000 kg of flowers to the market. Half of the flowers had to be thrown away like many other vendors at the market. More than the vendors, the farmers are worse hit due to the lockdown and the rains. People did not visit the market due to lockdown and lack of transportation,” said Fulare, who gets flowers from all over India including Bengaluru, Akola, Coimbatore and Madurai.“The prices of the flowers were reduced from ₹80-₹100 per kg to ₹10-₹20 so that they could be sold. Even then, the sale was poor and we had to throw them away,” added Fulare.Meanwhile, on Monday, at least 25 trucks of flowers arrived at the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tonnes-of-flowers-at-kalyan-apmc-market-thrown-away-for-want-of-buyers/story-Vwlsip8GG4SfLDHuYoqklK.html

The site is barely 100 metres from the boy’s home, said the police.“The body was decomposing and has been sent for an autopsy. We are waiting for the results to come back which shall throw some light on the cause of death,” said Sudhir Kumar, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.Police said prima facie, it seems to be a case of murder, as given the way the body was placed when they found it suggests that someone tried to hide it. However because of the decomposition obvious injury marks, if any, were not immediately discernable, said the police.“Based on the findings of the autopsy, we will add the necessary charges to the FIR. A probe in the matter is underway and necessary action will be taken soon. The body was handed over to the family following autopsy,” said the SHO.The family said they can’t think of anyone who might have wanted to cause harm to the boy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-decomposed-body-of-10-year-old-boy-found-at-construction-site/story-tceCgNgIowAQtBcVMfGyhN.html

20-10-2020||Noida||Amrapali group’s assets being auctioned to raise funds for stuck projects||NOIDA: Six properties of now-defunct Amrapali group will be put on sale via online auction with an aim to raise funds for construction of several stuck housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida.The six assets that will be auctioned include floor area ratio valued at ₹55 crore with capacity to build three new towers in Princely Estate in Sector 76, 12.73 hectares of land worth ₹44 crore in Udaipur, and Amrapali hospital worth ₹21 crore in Greater Noida’s Sector Omega-I. Besides, a pre-cast factory valued at ₹179 crore, ₹140-crore land and a plant of pre-cast worth ₹39 crore -- all in Greater Noida’s Sector Ecotech Extension 6 -- will be auctioned, said R Venkatramani, a senior lawyer who is appointed as court receiver by the Supreme Court for all the stuck projects of Amrapali. The interested buyers can bid online on October 31 this year. Once these assets are auctioned, the money collected will be used for the construction of the flats. “We have good amount of funds available with us and the construction on all projects of Amrapali is in full swing. If these assets are auctioned on October 31, then it will help us in raising more money to be spent on the construction,” said Venkatramani.On July 23 last year, the Supreme Court had appointed Venkatramani as court receiver to control Amrapali’s housing projects and carry out further activities, including registration of ready units, accepting money from buyers, selling unsold apartments and dealing with the central government-owned NBCC Ltd that has been directed to complete the stuck projects.NBCC has to deliver around 30,000 flats, some of which are partially built, while finishing is to be done in most of the cases.In the first tranche, NBCC had, on November 29 last year, invited firms to compete for tenders to the following projects: Centurion Park in Greater Noida Sector Techzone 4; Silicon City-I and Silicon City-II in Noida Sector 76, Zodiac in Noida Sector 120, Sapphire I and II in Noida Sector 45, and Princely Estate in Noida Sector 76. Since then, NBCC has started work on all projects in Noida and Greater Noida.On August 24 this year, NBCC also started the construction work at seceral other projects that include Smart City-Golf Homes, Kingswood, Leisure Park (Phase 1 and 2, and River View), Centurion Park-Terrace Homes, Tropical Garden, Leisure Valley, and Dream Valley. All of these projects have a total of about 16,308 housing units.“There will be no issue at all and all flats will be finished and delivered as per schedule submitted by the NBCC,” said Venkatramani.Earlier, the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) had tried to auction the assets of Amrapali but it failed to do so. Now the Supreme Court allowed state-run Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited (MSTC) to carry out the auction of these assets.“Earlier the rates of all assets needed to be auctioned were escalated as per the market sentiment. Now, the rates are better and we hope that MSTC will be able to sell around 40 assets in a phased manner and raise funds for construction of stuck projects,” said Amit Gupta, legal advisor to Amrapali Centurion Park Homebuyers Group that fought the case in the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amrapali-group-s-assets-being-auctioned-to-raise-funds-for-stuck-projects/story-LNOIaF3OA0Pc1HEMEY9gPK.html
20-10-2020||Noida||Three farmers booked for stubble burning in Jewar||Greater Noida: The police have registered a case against three farmers for allegedly burning crop stubble in their fields in Jewar on Saturday. In his police complaint, Vipin Kumar, who is the lekhpal (local revenue official) of Jewar block, said that he was conducting an inspection when he found incidents of stubble burning at three different locations in Jewar. “Three persons – Amarnath, Tota Ram and Jagdish Prasad – all residents of Jewar Bangar village – had harvested their crops and burnt the stubble in their fields. I had received information from local people and visited the spot. The incident also created pollution in the neighbourhood,” Kumar said in the complaint. Umesh Bahadur, station house officer, Jewar police station, said that based on the complaint, a case has been registered against three persons under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. “The revenue department had spotted the incident and informed police. We conducted primary investigation and found the stubble burning had happened. We also held a meeting with local farmers and sensitized them not to burn stubble as it pollutes environment,” he said. Bahadur also said that an investigating officer has been deputed to further look into the incident, and appropriate action will be taken against the erring farmers based on his report. Vijaypal Baghel, a local environmentalist, said that there is need to sensitize farmers about the harmful effects of stubble burning. “This is bad for the environment as well as bio-fertility. The crop residue should be used as cattle fodder. In rural areas, this is also used to make a hut. Some farmers burn the stubble in order to quickly clear the farm land. Strict enforcement and monitoring will yield good results,” he said. The Uttar Pradesh government has directed the administrations of NCR districts to check stubble burning in their respective areas. On October 14, Devesh Chaturvedi, additional chief secretary, UP government, had issued an order directing the district administrations to buy residue from farmers and use it for cattle fodder in goshalas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-farmers-booked-for-stubble-burning-in-jewar/story-xWYTHO3qEzjpE2YqzNXnlL.html
20-10-2020||City||Air quality stays ‘poor’ in Delhi||New Delhi: Marking slight improvement in the air quality in Delhi, mostly due to meteorological factors, the air quality index (AQI) in the city dropped for the second consecutive day on Monday. The AQI on Monday was 244, compared to 254 on Sunday and 287 on Saturday, according to the daily Central Pollution Control Board bulletin. The air has remained in the ‘poor’ category (AQI more than 200) since October 7.According to Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system the air has not deteriorated into ‘very poor’ category because the wind speeds have remained high. “The predominant surface wind was coming from the western direction of Delhi with speeds up to 12kmph,” the early warning system said. The ministry’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said that there could be a change in surface wind direction by October 21, which is likely to bring calm surface wind conditions leading to low ventilation and deterioration of AQI. Expecting further deterioration in air quality in the coming days, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Monday asked the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments to be ready to close thermal power plants that do not meet the standards laid down in 2015.In two separate letters, EPCA chief Bhure Lal asked the two states to review preparedness for closing thermal power plants and to inform the authority of this as well as steps that will be taken to ensure compliance with necessary shut-down during the peak winter period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-stays-poor-in-delhi/story-vNOmEDyIt0Qoa9s4w0riDM.html
20-10-2020||Noida||Air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad from Sept 15-Oct 15 worse than last year’s||Ghaziabad/Noida: Even as the different agencies have started with pollution abatement measures ahead of the winter season, the figures of past one month from September 15 to October 15 indicate that the three cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida have remained at a higher average air quality index (AQI) of 194, 192 and 175, respectively, as compared to the average figures for the corresponding period last year. According to the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), from September 15 to October 15 last year, the average AQI for Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida stood much lower at 133, 141 and 129, respectively. The officials attribute the rise in air pollution ahead of winter this year to the meteorological conditions and early withdrawal of monsoon. “The average AQI range is higher this year due to early withdrawal of monsoon which came into effect around September 25. The last rainfall activity in the region this year was on September 8. So, there has been lesser dispersal of pollutants this year due to no rain in major part of September. Last year, the monsoon withdrawal was on October 10 with October 4 being the last day that saw 47mm of rainfall,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. “Further, early withdrawal of monsoon this year has also led to early start of stubble burning which has also affected air quality around the start of September. Moreover, the wind speed last year was more in October as compared to 10-12kmph at present. In another 2-3 days, we will have easterly winds coming in but they will have lesser speed. So, chances of accumulation of pollutants are more,” he added. According to official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory – a division of agricultural physics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, there have been 7,640 instances of stubble burning in three states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh during the period from October 1 to October 18. During the same period in 2019 and 2018, the three states registered 3,727 and 4,033 instances of stubble burning, respectively, according to CREAMS’ records. The UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials from Noida said that the various government agencies are working aggressively to control pollution. “The higher side of AQI witnessed this year is primarily resultant of meteorological conditions. Locally, we do not have major source, except increase in number of vehicles. The work for the Delhi-Meerut Expressway is towards the finish and it is also not contributing majorly to the pollution,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB at Noida. The UPPCB officials from Ghaziabad said that the higher ranges of AQI have resulted due to lesser rainfall in September and October. “Last year, there was rainfall activity in months of September and October which led to lowering of pollutants. This year, we have taken up more stringent steps like installation of cameras at construction sites and even asked polluting units to install cameras which will be under control of UPPCB. Apart from this, regular action is being taken against illegally run factories. Different agencies are also taking up pollution abatement measures,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. The UPPCB officials also said that due to the early start of stubble burning this season, they are expecting that concentrated burning on fewer days will rather be spread in form of distributed burning over a longer period of time and will result in lesser deterioration of air quality. Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist, said, “It will be wrong to squarely blame stubble burning for pollution. If the officials expect that stubble burning this year will be spread over a longer period of time and will result in lesser pollution, they must also keep in check the local pollutants which also have a high share in air pollution.”Echoing similar views, Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ association, said, “It would not be correct to state that deterioration in air quality is due to stubble burning which has been a practice prevalent for decades. The vehicle base in NCR has increased tremendously, along with construction activities and instances of burning of solid waste and garbage. Local pollutants also share a major contribution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-from-sept-15-oct-15-worse-than-last-year-s/story-1sRBPnVxPwdSgIouIMGWdK.html
20-10-2020||Noida||Noida’s first shooting academy to offer scholarships to women||Noida: A shooting academy located in Dadri, the district’s first, has planned to offer scholarships to at least 10 women candidates. The academy, started by Lt (retd) Satendra Kumar, 46, a retired navy officer in Dadri, was inaugurated on Saturday by the Noida police commissioner.The academy – Satendra Kumar Shooting Academy LLP – is spread over an acre and is equipped with multiple air pistols, kits, sportswear, etc. “We have developed three shooting ranges – 10, 25 and 50 metre. The campus is environment friendly. We have collaborated with the Noida police for the Mission Shakti programme and are going to offer training to budding women sportspersons at an affordable fee. We will also select 10 aspiring and meritorious women candidates and offer them scholarships,” said Kumar, who is a recipient of the Arjuna award (1998), the Khel Ratna award (2016) and Uttar Pradesh government’s Laxman award (2020).Both men and women can train at the academy, however, scholarships are available only for women. There is no age limit however there are four training groups – youth (below 18 years), junior (18-21 years), open (21-60 years) and veteran (above 60 years), added Kumar, who took voluntary retirement from service in July 2019.Alok Singh, police commissioner, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that budding women shooters recommended by the Noida police will be provided training on a preferential basis. The Noida police commissionerate on Monday tweeted a number – 9364444999 – on which interested candidates can call for information on training at the academy. On Mission Shakti, he said that the initiative is getting a good response from the public.“The programme is a comprehensive effort by the state government, and the local police and administration. This exercise needs the involvement of multiple departments at the field level. The programme comprises four steps - awareness generation, women empowerment, enforcement, and prosecution,” he said. Talking about the LED screen-equipped van that was flagged off on Saturday, he said: “The van visits different places in rural and urban areas and relays information, through which locals connect to officials at the DCP level via video conference and share their issues or grievances,” he said.The commissioner said that the police have also planned to empower women by teaching them unarmed combat. “We will impart self-defence/judo training to women. We will also impart professional training to help them get jobs, in order to empower them. We are figuring out the modalities for this programme so that they can become self dependent,” he said. “We will also provide training to men and sensitise them that it is not manly to harass a woman. They will be sensitised to treat women with respect,” the commissioner told HT. On enforcement, he said that the Anti-Romeo Squads are continuing their drive and are taking action against men for unwanted behaviour. “We have also planned to take action against suspects named in serious offences. We have designated officials to assiduously chase such suspects to ensure early prosecution,” he said.Singh said the Noida police personnel are given short term courses where they refresh their skills in handling weapons. “They are trained to deal with multiple contingencies such as hostage situations, combat, riot, etc. We are also developing a special unit to deal with combat situations. The unit is undergoing training in the district. They will be professionally trained to tackle the toughest of situations. We will share more details once their training is over,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-first-shooting-academy-to-offer-scholarships-to-women/story-BikEvlV14bsFSVAnhvFZVK.html
20-10-2020||Noida||At this Ghaziabad school, students resume classes next to temporary jail||Ghaziabad: At least 250 students of the Shambhu Dayal Inter College in Ghaziabad attended school for the first time in over six months on Monday. However, they were not the only ones there, as the inter college complex now houses a temporary prison facility as well.According to school officials, one block of the campus was taken over by the district administration on June 24 to set up a temporary jail.“The block houses prisoners even now, although it is expected that they will be shifted in a couple of days. We have spoken to the education department as well as the district administration to get the premises vacated, as students have started coming in for classes and more are expected in coming days,” said principal Devendra Singh.The school, located near the MMG District Hospital, has at least 2,567 students enrolled from classes 9 to 12.“As a precautionary measure we have taken up sanitisation as well as deployed all standard operating procedures for prevention against the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Those inmates who had tested positive for the disease were housed here, instead of them being shifted to a regular jail. We are expecting that they are shifted out at the earliest,” he said. He added that about 13 rooms of the school have been occupied for the makeshift facility, which also has police deployment.The police, meanwhile, said that suspects who are arrested in different cases are brought to the temporary jail, where they are tested and lodged.“They are kept at the temporary jail for two-three days and tested. Once they show no symptoms for Covid-19, they are shifted to the Dasna jail. If any of the suspects tests positive, they are shifted to a Covid facility,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). Social activists said the jail should be shifted out immediately as the environment can have a detrimental effect on students’ minds.“It is not advisable to operate a temporary jail from the school premises and it should be shifted out immediately. Police presence and incoming of suspects can leave a bad impression in the mind of students and they should not be exposed to such an environment. In fact, the jail should have been shifted out before classes resumed,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, national president of Rashtriya Sainik Sanstha.Officials of the education department and the district magistrate visited the school on Monday. “About 12-13 inmates are still lodged at the interim prison at the school and we expect that the premises will be vacated by Monday evening. The district magistrate inspected the school on Monday and has given necessary directions for it to be shifted out,” said Ravi Dutt, district inspector of schools.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said the pro-tem facility has a few inmates and poses no issues to students. “However, classes have started and a temporary jail should not be operating from the school premises. Although it is in a different block of the school, I have given directions for it to be shifted. The school premises will be vacated by Monday night or Tuesday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/at-this-ghaziabad-school-students-resume-classes-next-to-temporary-jail/story-arLjpNBrtfZlpvBfl4f6rI.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Odd-even last weapon against pollution: Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said the government will implement the odd-even road rationing scheme to curb vehicular emissions as the “last weapon” in the fight against air pollution in the national Capital. “We have implemented the odd-even scheme several times in Delhi and it will be our last weapon. Odd-even is also a way to reduce vehicular pollution but right now we are completely focussing on this (‘red light on, gaadi off’) campaign. If all other programmes don’t work, then the government will think about implementing the odd-even scheme,” Rai said at an event to launch a campaign to urge motorists to turn off engines of their vehicles while waiting at traffic lights. Delhi’s air quality has consistently remained in the ‘poor’ category since October 7, with the AQI remaining over 200. On Monday, Delhi’s AQI was measured at 244. Experts also pointed out that since public transport is running with only limited capacity in view of restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government should step up other measures to ensure that it doesn’t have to resort to enforce odd-even.Also Read | ‘Disagree with Javadekar’: Kejriwal lists steps to tackle air pollution in short timeBhure Lal, chairperson, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) said that on-ground enforcement for controlling pollution sources will have to be augmented this time so that emergency measures such as bringing about the odd-even plan can be avoided. “This is surely a different kind of situation that we will be facing this time. The aim should be that the enforcement is so strict this year that the air quality does not slip into the emergency levels,” Lal said.Delhi has so far implemented the odd-even scheme thrice in sweeping measures to reduce the city’s record-high air pollution by limiting the number of cars on streets. After being implemented twice in 2016, the scheme was added to the Supreme Court approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) as a measure to be implemented when Delhi’s air quality reached the ‘emergency’ category—PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) are above 300ug/m3 or PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) levels remain 500ug/m3 continuously for 48 hours. Last year, the scheme was enforced between November 4 and November 15. However, researchers and environment experts have been divided on the odd-even scheme’s impact on the pollution levels in the national capital.When the policy was first implemented between January 1 and 15, 2016, a study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, The Energy Research Institute and National Physical Laboratory in Delhi, and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, found that the PM 2.5 levels fell by 4%-6%. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also carried out a study of the two phases in 2016 and concluded that a single factor could not result in substantial reductions in pollution and that an “integrated approach” was needed. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic the government will have to look at newer strategies to fight pollution. “You cannot remove half of a city’s vehicles without giving them an alternative public transport option. The Delhi government had plans for bringing in new buses, but a lot of things have been delayed because of the pandemic. The government will have to look for newer ways to keep the pollution levels down in these circumstances,” she said. All private petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid cars, including those entering the city from other states, are required to be a part of the road rationing drive. Only CNG-fuelled commercial vehicles such as auto-rickshaws, taxis, trucks, buses, tempos and gramin sewas are allowed to ply during the arrangement. Two-wheelers, commercial vehicles, cars driven by women or carrying only women passengers, specially-abled people or school children are exempted from the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odd-even-last-weapon-against-pollution-rai/story-3N6N2QEh9GbmQIx0YbEzVP.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Two dead after inhaling fumes at jewellery factory waste tank in Delhi’s Azadpur||Two cousins who were in the business of separating gold from muck died after inhaling poisonous gases while extracting waste from an underground tank at a jewellery factory in north Delhi’s Azadpur on Sunday evening, police said. Four of their employees, who were helping to pull out the waste that contains gold particles, fell unconscious and had to be hospitalised. The families of the two dead men -- Idris and Salim, both aged 45 -- suspected foul play, saying a lot was at stake -- gold and hard cash as commission to collect the muck from the factory. But police said it was “open and shut case” of death due to asphyxiation while clearing an underground tank.“We arrested the factory owner and a Delhi-based contractor on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and for causing hurt by a rash act,” Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said. Ruling out any conspiracy, the officer said the people who had entered the tank were not provided any safety gear. The factory located in Azadpur along GT Karnal Road is into manufacturing gold and silver chains. Like at many other such units, during the manufacture and cleaning process, gold particles are washed down and collected in a large underground tank. “The water with which the factory workers bath at the end of the day’s work also goes into the same tank, as do chemicals used to clean the gold and silver,” the DCP explained. All the waste material contains gold particles, which are extracted through a tedious process that involves washing the muck again and again and waiting for the gold to settle down before it is collected.. Big jewellery factories often outsource cleaning of these tanks to private players, who are part of a largely unorganised trade, in lieu of some cash or a part of gold extracted from the waste. In this case, the work was outsourced to two 45-year-old cousins -- Idris and Salim -- from Khurja in Uttar Pradesh. “This was the first time my cousins were working for this factory. The deal was to pay 820 grams of gold and R30 lakh cash to the factory in return for the muck and extracting gold out of it,” said Mohammad Arif, brother of Idris. They were working for the last 15 days, he said. HT tried to contact the factory office-bearers for their version of the deal and the allegations but the owners did not permit entry into the building on Monday afternoon. On Sunday morning, Idris and Salim arrived in Delhi in a Tata Scorpio with five full-time and part-time workers. They uses buckets to haul out muck from the 20 feet deep tank with a narrow opening at the top. “We began work at 10am and had collected about 50 large buckets of muck by 4pm. We didn’t need to enter the tank until the last of the muck remained. Since the remaining waste needed to be hauled out manually by entering the tank, we decided to go in,” said Mansoor, 38, a full-time worker who survived despite falling unconscious. Mansoor alleged that the two business partners asked the factory owner, Rajender Soni, and contractor Pramod Dangi, for oxygen cylinders to be able to carry out the work safely but received no such gear. “Finally, Idris lowered me into the tank with the help of a rope. I was inside for barely five minutes when I began to lose unconscious. I managed to alert Idris in time and he hauled me out,” Mansoor said. Mansoor said he fell unconscious after that and didn’t remember much. Another worker also named Salim said he too fell unconscious around the same time even through he did not even enter the tank. Both men said they had been doing this job for several years for a daily salary of R500 -- work or no work -- and for free food and stay that came along with the job. It remained unclear at what time and in what circumstances Idris and his partner Salim, or exactly how many people, entered the tank. But the police received a call at about 6.45pm about some workers falling unconscious. “Idris, Salim and a worker named Islam were pulled out of the tank. Six people were affected by the poisonous gases and they were all rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital. While Idris and Salim died, Islam continues to remain hospitalised. Three others were discharged after treatment,” said another police officer. Relatives of Idris and his cousin Salim said they had never heard of the two men entering the muck before. “Their work involved lakhs of rupees and they didn’t ever need to do this work by themselves. That is why they would take along so many labourers,” said Shoaib Ahmed, brother-in-law of Idris, saying the police should probe the deaths as a murder case. The DCP said the first information report (FIR) was registered on the statement of a surviving worker and there was no allegations of foul play by the complainant. In a slightly similar incident,two men were killed and another hospitalised after they were exposed to poisonous fumes while cleaning a septic tank in south Delhi’s Badarpur on October 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-dead-after-inhaling-fumes-at-jewellery-factory-waste-tank-in-delhi-s-azadpur/story-V2BM3izOB7MQBUz6ZBB6cP.html
20-10-2020||Chandigarh||Door-to-door garbage collectors in Chandigarh threaten stir from October 23||Even as the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has spent ₹30 crore to buy 390 more garbage collection trucks, it is still unlikely to meet the October-31 deadline set by a green tribunal panel to start segregated door-to-door garbage collection in all wards. The MC faces opposition from garbage collectors, who have threatened to go on a strike from October 23 and said they would not allow plying of new vehicles. The opposition is against the MC taking over the garbage collection through the trucks, which is being currently undertaken by the collectors in their private carts. “We will launch a stir and stop both door-to-door garbage collection as well as sanitation works from October 23 unless our demands are met,” said Krishan Kumar Chadda, president, Safai Karamchari Union. MC, which currently has 100 vehicles, will receive 200 more vehicles this month, but still would not be able to cover all the wards for collecting segregated solid waste. A panel setup by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had recently directed the MC to fully implement the segregation of the door-to-door collected solid waste by October 31. It had also directed the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) to submit a compliance report on the issue. NGT had early this year directed the civic body to ensure 100% waste segregation in the city by June 2020. However, due to Covid-19 crisis , it couldn’t be implemented. In October last year, the MC had made waste segregation mandatory in the city. But, segregation didn’t take off with both garbage collectors and residents failing to comply with the rules. Its earlier attempts at the segregated waste collection in 2017 and 2018 had also failed. Notably, Chandigarh even couldn’t grab a spot on the list of top-10 cities in the Swachh Survekshan 2020 rankings mainly because of poor waste management. Why opposition “The MC has not signed a memorandum of understanding with us as promised. We have been demanding that MC should allow us to collect the user charges from people as well as earn from the sale of the reusable items in the collected solid waste. But, even though the MC general house has passed a resolution to this effect, the corporation is yet to commit it in writing,” said Om Prakash Saini, president of the Chandigarh Door to Door Garbage Collectors’ Society. MC is insisting on collecting the user charges through residents’ water bills or property tax bills. “Instead, it is stating that it will collect user charges and also pay partially from the earnings of the reusable solid waste items. This will adversely impact our income,” he added. The door-to-door garbage collectors will be joined by the Safai Karamchari Union in the indefinite strike. “The MC should stick to its promises and allow the garbage collectors to continue with their work as they are currently doing. These new vehicles can’t even enter the narrow and congested lanes of the villages,” said Krishan Kumar Chadda. Meanwhile, MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We are acting as per the resolution passed by the general house. The resolution was taken up only after the collectors reached an agreement with the MC on the issue. The MC will also pay the collectors both from the user charges and from the earnings of reusable solid waste items. If there are still any differences, the MC committee on sanitation will take up the matter with the collectors.” Former mayor and current chairman of MC Sanitation Committee, Rajesh Kalia, said, “We have already accepted their demands. Nobody will lose their earnings. We only want to organise and streamline the entire garbage collection process in a better way. We will be meeting them and clarifying all the issues. It is only few political motivated people who are creating such hurdles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/door-to-door-garbage-collectors-threaten-stir-from-oct-23/story-LJejNEWh9xSYwDb6Hj4ZgP.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Confessions not in public domain cannot be published: Delhi high court||The Delhi high court on Monday said that confessional/disclosure statements of an accused which are not in public domain cannot be accessed and published while hearing a plea filed by Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, one of the persons arrested in conspiracy of the Delhi riots case, who had said that his disclosure statement was published by Zee News. The court said that the news channel had made a ‘mistake.’Justice Vibhu Bakhru gave another chance to the channel to file its affidavit disclosing the source of the statement that was broadcast on the channel.“Prima facie, we find that a mistake has been made by you. Now in order to redress the people who are aggrieved, think of an appropriate redressal,” the judge said.The court said that it does not think that a journalist has a right to take out the case diary and publish it and that the news report cannot be based on documents which are not in the public domain. “These are documents which you cannot take out and publish. There is no doubt about it,” the judge said.In his petition, Tanha had alleged that police officials leaked his disclosure statement, recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media.During the hearing, the judge also declined an application by the channel, represented advocate Vijay Aggarwal, seeking to file the name of the source in a sealed cover.Aggarwal requested the court to allow him to submit the affidavit in a sealed cover stating that it is for the comfort of the journalist who has reported the matter as she had asked not to disclose the name of her source as it would put him at risk. To this the judge said, “You are crossing the line here. There is no material to show this. Police has conducted high level enquiry and is taking action against its officials”.Tanha’s counsel Siddharth Aggarwal told the court that such a thing would not have been possible without the contact between the journalist and the prosecution. He said that his client had not even signed the disclosure statement.While the police has claimed that the disclosure statement was not leaked by any of its officials, the counsel for the news channel said the journalist has requested that he should not be pressed to disclose his source of information in view of the fact that the truthfulness of Tanha’s confessional statement has not been disputed by him in the petition.The police had said that even they are aggrieved with the news reportHT contacted Sudhir Chaudhary, editor-in- chief of Zee news, for his response on the court’s observations but he was not available for a comment despite repeated calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-says-confessions-not-in-public-domain-cannot-be-published/story-JYdYDUYBSzwZ42cOJOKZrO.html
20-10-2020||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar calls Eknath Khadse most capable Opposition leader; rules out induction of turncoats in Maharashtra||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Monday hinted that senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse may join the party. Commenting on the reports about Khadse’s entry to the NCP that have been doing rounds for several weeks, Pawar said Khadse’s capability and work cannot be overlooked, but the political decision has to be taken by him. He also praised the senior BJP leader saying that Khadse has been the most effective leader of opposition he had seen in over two decades.“Khadse saheb was the leader of opposition in the state. He was also the finance minister. We have seen his contribution in the growth of the party (BJP), though he was abusive to us. We have seen his aggressiveness, capability, work which cannot be overlooked. However, he has all the right to make a political decision,” Pawar said in a response to a question by media persons. “It appears today that he has been the most effective leader of opposition of Maharashtra in the last 20-25 years. Unfortunately, according to him, work and sacrifice wasn’t recognised. In such a scenario, a person can think of moving out to a place where he will get recognition,” the veteran leader said, giving an indication of a possible switch over.Seeking political rehabilitation, Khadse is in talks with senior NCP leaders. His close aides say he is likely to join the party and is expected to be nominated to the state legislative council.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress is yet to take a decision on recommending names to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for appointing 12 members to the upper house of state legislature.The former revenue minister was sidelined by the BJP after he was made to resign from the post following allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal near Pune in 2016. He has been upset with the party since then. He was also denied an election ticket in the state Assembly elections last year. He has been blaming former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for sidelining him in the party. Pawar also clarified that the NCP has decided not to re-induct turncoats from Osmanabad. His remark seems to be directed at former MP and Pawar’s erstwhile close confidante, Padmasinh Patil and his son Rana Jagjitsinh Patil. Both of them were ministers in different Congress-NCP governments, but defected to the BJP in the run to the Assembly elections last year. Patil was a long-time close aide of Pawar and had even handled responsibility as state president of Pawar-led Indian Congress (Socialist) before the outfit was merged back with the Congress. Padmasinh Patil’s sister Sunetra is also the wife of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.“A deliberation is going on over the re-induction of those who left the party. We are considering it and have taken some decisions as well. For instance, in Osmanabad there will be no entry for those who have left the party. Be happy wherever you are,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-most-capable-oppn-leader-says-sharad-pawar-rules-out-induction-of-turncoats-from-maharashtra-s-osmanabad/story-AECBbrq5WySwiqaCe6dt7M.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||Muted Durga Puja in Delhi this year as Covid-19 pandemic hits festivities||No thematic pandals and majestic idols, fairs or cultural performances. Durga Puja in Delhi this year will mostly be a private affair, bereft of all the grandiose as a majority of puja committees have either cancelled the celebrations or shifted their programmes online to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.In Chittaranjan Park (CR Park) -- the heart of Durga Puja celebrations in Delhi that attract tens of thousands of visitors every year -- all the major committees have decided not to allow the entry of people and limit physical darshan to members only.Durga Puja this year will be celebrated from October 22 to 25. Other major committees from across the city such as Aram Bagh, Kashmere Gate (Delhi Durga Puja Samiti), Matri Mandir Samity in Safdarjung Enclave and Milani cultural and welfare association in Mayur Vihar Phase 1 have followed suit, asking devotees to join the rituals online on their respective social media handles.Every year during the festival, lakhs of people would throng CR Park and its adjoining areas and other pujas across the city for what is called “pandal hopping”. Complete with cultural performances, competitions and food stalls, the pujas have always been crowd-pullers every year. In CR Park, parking used to be a big hassle and would result in traffic jams up to Nehru Place and beyond.Bhog, the ceremonial food offerings first given to Goddess Durga and then distributed among devotees, will also be home-delivered, they said. Everything from Pushpanjali (the first community prayer of the day) to the evening Aarti and donations has been shifted online. Committees are even posting texts of all mantras for devotees to chant along as the puja is performed by the priests.Greater Kailash (GK) MLA and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said the decision was taken in a meeting held on Monday morning with various puja committees, the area’s sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), police personnel, and representatives of the south Delhi municipal corporation (SDMC).To ensure citizens do not crowd outside the temple, Delhi Police will place barricades.Also Read | Covid-19: Thousands flout social distancing norms to throng Durga puja pandals in Kolkata“Around 12 Durga Puja committees from Chittaranjan Park, GK2, GK1, Alaknanda and Kalkaji attended the meeting. It has been unanimously decided that Durga Puja celebrations will be suspended this year due to the pandemic. Most of the population of CR Park and members of puja committees are senior citizens and it is important that they remain indoors and avoid contact with unknown people in pandals,” Bharadwaj said.The CR Park Kali Mandir Society, which organises one of the biggest Durga Puja festivals in Delhi, attracting around 250,000 visitors every season, has tied up with a DTH service provider and a local cable operator so that devotees can have a darshan of the Durga idol from their houses.“Worshippers will not be allowed to physically join the puja at the mandap. Pushpanjali will be offered online and the devotees will be required to be ready with flowers and other items in their homes,” said Prodip Ganguly, joint secretary of the society. ““Only for religious reasons, a small Kalash Puja/ Ghat Puja will be attended by 10-15 committee members. This will ensure the continuity of puja by these samitis. I have requested the district administration and local police to help the puja committees in stopping outsiders entering these areas,” Bharadwaj added.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said, all precautions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic are being taken and arrangements are being made at CR Park in view of the DDMA Guidelines.“Security arrangements, including anti-terror arrangements with meetings with stakeholders, and crowd-control measures, including those for social distancing, have been put in place,” the DCP said.The Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella body of 38 Durga Puja committees in East Delhi, said 14 committees in the area got permission from the district magistrate on Monday to celebrate with the idol but without fanfare.“Of the 38 puja committees in east Delhi, 14 will have idols but no outsiders will be allowed. It will be restricted to only 10 members per committee. The other 15 committees will do Ghot (kalash) puja either at the homes of one the members or at the usual venue. The remaining nine committees are not organising any form of puja this year,” said Mrinal Kanti Biswas from the Samiti.Biswas, who is also general secretary of Mayur Vihar Phase 1’s Milani Puja committee, said they organised two metal tanks for the immersion of idols in East Delhi. “One metal tank will be at the Mayur Vihar phase 1 Kali Bari and the other at Purbasha Kali Bari IP Extension. The height of the idols this time have been restricted to 4-5 feet only for easier immersion,” he said.The Aram Bagh Puja Samiti has shifted their puja to the Narayan Satsang Mandir, Rani Jhansi Complex (Delhi) from October 21 to 26. Their idol is three-and-a-half feet tall compared to the previous year’s 16-feet idol.Swapan Ganguly, general secretary of New Delhi Kali Bari, one of the oldest Durga Puja organisers in the city, said for the first time, they will not offer bhog on site. “In a first, we will home-deliver Durga Ma’s blessings to whoever gives donation for the bhog. Other visitors who insist on getting bhog will have to make a nominal payment this time and will be given the prasad in packed boxes as they exit from the pandal,” he said.Ganguly said as per the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) orders, they have planned separate entry and exits with sanitising tunnels for visitors. “We are creating a serpentine route for visitors coming to see the Durga idol. There will be no stage performances or food stalls this time,” he said.In an order issued on October 11, DDMA allowed Navratri and Durga Puja functions to be organised in the national Capital with limited attendees but prohibited all kinds of fairs (melas), food stalls, exhibitions, rallies and processions till October 31.The Delhi government said teams have been formed by the revenue department to inspect all sites for which applications have been received. “The exact number of approved applications for Durga Pujas in Delhi is unknown as data from all the 11 districts is yet to be compiled,” said a senior official in the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/muted-durga-puja-in-delhi-this-year-as-pandemic-hits-festivities/story-BGWILYOOW2KHzrtuMCvmiK.html
20-10-2020||City||Leaders survey flood-hit Maharashtra, no word on relief||Even as almost all key political leaders, including the chief minister, toured the flood-affected central and western Maharashtra on Monday, the farmers did not get any firm assurance of compensation for the massive crop losses they suffered due to the retreating monsoon last week. Farmers from more than 10 districts of central and western Maharashtra have sustained heavy losses to harvest-ready crops on more than 10 lakh hectares. Crops of soyabean, sugarcane, cotton and pulses like moong, urad have suffered major losses. Solapur, Sangli and Satara in western Maharashtra, and Osmanabad, Latur and Beed in central Maharashtra saw maximum rainfall last week. More than 60 people died due to downpour in these districts last week. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, along with few ministers, visited a few villages in Solapur and held a meeting with the officials from the district administration. He said financial assistance would be announced once the district administration completes the spot assessment of losses. He said the government would seek Centre’s help for the relief package. The CM said his tour was more to give assurance to the farmers that his government was with them. “The crisis is not over yet, as there is forecast of incessant rainfall from the retreating monsoon over the next few days. Our priority should be to avoid human losses during these challenging times. We will do everything for the farmers and their welfare,” Thackeray said in a press conference held at Solapur. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured them financial assistance. “There is nothing wrong in seeking Central government’s assistance in such a natural calamity. It is the government elected by the people and it is the duty of the Centre to assist us. PM Modiji is positive about it,” he added. Thackeray will visit flood affected villages in Osmanabad district on Wednesday. Like Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, leaders of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Pravin Darekar, ministers from state government, MPs from ruling and opposition parties visited rain-affected areas. Pawar said that the state government has no option but to borrow to help the farmers. Fadnavis said the state government has the borrowing limit of ₹1.20 lakh crore, out of which only ₹50,000 crore has been borrowed and it is still entitled to raise loans. “As a ruling partner in BJP-led state government, Thackeray had demanded for relief of ₹25,000 a hectare for crop losses due to unseasonal rain. Why is he not giving the same amount to the farmers now,” he asked. War of words During their tours, CM Thackeray and Oppn leader Fadnavis exchanged political remarks against each other. Fadnavis, while beginning his three-day tour, said the state government should show courage by giving relief to farmers instead of pointing fingers at the Centre. He said that while in power, he had announced financial aid of ₹10,000 crore to farmers hit by unseasonal rain last year. He taunted the CM, congratulating him for venturing out of the house for the first time in six months. He added the CM was visiting the areas just because he announced his three-day tour. Hitting back, Thackeray said if Fadnavis feels that he toured flood-affected people because of him, he should visit Delhi, so that PM Narendra Modi will come out of his office. Thackeray also advised the Oppn leader to help the government get financial aid from the Centre. He said if the Centre had paid the state’s dues on time, they would not have had to seek Central aid. Fadnavis termed Thackeray’s remarks immature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leaders-survey-flood-hit-maharashtra-no-word-on-relief/story-ZgmZmx6TDutwIRJxFtKSbJ.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||New ladders will help Delhi fire dept cut response time||The Delhi Fire Services (DFS) has inducted smaller fire engines with hydraulic ladders as part of an effort to improve operational capabilities in handling fires in buildings shorter than 15 metres --- which according to the DFS data comprise most the spots where they are called for rescue missions. Officials said the new machines, which have been designed in collaboration with the DFS, are not only cheaper but can also be deployed in shorter time than the bigger, imported skylifts which can reach up to a height of 50 metres. Called ‘mini aerial hydraulic platforms’, the DFS has inducted four of these machines. “The new machines will bring down the response time and help save lives and property,” said DFS chief Atul Garg.He explained that manoeuvring and deploying the current skylifts prove difficult in congested spaces as it needs at least a space of 20 feet to deploy. In cases of fire incidents in multi-storey buildings, the new machines will provide better response time as they are as small a normal fire tender and can easily be deployed in areas where is no space to use bulky machines. Fire department statistics show that it received 13,433 fire and rescue related calls between April 1 and October 18 this year – nearly 67 calls every day. Of them nearly 25 calls made daily were related to seeking assistance of firemen for rescuing birds and animals. A majority of the remaining calls were related to fire in factories, godowns, and buildings in unauthorised colonies – all having heights between 15 and 18 metres. “Except that the imported aerial platform is the only available option for tackling fire and rescue operations in high-rise buildings, the mini aerial platforms have similar features. It’s smaller in size, cost effective, time saving and more helpful in situations where fire fighting and rescue operations are to be carried out in congested neighbourhoods,” said a senior DFS official. “We apprised the concerned officials in the Delhi government about the situations and circumstances and floated the idea of procuring locally designed and manufactured aerial hydraulic platform. The idea for such vehicle came from the vehicles that the electricity department uses for maintenance of street lights. After the government’s approval, we designed a mini aerial platform and got it manufactured from the vendor,” said Garg. “We have inducted four mini platforms in our fleet and they have being used on trial basis. So far, their response and feedback from our fire fighters are positive and encouraging,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-ladders-will-help-delhi-fire-dept-cut-response-time/story-tUnxFcqXvDaB0mFNO9CzkO.html
20-10-2020||Delhi||HC poser to Delhi govt over Amanatullah Khan’s bid for waqf board chair||The Delhi high court on Monday asked the Delhi government how MLA Amanatullah Khan could be appointed as chairperson of the Delhi Waqf Board when a special audit initiated to look into allegations of irregularities against him is pending.A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad posed the query to the Delhi government during the hearing of a plea, seeking quashing of a notification which called for a meeting of the elected waqf board members on Monday evening to elect one of them, including Amanatullah, as the chairperson.“Issue is whether a person facing serious allegations of irregularities should be allowed to be made chairperson of the board when the Delhi government has ordered a special audit regarding allegations against him. Why should he be allowed to be part of the system when there are serious allegations against him,” the bench asked.The Delhi government had last month ordered a special audit into alleged irregularities by Amanatullah Khan during his tenure as Delhi Waqf Board chairperson during March 2016 and March 2020Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Delhi government, informed the court that the board has nothing to do with the special audit and the findings would be placed directly before the government. The bench listed the matter for hearing on November 9 after Jain said the meeting of the board to elect a chairperson would be deferred till November 19. The court was hearing a plea filed by Mohd Iqbal Khan.The bench then asked whether Khan intends to contest for the post of chairperson.Advocate KC Mittal, appearing for Khan, said that under section 16 of the Waqf Board Act, if any member who incurs disqualification, he cannot be elected as a member or chairperson. As far as his client is concerned, he has not been disqualified at any instance. The section is very clear and specific that unless someone is convicted or charged of corruption or moral turpitude, there is no bar from him being elected again as chairman, Mittal said.The court also asked the ASG to place before it, on the next date, the rules and judgments which permit a third party to challenge waqf board elections before a tribunal set up for the purpose.The petitioner, who claims to be a social worker, said the notification calling for a meeting of the board members on October 19 was issued on October 7 and therefore, he did not have the time to move a representation to the concerned authority. He has alleged in his petition that there are also several criminal cases against the MLA. Khan has in the past accused Delhi police of filing false cases against him and called the police a political conspiracy. The waqf board is the custodian of over 2,000 properties in Delhi such as mosques, graveyards, schools, residential buildings and shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-poser-to-delhi-govt-over-amanatullah-khan-s-bid-for-waqf-board-chair/story-7TNeX3xGWF0bvvwKneu1VI.html
20-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body’s standing committee members challenge 674-item agenda for October 21 meeting||A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed before the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday, challenging the agenda of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC)standing committee meeting scheduled for October 21. The PIL has been filed by advocate Makarand Narvekar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of the standing committee, and Prabhakar Shinde, group leader of the BJP in the BMC.The PIL challenges the 674 items placed for approval by way of video conferencing in a single meeting day. It contended that it is not possible to deliberate and pass so many resolutions in a single day, and it seemed like the corporation intended to pass all resolutions without any discussion. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni allowed the PIL to be heard on October 20 for urgent reliefs. According to the PIL filed by advocate Jeet Gandhi on behalf of Narvekar and Shinde, on October 16, BMC issued the agenda of the standing committee meeting to be held on October 21. As per the agenda, the meeting would be held for the first time since March 31. Due to the pandemic situation, it would take place through video conferencing. A total of 674 items had been placed for discussion and approval by members of the committee for the meeting. The PIL further stated that in the history of the BMC, the standing committee has never passed so many resolutions in a single day. According to the petition, the respondents — the BMC along with chairman of the standing committee Yashwant Jadhav, its municipal secretary Sangeeta Shinde, BMC commissioner IS Chahal and the state government — have clubbed several items on the agenda for one meeting, and are expecting to pass them together, without allowing deliberation. Narvekar and Shinde have contended that the arbitrary decision of the respondents to have 674 items for deliberation on a single day will cause grave harm to citizens of Mumbai, and should not be voted on without any deliberations. The PIL further stated that the agenda runs into thousands of pages, and it extremely difficult to go through the information in three days. The petitioners stated that there are already 80 pending agenda items of the standing committee meeting dated May 15, 2020, which was scheduled but not held owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Pointing out that elections for the post of chairman of 27 committees were held physically on October 10, the PIL suggested that the committee meeting also be held physically and that the items on the agenda be reduced so that there can be fruitful discussions on each issue. Additionally, BJP has alleged an error in the results of the ward committee chairman elections. Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and standing committee member, said, “We have also approached the HC, challenging Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar’s decision to name Shiv Sena’s candidate as the winner of the ward committee elections held on Friday by declaring one vote of the BJP as invalid. The matter is not listed yet.”The BJP had alleged that Pednekar declared Shiv Sena’s Deepmala Badhe as the winner for the chairman post in the ward committee elections for S and T wards by wrongly declaring one vote of contesting BJP corporator Jagruti Patil as invalid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-standing-committee-members-challenge-674-item-agenda-for-october-21-meeting/story-dGgdmDRpf6hDL5a4djdvgP.html
20-10-2020||Mumbai||With onion supply in Maharashtra dwindling, imports from Iran arrive at Vashi APMC market||Onions imported from Iran have arrived at the wholesale APMC market in Vashi on Monday. With the onion prices rising in the region due to shortage of onions from Maharashtra, the imported onions, which are cheaper, are being seen as alternative by traders. Iranian onions were sold for ₹55 to ₹60 per kg, while those from various regions of the state are selling for ₹60 to ₹70 per kg in the wholesale market. Ankush Gaikar, an onion trader, said, “With the onion stock dipping in local markets and prices rising, traders are increasingly importing onions. Around 600 tonnes of onion has arrived recently at Mumbai port of which 25 tonnes arrived in APMC market on Monday. The onions are of good quality and are cheaper than those available from local sources.” Ganesh Patil, another trader, said, “The number of vehicles bringing in onions daily has reduced. Today, 94 vehicles arrived against the usual of around 125 vehicles. Recent rains have damaged a lot of crop, and that is affecting supplies. Arrival of new crop is expected to be on the lower side for the next two months. This is where the imported onions will help cover the shortage. Onion is presently being imported from Iran, Egypt and Turkey.” Anil Pandey, a retailer from Mumbai, said the imported onions seem to be of good quality but added that it is the consumer who will decide if they prefer it over the Indian onion. He said, “Indians have a liking for a particular taste of onions, and the imported onions often do not match it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-onion-supply-in-maharashtra-dwindling-onions-imported-from-iran-in-vashi-apmc-market/story-mDSEOBKuVLejRqtDZ09UEP.html
20-10-2020||Pune||On visit to flood-affected areas, Thackeray says financial aid after assessment; farmers unhappy with his visit||Daund/Akkalkot: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said he will announce financial assistance to farmers in next few days once the ground level assessment by administration is complete. Thackeray, who visited flood-affected parts of Solapur district, asked farmers to stay alert in view of India Meteorological Department’s prediction of heavy to very heavy rainfall in parts of state in next three days. “I will not make any announcement about the financial aid today. The Panchanamas are on and once it is complete, government will make an announcement. The danger of heavy rainfall in the state still persists as IMD has forecast of heavy rain in next two-three days. Therefore, I would like to urge everyone to stay cautious,” Thackeray said while addressing press conference. He was accompanied by state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and other ministers in the Mahavikas Aghadi government. Thackeray also handed over cheques of financial aid to the relatives of those who died in the rain fury in Solapur district. Farmers and their representatives, however, expressed disappointment over “no announcement” about aid by CM as they fear the process to complete assessment may take days. Gajanan Gunaware, sarpanch, Swami Chincholi village in Daund taluka which is also affected the most, said, “Farmers had taken loans for farming and this was the season to get the benefit out of the crops, but floods washed away everything. The state government should immediately waive off farm loans. Political party leaders, including the CM, will just visit, say a few words and go away. We have to survive here for years and need a permanent solution to this flood situation.” Earlier in the day, Thackeray visited Sangvi Khurd village in Akkalkot tehsil of Solapur district to assess loss to crops and property. The farmers in the village expressed disappointment as the chief minister has decided to take review of loss to crop from the bridge on Bhori river instead of visiting fields. Asha Dattatray Awate, president of village Mahila Bachat Group said, “The entire village has suffered due to floods and we were hoping to talk to CM and tell him our problems. But the police didn’t allow us to talk to him. We repeatedly requested them to allow us only for 2 minutes, but none of them listened to us. Most families in the village have suffered due to heavy rains and we are left with no food grain and money. The only option for us is to commit suicide.” Heavy rains last week destroyed crops on over 1 lakh hectares while 48 persons lost their lives in Marathwada, Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions. Following the rain fury, Thackeray had come under criticism of not stepping out of Matoshree, his residence. Another villager Shivaji Pandurang Machale said, “Thackeray came with full police bandobast and hundreds of political party leaders and their workers. He just stopped on the Bori River bridge, spoke to some of the villagers on the other side of the bridge where the damage is nominal and left. The maximum damage of houses and farms is on the other side, more than 115 houses are completely damaged and around 100 acres with standing crop are washed away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-visit-to-flood-affected-areas-thackeray-says-financial-aid-after-assessment-farmers-unhappy-with-his-visit/story-B2Q9VWFdwykSx7CTB3IfPO.html

We can declare that the case has been solved. We have found the body and a DNA test will be conducted,” said commissioner Gupta. A case under Section 365 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Shivajinagar police station on October 2 after More’s brother Prashant More reported him missing. “Advocate Shendage was involved in a case against a land department official that was registered based on advocate More’s complaint to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in 2018. Arrests were also made in that case. We had asked for a speedy investigation. Many of his friends and colleagues had also gone to the police station and submitted their suggestions,” said Satish Mulik, president, Pune Bar Association.

20-10-2020||Pune||Police bust multiple illicit alcohol operations in rural Pune||The Pune rural police, on Monday, claimed to have found two illicit alcohol breweries in Jejuri village, Purandar. At one site, run by Sandeep Kej Ratod, 20 litres of alcohol in plastic cans was found at 6:30pm on Sunday; while at a second operation run by one Kacchu Deepak Rathod, 15 litres of illicit alcohol was found, along with equipment used to brew the same.

A farmland owner had set-up a tin-shed on his farm in Akharvasti, Tulapur village and was brewing illegal alcohol. Ingredients worth Rs 61,100 were seized. The accused, however, ran away after hearing the police arrive in the field. A case under Sections 65(c) and 83 of Maharashtra Prohibition Act has been registered at Lonikand police station. A similar raid was conducted in Parwadi, Baramati, on Sunday afternoon. The police seized 17 bottles worth Rs 884 from a tin shed and arrested Swapnil Sanjay Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-bust-multiple-illicit-alcohol-operations-in-rural-pune/story-18mNNCFCpN4Y6wnDA9gJlL.html

20-10-2020||Pune||Pan-India pre-monsoon season 2020 recorded 27.58 degrees Celsius, the coolest since 1997||The pan-India average temperature during the pre-monsoon season for 2020 was 27.58 degrees Celsius, an analysis of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, data, revealed on Monday. The analysis was undertaken by Vineet Kumar, a research fellow at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune. A tweet from Kumar read: “All India average temperature during the pre-monsoon season of the year 2020 was 27.58 C, making it the coolest pre-monsoon season after 1997”. Kumar’s main area of research is cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. His study is based on the weather conditions released by IMD. According to IMD, the pre-monsoon period is between March 1 and May 31, monsoon (June 1 to September 30), post-monsoon (October 1 to December 31), and winter (January 1 to February 28/9). Anupam Kashyapi, director, IMD, commenting on the pre-monsoon drop in temperature, said, “Cyclonic storms were more in the March to May period, with frequent Western disturbances which lowered the average temperature over north and central India. Severe cyclonic storms too were partially seen over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, reducing the average temperature.” The IMD report also states that rainfall was almost double the normal in central India and north India. Central India recorded 76.5mm of rain that is 204% of its normal rainfall. This is the highest rainfall since 2001 for central India. Similarly, in north India, rainfall was significantly above normal. Northwest India recorded 149.4 mm, or 131% of its normal rainfall. The report also stated that rainfall received in the country as a whole is 158.5 mm. IMD forecasts light to moderate rains in next 48 hours The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast of heavy rains for two consecutive days threw the city’s life out of gear with incidents of waterlogging and traffic jams on Sunday and Monday. According to IMD, the city recorded an average 32.6 mm rainfall during the past 24 hours at 5.50 pm on Monday. The department has forecast light to moderate rainfall with thunder activity, including lightning, during the next 48 hours. IMD weather section head Anupam Kashyapi said, “As monsoon takes it exit, isolated heavy rain is expected over most parts of Maharashtra, except Vidarbha, during the next three days and rainfall will intensify on October 20.” Heavy rainfall was recorded at Panhala (437mm), Indapur (246mm), Baramati (235mm), Mahabaleshwar (204mm), Pandharpur (282mm) and Paithan (80mm) last week. The exit of South West Monsoon season has been stalled due to consecutive weather conditions existing over central area of India during past ten days.

20-10-2020||Pune||Fadnavis, Thackeray engage in war of words over who will assist farmers between Centre and state||Pune: The tour of flood-affected parts of Maharashtra undertaken by various political parties turned into a political slugfest on Monday as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis engaged in a war of words over who will assist farmers between Centre and state. During his visit to flood-affected areas, leader of opposition Fadnavis said that while the Centre will help farmers in Maharashtra, the state government cannot escape its responsibility. “It is the state government’s primary responsibility to assist farmers. However, what we see today is a growing tendency of this state government to pass on every responsibility to the Centre,” said Fadnavis on NCP president Sharad Pawar’s remarks. Pawar on Sunday said that the Union government should help the flood-affected farmers as the state has limitations. Pawar also said he will be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the next 10 days. The NCP chief also wants the state government to explore possibility of borrowing money to offer financial aid to farmers affected by rains on immediate basis. Later in the afternoon, responding to Fadnavis’ accusation that the state government is passing on its responsibility to the Centre, Thackeray said that if the Centre gives dues to the state on time, there will not be a need to ask for Delhi’s help. “I do not want to bring in politics here. However, if the Centre gives our dues on time, there will not be a need for asking anything from the Centre,” said Thackeray. On being asked why the Maharashtra government is seeking help from the Centre instead of coming forward on its own, Thackeray countered: there is nothing wrong in doing this. “What is wrong in asking for help from the Centre? After all, the Central government is of the entire country,” said the chief minister, while expressing confidence about Prime Minister Modi extending help to the state saying during his phone call, Modi had assured assistance to Maharashtra. Modi on Friday called up Thackeray and assured him help as the damage to crop and lives in Maharashtra is huge due to recent rains. The heavy rains and floods have claimed at least 48 lives in Maharashtra’s Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions last week while crops on lakhs of hectares have been damaged extensively, leading to farmers demanding immediate relief. At many places in Pune and Solapur districts, farmers have complained that despite four days, the administration has not started assessment of cross damage, as a result of which there is delay in help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fadnavis-thackeray-engage-in-war-of-words-over-who-will-assist-farmers-between-centre-and-state/story-7JdYqQqZkKDNGcy5OjRBgI.html
20-10-2020||Mumbai||New freshwater fish discovered from western ghats in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district||Researchers have discovered a new sub-species of the Schistura – a freshwater loach –from the Sahyadris (western ghats) in Maharashtra. The Schistura are tiny and colourful fish species which inhabit streams and water that is rich in oxygen. Species that spend most of their life in either freshwater inland areas or brackish estuaries are known as freshwater fish species. The findings by Jayasimhan Praveenraj from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-Central Island Agricultural Research Institute, Port Blair; Maharashtra chief minister’s son Tejas Thackeray from the Thackeray Wildlife Foundation, Mumbai; and fish enthusiast and underwater photographer Shankar Balasubramanian were published the peer reviewed journal Aqua International Journal of Ichthyology recently. Praveenraj said Thackeray had found this tiny loach in 2012. The same loach was collected for the second time by Thackeray and Balasubramanian in 2017. The fish was named as ‘Schistura hiranyakeshi’ after the river Hiranyakeshi which originates in the Sindhudurg district. “As we collected the specimens from 2017, we found that the fish did not have any official scientific name, and hence we worked on it for providing an official description. We compared our newly-found loach with other species of Schistura from the Indian subcontinent and confirmed it to be new. Hiranykeshi in Sanskrit means ‘golden hair’ which also symbolises the golden yellow fin colour on the fish. This is one of the prettiest loaches ever discovered from India,” said Praveenraj. Endemic to its type locality, the Schistura hiranyakeshi has a very limited distribution and appears to be rare and restricted only to the upper streams and ponds of the ancient Shiva temple in Sindhudurg district at Amboli, a recognised hotspot for multiple discoveries. According to studies, the species has a golden-beige body colour with a crimson sheen and golden yellow bars on their elongated body along with a unique colour pattern. They are around 37.8mm long. “There are 64 species of Schistura in India, with most of them described from the Northeast region, while only 14 were described from peninsular India,” said Praveenraj. Experts said that it was a significant discovery. “The northern parts of the western ghats, including parts of Goa and Maharashtra, are poorly explored as compared to their southern counterparts in Karnataka and Kerala, where major studies have been focussed. There have always been speculations that the northern western ghats’ freshwater system has rich biodiversity. Now, this is an evidence to show the presence of strikingly beautiful species that have previously escaped the eyes of researchers,” said Rajeev Raghavan, assistant professor at Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies, and the South Asia coordinator of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Freshwater Fish Specialist Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/new-freshwater-fish-discovered-from-western-ghats-in-maharashtra-s-sindhudurg-district/story-8LNQx506ylGFaUr3yh7eRJ.html
20-10-2020||World||Global youth losing faith in democracy: Cambridge study||Faith and satisfaction in democracy is in the steepest decline among 18 to 34-year olds in almost every global region, a new Cambridge University study says, adding that the young are most positive under left or right populist leaders.The study from the Centre for the Future of Democracy released on Tuesday is based on data of nearly 5 million respondents in over 160 countries – except India and Turkey – between 1973 and 2020. It also looked at differences in perceptions of democracy between four sets of generations.The four sets are: ‘Millennials’: those coming of age in the 21st century, born between 1981 and 1996; ‘Generation X’: who came of age in the 1990s, born between 1965 and 1980; ‘Baby boomers’ or ‘1960s and 1970s generation’, born 1944–1964’; and the ‘Interwar generation’, born between 1918 and 1943, prior to decolonisation in Africa and Asia and in between the two World Wars.The authors said India was not included in the sample because the survey data for the country begins only in 2002 and also due to limited comparable data points, but would be added in future rounds.Robert Foa, the study’s lead author, says: “This is the first generation in living memory to have a global majority who are dissatisfied with the way democracy works while in their twenties and thirties”.“By their mid-thirties, 55% of global millennials say they are dissatisfied with democracy, whereas under half of Generation X felt the same way at that age. The majority of baby boomers – now in their sixties and seventies – continue to report satisfaction with democracy, as did the interwar generation,” he adds.The study says the idea that the young who are dissatisfied soften in attitude as they age is now reversed the world over. Millennials and Gen Xers have grown steadily less satisfied with democracy as they have advanced in life, it adds.Foa adds: “Right across the world, we are seeing an ever-widening gap between youth and older generations on how they perceive the functioning of democracy. This democratic disconnect is not a given, but the result of democracies failing to deliver outcomes that matter for young people in recent decades, from jobs and life chances to addressing inequality and climate change.”The study reports an average 16 percentage-point increase in satisfaction with democracy among voters under 35 during the first two years of populist leaders. But no comparable swell was seen when moderate politicians narrowly beat populists.According to the study, whether the rise of left-wing Syriza and Podemos in Greece and Spain, or the populist right of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Poland’s Law and Justice party, all boosted pro-democracy attitudes among millennials, as did political realignment in countries from Brazil and Mexico to the Czech Republic. “Countries electing populist leaders see sharp turnarounds in disenchantment, to the point where young people appear more satisfied with democracy under populists than under moderates,” said Daniella Wenger, one of the co-authors of the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-youth-losing-faith-in-democracy-cambridge-study/story-vr0Auh5NFTpPnG0UaZf8qI.html
20-10-2020||World||India-US ties bright regardless of who wins White House: Official||The future of India-US ties was “bright” regardless of the outcome of the US presidential election, US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said on Tuesday, noting that every American president had left the relationship in a better shape than they had inherited. He also said the goal for the Quad-- the quadrilateral forum of cooperation between India, US, Australia and Japan-- was to tend it towards regularisation and, eventually, formalising of the group.“This relationship is much bigger than one political party,” Biegun said while responding to questions from reporters during a press call organised by the London Regional Media Hub of the US state department. Biegun, who was in India last week, told said he was confident that “regardless of the outcome of our elections, the future is quite bright for relations between the United States and these two very important …partners,” referring to India and Bangladesh. “One of the constants in US-India relations has been that every presidential administration here in the United States has left the relationship in even better shape than the one inherited from its predecessor.” Biegun’s remarks came in the middle of the US election in which the campaign of President Donald Trump has actively sought, with an eye on Indian American voters, to portray him as the better guide and guardian of the relationship than his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, should he get elected.There are an estimated 1.9 million registered Indian American voters and they have been wooed this time by both presidential campaigns like never before in anticipation of the crucial role they could play in closely contested battleground states that will determine the outcome.The Trump campaign released a video of clips from President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s joint appearance at the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston int September, 2019 and from “Namaste Trump” rally in Ahmedabad in February to convey proximity between the two leaders and countries.Members of the campaign and other Republicans have argued that the president’s silence on the change in the constitutional status of Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act reflected the administration’s support and close ties with the Modi government and India.The Biden campaign has pushed back, arguing that the relationship will be in better hands in a Biden administration, pointing to the former vice-president’s crucial role and support in the conclusion of the historic India-US nuclear deal.Biegun’s remarks on the future of the Quad reflected growing ambitions for the informal forum ahead of Australia participating for the first time in the multi-nation Malabar military exercises with India, the US and Japan.The US diplomat did not refer to the military exercises but said in response to a question about the chances of growing the body to include other countries, “I will say that it is our view that in the passage of time the Quad should become more regularised, and at some point, formalised as well as we really begin to understand what the parameters of this cooperation are and how we can regularise it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-ties-bright-regardless-of-who-wins-white-house-official/story-Nk3fy9l5INhSO7MggGlyGN.html
20-10-2020||World||Battered by Covid-19, London plots to recharge future||The celebrated 18th century writer Samuel Johnson once said that ‘when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life’, but he never had to contend with the effects of a Covid-19-like pandemic, which has sucked life out of the vibrant British capital. Central London looks and feels like a dead city: there is none of the buzz, crowds and the atmosphere that millions of tourists and residents have long associated it with. Except for coffee shops, few businesses are open, with traffic lights regulating virtually non-existing traffic.The desolate picture is a result of the pandemic, but another spectre looms in the form of Brexit, which will be formalised on December 31, posing a multi-billion-pound question mark on London’s status as a hub of global finance, trade and business, without a deal with the EU.The City of London Corporation, the governing body of the financial district of City, on Tuesday presented a manifesto to recharge the capital beyond the effects of Covid-19, keen to rebuild it into a vibrant, thriving and open capital that it is globally known for.London hosts European or global headquarters of 40% of Fortune 250 companies; has four universities in the global top 40; is home to 3 million residents born overseas; speaks over 250 languages; has nearly 1,000 art galleries and museums; with one-thirds of its space green, including several sylvan parks.The corporation’s report, ‘London Recharged: Our Vision for London in 2025’, sets out several recommendations to reinvent itself and maintain its position as a global business hub, including simplifying visa and immigration procedures for skilled workers.It calls for investment in skills, digital infrastructure and built environment to ensure that London remains the global centre of choice, and also explores how London’s office stock and built environment can be transformed in response to trends such as increased remote and flexible working imposed by the pandemic.William Russell, the 692nd Lord Mayor of the City of London, said: “The capital’s success throughout history has been a story of constant reinvention. It is more important than ever that London adapts quickly to today’s challenges so that it remains a place where people want to work, live and visit tomorrow”.“This report sets out detailed measures that can help the capital thrive and evolve as we get through the current pandemic. A vibrant London will help to drive our recovery forwards as we work with the rest of the UK.”Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the corporation, added: “London is today facing major challenges. Coronavirus, the UK’s exit from the European Union and increasing protectionism across the globe are all threats to the capital’s role as an international business hub.”“Implementing these recommendations will underpin the capital’s competitiveness by supporting innovation, improving sustainability and offering greater opportunities to our diverse population”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battered-by-covid-19-london-plots-to-recharge-future/story-Dn566S4SLZ4dYdaKbQZSFJ.html
20-10-2020||World||China warns India on trading with Taiwan, slams US-Tibet govt-in-exile meeting||India should remain committed to the one-China principle and deal with Taiwan prudently, Beijing warned on Tuesday following a media report that New Delhi could open trade talks with Taiwan, which the mainland considers a breakaway region.The Chinese foreign ministry also slammed a meeting of the newly appointed US officer for Tibetan affairs with the head of Tibet’s government-in-exile.“There is only ‘One-China’ in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. One-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community, including India,” ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular briefing.Zhao was reacting to a Bloomberg report which indicated that India could begin trade talks with Taiwan.“It (one-China principle) is also the political basis for China to develop ties with other countries. So, we firmly oppose any official exchanges between countries having diplomatic ties with China and Taiwan or signing any official documents,” Zhao added.“The Indian side should remain committed to one-China principle and approach Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly.” Tensions between China and Taiwan has risen recently over the issue of reunification – summarily rejected by the current Taiwanese dispensation led by President Tsai Ing-wen.Beijing has aggressively reacted to developing ties between Taiwan and foreign countries including India.Earlier this month, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi issued guidelines for the Indian media’s coverage of Taiwan’s national day, observed on October 10, saying all countries having diplomatic ties with Beijing should “firmly honour their commitment to the One-China policy”.The Chinese embassy sent out a letter referring to the “so-called forthcoming ‘National Day of Taiwan’”, and saying it “would like to remind our media friends that there is only one China in the world, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China”.“Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory...All countries that have diplomatic relations with China should firmly honour their commitment to the One-China policy, which is also the long-standing official position of the Indian government,” the letter said.In February 2017, China had lodged a complaint with India on the rare visit of a Taiwanese parliamentary delegation, warning New Delhi to follow the “one-China” policy and to not have any official contact with Taipei.In 2015 September, before she became the first woman President of Taiwan, Tsai had spoken about the increasing importance of India in Taiwan’s foreign policy.“Asean and India are poised to become two of the world’s largest economic bodies. Strengthening our overall relations is a natural choice for Taiwan as we diversify our economic and trade ties. In the future, we will form a new task force to actively pursue this policy objective,” Tsai had said in her 29th DPP anniversary speech in September.‘Tibet affairs are purely China’s internal affairs’Spokesperson Zhao also reacted angrily to reports about the meeting between the head of the Tibetan administration in exile, Lobsang Sangey with the newly appointed US special coordinator for Tibetan issues, Robert Destro. Zhao said Tibet’s affairs are purely China’s internal affairs. “No external forces shall interfere in them. Appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is a political move to interfere in China’s internal affairs and sabotage Xizang’s (Tibet’s) stability. It is China’s consistent position we firmly oppose that, and we will not acknowledge that.”“We have lodged stern representation to the US side. The so-called Tibetan government in exile is a separatist political organisation chasing a wild dream of Tibetan independence. It violates China’s constitution and law, and it is not recognised by any nation worldwide,” Zhao added.Calling Sangay an “out and out anti-China separatist”, Zhao said that China firmly opposes him engaging in anti-China separatist activities in whatever status and whatever pretext in any country. “We firmly oppose officials of other countries having any kind of contact with him.”“Destro, by meeting with this person violated the commitment and policy stance of US side of not supporting Xizang’s independence and not acknowledging this government in exile. This will send very wrong signal to Xizang’s independence forces.”“We urge the US side to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs and sabotaging Xizang’s development and stability and refrain from offering any support to the separatist forces. China will take all measures to safeguard its own interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-india-on-trading-with-taiwan-slams-us-tibet-govt-in-exile-meeting/story-jL99zvVjI8rmEZrPSnhnqM.html
20-10-2020||World||New UK ‘challenge’ trial to fast-forward Covid-19 vaccine||Healthy young volunteers aged 18 to 30 years in the UK are to be inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine candidate and then exposed to the virus in a controlled environment to expedite the eventual development of a safe and tested vaccine for the entire population.The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday said that only a vaccine candidate that has proved safe in initial trials (such as the one at the University of Oxford) will be given to some 90 volunteers for the so-called ‘human challenge’ trial.Medics and scientists will closely monitor the effect on the volunteers 24 hours to see exactly how the vaccine works and to identify any side effects. The ‘human challenge’ method of trial has long been used, including in colonial India to develop the vaccine for smallpox.The trial is due to begin in January 2021, with results expected by May, officials said, adding that such human challenge studies have been performed safely and have played important roles in accelerating the development of treatments for diseases including malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu.Deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said: “A safe, fully approved, and meticulously controlled human challenge model for Covid-19 that is conducted by experienced experts may help in the search for safe and effective vaccines.”“First, for the many vaccines still in the mid-stages of development, human challenge studies may help pick out the most promising ones to take forward into larger Phase III trials.“Second, for vaccines which are in the late stages of development and already proven to be safe and effective through Phase III studies, human challenge studies could help us further understand if the vaccines prevent transmission as well as preventing illness,” he added.The first stage of the project will be delivered by a partnership between Imperial College London, the Royal Free Hospital’s specialist and secure research unit in London and industry-leading clinical company hVIVO, which officials said has pioneered viral human challenge models.The aim will be to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause a person to develop Covid-19 infection. This is known as a virus characterisation study. Volunteers will be monitored for up to a year after participating in the study to ensure their long-term well-being.Once this first phase is completed, researchers will deploy the human challenge model which officials said will provide an “unrivalled opportunity” to study closely how vaccines work in the body to stop Covid -19.Meanwhile, Patrick Vallance, chief scientific officer, told a parliamentary committee that a vaccine against coronavirus will not eradicate the disease or be widely available before the spring, amidst some reports that it could be available after Christmas. Before Covid-19, it took at least five years to develop a vaccine from scratch, with an average time of 10 years, but new vaccine technologies had helped to shrink that timeframe, he said.Stressing that a number of vaccines had been shown to trigger antibodies, Vallance said there was still a long way to go before a vaccine was widely available, adding that it was unlikely it would be rolled out for use in the community before spring 2021.According to him, Covid-19 was unlikely to be completely stamped out: “It is likely that this disease will circulate and be endemic…Clearly as management becomes better, as you get vaccination which would decrease the chance of infection and the severity of the disease … this then starts to look more like annual flu than anything else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-challenge-trial-to-fast-forward-covid-19-vaccine/story-tm8fJMoj1p6lmkbUQE1y0O.html
20-10-2020||World||China ‘takes note’ of Australia joining Malabar naval drills||China on Tuesday said it has “taken note” of India’s announcement that Australia will join the annual Malabar naval exercises along with the US and Japan, underlining that military cooperation should be “conducive” to regional peace and stability.India on Monday announced that Australia will join the upcoming Malabar exercise which effectively means that all the four-member countries of the ‘Quad’ or Quadrilateral coalition will be participating in the mega drill.The US and Japan are the other countries that participate in the annual exercise, which is likely to take place next month in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.Commenting on the announcement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that China has “taken note of this development.” “We always believe that military cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability,” he said in a brief reaction. India’s decision to heed to Australia’s request to be part of the mega naval drill comes in the midst of growing strain in ties with China over the border row in eastern Ladakh.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent participant in the exercise in 2015. This annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in joining the exercise.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-note-of-australia-joining-malabar-naval-drills/story-QqHmQDCAHLKQYKyY1DrgAP.html
20-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Stage set for third presidential debate between Trump and Biden||The third and final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden will be conducted on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. The debate will be moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker.The first presidential debate was conducted on September 29 after which President Trump was criticised for interrupting Biden several times. The second debate was supposed to be held on October 15 but was called off as Trump refused to take part in the same. As Trump tested positive for coronavirus, the Commission on Presidential Debates had decided that the second debate would be conducted virtually but the Trump campaign refused to participate in the debate and Trump called the idea of a virtual debate “a waste of time”.The Commission on Presidential Debates has also come up with new rules for the third and final debate. The 90-minute debate will be divided into 15-minute segments. At the start of each new topic, each candidate will have two minutes of uninterrupted time during which the opponent’s microphone will be off. The rest of the time will be for open discussion for remarks by both the candidates on each other’s statements during which the microphones of both the candidates will not be muted. As has been done before, the moderator will ensure that roughly equal amounts of time are given to both the speakers over the course of 90 minutes.The debate is crucial for both Trump and Biden as even though Biden has a significant lead in the national polls, the gap between him and Trump is reducing in the battleground states. As the coronavirus pandemic has changed the campaigning style for the candidates, debates have become even more significant than ever. Both the campaigns have agreed to the two-minute uninterrupted rule for the debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-stage-set-for-third-presidential-debate-between-trump-and-biden/story-8Id9XB5ISrlT8ZFJwCnZXJ.html
20-10-2020||World||How Trump plowed through USD 1 billion, losing cash advantage||President Donald Trump’s sprawling political operation has raised well over USD 1 billion since he took the White House in 2017 — and set a lot of it on fire.Trump bought a USD 10 million Super Bowl ad when he didn’t yet have a challenger. He tapped his political organisation to cover exorbitant legal fees related to his impeachment. Aides made flashy displays of their newfound wealth — including a fleet of luxury vehicles purchased by Brad Parscale, his former campaign manager. Meanwhile, a web of limited liability companies hid more than USD 310 million in spending from disclosure, records show. Now, just two weeks out from the election, some campaign aides privately acknowledge they are facing difficult spending decisions at a time when Democratic nominee Joe Biden has flooded the airwaves with advertising. That has put Trump in the position of needing to do more of his signature rallies as a substitute during the coronavirus pandemic while relying on an unproven theory that he can turn out supporters who are infrequent voters at historic levels. “They spent their money on unnecessary overhead, lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous activity by the campaign staff and vanity ads way too early,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican consultant who advised John McCain and Jeb Bush and is an outspoken Trump critic. “You could literally have 10 monkeys with flamethrowers go after the money, and they wouldn’t have burned through it as stupidly.” For Trump, it’s a familiar, if not welcome, position. In 2016, he was vastly outraised by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but still pulled off a come-from-behind win. This time around, though, he was betting on a massive cash advantage to negatively define Biden and to defend his own record. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien insisted money was no issue. “We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” he told reporters Monday. Biden, Stepien added, was “putting it all on TV,” as he eschewed most door-knocking because of the pandemic, while Trump has roughly 2,000 field staffers across the country knocking on doors and making calls for his campaign. “Where we have states that are sort of tipping, could go either way,” Trump told campaign staffers Monday, “I have an ability to go to those states and rally. Biden has no ability. I go to a rally, we have 25,000 people. He goes to a rally, and he has four people.” The campaign and the Republican National Committee will offer a glimpse of their financial situation Tuesday when they file mandatory monthly campaign finance reports. Advertising spending figures, however, offer a bleak picture. While a half-dozen pro-Trump outside groups are coming to the president’s aid, Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to dump USD 142 million into ads in the closing days of the campaign, outspending Republicans by more than 2-to-1, according to data from the ad tracking firm CMAG/Kantar. On Monday, the firm Medium Buying reported Trump was cancelling ad buys in Wisconsin; Minnesota, which Trump had hoped to flip; and Ohio, which went for Trump in 2016 but now appears to be a tight contest. It’s a reversal from May, when Biden’s campaign was strapped for cash and Parscale ominously compared the Trump campaign to a “Death Star” that was about to “start pressing FIRE for the first time.” The ad campaign they unrolled over the next three months cost over USD 176 million but did little to dent Biden’s lead in public opinion polling. Trump is now in a position that’s virtually unthinkable for an incumbent president, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks advertising spending. “Advertising obviously isn’t everything. But we do think ads matter for a couple percentage points in a presidential race. And it’s just not a good sign for the Trump campaign,” Ridout said. A review of expenditures by Trump’s campaign, as well as the Republican National Committee, lays bare some of the profligate spending. Since 2017, more than $39 million has been paid to firms controlled by Parscale, who was ousted as campaign manager over the summer. An additional USD 273.2 million was paid to American Made Media Consultants, a Delaware limited liability company, whose owners are not publicly disclosed. Campaigns typically reveal in mandatory disclosures who their primary vendors are. But by routing money to Parscale’s firms, as well as American Made Media Consultants, Trump satisfied the basic disclosure requirements without detailing the ultimate recipients. Other questionable expenditures by Trump and the RNC that are included in campaign finance disclosures: — Nearly $100,000 spent on copies of Donald Trump Jr.’s book “Triggered,” which helped propel it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-trump-plowed-through-usd-1-billion-losing-cash-advantage/story-Y0wrJ1nhOQ4afepyXKyOyK.html

According to the count, Arce has 52.4 per cent of valid votes and his centrist rival Carlos Mesa has 31.5 per cent. This would bring the left-wing party of Evo Morales back into power. So what does this election mean for Bolivia and for Morales?Background to the electionThe chaotic October 2019 election led to the resignation and exile of left- wing president Evo Morales who came into power in 2006 and governed the nation since then. On November 12, 2019, conservative Senator Jeanine Anez took over as interim president and promised the country that a re-run of the October 2019 elections would be conducted. The elections were initially set to be conducted on May 3, 2020 and then on September 6, 2020 but due to the coronavirus pandemic they were postponed and conducted on October 18, 2020.Eva Morales in this electionMorales has been an iconic figure not only in Bolivia but in Latin America as he is part of the wave of leftist presidents of the region. But this will be the first time since 2002 that Morales has not fought the election himself as he is in exile in Argentina after the 2019 polls. He has supported Luis Arce unequivocally through media interviews and social media campaigns. If Morales’ Movement Towards Socialism (Mas) party’s presidential pick Arce wins the election, it would ensure Morales’ return to Bolivia.How is the world looking at the elections in Bolivia?A victory for Morales’ party Mas and his imminent return would be welcomed by left wing presidents of Cuba, Venenzuela and Nicaragua who have been long term allies of Bolivia. However, the election is being dimly viewed by the US as Morales has been a lifelong critic of US’ “imperialism”.As official results are awaited, if no candidate succeeds in obtaining more than 50 per cent of the votes or 40 per cent votes with a 10-point lead over the nearest challenger, a run-off between the two top contenders will be held on November 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolivian-elections-2020-what-it-means-for-evo-morales-and-latin-america/story-SvhgLdPhCF5dXdbibCi4UN.html

Harris, whose mother was from India and father from Jamaica, scripted history in August when she was picked by the Democratic Party as its vice presidential nominee. She is the first Black woman and the first Asian-American woman to be selected as the vice presidential nominee of a major political party in the US. “Rain or shine, democracy waits for no one,” Harris, 55, said in a tweet along with a picture of herself dancing in the rain with an umbrella over her as supporters cheer her along in Jacksonville, Florida. Rain or shine, democracy waits for no one. pic.twitter.com/DMimsHbmWO On Monday, Harris resumed her election campaign, which she had paused for a few days after two of her staffers tested positive with Covid-19. On Monday, she campaigned in Orlando and Jacksonville. “Kamala Harris is dancing in Florida rain,” tweeted news portal The Recount with a 15-second video. By mid-night, it had received nearly a million impressions. “Twitter Can’t Get Enough of Kamala Harris Dancing in the Rain,” said news site InStyle.Com. “Harris wore her go-to campaign footwear, Converse Chuck Taylors, and seemed unbothered by the shower,” it said. “When we vote, we win,” Harris told carloads of people who covered a rain-soaked parking area behind a University of North Florida conference center. In her remarks, Harris stressed on Florida’s importance for the national presidential race and said the state’s voters “are very likely going to decide” the contest. Earlier she stopped at the Jacksonville Public Library’s Highlands branch to greet people casting early ballots there. “I’m so excited to be back in Florida for early voting,” she told reports, as she headed towards people leaving the library. “It is so important,” she told people who had just cast ballots. “Thank you for voting early,” she said. “Sometimes you just got to dance! And with that, thank you Jacksonville!” her spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-wins-nearly-million-impressions-with-her-florida-rain-tweet/story-kOUSMMb669Zvm184Jcz4LP.html
20-10-2020||World||From HCQ to remdesivir, the treatment options for Covid-19||What are the treatment options for Covid-19?There are several, and which one is best depends on how sick someone is.For example, steroids such as dexamethasone can lower the risk of dying for severely ill patients. But they may do the opposite for those who are only mildly ill.In the United States, no treatments are specifically approved for Covid-19, but a few have been authorized for emergency use and several more are being considered. A panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health updates guidelines as new studies come out.Here’s what’s advised for various patients:-- Not hospitalized or hospitalized but not needing extra oxygen: No specific drugs recommended, and a warning against using steroids.-- Hospitalized and needing extra oxygen but not a breathing machine: The antiviral drug remdesivir, given through an IV, and in some cases also a steroid.-- Hospitalized and on a breathing machine: Remdesivir and a steroid.What about convalescent plasma, an infusion of blood from a Covid-19 survivor that contains antibodies that fight the virus? Not enough is known to recommend for or against it, the guidelines say.However, enough is known to advise against hydroxychloroquine and certain drugs that affect the immune system -- multiple studies have found them ineffective against the coronavirus.Aside from drugs, doctors have learned more about ways to treat hospitalized patients, such as putting them on their bellies and other measures that may prevent the need for breathing machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hcq-to-remdesivir-the-treatment-options-for-covid-19/story-Uuw6O8vIxMwpJigHkScjYN.html

But they have prompted anger from the Palestinians.Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, described Tuesday’s UAE visit as “shameful”.Speaking in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, he said it came amid Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.“The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance,” he said.In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said: “Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands,” he added.The five-hour visit would be restricted to the airport near Tel Aviv, due to coronavirus concerns, Israeli organisers said.“This is an historical moment for the UAE country and Israel and we are looking forward to salaam (peace) ... in the region,” one of the Etihad pilots could be heard saying in a video posted on Twitter by US Middle East envoy Ari Berkowitz.Berkowitz and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are accompanying the Emirati delegation, which is being led by Economy Minister Abdullah bin Touq al-Mari and Minister of State for Financial Affairs Obaid Humaid al-Tayer, according to a UAE foreign ministry spokeswoman.The US officials had on Sunday joined an Israeli delegation to Bahrain for a signing ceremony to formalise ties.Israel and the UAE have already signed several commercial deals since mid-August, when they first announced they would establish full relations.Israeli officials said the two sides were expected to sign a mutual visa-exemption agreement - Israel’s first with an Arab country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-delegation-us-officials-visit-israel-palestinean-concerns-unheeded/story-PrpsCZ4y7bwuNI6KQSqggP.html
20-10-2020||World||Pak fails to prevent forced conversions of religious minorities: Parliamentary committee||A parliamentary committee in Pakistan has said that the country has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect religious minorities from forced conversions, according to a media report on Tuesday.The parliamentary committee on forced religious conversions headed by Senator Anwarul Haq Kakar recently visited parts of Sindh where forced conversions of young Hindu girls have been reported.During a media interaction on Monday, Kakar said that “the state has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect religious minorities from forced conversions”, The Dawn News reported.He, however, noted that most of the cases of conversions “have some degree of willingness”. Replying to a question, Kakar said there are several definitions of forced conversion, and the subject was debated by the committee at length.“Although conversion to seek a better lifestyle is also considered forced conversion, economic reasons can be considered exploitation and not force, as eventually it is after consent,” he said, adding that there is a thin line between consent and exploitation. Kakar said people who “encourage girls from the Hindu community to move out and marry according to their own wishes are not as liberal about their own daughters”. The worst part of the situation, he said, was that the family’s “pain and shame” were not taken into consideration. “If we all start taking the families into confidence and devise a mechanism to console them, the cases of forced conversions will decline,” he said.Kakar suggested introducing a new marriage rule that includes the mandatory presence of a ‘vali’ (guardian) at the time of wedding and the establishment of shelters managed by the district administration to house underage girls who wanted to get married, in order to clear the confusion between force and consent.According to the report, the most vulnerable districts for forced conversions are Sanghar, Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur and Mirpurkhas. There have been negligible reported cases from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while a few cases involving Christians have been reported in Punjab.Civil society activist Krishan Sharma said there are two kinds of forced conversions, the first involving kidnapping and illegal confinement, and a second kind.“The second kind is rampant in Sindh and that has to be taken care of by the state - this is procedural forced conversions, [in which] the whole system of the country, from the police, the courts, etc, are violating the laws and facilitating such conversions,” the report quoted Sharma as saying. “When the parents present a certificate that the age of the girl is below 18 years, the police usually do not attach this document in the FIR, but we have women protection laws in the country and we need to implement them. Besides that, Pakistan is signatory to several international obligations,” he said.Sharma said there has to be a law stating that the minimum age for religious conversion is 18, which is also the marriageable age in Sindh. “The courts too should take note of marriages of girls below the age of 18 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-fails-to-prevent-forced-conversions-of-religious-minorities-parliamentary-committee/story-I0gbQ08ZoKLoYK2VZ0XjuL.html
20-10-2020||World||FATF plenary meeting: What next for Pakistan?||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will begin a three-day virtual plenary meeting on Wednesday that will decide on the next course of action against Pakistan with regard to steps taken by the country to crack down on fund-raising by terror groups. Pakistan’s case: The multilateral watchdog, which counters money laundering and terror financing, put Pakistan on its list of “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or “grey list” in 2018 for not doing enough to curb financial activities of terror groups. The grey list now has 18 countries, ranging from Iceland to Mauritius and Panama, and most of these nations have been cited for lax money laundering regimes and none face as serious charges related to terror financing as Pakistan. After a plenary meeting in February, FATF warned Pakistan that all deadlines set for implementing an action plan against terror financing had expired, and that the country had largely addressed only 14 of 27 action items in the plan. According to a more recent assessment, Pakistan is understood to have largely addressed about 20 action items. However, FATF’s regional affiliate Asia-Pacific Group (APG) concluded last month that Pakistan has fully complied with only two out of 40 recommendations to curb money laundering and terror financing. The abuse of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and registered charities by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was cited by APG in its latest report as a “significant threat”, and the group retained Pakistan in its “enhanced follow-up” category. Terror financing: Combating terror financing has been a priority for FATF since 2001. FATF plays a key role in global efforts to fight terror financing by setting global standards, assisting countries to implement financial provisions of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on terror, and evaluating their ability to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute the financing of terrorism. FATF carries out assessments throughout the year of countries on the grey list, though this work has been curtailed in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of its work in Pakistan has been focused on getting the government to introduce laws to enforce UN sanctions, improve coordination between different government organisations and law enforcement agencies, and prosecution of terrorists involved in fund-raising. Though Pakistan has arrested LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and a handful of other terrorist leaders and successfully prosecuted several of them – Saeed was given a prison term of five-and-a-half years in February – there have been other developments that have been criticised by Western nations. For instance, Pakistani authorities have removed some 3,800 names from a terror watch list this year. Pakistan has also enacted some 10 new laws for freezing and seizing the assets of terror groups and to impose fines and prison terms for terror financing but FATF has said enforcement and prosecution needs to improve further. What’s next: Pakistan is widely expected to remain in the grey list, with very little chance of it being included in FATF’s list of “high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action” or “black list” – which currently has only two countries, North Korea and Iran – for a variety of reasons. Some Western countries are reluctant to push for stiffer action against Pakistan at a time when it is perceived as crucial for the troubled peace process in Afghanistan, while the backing of just three of FATF’s 39 members is adequate to keep it out of the black list. Pakistan has China in its corner and its leadership has reached out to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey for support. What remains to be seen is how much leeway FATF will give to Pakistan to deliver on the action plan against terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-plenary-meeting-what-next-for-pakistan/story-syKRYz5UWwlgx48O6LZw6I.html

The government is preparing to invest 33.6 million pounds ($43.4 million) in the study.Imperial College London said Tuesday that the study, involving healthy volunteers between 18 and 30, would be conducted in partnership with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and hVivo, a company that has experience conducting testing .“Deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen is never undertaken lightly,’‘ said Peter Openshaw, co-investigator on the study. “However, such studies are enormously informative about a disease, even one so well studied as Covid-19. ‘’In the first phase of the study, researchers will aim to determine the smallest level of exposure needed to cause the disease. Researchers will then use the same challenge model to study how potential vaccines work in the body, the body’s immune response and potential treatments.Vaccine Taskforce chair Kate Bingham said the research will improve our understanding of the virus and will help in making decisions about research.“There is much we can learn in terms of immunity, the length of vaccine protection, and reinfection,’‘ she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-start-controversial-challenge-vaccine-study-will-infect-healthy-volunteers-with-virus-for-research-trial/story-Amb5J1kxIo92aHQ50ebEmL.html
20-10-2020||World||UK lab joins network to compare Covid-19 vaccine candidates||A second British laboratory is joining a global lab network to assess data from potential coronavirus vaccines, set up by a major non-profit health emergencies group to establish the effectiveness of different vaccine candidates. Earlier this month, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) set up the network, allowing scientists and drugmakers to compare vaccines and speed up selection of the most effective shots.Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said on Tuesday the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) was joining the scheme, and had received funding from CEPI to develop an international standard for the Covid-19 antibody.That means the NIBSC will produce a sample of antibody with a defined amount of biological activity that can be used by regulators and vaccine makers to calibrate their tests.“This is an important initiative providing a service to vaccine developers globally and permits accurate evaluation of candidate vaccines for this pandemic,” Dr Mark Page, who is leading the work at NIBSC, said.Public Health England is also involved in the CEPI scheme.Hundreds of potential coronavirus vaccines are in various stages of development around the world, with shots developed in Russia and China already being deployed before full efficacy trials have been done, and front-runners from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca likely to have final-stage trial results before year-end.CEPI itself is co-funding nine of the vaccines in development, including candidates from Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and CureVac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lab-joins-network-to-compare-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/story-4il2zWUhX3CwZkx0u2i7IP.html
20-10-2020||World||India considers trade talks with Taiwan as both spar with China||Support is growing within India’s government to formally start talks on a trade deal with Taiwan as both democracies see relations with China deteriorate.Taiwan has sought trade talks with India for several years, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been reluctant to move ahead because it would involve a messy fight with China once any pact is registered at the World Trade Organization, according to a senior Indian government official who asked not be named, citing rules for speaking with the media.Yet over the past few months the hawks in India who want to start trade talks are getting the upper hand, the official said. A trade deal with Taiwan would help India’s goal of seeking greater investments in technology and electronics, the official said, adding that it’s unclear when a final decision would be made on whether to start talks.Earlier this month, Modi’s government gave approval to firms including Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. as he looks to attract investment worth more than 10.5 trillion rupees ($143 billion) for smartphone production over five years.Indian Commerce Ministry spokesman Yogesh Baweja didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Taiwan’s top trade negotiator, John Deng, didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Any formal talks with India would amount to a big win for Taiwan, which has struggled to begin trade negotiations with most major economies due to pressure from China. Like most countries, India doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan, with the two governments maintaining unofficial diplomatic missions in the form of “representative offices.”India and Taiwan in 2018 signed an updated bilateral investment agreement in a bid to further expand economic ties. Trade between them grew 18% to $7.2 billion in 2019, according to India’s Department of Commerce.‘Country’ SpatPresident Tsai Ing-wen’s administration has raised its profile in India in recent weeks after China issued a statement telling Indian media outlets not to refer to Taiwan as a country when reporting on its Oct. 10 National Day celebrations. Twitter users in India lambasted China and its ambassador to New Delhi, Sun Weidong, while heaping praise on Taiwan and making the hashtag #TaiwanNationalDay go viral.Indian public sentiment toward China has fallen in the wake of deadly border clashes between the two neighbors starting in May. Modi’s government has since banned dozens of Chinese apps including TikTok, while also speaking with Japan, Australia and the U.S. about creating alternative supply chains to diversify away from China in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. India has seen more than 7.5 million infections and 115,000 deaths from Covid-19.China’s Insistence That Taiwan Isn’t a Country Starts BackfiringThat displeasure with China, as well as Taiwan’s successful handling of the pandemic, is translating into a soft power opportunity for Tsai. Taiwan’s 24 million have seen fewer than 600 infections and only seven deaths.“We have to think about the way for democracies, for like-minded countries, to work further together,” Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu said during an interview last week on the television network India Today. “We have traditional good relations with the United States, with Japan, and we want to develop closer ties with India as well.”Tsai, who was voted into a second term in a January landslide, has sought to capitalize on the wave of interest in Taiwan among Indians online. On October 11, she thanked Indian Twitter users who had sent national day greetings. Two days later she went viral again, posting photos of her visiting the Taj Mahal.On October 15, Tsai tweeted a photo of Indian food accompanied by a cup of masala chai, which some Twitter users saw as a possible reference to the so-called Milk Tea Alliance that has united activists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and elsewhere against Chinese nationalism. All three tweets received more than 40,000 likes each and thousands of friendly messages from Indian accounts.China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as its territory despite having never ruled it, has pushed back against the Tsai administration’s overtures to India.“We urge relevant Indian media to adhere to the correct position with regard to the significant core interests of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ji Rong, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in New Delhi, said in a statement on Friday. Indian media, Ji continued, “should not provide ‘Taiwan independence’ forces a platform, so as to avoid sending the wrong message.”Sana Hashmi, a fellow at Taipei-based National Chengchi University and author of “China’s Approach Towards Territorial Disputes: Lessons and Prospects,” said it makes sense for India to align with Taiwan economically.“Increasingly there seems to be an awareness not just among Indians but even in other nations about how China has dictated relationships in the region,” said Hashmi, who has penned op-eds in Taiwanese and Indian media encouraging closer ties between the two democracies. “And it’s not like China is going to give any concessions to India or Taiwan for toeing its line.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-considers-trade-talks-with-taiwan-as-both-spar-with-china/story-YKh61mYdcL2ZPEWlPnetcI.html
20-10-2020||World||Why Beijing may want to keep Trump in the White House||Donald Trump has frustrated and enraged China during a tumultuous first term, but Beijing may welcome his re-election as it scans the horizon for the decline of its superpower rival.Relations are as icy as at any time since formal ties were established four decades ago, with China warning it does not want to be drawn into a new “Cold War” with the United States.Under his ‘America First’ banner, Trump has portrayed China as the greatest threat to the United States and global democracy.He has launched a massive trade war that has cost China billions of dollars, harangued Chinese tech firms and lay all the blame for the pandemic with Beijing.But another Trump triumph in November may have its advantages for China as President Xi Jinping seeks to cement his nation’s rise as a global superpower.China’s leadership could be handed “the opportunity to boost its global standing as a champion for globalisation, multilateralism, and international cooperation,” said Zhu Zhiqun, professor of political and international relations, Bucknell University.Trump has pulled America from a sprawling Asia-Pacific commercial deal and climate agreements, imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on Chinese goods, and withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization at the height of a global pandemic.Where the US has retreated, Xi has stepped forward.He has presented his country as the champion of free trade and a leader in the fight against climate change, as well as vowed to share any potential Covid-19 vaccine with poorer nations.“A second Trump term could give China more time to rise as a great power on the world stage,” Zhu said. Philippe Le Corre, a China expert at the Harvard Kennedy School in the United States, agreed an extension of Trump’s ‘America First’ policies would be of long-term benefit for Beijing.“(It) partially cuts Washington off from its traditional allies,” he added, and that gave China room to manouevre. China’s nationalists have openly cheered, or jeered, for Trump.“You can make America eccentric and thus hateful for the world,” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a chest-beating nationalist paper, warned in a Tweet directed at the US president. “You help promote unity in China.” Trump is also lampooned on China’s heavily censored social media as ‘Jianguo’, meaning “help to build China”. - Biden trouble -Trump has undoubtedly inflicted economic and political pain on China.“China has lost out enormously in its plan for trade and technology,” said Beijing-based political analyst Hua Po.In January the US and China signed a deal bringing a partial truce in their trade war that obliged Beijing to import an additional $200 billion in American products over two years, ranging from cars to machinery and oil to farm products.Washington has also turned its guns on Chinese tech firms it says poses security threats, throwing the future US operations of video-sharing app TikTok -- owned by Chinese parent company Bytedance -- into uncertainty.Mobile giant Huawei is also on Trump’s hitlist.The enmity also extends into defence and human rights, with Taiwan, Hong Kong and the treatment of China’s Muslim Uighur minority all making waves in US. But China may not win much relief in any of these areas if Trump loses to Democratic challenger Joe Biden.Beijing worries that Biden is likely to renew American leadership on human rights, pressing China on issues of the Uighurs, Tibet and freedom in Hong Kong.“Biden is likely to be tougher than Trump on human rights issues in Xinjiang and Tibet,” said Zhu, of Bucknell University.And on tech and trade -- crucial flash points in the US-China rivalry -- it is unclear just how much room a Biden White House would have to manoeuvre. “Biden will inherit the tariffs, and I’m doubtful he would lift them unilaterally,” said Bonnie Glaser, Director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“Beijing will probably have to concede to other US demands if it wants the tariffs lifted.”China will also have to come up with convincing arguments on data security if it is to avoid more damaging bans on its tech firms.Washington sees Huawei -- the global leader on 5G internet -- as a serious security threat.“Politically, it will be almost impossible for Biden to reverse these policies,” Fallon said. “Huawei has been on the US radar as a security threat even before the Trump presidency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-beijing-may-want-to-keep-trump-in-the-white-house/story-m7E5zXlEZbgvXfVNfzV5hK.html

20-10-2020||World||Lawsuit challenges Trump administration’s new H-1B visa rules||Several individuals and organisations, including the US Chambers of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s recent rules related to the H-1B visa, terming them “arbitrary” and “haphazard” regulations that will undermine high skilled immigration into America. Early this month, the Trump administration announced new restrictions on H-1B non-immigrant visa programme which it said is aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners, a move which is likely to affect thousands of Indian IT professionals. The interim final rule announced by the Department of Homeland Security will narrow the definition of “speciality occupation” as Congress intended by closing the overbroad definition that allowed companies to game the system. It will also require companies to make “real” offers to “real employees,” by closing loopholes and preventing the displacement of the American workers. And finally, the new rules would enhance the department’s ability to enforce compliance through worksite inspections and monitor compliance before, during and after an H1-B petition is approved. The lawsuit filed by the US Chambers of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and several other organisations in the Northern District of Columbia on Monday alleges that “harmful and haphazard rules on H-1B visas” if left in place, would affect hundreds of thousands of American-based workers and disrupt manufacturers’ ability to hire and retain critical high-skilled talent. “The rules being implemented by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor undermine high-skilled immigration in the US and a company’s ability to retain and recruit the very best talent,” said US Chamber CEO Thomas J Donohue. If these rules are allowed to stand, they will devastate companies across various industries, he said. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. It is most sought-after among Indian IT professionals. “We need high-skilled innovators now more than ever, and the administration’s attempt to rush these rules forward without properly considering their impact on thousands of people on the front lines of developing vaccines and treatments and making critical supplies, as well as saving lives in our hospitals, could have devastating consequences at a critical moment in our history,” said NAM senior vice president and general counsel Linda Kelly. Rewriting laws through a “dark-of-night-style” rulemaking leads to dangerous policy outcomes, and this pair of interim final rules is an illegal attempt to dismantle legal immigration by rendering the H-1B visa programme unworkable for hundreds of thousands of American-based workers who are essential to the recovery and renewal of the industry and the economy, Kelly said. Seventeen individuals and organisations, including universities and businesses, in their lawsuit, have challenged the US Department of Labour’s recent rule on wages related to H-1B visas. The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday alleged that the poorly-drafted and improperly-issued rule did not comply with the procedural rules for rule-making and is substantively “arbitrary”, incorrect and irrational. “The increase to the prevailing wages will manifestly not benefit US economic growth or any workers; study after study has shown that H-1B visa holders create American jobs,” said Jesse Bless, director of federal litigation at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). The regulation has caused immediate and unnecessary harm in every corner of the economy, including academic institutions, non-profits, hospitals, start-ups and small businesses, he said. Early this month, the Department of Labour published a rule to appropriately identify wage levels for H-1B holders and other foreign labour programmes. The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, the White House argued. Among those who have filed the lawsuit are Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Denver, Chapman University, Bard College, International Institute of New England, Information Technology Industry Council, Arizona State University, Scripps College, Northern Arizona University, Indiana University, Study Mississippi, Dentists for America, Physicians for American Healthcare and Hodges Bonded Warehouse. Jeff Joseph, Senior Partner of Joseph and Hall, in a statement alleged that dealing with the Department of Labour often feels like “The Hunger Games”. “Everyone is required to play the game, but no one knows the rules and the rules are constantly changing. This is not a game. The fact that the rule was made effective without thinking about the destructive impact it would have on industries and the economy illustrates how out of touch this administration is regarding the symbiotic relationship between legal immigration and the economy,” he said. The days when the federal government blatantly ignores the law in its rule-making are over, said Charles Kuck, managing partner of Kuck Baxter Immigration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawsuit-challenges-trump-administration-s-new-h-1b-visa-rules/story-qHXcNhtE4fYO2bXdV46FtI.html

Donald Trump Jr and Guilfoyle have taken up the mantle to campaign in the battleground states. In the week gone by and this week, Trump Jr, 42, has more than 30 campaign events, in addition to his multiple appearances on national television channels and local media. Similarly, Guilfoyle, who is in-charge of fund-raising in her capacity as National Chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, has been joining Trump Jr in the rallies. The Palm Coast Observer, a Florida-based newspaper, this week, reported that Trump Jr’s election rally was attended by more than 2,000 people, a large number considering the present coronavirus risks.Also Read| Trump-Biden debate: Candidates’ mics to be muted at the start of each segment Trump Jr has defended his father’s policies and attacked the Democratic candidates on two core issues -- the Joe Biden family’s links to China and allegations of corruption. His arguments have been well received. “Donald Trump Jr. fires up Kernersville crowd,” North Carolina’s News and Record newspaper headlined on the Republican event in Kernersville on Monday. Trump Jr, who is presently campaigning in North Carolina, has scheduled multiple campaign stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this week. “The president’s son got one of his loudest cheers when he talked about Trump’s success in brokering peace deals in the Middle East,” said Mukesh Modi, a Indian-American community leader and one of the organisers of a meet-and-greet event in Long Island, New York.Also Read | US Election 2020: ‘2021 will be greatest economic year in US history,’ predicts Trump Modi recalled one of Trump Jr’s go-to tagline’s on the president, “He continues to deliver.” At the same event, Modi, who is also co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, described Guilfoyle as someone who runs the most successful fund-raising machine juggernaut in the history of presidential elections.

20-10-2020||World||UNICEF prepares for Covid-19 vaccinations, to stockpile half a bn syringes by end of 2020||UNICEF said it will stockpile 520 million syringes in its warehouses, as part of a larger plan of one billion hypodermic needles by 2021, to guarantee initial supply and help ensure that syringes are available in countries before the Covid-19 vaccines arrives.“As the world awaits a Covid-19 vaccine, UNICEF has begun laying the groundwork for the rapid, safe and efficient delivery of the eventual vaccine by purchasing and pre-positioning syringes and other necessary equipment,” the UN agency said on Monday.The agency said as soon as Covid-19 vaccines successfully emerge from trials and are licensed and recommended for use, the world will need as many syringes as doses of vaccine. To begin preparations, this year, UNICEF will stockpile 520 million syringes in its warehouses, part of a larger plan of one billion syringes by 2021, to guarantee initial supply and help ensure that syringes arrive in countries before the Covid-19 vaccines, it said.During 2021, assuming there are enough doses of Covid-19 vaccines, UNICEF anticipates delivering over one billion syringes to support Covid-19 vaccination efforts on top of the 620 million syringes that it will purchase for other vaccination programmes against other diseases such as measles, typhoid and more.“Vaccinating the world against Covid-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.“In order to move fast later, we must move fast now. By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively. That’s enough syringes to wrap around the world one and a half times,” Fore said. In line with the longstanding collaboration between the two partners, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will reimburse the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the procurement of the syringes and safety boxes, which shall then be used for the Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) and for other Gavi-funded immunisation programmes if necessary.Besides syringes, UNICEF is also buying 5 million safety boxes so that used syringes and needles can be disposed of in a safe manner by personnel at health facilities, thus preventing the risk of needle stick injuries and blood borne diseases. Every safety box carries 100 syringes. Accordingly, UNICEF is “bundling” the syringes with safety boxes to ensure enough safety boxes are available to go along with the syringes.UNICEF said injection equipment such as syringes and safety boxes have a shelf life of five years. Lead-times for such equipment are also long as these items are bulky and need to be transported by sea freight. Vaccines, which are heat sensitive, are normally transported more quickly by air freight. In addition to saving time, early purchase of syringes and safety boxes also reduces pressure on the market and pre-empts potential early spikes in demand when vaccines do become available.As the key procurement coordinator for Gavi, UNICEF is already the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. Every year, UNICEF provides vaccines for almost half of the world’s children and procures and supplies around 600-800 million syringes for regular immunisation programmes. Covid-19 vaccines will likely treble or quadruple that number, depending on the number of Covid-19 vaccines that are ultimately produced and secured by the UNICEF.“Over two decades, Gavi has helped an additional 822 million children from the world’s most vulnerable countries access critical, life-saving vaccines,” CEO of Gavi Seth Berkley said. “This would not have been possible without our partnership with UNICEF, and it is this same collaboration that will be essential to Gavi’s work with the COVAX Facility.” To make sure that vaccines are transported and stored at the right temperature, the UNICEF, along with WHO, is also mapping out existing cold chain equipment and storage capacity – in the private as well as public sector – and preparing necessary guidance for countries to receive vaccines.“We are doing everything we can to deliver these essential supplies efficiently, effectively and at the right temperature, as we already do so well all over the world,” Fore said.Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, with support from Gavi and in partnership with WHO, UNICEF has been upgrading the existing cold chain equipment across health facilities in countries to ensure that vaccines remain safe and effective throughout their journey. Since 2017, over 40,000 cold-chain fridges, including solar fridges, have been installed across health facilities, mostly in Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-prepares-for-covid-19-vaccinations-to-stockpile-half-a-bn-syringes-by-end-of-2020/story-e9D9MqLCUup7lGrYlOfMXP.html
20-10-2020||World||Thai Cabinet approves parliament session to discuss protests||Thailand’s cabinet backed a proposal from lawmakers to convene a special session of the parliament to discuss anti-government protests that have swept the nation’s capital and other major cities in the past week.The house will meet for two days from Oct. 26, Anucha Nakasai, minister for Prime Minister’s Office, told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Bangkok Tuesday. The proposal needs to be endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Thai lawmakers on Monday sought an early parliament meeting to discuss ways to end the protest movement calling for the ouster of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha’s government, a rewriting of the constitution and reform of the monarchy. Thousands of protesters rallied in Bangkok for a sixth straight day on Monday, defying a ban on gatherings and the threat of crackdowns by the police.The protests have weighed on the country’s stocks and currency as concerns mount a prolonged standoff may erode company earnings and delay an economic recovery. The benchmark stock index, the worst performer in Asia this year, was headed for a fifth straight day of losses, while the baht fell 0.2% to 31.259 to a dollar, extending losses this year to 4.2%.On Tuesday, Prayuth ordered police to reconsider censorship of media outlets, a day after police said they would probe four news outlets that may have violated the emergency rules imposed in Bangkok last week.“Our job is to protect the country and eliminate ill-intentioned actions aimed at creating chaos and conflict in the country,” Prayuth told reporters after the cabinet meeting.The protesters have vowed to carry on the demonstrations until all their demands are met. The organizers said there would be a “surprise” for the government if authorities failed to release all detained protesters and lift the emergency rules by 6 p.m. local time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-cabinet-approves-parliament-session-to-discuss-protests/story-rHqd2WWuExysOKp8Ev00jP.html
20-10-2020||World||On row over National Day, Taiwan says won’t be intimidated by China’s ‘hooligan’ officials||Taiwan will not be intimidated by China’s “hooligan” officials and will continue to celebrate its national day around the world, the government said on Tuesday, after Taiwan said Chinese diplomats had tried to charge into a diplomatic event in Fiji.Taiwan’s charges, including that a Taiwanese diplomat ended up in hospital after the altercation, are hotly disputed by China, which views the democratically-run island as its own territory with no right to formal state-to-state ties.The Pacific is a major source of competition between the two, where Taiwan has official diplomatic relations with four countries, though not Fiji. Taiwan says the Chinese diplomats were trying to take pictures of a Taiwan national day event at a hotel to see who was there, and that in the altercation that followed people from both sides were injured.Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said Taiwan was a “peace-loving country” that invited people to events around the world for its Oct. 10 national day, which marks the founding of the Republic of China, Taiwan’s official name.“Going forward we will continue to hold national day receptions,” she said. “This will not change.”China can spread as many lies as it likes but Taiwan shouldn’t pay too much attention, Ou said.“The reality is this year we had 108 offices hold national day events in different ways, inviting the world to celebrate our birthday.”Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said the world needed to see what China was capable of, saying what they did was a “barbaric act”. “China’s officials posted overseas are acting like hooligans; beating people is not acceptable. We sternly condemn this,” he told reporters. The issue was hard to deal with because the Chinese diplomats there have diplomatic immunity, Su added.“But we must appeal to the international community with the relevant evidence.”Fiji’s foreign ministry has yet to comment on the incident, though Ou said Fiji’s government had been trying to mediate to bring a close to the issue.

20-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: ‘2021 will be greatest economic year in US history,’ predicts Trump||US president Donald Trump has predicted that the American economy will soon recover from the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown and that the next year will be the greatest economic year in the country’s history.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage) Republican incumbent Trump faces a stiff challenge from the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, in the November 3 elections. The handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic condition and racial tensions have emerged as the main poll topics. “Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, that’s what’s going to happen,” Trump said at an election rally in Arizona, a battleground state, on Monday. The coronavirus has claimed 220,119 lives with over 8.2 million confirmed infections in the US. The pandemic has also resulted in one of the greatest recessions and job losses in the country’s history. Of the 22 million jobs that were lost in early spring, 11 million jobs have been recovered. The budget deficit is at an all-time high of USD 3.1 trillion. Acknowledging that the country was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, Trump promised his supporters that the country will soon get back to normal life. “That’s what we want, just a normal. Just seven months ago (is where) we want to get back (to) and we will be better than that very soon, we build a foundation that (is) so strong and you see what’s happening, (the) stock market (is going) through the roof,” he said. “We saved millions of lives by doing what we did and we built it (the economy) back up and it’s a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare,” Trump said as he continued with his criticism of Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris. “That’s what it is. Biden will postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, and shut down our country and we are opening and we are opening rapidly and we’ve got a V (victory) shape. It may be a super V. It looks like it’s a super V which nobody ever even heard of before,” he said. The president alleged that a Biden administration would massively raise taxes. “You will be buried in regulations. You know we cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved, we have it down to one year and you know what from two to one very shortly to be exact,” he asserted. The Biden administration, he said, will bring all of those regulations back. “They want to dismantle your police departments,” he said. Trump alleged that Harris is a left liberal. “Biden even chose as his running mate the most liberal senator in America. Senator Kamala Harris is a sponsor of the socialist Green New Deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans,” he said. The Green New Deal is a Congressional resolution which aims to tackle factors contributing to global warming. “Harris also urged her supporters to donate to a fund that build out the rioters, the ones that knocked out your towns, your cities, not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas,” Trump alleged, referring to the race protests after George Floyd’s death in police custody. “Joe Biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists, the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, they (Democrats) raise a lot of money. You know why? Because they make deals. They make deals,” he alleged. Trump said, if he wants, he can raise money for his campaign pretty soon and with ease. “I would be the greatest fundraiser in history if I wanted to call Wall Street. I know them all. ‘I want USD 10 million for my campaign.’ - ‘Yes, sir.’ All I have to say is I want USD 10 million, I want USD 15 million, I want USD 25 million. I would set every record,” he said. “In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president, who is finally putting America first. About time. It’s about time. It’s about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And you know what? You knew that, a lot of people knew it for a long time,” he said. “And as far as I’m concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that’s what it is. It’s a criminal enterprise,” Trump said alleging that the mainstream media and the Big tech companies were trying to hide the entire corruption.

Panama’s government meanwhile continues to petition the international community to remove it from several tax haven blacklists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arrest-warrants-issued-for-founders-of-panama-papers-firm-report/story-9QH2w7h5WLNtonS3mHYkAK.html
20-10-2020||World||Pakistan lifts ban on TikTok after the Chinese app promises to moderate content||Pakistan’s telecom regulator on Monday announced that it was lifting a ban on popular video-sharing app TikTok. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that the decision was taken after TikTok’s management assured the PTA that it will block all accounts “involved in spreading obscenity and immorality” in the country.The Pakistan telecom body’s decision has come more than a week after it had blocked the Chinese video-sharing platform over “immoral and indecent” content.ByteDance-owned TikTok later said in a statement that it was pleased to see the app unblocked for users in Pakistan. “We appreciate the PTA’s commitment to ongoing productive dialogue and recognise their care for the digital experience of Pakistani users,” it said.The move was widely welcomed in Pakistan where a number of people have turned into stars overnight because of the content they produced and the followers they amassed. Pakistan is TikTok’s 12th largest market and analysts say the popularity of the app grew phenomenally in the country this year during the lengthy coronavirus-related lockdown. The video-sharing app has been downloaded nearly 43 million times in Pakistan, including 14.7 million this year alone, according to data from research firm SensorTower.Amid TikTok’s growing popularity across Pakistan, there have been complaints over some of the content that is shared on the platform. The company’s transparency report shows that it has taken down nearly 6.5 million videos between January and June - the third highest for any country after India and the US.The report also shows that the Pakistani government had reported 40 accounts to TikTok over content it didn’t agree with, but only two of those accounts were removed or restricted by the app.Pakistan closely monitors online content and has put in place regulation that asks digital platforms to remove content that the government finds objectionable. In September, the government said it blocked access to the dating apps Tinder, Tagged, Skout, Grindr and SayHi for what it called “immoral and indecent content”. The government had also blocked YouTube from 2012 to 2016 reportedly over blasphemous content that hadn’t been removed by the platform at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-lifts-ban-on-tiktok-after-the-chinese-app-promises-to-moderate-content/story-wYAnsktgpFYhlsDIcAjiTN.html

20-10-2020||World||‘Running Angry’: Trump attacks Dr. Fauci, press and polls||An angry President Donald Trump came out swinging Monday against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the press and polls that show him trailing Democrat Joe Biden in key battleground states in a disjointed closing message two weeks out from Election Day.On the third day of a western campaign swing, Trump was facing intense pressure to turn around his campaign, hoping for the type of last-minute surge that gave him a come-from-behind victory four years ago. But his inconsistent message, another rise in virus cases and his attacks on experts like Fauci could undermine his final efforts to appeal to voters outside his most loyal base.“I’m not running scared,” Trump told reporters before taking off for Tucson, Arizona, for his fifth rally in three days. “I think I’m running angry. I’m running happy and I’m running very content ‘cause I’ve done a great job.”His aggressive travel comes as Trump plays defense in states he won four years ago, though the president insisted he was confident as he executed a packed schedule despite the pandemic.“We’re going to win,” he told campaign staff on a morning conference call from Las Vegas. He went on to acknowledge that he “wouldn’t have told you that maybe two or three weeks ago,” referring to the days when he was hospitalized with Covid-19. But he said he felt better now than at any point in 2016. “We’re in the best shape we’ve ever been,” he said.Seeking to shore up the morale of his staff amid growing private concerns that he is running out of time to make up lost ground, Trump blasted his government’s own scientific experts as too negative, even as his handling of the pandemic that has killed nearly 220,000 Americans remains a central issue to voters.“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” Trump said of the government’s top infectious disease expert. “Every time he goes on television, there’s always a bomb. But there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci’s a disaster.”At a rally in Prescott, Arizona, Trump assailed Biden for pledging to heed the advice of scientific experts, saying dismissively that his rival “wants to listen to Dr. Fauci.”The doctor is both respected and popular, and Trump’s rejection of scientific advice on the pandemic has already drawn bipartisan condemnation.At his rally, Trump also ramped up his attacks on the news media, singling out NBC’s Kristen Welker, the moderator of the next presidential debate, as well as CNN for aggressively covering a pandemic that is now infecting tens of thousands of Americans every day.Fauci, in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, said he was not surprised that Trump contracted the virus after he held a series of large events with few face coverings.“I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Fauci said of the president.Biden was off the campaign trail Monday, but his campaign praised Fauci and criticized Trump for “reckless and negligent leadership” that “threatens to put more lives at risk.”“Trump’s closing message in the final days of the 2020 race is to publicly mock Joe Biden for trusting science and to call Dr. Fauci, the leading public health official on Covid-19, a ‘disaster’ and other public health officials ‘idiots,’“ the campaign said.Monday’s professed confidence in victory stood in contrast to some of Trump’s other public comments in recent days reflecting on the prospect that he could lose.“Could you imagine if I lose my whole life? What am I going to do?” he asked a rally crowd last week in Macon, Georgia. “I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country. I don’t know.”Biden, meanwhile, was in Delaware for several days of preparation ahead of Thursday’s final presidential debate. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, returned to the campaign trail after several days in Washington after a close adviser tested positive for the coronavirus.Late Monday, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced that Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off in Thursday’s debate while his rival delivers his opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics.The rule changes come three weeks after a chaotic opening faceoff between the two presidential contenders that featured frequent interruptions — most often by Trump. The open discussion portion of the debate will not feature a mute button, but interruptions by either candidate will count toward their time.The commission has faced pressure from the Trump campaign to avoid changing the rules, while Biden’s team was hoping for a more ordered debate. In a statement, the commission said it “had determined that it is appropriate to adopt measures intended to promote adherence to agreed upon rules and inappropriate to make changes to those rules.”Trump’s campaign said he would participate in the debate despite his concerns about the new rule.“I just think it’s very unfair,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from Arizona. “I will participate but it’s very unfair that they changed the topics and it’s very unfair that again, we have an anchor who’s totally biased.”In addition to public polling that indicates Biden has an edge, the former vice president enjoys another considerable advantage: money.Over the past four months, Biden has raised over $1 billion, a massive amount of money that has significantly eclipsed Trump’s once-overwhelming cash advantage.That’s become apparent in advertising, where Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to spend twice as much as Trump and the Republicans in the closing days of the race, according to data from the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.“We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who insisted Trump has the advantage with the campaign’s field staff and data targeting.Though Trump has pulled back from advertising in Midwestern states that secured his 2016 win, he’s invested heavily elsewhere, including North Carolina, where he is on pace to slightly outspend Biden.Concerns about a possible loss to Biden that have been spilling into the open in recent days have been percolating behind the scenes at the Trump campaign. Trump himself has alternated between disbelief and anger at the idea that he could lose to a candidate whom he views as washed up and incompetent, according to three campaign and White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.Trump has directed anger at press coverage but also has vented about his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, whom he blames for mishandling his hospitalization for the virus and Covid relief talks.He has asked some of his closest advisers if a campaign shakeup was needed, according to the officials. The president was encouraged to hold off on any moves so close to Election Day.Meanwhile, aides have started privately wondering whether or not Trump’s campaign rallies, which have helped define American politics for the last five years, were in their final days.In recent weeks, meanwhile, some White House staff offices have also tried to rotate in aides who have never flown on Air Force One or have done so infrequently so they can do so before Election Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/running-angry-trump-attacks-dr-fauci-press-and-polls/story-5mzaCzr4w2yfhIraPZhGdO.html
20-10-2020||World||Justin Trudeau’s party counters opposition’s WE probe move with snap poll threat||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party has pitched the possibility of calling snap polls if the opposition goes ahead with an attempt to form a parliamentary body to examine potential corruption and conflict of interest related to the grant of a billion-dollar project to a charity with links to the PM and his family.The opposition’s motion seeking to form a 15-member committee is expected later this week. However, Trudeau’s party has warned that if the motion is passed, it could lead to early elections. Pablo Rodriguez, leader of the government in the House of Commons, made this point in a letter to the leaders of the opposition parties, saying, “If passed, the proposal will raise serious questions about whether the House of Commons continues to have confidence in the government.” Instead, he proposed to form a 12-member committee with a “the mandate to conduct hearings to examine and review all aspects of the government’s spending in response to the pandemic”. Unlike the committee proposed by the opposition, this one would have an equal number of Liberal Party members, even though the government has a minority status in the House.Gérard Deltell, leader of the opposition Conservative Party in the House, criticised the government’s stance. He told the daily National Post, “To threaten to plunge the country into a general election while Canada is in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic, all because you want to avoid some tough questions, is simply reckless and irresponsible.”The latest confrontation is over the opposition seeking to investigate the project related to student volunteerism granted during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic to WE Charity. It later emerged that Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother had been paid thousands of Canadian dollars for appearances at events conducted by the organisation. Trudeau later apologised for not recusing himself when the cabinet cleared the proposal. The grant was scrapped after the controversy erupted. The Canadian PM also made an appearance before a parliamentary committee on this issue and is being investigated by the country’s conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. The ruling party, meanwhile, is also against the opposition’s demand seeking details of fees paid to Trudeau’s family. In his letter, Rodriguez said, “We will continue to oppose efforts by the opposition to force private citizens, including the extended family of politicians, to divulge personal financial information. This demand goes too far.”Canada, meanwhile, is seeing a peak in new coronavirus cases, though with a lower number of fatalities. Rodriguez, however, used the argument of the renewed challenge to combat the virus to counter the opposition’s demand for the formation of a special committee. He said in Ottawa, “When you’re asking the government to concentrate all their efforts on what is requested by this committee instead of fighting the pandemic, or instead of being there for Canadian households, we think that it’s extremely irresponsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-party-counters-opposition-s-we-probe-move-with-snap-poll-threat/story-ux9VVfoHKTG5frBpgQGNbI.html

20-10-2020||World||Trump-Biden debate: Candidates’ mics to be muted at the start of each segment||New rules have been announced for the final presidential debate between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden that will see the opponent’s microphone muted during the initial comments of every segment in order to allow the candidates uninterrupted speaking time.The decision was announced by the US commission on presidential debates. The in-person face-off is scheduled for Friday morning, India time, at Belmont University in Nashville.At the debate, Trump and Biden will get two minutes each to answer, without interruptions, the opening question of each of the six 15-minute segments. “The only candidate whose microphone will be open during these two-minute periods is the candidate who has the floor under the rules,” the commission said. Both the microphones, however, will remain open for follow-up questions or exchanges between them.The opening presidential debate had devolved into a shouting match. Trump and Biden had repeatedly interrupted each other and talked over each other. The second scheduled debate was cancelled after Trump pulled out when it was turned into a virtual event forced by the US president’s Covid-19 illness.Now recovered, Trump has appeared eager to take on Biden and will seek to change the course of the race that has seen him trailing by double digits in some polls.On Monday, the US president opened up a new line of attack against Biden, accusing the Democrat of listening to Dr Anthony Fauci, the top American epidemiologist, suggesting that it wasn’t the right thing to do. “You know, Biden wants to lock it down,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Prescott, Arizona, referring to the debate on the need for more curbs to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump added, seeking to mock Biden, “He wants to listen to Dr Fauci. He wants to listen to Dr Fauci.”Biden, who has been calling for the Trump administration to listen to Dr Fauci, welcomed the charge with a one-word tweet: “…yes”.Dr Fauci, when asked to respond to Trump’s earlier charge that he was a “disaster”, cited the 1972 crime film, The Godfather, to say “Nothing personal, strictly business” – in a reference to actor Al Pacino in the protagonist Michael Corleone’s role arguing to volunteer to kill two men who tried to kill his father.Failing to stop the spread of Covid-19, which has killed more than 218,000 Americans and infection more than 8 million, and frustrated by the shadow it has cast on his re-election chances, the American president has indiscriminately attacked all his targets. He has questioned the science behind mitigation measures, argued that face masks are not as effective as they are said to be, and has attacked public health officials who have refused to toe his line.During a conference call with his campaign staff earlier on Monday, Trump had said, “People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people - these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci is a nice guy, he’s been here for 500 years; he called every one of them wrong. Fauci is a disaster. I mean, this guy, if I listened to him, we would have 500,000 deaths.”Trump was ticked off reportedly at a Sunday interview in which Dr Fauci had said that he was not surprised when the US president contracted the disease because of a super-spreader event that the White house had hosted recently to announce Trump’s pick for a Supreme Court judge.Trump’s handling of the pandemic is a key issue in the 2020 White House race with 57.5% of Americans disapproving of it, according to the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls – one of the reasons why he trails Biden in national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-debate-candidates-mics-to-be-muted-at-the-start-of-each-segment/story-wg6yIkuntPB20Mcq2hnHPP.html
20-10-2020||World||Argentina passes 1 million cases as coronavirus hits Latin America||At the edge of Argentina in a city known as “The End of the World,” many thought they might be spared from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.Sitting far from the South American nation’s bustling capital, health workers in Ushuaia were initially able to contain a small outbreak among foreigners hoping to catch boats to the Antarctic at the start of the crisis.But as Argentina passed 1 million virus cases Monday, it is now smaller cities like Ushuaia that are seeing some of the most notable upticks. Doctors have had to quadruple the number of beds for Covid-19 patients over the last month. At least 60% of those tested recently are coming back positive for the virus.“We were the example of the country,” said Dr. Carlos Guglielmi, director of the Ushuaia Regional Hospital. “Evidently someone arrived with the coronavirus.”Across Latin America, three other nations are expected to reach the 1 million case milestone in the coming weeks — Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The grim mark comes as Latin America continues to register some of the world’s highest daily case counts. And though some nations have seen important declines, overall there has been little relief, with cases dropping in one municipality only to escalate in another.The trajectory is showing that the pandemic is likely to leave no corner of Latin America unscathed.“The second wave is arriving without ever having finished the first,” said Dr. Luis Jorge Hernández, a public health professor at the University of the Andes in Colombia.Argentina has seen cases spiral despite instituting one of the world’s longest lockdowns. Colombia’s major cities have seen a dip, but smaller areas like the department of Caldas in the coffee region are only now reaching a peak. Peru’s overall numbers have dropped, but officials recently reported 12 regions are spiking back up. Mexico, likewise, has seen a rise in a quarter of all states over the last week.The result is that rather than a second virus wave like that being seen in Europe, epidemiologists anticipate a more sustained, plateau-like trend.“Our countries are still getting out of the first wave,” said Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization’s Department of Communicable Diseases. “A great part of the population remains exposed and community transmission continues.”The virus’ cruel path through Latin America is a consequence of weak public health systems, social factors like poverty and poor government decisions early on that resulted in flawed or limited testing and little contact tracing. Today the region is home to half the 10 countries with the highest total cases around the globe.Argentina initially registered low virus case numbers but now has one of the highest rates of new daily infections per capita, according to Our World in Data, a non-profit online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford. It is on par with several European countries that are experiencing a resurgence of the virus.Dr. Adolfo Rubinstein, a former Argentine health minister, said the nation depended too heavily on lockdowns as its primary means of controlling the virus, failing to purchase enough tests in the initial months of the pandemic.Where the virus is appearing is also shifting. Initially, up to 90% of the confirmed cases were in metropolitan Buenos Aires. Today, 65% of Argentina’s cases are in its provinces and even faraway places like Ushuaia, authorities said.“Now it is everywhere in the country,” Rubinstein said.Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, director of the Americas branch of the World Health Organization, warned recently that the coronavirus is appearing in places that were previously not affected, with high numbers popping up in regions like the English-speaking Caribbean.“In many countries, the pandemic has also moved to less populated areas,” she said.That can be seen not just in Argentina but in Colombia as well. The city of Manizales in a region known for its coffee farms now registers 440.98 cases per 100,000 residents, far higher than the nationwide average of 284.09 per 100,000, according to the Ministry of Health. Officials say the slower rise in cases allowed them to expand ICU capacity.“Here we didn’t have a peak like in Europe,” Hernández said. “We had a plateau.”Throughout the region, testing remains a hurdle. In Peru, officials have relied heavily on antibody tests to identify cases — even though the tests are not designed to make a diagnosis because they can only detect proteins that develop a week or more after infection. Argentina’s testing is still far below that of neighboring countries; on Sunday, just 13,890 were tested, compared to 31,988 the same day in Colombia.The high percentage coming back positive in Argentina suggests the country is still likely missing vast numbers of infections.Brazil reached 1 million cases in June and now is up to 5.2 million for the pandemic.“These are huge undercounts of what is really going on in terms of numbers,” said Felicia Knaul, director of the Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas at the University of Miami. “We need more consistent mask use — but we have to couple that with testing and tracing — or else the numbers are going to rise tremendously.”In Ushuaia, officials believe truckers carrying in produce from the Buenos AIres region may be responsible for the rise in cases since mid-September. The city famous as a departure point for cruises to the Antarctic had been a model for the nation. Closed off air travel and a halt on tourism left it virus free for months.But that false sense of comfort may have led people to relax on basic pandemic norms like hand washing and social distancing. The Tierra del Fuego province, which has a population of about 150,000, now has over 8,000 confirmed cases.In Ushuaia, anxious residents line up in their cars for drive-thru testing. A sports center that had been empty is now set up to take care of patients. One month ago, the regional hospital was treating just seven Covid-19 patients; now it has 28, occupying all of its bed set aside for adults with the illness.“The failure in Argentina was the low amount of testing,” Guglielmi said.José Bongiovanni, a lawyer in Ushuaia, said a worry that seemed distant now feels close.“Living at the end of the world was never easy,” he said. “It’s a lot less easy in a moment like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentina-passes-1-million-cases-as-coronavirus-hits-latin-america/story-NQkCTDOQ1IrZq0K7buHpmM.html
20-10-2020||World||H-1B lawsuit filed against US Department of Labour||Seventeen individuals and organisations, including universities and businesses, have filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Labour challenging its recent Interim Final Rule on wages related to H-1B visas.The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday alleged that the poorly-drafted and improperly-issued rule did not comply with the procedural rules for rule-making and is substantively arbitrary, incorrect and irrational. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. It is most sought-after among Indian IT professionals.“The increase to the prevailing wages will manifestly not benefit US economic growth or any workers; study after study has shown that H-1B visa holders create American jobs,” Jesse Bless, director of federal litigation at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), claimed.The regulation, he said, has caused immediate and unnecessary harm in every corner of the economy, including academic institutions, non-profits, hospitals, start-ups and small businesses.“Frankly, the last thing we need during a (Covid-19) pandemic and economic turmoil is a rule based on a false and incorrect understanding of the market and American workforce. This will impede our economic recovery, not enhance it,” Bless said.Early this month, the Department of Labour published a rule to appropriately identify wage levels for H-1B holders and other foreign labour programmes, which according to the White House will improve the quality of H-1B workers and better reflect wages paid to similarly employed workers in the US.The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, the White House argued.Among those who have filed the lawsuit are Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Denver, Chapman University, Bard College, International Institute of New England, Information Technology Industry Council, Arizona State University, Scripps College, Northern Arizona University, Indiana University, Study Mississippi, Dentists for America, Physicians for American Healthcare and Hodges Bonded Warehouse.Jeff Joseph, Senior Partner of Joseph and Hall, in a statement alleged that dealing with the Department of Labour often feels like “The Hunger Games”.“Everyone is required to play the game, but no one knows the rules and the rules are constantly changing. This is not a game. The fact that the rule was made effective without thinking about the destructive impact it would have on industries and the economy illustrates how out of touch this administration is regarding the symbiotic relationship between legal immigration and the economy,” he said.The days when the federal government blatantly ignores the law in its rule-making are over, said Charles Kuck, managing partner of Kuck Baxter Immigration. US universities, employers, and healthcare systems can no longer stand by and watch while the US immigration system is dismantled by a nativist administration and in contravention of federal law, he said.Aside from the blatantly unlawful way, the Department of Labour dropped this rule on the economy, its basic premise is also wholly incorrect, alleged Greg Siskind, founding partner of Siskind Susser.“The workers impacted are in occupations with extraordinarily low unemployment. And as we show in the complaint, these outstanding immigrants are doing critical work benefiting everyday Americans, whether it is providing critical research to cure disease, making our country globally competitive, providing medical and dental care to rural Americans, or caring for our country’s senior citizens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-lawsuit-filed-against-us-department-of-labour/story-kQ92UMZYSftU4NYPobii0K.html

The five civilian porters from the Tagin tribe of Arunachal Pradesh had gone missing in early September.Ahead of their release in the second week of September, state-run nationalistic tabloid Global Times claimed in a report that the five were “spies” working for the Indian Army.The five had disguised themselves as “hunters”, the report said, quoting an anonymous source, adding that they were “India’s intelligence staff”.“They recently trespassed the China-India border and entered the Shannan prefecture of Tibet,” the report claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-soldier-went-missing-looking-for-yaks-hope-india-returns-him-soon-says-china/story-XFah5ImYMHYMTDrpCPyIPO.html
20-10-2020||World||China’s leisure spending remains drag on growth amid recovery||China’s hotels and restaurants, one of the hardest-hit sectors of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, remained a significant drag on growth in the third quarter even as the recovery gained momentum.Output in the sector fell 5.1% from a year ago, the statistics bureau said Tuesday in a supplemental report on gross domestic product. That was smaller than the 18% decline in the second quarter. For the first nine months of the year, the sector’s output was down 19.1% compared to the same period in 2019.Gross domestic product data released Monday showed consumption in China continued to improve in September as virus-related restrictions eased further and consumer confidence picked up. However, spending hasn’t returned to pre-Covid levels, with retail sales in the first nine months of the year down about 7% compared with the same period last year.China’s Third Quarter Gross Domestic Product: Details (Table)Leasing and commercial services was the worst performer last quarter, declining 6.9% from a year ago. The information technology sector continued to outperform, rising 18.8%.Growth in the construction sector remained solid, rising 8.1% in the quarter from a year ago, reflecting strong credit support from the government to boost infrastructure and a buoyant property market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-leisure-spending-remains-drag-on-growth-amid-recovery/story-ODQWd1phx3ZQBYf1MZGVCM.html

20-10-2020||World||Ireland imposes some of Europe’s toughest Covid-19 curbs||Ireland announced some of Europe’s toughest Covid-19 constraints on Monday, shutting non-essential retail, limiting restaurants and pubs to take away service and telling people not to travel more than five kilometres (3 miles) from their home.Ireland imposed one of Europe’s longest lockdowns during the first surge in coronavirus cases and eased restrictions at such a cautious pace that pubs that only serve drinks in Dublin had not reopened by the time a rise in infections prompted a tightening of curbs.This time, schools will stay open and essential services such as construction are allowed to continue, prime minister Micheal Martin said, as he moved the country to the highest level of restrictions, Level 5, for six weeks from midnight Wednesday. Hotels may remain open, but only if their rooms are needed by essential workers.“The evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead is now too strong,” Martin said in a televised address, two weeks after rejecting what was then seen as a surprise call by health chiefs to move to Level 5, marking the first time ministers went against their advice.Martin said the government’s aim was to return to Level 3 by Dec. 1. That would allow all retailers to reopen and restaurants to serve 15 customers outdoors. Even then, another lockdown could not be ruled out in 2021, he added.“WE NEED A VACCINE”While countries struggling with high rates of infection like Belgium, the Netherlands and France have shut bars, restaurants and imposed a nighttime curfew, none have such strict travel restrictions within the country.Harder hit Northern Ireland last week shut schools for two weeks and restaurants for four, although most retailers remain open. In Wales, people have been asked to stay at home in a two-week “fire-break” lockdown announced on Monday.On Sunday, Ireland broke its single-day record for new for the fifth time in nine days, and has the 12th highest rate among the 31 countries monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. To cushion the blow, the government will increase the amount it contributes to coronavirus-related jobless payments and wage subsidies until Jan. 31. Last week’s budget, the biggest stimulus package in the history of the state, introduced much larger grants of up to 5,000 euros ($5,884.50) per week for shuttered or battered businesses. The supports will cost about 1.5 billion euros for six weeks, based on a forecast that around 150,000 people will be temporarily laid off on top of the 40,000 let go in the last two weeks, deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar said.The jobless rate, including those on the emergency payment, stood at 14.7% last month. The finance ministry forecast that the economy could contract again next year if there is a prolonged period of stringent restrictions.“We can do it this year, we can do it next year,” Martin said of financial support for the economy, adding, “We need a vaccine next year.”  (Writing by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Hugh Lawson and Bill Berkrot)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-imposes-some-of-europe-s-toughest-covid-19-curbs/story-35EXsDKVPSMkKrjfgsaYlM.html

Both microphones will be turned on to allow a back-and-forth after that time.Trump’s campaign objected to the change but said he would still take part.“President Trump is committed to debating Joe Biden regardless of last-minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favored candidate,” campaign manager Bill Stepien said.The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest developments.The news came the day the number of Americans voting early ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3 crossed the 30 million mark and as Trump tries to reframe a contest in which national and state opinion polls show him trailing.Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden during a chaotic and ill-tempered debate on Sept. 29, and Biden responded with insults. Trump backed out of a second scheduled debate set for last Thursday over a disagreement about the virtual format following his COVID-19 infection. At that time, he raised concerns about having his microphone muted. “You sit behind a computer and do a debate - it’s ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want,” Trump said in an Oct. 8 interview on Fox Business.On Monday, Trump’s campaign said it was unhappy with the announced set of topics for Thursday’s debate, arguing that it should focus more on foreign policy and complaining that the nonpartisan group was tilted toward Biden. Biden’s campaign said both sides previously agreed to let moderators choose the subjects. It said Trump wanted to avoid discussing his stewardship of the coronavirus pandemic, which surveys show is the top issue for voters.“As usual, the president is more concerned with the rules of a debate than he is getting a nation in crisis the help it needs,” Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-objects-mute-button-in-presidential-debate-but-confirms-participation/story-oMIfXDORFl0hj9D4rK5rbL.html
20-10-2020||World||Major 7.5 magnitude quake off Alaska triggers small tsunami waves||A major 7.5-magnitude quake off the coast of Alaska triggered small tsunami waves Monday, US agencies said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.Residents evacuated to higher ground as tsunami warnings covered much of the southern coast of the remote US state, including the thinly populated Alaska Peninsula, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Two-foot waves were recorded at the tiny nearby city of Sand Point, some 60 miles (100km) from the epicenter of the quake which struck at a depth of 25 miles (40 km).The at-risk zone extended hundreds of miles northeast to the entry of the Cook Inlet.But it stopped short of the state’s largest city of Anchorage, located some 600 miles (1,000 km) from the epicenter and at the end of that gulf.And the tsunami warning was downgraded to a less-severe advisory, with NOAA stating that affected areas “should not expect widespread inundation.”The earthquake itself was felt in the nearby Alaska Peninsula community of King Cove, but everything seemed to be intact, city administrator Gary Hennigh told the Anchorage Daily News. Cold Bay resident Michael Ashley said the quake was “a pretty good ride.”“All the couches, recliners and bookcases were moving around, and I had to pretty much hold one of them up,” he told the newspaper.There was “a low likelihood of casualties and damage” from the quake itself, the United States Geological Survey said.The major quake was followed by at least five aftershocks of 5.0-magnitude or higher.Monday’s quake came nearly three months after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck a close by region.Alaska is part of the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.The US state was hit by a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in March 1964, the strongest ever recorded in North America.It devastated Anchorage and unleashed a tsunami that slammed the Gulf of Alaska, the US west coast, and Hawaii.More than 250 people were killed by the quake and the tsunami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-7-5-magnitude-quake-off-alaska-triggers-small-tsunami-waves/story-dqxABZX4Rbk5KVLZ2gd3xK.html
20-10-2020||World||10 residents dead amid Covid-19 outbreak at Kansas nursing home||A coronavirus outbreak has killed 10 residents in a nursing home in a northwestern Kansas county that proportionally already had the nation’s largest increase in cases over two weeks.The health department in Norton County reported Monday night that all 62 residents and an unspecified number of employees at the Andbe Home in Norton had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The agency also said one Andbe Home resident was hospitalized, while the remaining 51 were being treated at the home.“Steps are being taken to prevent any further outbreak, including quarantining residents in their rooms and not allowing outside visitors into the facility,” the county health department said in a statement Monday evening.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe outbreak at the nursing home came after the state Department of Health and Environment last week reported more than 100 cases at the state’s prison in Norton over the two weeks ending Wednesday.Kansas is seeing an average of more than 700 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases a day, its largest numbers since the pandemic reached the state in early March.But northwestern Kansas has been hit hard by coronavirus in recent weeks, and Norton County had the largest number of new cases per 100,000 residents of any county in the US for the two weeks ending Sunday, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.The Kansas health department said that cases in Norton County rose from 46 two weeks ago to 340 as of Monday in Norton County. With about 5,400 residents, that was an increase of 5,484 cases per 100,000 residents, according to the state’s figures.But the state released its report before Norton County officials confirmed that all Andbe Home residents had tested positive for coronavirus and before local officials reported 10 deaths at the home.The 15 counties in the state’s northwest corner together had 987 new coronavirus cases during the past two weeks, an increase of nearly 49%, to bring the total to 3,024, according to state health department data. With 80,000 people living in the region, the increase was 1,226 cases for every 100,000 residents, more than three times the state’s figure.Two other northwest Kansas counties, Sheridan and Gove, also were among the top 20 counties in the nation for the largest proportional increases in cases for the two weeks ending Sunday, based on Johns Hopkins data.Also Read: World struggles as Covid-19 infections cross 40 millionThe state health department reported Monday that Kansas had 2,113 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases since Friday, an increase of 3% that brought the pandemic total to 72,968. The department also reported 13 additional Covid-19-related deaths, bringing the total to 872 before the nursing home deaths in Norton were reported.Kansas had an average of 729 new cases a day for the seven days ending Monday after first exceeding 700 cases a day for the seven days ending Oct. 12. The record is 743 cases for the seven days ending Wednesday.The state on Monday also reported its first Covid-19-related staff death at one of its four hospitals for the mentally ill or the developmentally disabled.The Department for Aging and Disability Services, which oversees the hospitals, said an employee at the state’s mental hospital in Larned in southwestern Kansas died last week but said the staffer had not been on hospital grounds for several weeks. The department did not identify the staffer.In Olathe in the Kansas City area, a middle school classroom assistant died from Covid-19-related complications, KCTV reported. Mission Trail Middle School’s principal said in an email to parents that the staffer had been sick for several weeks and had not been in the building since Sept. 24.Meanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly and Wichita State University officials celebrated the opening of a new laboratory that can run 32,000 coronavirus testing specimens a week. Kansas has averaged about 29,000 tests a week over the past month, according to data from the state health department.Kelly said the high-capacity lab will help the state identify coronavirus hot spots so that its residents can avoid them.“We can help provide certainty that our schools and our businesses can stay open safely,” Kelly said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-residents-dead-amid-covid-19-outbreak-at-kansas-nursing-home/story-H3pKhSfZgrw7vHpxXKDUrM.html
20-10-2020||World||Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthens in central Atlantic||Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthened Monday morning in the central Atlantic, the latest in what has been a very active hurricane season.The storm had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), up slightly from when it formed hours earlier. Additional strengthening was expected and Epsilon was forecast to be at or near hurricane strength by early Thursday, the US National Hurricane Center said.The storm was centered Monday afternoon about 730 miles (1,180 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda and was stationary. A slow northward motion is expected during the night, forecasters said, adding the storm was then expected to take a more northwestward track as it approaches Bermuda by Thursday.This year’s hurricane season has had so many storms that the Hurricane Center has turned to the Greek alphabet for storm names after running out of official names.Epsilon also represents a record for the earliest 26th named storm, beating out Nov. 22 in 2005, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-epsilon-strengthens-in-central-atlantic/story-HFYq9FDDjK59Wc3KscS9CJ.html
20-10-2020||World||Cambridge study shows Millennials’ dissatisfied with democracy||Young people are less satisfied with democracy and more disillusioned than at any other time in the past century, especially in Europe, North America, Africa and Australia, a study by the University of Cambridge has found.Millennials, or those born between 1981 and 1996, are more disillusioned than Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1981, or Baby Boomers born between 1944 and 1964 and the Interwar Generation of 1918-1943.“Across the world, younger generations are not only more dissatisfied with democratic performance than the old, but also more discontented than previous generations at similar life stages,” the Cambridge study found.The picture is bad in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, France, Australia and the United Kingdom.But satisfaction has increased in Germany, South Korea and many of the post-Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.The main reason behind the disillusion with democracy among young people was inequality of wealth and income, the report said, citing figures showing that Millennials make up around a quarter of the U.S. population but hold just 3% of the wealth. Baby Boomers held 21% of the wealth at the same age.The study suggested that the populist challenge to mainstream, “establishment” politics could actually help improve democratic engagement by shocking moderate parties and leaders into reversing the decay.The Cambridge Centre for the Future of Democracy delved into data from over 4.8 million respondents collected across 160 countries between 1973 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-study-shows-millennials-dissatisfied-with-democracy/story-YkmS3oGXXJK9Bilq7Id2JO.html
20-10-2020||World||France: Police crackdown after beheading of teacher||French police on Monday raided Islamic associations and foreigners suspected of extremist religious beliefs, police sources said, three days after a suspected Islamist beheaded a school teacher.History teacher Samuel Paty, 47, was murdered on Friday in broad daylight outside his school in a middle-class Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police.The assassin sought to avenge his victim’s use of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of expression to 13-year-olds. Public figures called the killing an attack on French values. Interior minister Gerald Darmanin said there were some 80 investigations being conducted into online hate and that he was looking into whether to disband about 50 associations within the Muslim community.“Police operations have taken place and more will follow, concerning tens of individuals,” the minister told Europe 1.A police source said France was preparing to deport 213 foreigners who were on a government watch list and suspected of holding extreme religious beliefs, among whom about 150 are serving jail sentences. French authorities said they detained 11 people following the killing. Darmanin said they include the father of a student and an Islamist activist who along with the attacker “obviously launched a fatwa”, or religious ruling, against the teacher.A judicial source told Reuters the man known to the intelligence agencies was Moroccan-born Abdelhakim Sefriuoi. French President Emmanuel Macron held a defence council on Sunday at the Elysee presidential palace. The government will reinforce security at schools when classes resume on November 2, Macron’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-police-crackdown-after-beheading-of-teacher/story-BqlNR67QowMPdkcm97KP2I.html
20-10-2020||World||Pakistan police briefly detain Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law||Pakistani police on Monday briefly detained the son-in-law of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, allegedly forcing their way into his hotel room in Karachi, just hours after a massive rally was held in the port city by a joint opposition front that seeks the ouster of the Imran Khan government.“Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested” Muhammad Safdar Awan, said Maryam Nawaz, PML-N vice-president, who had addressed the rally on Sunday. She said she was asleep when the police “barged in” her hotel room where she was staying with her husband.She alleged that Karachi police were being used by “unknown but known forces” to suppress their voice, implying that the military had a hand in her husband’s arrest. Safar was freed later after a court granted him bail, his party and family said. The 11-party Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) claimed earlier that the provincial police chief of Sindh was kidnapped by paramilitary forces and made to register cases against him and 200 others, including Maryam Nawaz. Safdar on Sunday had visited the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s founder, and led a crowd in chanting, “Give respect to the vote.” That slogan was viewed as criticism of Pakistan’s military, which ruled the country directly or indirectly for much of its history. Also, chanting political slogans at Jinnah’s tomb is widely considered a taboo. Police say they arrested Safdar after receiving a complaint from a citizen.At Sunday’s rally, Maryam attacked Prime Minister Imran Khan. “When you are pressed for answers, you hide behind the armed forces. You coward! You bring the army into disrepute. You use them (the army) to hide your own failures. Who gave you this right?” she said. Maryam also responded to comments made by Khan a day earlier. “You tell people not to worry because there’s been only one rally. But you are already worried.” She asked him to not think about banning PML-N, asserting that it’s the country’s biggest political party. She was softer towards the military, saying the PDM was not against the army but only a few generals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-police-briefly-detain-nawaz-sharif-s-son-in-law/story-1uSlx5ii0pVUEttBvZ8USK.html
20-10-2020||World||World struggles as Covid-19 infections cross 40 million||Countries are struggling to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic as global cases topped 40 million, with Wales ordering a two-week shutdown, Belgium warning of a virus tsunami, and Poland turning a national stadium into a field hospital.With cases soaring in all but eight of its 50 states, the US homeland security department announced that its land borders with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to all non-essential travel till November 21.Experts said that the new grim milestone in global cases is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the true impact of the pandemic that has upended life and work around the world. The actual worldwide tally is likely to be far higher as testing has been variable, many people have had no symptoms, and some governments have concealed the true number of cases. To date, over 1.1 million confirmed Covid-19 deaths have been reported. Wales announced a two-week “short, sharp” lockdown from Friday to break the cycle of transmission, as the number of new cases continued to surge in the United Kingdom.Calling it a “firebreak”, first minister of the Labour-led Welsh government, Mark Drakeford, announced on Monday that for the two weeks, everyone will need to stay at home. All businesses will be shut. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs of Sunday evening, the UK recorded 16,982 new cases and 67 deaths. Overall, there have been 57,690 deaths and 722,049 cases in the country.Bars and restaurants across Belgium shut down for a month and a night-time curfew took effect on Monday as health authorities warned of a possible “tsunami” of new cases. “We are really very close to a tsunami,” Belgium’s health minister Frank Vandenbroucke said. Poland is opening a field hospital at Warsaw’s national stadium and will bring in the army to handle drive-through coronavirus testing facilities amid a surge in new infections that threatens to overwhelm the health care system.Switzerland has made mask-wearing compulsory in indoor public spaces and put limits on public gatherings after infections doubled in a week.South Africa’s health minister Zweli Mkhize and his wife have tested positive for Covid-19, as he warned of a possible resurgence of the disease in the country.Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, hospitalised in Israel with Covid-19, was placed on a ventilator on Monday after his condition deteriorated.Russia reported almost 16,000 new cases on Monday, the highest single-day rise so far. For the fifth time in two weeks, Iran reported a record number of daily deaths linked to the virus, with 337 fatalities. The UN said it would stockpile one billion syringes around the world by the end of 2021, to be used for the delivery of any future Covid-19 vaccine. Unicef said it aims to get 520 million syringes in its warehouses by the end of this year, to guarantee an initial supply in countries ahead of the vaccine||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-struggles-as-covid-19-infections-cross-40-million/story-F8VzkZwVDSyCyWINO6MfAK.html

20-10-2020||World||Trump lumps Fauci among ‘idiots’ but suggests he won’t fire him||Donald Trump complained to his campaign staff about the government’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, including him among people he considers “idiots,” but said he couldn’t fire him because of public perception.“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” Trump said Monday in a call intended to boost morale at a campaign running well behind his challenger, Joe Biden. Trump’s campaign invited reporters to listen in.“Anytime he goes on television” there’s a “bomb,” Trump told his staff, adding that if he fired Fauci it would be a “bigger bomb.”He claimed without substantiation that “if we listened to him” there would be 700,000 to 800,000 American deaths. More than 220,000 Americans have died so far from the coronavirus pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAfter disparaging Fauci, Trump remarked that he didn’t care whether reporters were on the call.Trump has previously said he accepted Fauci’s recommendations while fighting the pandemic. But Fauci is a strong proponent of public use of face masks, a precaution the president hasn’t followed himself and has discouraged among his staff.Trump’s Monday comments came after Fauci appeared on the CBS program “60 Minutes” and said he wasn’t surprised the president contracted Covid-19. “I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Fauci said.Fauci, who has been a regular presence on TV, said his media interviews had been limited by the White House. He said he wasn’t allowed to go on “many, many, many shows that have asked for me.”Trump tweeted on Monday that Fauci “seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope. All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions.” Trump also said Fauci “threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!” -- a reference to Fauci throwing the ceremonial first pitch of the 2020 Major League Baseball season.The president’s campaign has aired television ads that take remarks by Fauci out of context to suggest he’s complimented Trump’s response to the pandemic. Fauci has publicly objected, saying he’s always been publicly non-partisan, and he’s urged Trump’s campaign to pull the ad.Trump’s closest medical adviser is now Scott Atlas -- a neuroradiologist with no epidemiology expertise affiliated with the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University -- who came to the president’s attention with frequent appearances on Fox News.The Washington Post reported Monday that Atlas has repeatedly sparred with Fauci and Deborah Birx, an epidemiologist who is the White House coronavirus task force coordinator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-lumps-dr-fauci-among-idiots-but-suggests-he-won-t-fire-him/story-X5BivJp2UBVtMJQVZpvFYO.html
20-10-2020||India||Gauhati HC fines Assam forest department Rs 10,000 for non-compliance||The Gauhati High Court on Tuesday fined the Assam forest department Rs 10,000 for failing to file an affidavit in connection with a public interest litigation (PIL) on grant of permission to Oil India Limited (OIL) to drill for hydrocarbons under the Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP). A division bench comprising Chief Justice (acting) NK Singh and Justice Manish Choudhury was hearing the PIL seeking the court’s intervention against the Centre’s permission to OIL to drill inside DSNP by doing away with public hearings under the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, 2020. During the last hearing on September 30, the court had issued notices to all 14 respondents including the Centre and Assam government to file affidavits before the next date of hearing. The court had directed the respondents to also mention in their affidavits on whether a Supreme Court order of 2017 asking OIL to carry out a biodiversity impact assessment study through Assam State Biodiversity Board was followed before permission was given to drill at DSNP by Centre in May this year. “On Tuesday, the Assam forest department, one of the respondents, sought more time to file the affidavit. The court immediately imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000 on them for failing to file the affidavit. Though the amount is small, it sends the message that the court has taken the issue seriously,” said Debajit Kumar Das, advocate for the petitioners Mrinmoy Khataniar and Amar Jyoti Deka. The matter has now been fixed for hearing on November 19 for consideration of stay of the environmental clearance given to OIL to drill for hydrocarbons under DNSP. On May 11, the Union forest, environment and climate change ministry had given environmental clearance for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations by OIL under DNSP in Tinsukia district of Assam. Spread over 340 sq km, Dibru-Saikhowa is one of the five national parks in Assam. The park, which is also a biosphere reserve, is home to 36 mammal species including tiger, Gangetic dolphin, feral horses etc. and 382 bird species. Concerns about OIL’s drilling plan soon emerged on social media platforms after the company published an advertisement in newspapers mentioning the environment ministry’s clearance for the project. Reacting to the apprehensions, OIL had clarified in May that the company won’t operate inside the national park and the drilling will have no impact on the area as operation would be conducted through extended reach drilling (ERD). On Monday, the petitioners had filed a fresh affidavit, which sought inclusion of a report submitted by a committee of experts to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in July this year, to be added to the original PIL. The report based on a case pending before NGT regarding compensation for blowout of a natural gas well at Baghjan (close to the DSNP) in May this year indicated that OIL had not complied with SC’s directives of 2017 regarding a biodiversity impact assessment for drilling at the national park. “As on date there appears to be no such biodiversity impact assessment study, either prepared by Assam State Biodiversity Board or any other agency engaged by OIL, on record, till date,” the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-fines-assam-forest-department-rs-10-000-for-non-compliance/story-8uiWlsVU915vEiQS2ZsXZM.html
20-10-2020||India||Law violations cannot be condoned under pretext of human rights : India to UNHCHR chief||India on Tuesday strongly reacted to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet’s concern over restrictions on NGOs and arrest of activists, saying violations of law cannot be condoned under the pretext of human rights and a more informed view of the matter was expected of the UN body.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also asserted that India was a democratic polity based on the rule of law and an independent judiciary.“We have seen some comments by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on an issue relating to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). India is a democratic polity based on the rule of law and an independent judiciary.“The framing of laws is obviously a sovereign prerogative. Violations of law, however, cannot be condoned under the pretext of human rights. A more informed view of the matter was expected of a UN body,” Srivastava said.Earlier, Bachelet expressed concern over the restrictions on foreign funding for the NGOs and the arrest of activists in the country.She appealed to the Indian Government to “safeguard the rights of human rights defenders and NGOs, and their ability to carry out their crucial work” on behalf of the many groups they represent.“India has long had a strong civil society, which has been at the forefront of groundbreaking human rights advocacy within the country and globally,” she said in a statement.“But I am concerned that vaguely defined laws are increasingly being used to stifle these voices,” she said.Bachelet specifically cited as “worrying” the use of the FCRA, which prohibits the receipt of foreign funds “for any activities prejudicial to the public interest.” Also Read | Centre plans crackdown on NGOs over violation of normsAs per the amended FCRA law, furnishing of Aadhaar numbers by office-bearers of NGOs has become mandatory for registration.

20-10-2020||India||Rain, delayed harvest push up onion prices||New Delhi The price of onions has increased sharply in several cities this week, despite the government’s ban on exports imposed last month, as a rain-induced delay in the ongoing summer harvests exacerbated supplies.On Monday, wholesale rates in Lasalgaon, Asia’s largest onion trading hub in Maharahstra’s Nashik, shot up to Rs 6,200 a quintal (100 kg) for some varieties, from Rs 4,700 on Thursday, the last trading day of last week, said Prakash Kumawat, an official of the Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Consequently, retail prices in cities such as Pune, Guwahati and Patna rose to Rs 70, Rs 65 and Rs 60 per kg respectively, up from last week’s prices of Rs 40 to Rs 50, according to market data on Monday. “Rains over the past week in Nashik and Malegaon in Maharashtra and parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have either damaged crops or delayed harvests,” said Sudin Tarle, another official at the Lasalgaon wholesale market. Since the bulb is a common base ingredient of most Indian dishes, and therefore widely consumed, consumers are quite sensitive to a rise in onion prices as compared to many other commodities. Analysts point to a familiar pattern in India’s onion-price spirals. Retail rates soar every alternate year or so, usually at this time of the year. It’s not uncommon for prices to crash either. Onion trade in the country suffers from classic price volatility, a term used for regular patterns of wild swings in prices. It is caused mainly because of supply-disrupting factors such as extreme weather, high losses from inadequate or improper storage or frequently shifting production levels, all of which can cause supplies to go from surplus to scanty in a matter of weeks. The reasons for the current spell of high prices are not very different from those during earlier inflationary periods. While existing stocks from this year’s winter crop have been nearly exhausted—as they are usually are, at this time of the year— fresh harvests have been disrupted. “Onion prices will remain elevated during the festive season. The full year onion output will likely drop by at least 10-15% due to weather-related damage to both the winter and summer crop,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. On September 15, the government banned exports of all varieties as a precautionary step since domestic supplies showed signs of depleting due to a bad winter crop and brisk exports. According to official trade data, the country exported $328 million worth of fresh onions and $ 112 million worth of dried onions in 2019-20. Between April and July 2020, exports of onions to neighbouring Bangladesh soared 157.7%. The government also banned onion exports in 2019 on September 29, 2019, after a bad crop crimped output. In December that year, prices soared to Rs 80 per kg in the national capital. The government lifted the ban on March 15, 2020 before re-imposing it this September.“Prices will stabilise when the late kharif crop is fully harvested. The government is monitoring prices and stocks. Steps like the export ban were initiated well in advance in anticipation of a price rise. If needed, the government import will resort to imports,” said a senior official of the consumer affairs ministry, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-delayed-harvest-push-up-onion-prices/story-i3ZglfgMsDPw9YjWM2zhRK.html
20-10-2020||India||Ghaziabad man held for rape, murder of 2-year-old baby girl||On the day when the district officials were busy spreading awareness on Uttar Pradesh government’s ‘Mission Shakti’, dedicated to women’s safety, a 30-year-old man allegedly raped and murdered a two-and half-year-old baby girl of his colleague on late Monday night. The cops said that based on the complaint filed by the family, they have arrested and booked the suspect under sections for rape and murder of the Indian Penal Code.The gruesome incident took place at a locality under the jurisdiction of Kavi Nagar police station area on Monday night when the girl’s father, the suspect, Chandan Pandey, and one other person, were having drinks nearby after which the suspect went to the victim’s house.“The suspect came to our house and went upstairs. He then came down while the girl was sitting on his shoulders. It was about 8.51 pm and this was captured in CCTV footage. He then took the girl saying that he was taking her out to a local shop. All the family members launched a search when he did not return. Later, we informed the police. During the search late night, my mother spotted a man who was lying on a bed at a shop. When she went near to him, she found that it was the suspect,” said a cousin of the victim.The suspect was nabbed and handed over to the police.“Everyone tried to ask him the whereabouts of the girl but he did not reply. He was then taken away by the police. Around 11.30 am on Tuesday, the cops lured him on pretext of letting him off on the condition of telling them the girl’s location. He then told that he left the girl at a nearby industrial area among a thick growth of trees,” the cousin added.Also read: ‘Largest and toughest to clinch’ - AAP now sets eyes on Uttar PradeshThe scene of crime is near the transport department office in Bulandshahr Industrial Area. The site is adjacent to a road where huge iron sheets, used as raw material in factories, were stacked up on the roadside. The scene of the crime is stated to be about a kilometre away from the victim’s house in an isolated patch which hardly witnesses any commuter movement during night.“The suspect took the girl to the spot. It is such a place that any passerby would not be able to spot what was happening behind the stack of iron sheets. The police found the body of the girl and immediately asked for a cloth. Thereafter, the police covered her body and left immediately. They took her for postmortem,” said the victim’s uncle.“At the scene of the crime, we found three packets of namkeen (snacks) and some coins, which he probably gave to the girl to lure her. The suspect is my brother-in-law’s (girl’s father) colleague and both work at the same factory for past 10-12. He often visited our house and was also known to the girl,” he added.The cops said that based on the complaint of the family, they registered an FIR under IPC section 376ab (punishment for rape on woman under twelve years of age) and 302 (murder), besides levying provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) at Kavi Nagar police station.The cops said that the suspect has so far not revealed any motive behind the incident. They added that there was some altercation between the suspect and the victim’s father about two years ago.“We have registered an FIR based on the complaint given by the family and awaiting postmortem reports of the victim. The FIR is registered for rape and murder. The suspect is a colleague of the victim’s father and also visited their home. The family said that he took the girl from the house and have also alleged rape. We have arrested the suspect and also deployed teams for collection of forensic evidences,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police.On late Tuesday night, the Ghaziabad police, while confirming the case of murder and rape, issued a statement stating, “The postmortem report of the victim stated that the cause of death was asphyxia due to antemortem throttling. Also, the postmortem report indicated evidence of rape.”The suspect is stated to be aged about 30 years and married. The victim’s family is stated to be native of Sitamarhi in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghaziabad-man-held-for-rape-murder-of-2-year-old-baby-girl/story-XpJqDfDcUyRx7Ruw32sDPL.html

20-10-2020||India||Covid-19: ICMR official warns against reinfection after recovery||One may get reinfected with the coronavirus if the antibodies against the infection diminish in the body in five months’ time after recovery, a top ICMR official said on Tuesday, urging people to continue wearing face masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.“We are looking at the data as to how many people got infected, then turned negative and then tested positive again. Typically, we know that antibodies persist for about three to five months.“The CDC has said you call it a reinfection if a person gets reinfected after 90 days. We are looking at the data accordingly, as soon as we have it, we will present it to you,” ICMR Director General Balaram Bhargava said in response to a question at a press conference.Elaborating further, he said some studies have suggested that antibodies last for three months while some others said they may last in the body for up to five months also.It is a new disease and information regarding this is limited as of now, Bhargava said, adding that if antibodies decrease in the body of a person within five months of recovery, there is a possibility of reinfection with Covid-19.“That is why following Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing has to be continued even after recovery,” he said.In a press briefing last week, Bhargava had said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has decided on a 100-day cut-off for re-infection if it occurs as antibodies are also assumed to have a life of four months, according to some studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-icmr-official-warns-against-reinfection-after-recovery/story-cAfiiZlTxYUa6gn1MUevII.html
20-10-2020||India||Centre considers eliminating plasma therapy from Covid-19 clinical management protocol||The Centre is considering to remove convalescent plasma therapy from the national clinical management protocol for Covid-19, a top ICMR official said on Tuesday.Presently, the use of off-label convalescent plasma for treating Covid-19 patients in the moderate stage of the illness is allowed under “investigational therapies”.However, a randomised controlled trial, led by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), on 464 patients in 39 hospitals in 25 districts across 14 states and UTs has shown that plasma therapy does not reduce mortality or prevent progression of Covid-19 from moderate to severe.At a press conference, ICMR Director General Balaram Bhargava said, “We have had discussions in the national taskforce and we are in discussion with the joint monitoring group that this (convalescent plasma therapy) may be deleted from the national guidelines. The discussion is ongoing and more or less we are reaching towards that.” He was responding to a query on continued use of plasma therapy despite the ICMR-led controlled trail revealing otherwise, the result of which has been public.The ‘open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial’ (PLACID Trial) was conducted between April 22 to July 14 to investigate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19.The therapy involves taking anti-bodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those into a Covid-19 patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.On the interim results of WHO Solidarity Trial indicating four repurposed drugs for Covid-19, including remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, have little or no effect on reducing mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay, Bhargava said debate and discussion were ongoing at the National Taskforce and at the Joint Monitoring Group, and advisories would be issued accordingly.“WHO solidarity trial is a 30-country trial in which India has been a participant. Interim results of this have been put on a website, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.“However, we find that these drugs are not performing as we had expected. Debate and discussion are ongoing at the National Taskforce and Joint Monitoring group and we will take into cognizance the results of this trial and issue advisories accordingly,” he said. Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens were tested in 405 hospitals of 30 countries covering 11,266 adults to look into the effects of these treatments on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The trial was conducted from March 22 to October 4.  “Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay,” the study which appeared on medRxiv, a preprint server, on October 15 said.The trial findings are set to be published in the British Medical Journal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-considers-eliminating-plasma-therapy-from-covid-19-clinical-management-protocol/story-WPIMNOR5kkSI8QE90ApbmL.html
20-10-2020||India||Smriti Irani slams Gandhis for ‘not paying attention’ to development of Amethi-Raebareli||Union minister and Amethi MP Smriti Irani attacked the Gandhi family on Tuesday, saying a political family ruled in Rae Bareli and Amethi for a long time, but did not pay attention to the development of the region.“Actual development in Amethi came when the Narendra Modi government came to power at the Centre and the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh,” she told reporters in Amethi.Without naming the Gandhis, Irani said a political family of the country ruled in Amethi and Rae Bareli for a long time, but only did politics and paid no attention to the development of the region.Referring to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath’s jibe at a woman minister from the state, she said it shows the character of Congress leaders.Training her guns on the Gandhis, Irani accused Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra of taking the land of farmers in the name of Samrat bicycle company under a conspiracy.“I am fighting for this for the last six years and these people have not returned the land of the farmers. If they have any sympathy for farmers, they should return the land,” she said.The Union minister for women and child development, however, evaded questions on atrocities on women, especially on cases like the one reported from Hathras, where a 19-year-old Dalit woman died after allegedly being raped by four upper-caste men.Irani held a review meeting of the development works in her Lok Sabha constituency with senior officials of Amethi district and inaugurated some of the projects virtually.She chaired a meeting of Salon tehsil of her constituency that falls in Raebareli district and said she is happy that the BJP is living up to the expectations of people through its work.“It is true that the family of the head of a political party had been doing its politics in Amethi-Raebareli for years, but it is a matter of satisfaction for me that we are living up to the expectations of people through our work,” Irani said.Chairing the meeting of the Salon tehsil, she said 12 anganwadi centres have come up in the tehsil and it is an indication that this government is playing its role in completing pending projects.This is the change for which people have voted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power, she added.Earlier, on arrival, Irani paid obeisance at the Abhay Daata temple in the tehsil campus, where the meeting took place.She said Raebareli District Magistrate (DM) Vaibhav Srivastava has assured her that all major development works and those related to social welfare would be completed up to the village level on time.Irani also praised the DM for digital payments to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-slams-gandhis-for-not-paying-attention-to-development-of-amethi-raebareli/story-4C3hEsa3kC6Y5XMerLjr2H.html
20-10-2020||India||Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee stable but neurological problem recurs||Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee’s neurological condition deteriorated slightly although he was stable, doctors said on Tuesday evening. The award-winning actor was in a drowsy state since Monday night. On Sunday evening, doctors at the private hospital in Kolkata where Chatterjee is admitted said that his condition had improved and the octogenarian had opened his eyes, responded to verbal commands and even said a few words. “We are not in such a good situation now. His neurological condition in the last 24 hours has deteriorated a little. His GCS score, which was around 11, has come down again to around 9 and 10. Our neurological board, consisting of five doctors, has opined that the improvement happened due to immunoglobulin and steroids. After these medicines were stopped, the count came down,” Dr Arindam Kar, who is leading the medical team that is treating Chatterjee, said. The actor underwent an MRI test on Monday. “It showed no structural abnormalities. We have diagnosed that the Covid encephalopathy will stay for a while... in a worst case scenario, for an indefinite period. We will again give him immunoglobulin and steroid for the coming two days,” Dr Kar said. “The good part in respect to the previous days is that his organ functions are doing well. Most of time he is off oxygen support. He has no fever. His kidney, liver and coagulation functions are all okay. No new infection has been detected. Blood pressure is under control. The heart is good,” Dr Kar said. “The only problem we are dealing with now is encephalopathy. It means the brain (function) and consciousness (level) is sub-optimal. The improvement that we had seen did not stay. We are hopeful that with immunoglobulin and steroid he should bounce back towards improvement. The duration of encephalopathy has been a concern for all of us. We are not absolutely sure how long he would require care and how quickly he will return towards normalcy. We are considering some other options also,” said Dr Kar. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner was admitted on October 6 after he tested positive for Covid-19. He had to be shifted to the Covid ITU after his condition deteriorated. Chatterjee tested negative for Covid-19 on October 14. Millions of people in Bengal and beyond have been praying for Chatterjee’s recovery ever since he was admitted. Amitabh Bachchan, who went to Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai for a checkup a few days ago, reportedly asked the doctors if they were aware of Chatterjee’s condition. Doctors at the private hospital in Kolkata said they received calls from their fellow colleagues at Nanavati Hospital. The icon of commercial Indian cinema was informed how Chatterjee was doing. In a bid to offer holistic treatment, doctors have made Chatterjee listen to music and literature of his choice. On Saturday evening he communicated with his daughter Poulomi Basu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/veteran-actor-soumitra-chatterjee-stable-but-neurological-problem-recurs/story-gMWrSFzQMEAEgklDAKMoYM.html
20-10-2020||India||Pak’s coordinated push shows up in joint terror teams killed by Kashmir cops||Once the gunfight was over and the police officers started running background checks on the three suspected terrorists in south Kashmir’s Shopian district earlier this month, they discovered that the three men fighting them did not belong to one terrorist group but two: the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Al-Badr. They weren’t surprised.Security agencies had been reporting for some time that Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence had been pushing terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir to work together. And there had been evidence on ground that Islamabad’s push to build synergy among terror groups may be working on the ground.The 7 October encounter was the third instance in two months that the police had eliminated a joint team of terrorists in Kashmir valley.Also Read: In Pak Army approach to terror in Kashmir, building synergy is new buzzwordIntelligence inputs reviewed by Hindustan Times indicate that Pakistan Army’s efforts to forge operational synergy between the terrorist groups such as Hizbul, Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba had been continuing since August 2019 when Islamabad had floated The Resistance Front (TRF), a new terror group with a Kashmiri face. That mask, however, didn’t work very well on ground, a fact that appears to have persuaded the Pakistan Army to rely on the Hizbul, which had the reputation of being a terror group comprising local Kashmiris.It was in this context that the Pakistan Army decided in May this year to tweak its strategy and promote the Hizbul Mujahideen, letting it take responsibility for terror strikes in the Kashmir valley.Also Read: In Pak terror plan to revive 2 routes, Pathankot airbase attack coordinator is keyBesides, the terror groups have also been told by Pakistan to pool resources, right from manpower to explosives, an instruction that unusually translates into coordinated attacks on security installations.A senior police officer said the security establishment was conscious of the attempts to unite the terror groups but intended to counter the Pakistani gameplan with intelligence-driven operations. “It is not a coincidence that nearly 200 terrorists have been killed in Jammu and Kashmir,” the official said. This list includes 27 foreign terrorists, mostly Pakistani nationals linked to the Jaish or the Lashkar.In all, security forces have eliminated 33 terrorists in 17 encounters since September 1 including the one in Pulwama on Tuesday that led to the elimination of three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists in a four-hour-long encounter.According to details accessed by Hindustan Times, 13 belonged to the Hizbul Mujahideen, 11 to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, 4 were affiliated with Al-Badr while 3 were linked to the Jaish-e-Mohammed. The remaining two could not be categorised under any terror outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-s-coordinated-push-shows-up-in-joint-terror-teams-killed-by-kashmir-cops/story-PbKXAPNDiF8BLEuZgKKj2M.html

As the deadline approached, the CM said he didn’t intend to hurt anyone’s sentiments. “We feel the invitation was given to editors and senior journalists by keeping some specific interests in mind. Initially, a section of mediapersons have tried to mar our protests against the chief minister’s threat on the media. Now the administration is being used to mar our movement,” said president of Agartala Press Club Subal Kumar Dey, also chairperson of Assembly of Journalists.“No member of our journo body would accept any invitation from the CM till he withdraws his comments,” he said, adding that they would stick to their movement in the coming days.An official from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said, “The CM might have invited some journalists but not on behalf of any organisation. He didn’t invite any leader of the Assembly of Journalists.” Earlier, the journalists wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Press Council of India about the issue and also mentioned that at least six journalists were assaulted in different parts of the state since the statement was given by the CM.The scribes also sought intervention of Tripura Governor Ramesh Kumar Bais in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-scribes-reject-offer-of-talks-demand-cm-biplab-deb-withdraw-remark/story-5iGQTKN19W9QwnIU9sJAUO.html

ACB Director General (DG) B L Soni said the complainant had lodged a complaint with the ACB in Rajasthan’s Kota, which was initially verified. Goyal is incharge of five states, including Rajasthan, and posted at the regional office of UIDAI in New Delhi, he said.  Under ACB Additional Director General Dinesh M N, a team laid a trap at the UIDAI office in South Delhi’s Pragati Vihar area, where he was arrested while taking bribe, police said.  A case has been registered against Goyal under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and he is being interrogated, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adg-of-uidai-arrested-for-taking-bribe-in-delhi-office/story-sYrEat5dhRnZu79tCcHH6H.html
20-10-2020||India||Quad should be formalised for members to deal with global challenges: Stephen Biegun||The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad should become more regularised and formalised so that there are modalities for cooperation and interoperability among its members for dealing with global challenges, US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said on Tuesday. Biegun, who was on a week-long visit to India and Bangladesh last week, was speaking ahead of the India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue expected to be held during October 26-27 and the Malabar military exercise in November that will be joined by the navies of all the Quad members – Australia, India, Japan and the US. The top US diplomat also criticised China for not doing enough to help find a long-term solution to the issue of more than 8,00,000 Rohingya refugees currently sheltering in Bangladesh, particularly because of its close ties with Myanmar. Biegun acknowledged that the US currently has “no designed policy for Quad expansion” and isn’t “advocating for Quad-plus” though it has mutual defence agreements with partners in the Indo-Pacific region such as Australia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. However, he added: “It is our view that in the passage of time, the Quad should become more regularised and, at some point, formalised as well, as we really begin to understand what the parameters of this cooperation are and how we can regularise it.” Such regularisation, he said, will bolster cooperation within the Quad and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific, especially if there is a framework for dealing with crises, irrespective of whether they are natural disasters or economic and security issues. “What you want to do is have a certain modality of cooperation, interoperability and understanding [of] the respective strengths that each partner can bring in facing any number of global challenges,” Beigun said. Since its revival in 2017, the Quad has gained in importance for its four members in tandem with the rise of an increasingly assertive and aggressive China. The grouping was elevated to the ministerial level in September last year and India on Monday formally invited Australia to join the Malabar naval exercise conducted annually with the US and Japan. Biegun said the Quad remains a “somewhat undefined entity” and it was premature to talk about expanding it. However, there is a “natural affinity” among numerous nations in the Indo-Pacific and an opportunity for close engagement with partners in South Asia such as Bangladesh, he added. “We’re not necessarily advocating for Quad-plus but rather a continuation and regularisation of the Quad with an eventual goal of understanding how it could be best formalised and then also welcoming cooperation with any country in the Indo-Pacific that’s committed to defending a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said. Referring to his visit to Bangladesh, where he met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and foreign minister AK Abdul Momen, Biegun said an important issue of discussion in Dhaka was the fate of more than 8,00,000 Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar after being “subjected to unacceptable violence and brutality”. The US hopes to see the “same level of generosity and the same level of clarity of messages to the government of Myanmar from other partners or other nations in the Indo-Pacific, particularly China, which unfortunately has done very little to help resolve the Rohingya issue,” he said. Biegun added that much more should be expected from China, considering its “proximity to...this humanitarian catastrophe”. He also said the outcome of the US presidential election is unlikely to impact the overall relationship with India because presidents from both the Republican and Democratic parties have worked to improve relations with New Delhi. “The real opening began with president [Bill] Clinton, it accelerated under president [George] Bush, it continued under president [Barack] Obama and its accelerating again with President [Donald] Trump,” he said. The values of the two biggest democracies steer them in a similar direction and there are natural convergences of interests since both countries face many of the same challenges globally, he said. “There are many sinews that tie us together and it makes me confident that this relationship is much bigger than any one political party,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-should-be-formalised-for-members-to-deal-with-global-challenges-stephen-biegun/story-ix6i5rXzAoBAvvjJeyfjiJ.html

If the permission is granted, then the event will be held as per tradition in the open grounds adjoining the RSS headquarters in Nagpur; otherwise, between 50-100 people will be in attendance at the lecture that will be held indoors,” said the functionary.The speech is broadcast live through social media platforms and the public broadcaster, Doordarshan.Owing to the pandemic, the Sangh earlier this year cancelled the meeting of its highest decision making body, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, and has also decided to hold its all India executive council meeting in 11 locations instead of at a single place to avoid large gatherings.The annual Vijaydashmi address is one of the main events in the Sangh’s almanac and is an occasion where the RSS chief puts forth the Sangh stance on important issues. The speech is also parsed for the message that the Sangh has for the government.This year’s speech comes days ahead of the Bihar assembly election and in the backdrop of the beginning of the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which has been a long-pending demand of the Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-no-chief-guest-invited-for-rss-chief-s-dussehra-address/story-tm13a3CYgYJNpV5PN8yZuN.html
20-10-2020||India||‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’: Civil defence volunteers to be deployed at traffic intersections in Delhi||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday said civil defence volunteers will be deployed at 100 traffic intersections in the national capital from Wednesday as part of the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign.The initiative will be launched from ITO, he said, adding that it will only be an awareness drive and nobody will be issued a “challan”.“The Delhi government thinks that if everyone is affected due to pollution during the Covid-19 situation, then everyone needs to contribute, whether for two minutes or at a traffic signal. We are aggressively launching an awareness campaign. I believe that when something starts, it looks tough, but it will gradually become the culture of the national capital,” Rai said.He said the Delhi Police has selected 100 traffic intersections for the campaign.“We had three rounds of joint meetings with the police, the transport department and the environment department. The Delhi Police has selected and given us 100 intersections.“We are appointing around 2,500 environment marshals from civil defence. They will coordinate with the traffic police and take the campaign froward. We are also deploying teams of the transport department,” the minister said.The marshals will be deployed at the 100 traffic signals across Delhi’s 11 districts.They will carry placards and give roses to those not switching off the engines of their vehicles at red lights. The commuters will be made aware as to how they can fight pollution through the move, Rai said.“We think the pollution in Delhi affects all of us and all of us need to take the responsibility of resolving this issue. If we need a permanent solution, then the sources of the pollution will have to be controlled.“I request people to turn off the engines of their vehicles if they spend more than 15 seconds at a traffic signal. It will save fuel and reduce pollution,” he said. The campaign is a big positive step, the minister said, adding, “Around one crore vehicles are registered in the national capital and experts say that on an average, a vehicle stops at a red light for 15-20 minutes in a day and burns fuel unnecessarily.” “There is a need to change the mindset. It is a campaign through which we can try to control 15-20 per cent pollution caused by vehicles. We can stop the unnecessarily fuel-burning at traffic signals and nobody will be affected by this. We are writing to MPs, MLAs, councillors, RWAs and others to participate in the campaign,” he said.Rai pointed out that the odd-even rule does not apply to two-wheelers and autorickshaws in Delhi, but the campaign targets all commuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-light-on-gaadi-off-civil-defence-volunteers-to-be-deployed-at-traffic-intersections-in-delhi/story-WJhYuvT3za0sRQr137b1IN.html
20-10-2020||India||What is Digital Health ID that will be used by government for Covid-19 immunisation?||Even as the world races to find a cure for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), vaccinating 1.3 billion people will be India’s biggest challenge in the fight against the pandemic. The urgency of the same was addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Nodi in the inaugural function of the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020 on Monday. He said, “…India is now at the forefront of vaccine development for Covid- 19. Some of them are in advanced stages. We are not stopping here; India is already working on putting a well-established vaccine delivery system in place. This digitised network, along with the digital health ID, will be used to ensure immunisation of our citizens.”In his Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the creation of a digital health ID for every Indian under the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). The NDHM is aiming to create a digital ecosystem for healthcare and integrate it with telemedicine and e-pharmacies at a later stage. The digital health ID is a 14-digit number that can be generated on the website, healthid.ndhm.gov.in. The pilots have been rolled out in six Union Territories — Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Lakshadweep, Ladakh and Puducherry and the facility is currently available there. The scheme will be available in the entire country when it is implemented. There will be two options for generating the Digital Health ID- one by using Aadhaar and the other by using the phone number.Once the 14-digit number has been generated, the system will also give an option to generate an alias. This will be similar to an email ID — xyz@ndhm.in with a password. This will help in easy accessibility for everyone. The digital ID can also be physically generated in a health facility after the complete rollout using Aadhaar. By using the digital health ID all the health records will be stored in the cloud with the ownership lying with the individual. The Digital Health ID will be in the form of a mobile application of website.National Health Authority (NHA), which administers the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) will lead the implementation of NDHM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-digital-health-id-that-will-be-used-by-government-for-covid-19-immunisation/story-aPT6P9BdUjIX4F8UaUy5XI.html

The cenral agency took over the probe from Lucknow police on the recommendation of Uttar Pradesh government.A case was registered in Lucknow’s Hazratganj police station on the complaint of a person named Kamal Sharma, which was transferred to the CBI.The FIR has been registered against unidentified people. The charges include manipulating the TRPs using forged means.The alleged scam was brought to light by Mumbai police earlier this month which registered a case. Republic TV is one of the four channels being investigated.Six people have so far been arrested by the police in connection with the scam, which allegedly involves inducing homes which form the sample set whose TV viewing is monitored to ensure that certain channels get higher ratings.The ratings are a key influencer of advertiser preferences while placing commercials.ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which owns Republic TV, and its Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami moved the Bombay high court last week seeking to quash the FIR lodged by the Mumbai police against the channel in the case.The channel filed the petition in the high court on October 16, a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a plea of one of its senior officials challenging the summons issued by the Mumbai police.The Mumbai Crime Branch had earlier registered an FIR under various sections of Indian Penal Code for cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy against Republic TV and its senior officials, and also against two other local regional channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-probe-in-trp-scam-on-recommendation-of-up-government-registers-case/story-EewCv9suFAXkGQJXP3d8HI.html
20-10-2020||India||‘Increased testing or well-behaving virus?’: What’s behind J-K’s declining Covid-19 numbers||Jammu and Kashmir has apparently witnessed a substantial drop in its average daily number of Covid-19 cases reported in October.While the authorities are upbeat, some doctors are not enthused attributing the decrease to the increasing use of RAT tests instead of much reliable RT-PCR. Others say that the virus was “behaving well”.As against an average of 1,245 daily cases of Covid-19 in September, October has recorded slightly more than half of that which is around 699 average cases daily till date.In terms of fatalities also, the average daily deaths in October have been around 11 as against 16 in September. In September, 478 patients lost their lives while this month, till October 19, the number stood at 207.Also read: ‘Stepping out without mask puts others’ lives at risk’ - PM Modi in address to nation“There is a definite reduction in the number of cases this month. Death rate is a good indicator. The number of fatalities has also gone down. Visibly, the trend is downwards,” said Bhupinder Kumar, mission director, National Health Mission (NHM) and in-charge Covid mitigation.Kumar said that the testing rates in Jammu and Kashmir have been one of the highest in the country which allowed them to stop the spread from those which would have remained undetected. “We test around 25,000 persons every day on an average,” he said. “Besides, patients’ management at home, as well as in hospitals, was streamlined”.Most of these tests have been done using the RAT (Rapid antigen tests).“Three-fourth of the testing has been done using the RAT while 25 percent is through RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction),” he said.The total number of tests conducted in the Union territory till October 19 crossed 20.23 lakh of which 88,369 tested positive and 1,388 patients had died. The overall recoveries have reached 78,667 which account for a recovery rate of 89.0 percent, the highest so far.However, the use of the RAT has been criticised by one of the factions of the Doctors Association of Kashmir (DAK). It has said that the rapid antigen tests were hiding the region’s Covid-19 numbers.“One in two persons infected with the novel coronavirus receive false-negative results by rapid antigen test,” said DAK president and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan.He said, while rapid tests provide results in minutes, they are far less accurate than the gold standard RT-PCR.The specificity rate - or the ability to find those not having the virus - of RT-PCR is high as against the RAT which is 50 percent. On the other hand, the sensitivity rate, the ability to find those having the disease, of the RAT is high as against RT PCR which is 67 percent.However, the RAT provides results within 15 minutes while RT PCR takes at-least 24 hours.“Not only do these rapid tests hinder the diagnosis in individual patients, but also obscure the true extent of the outbreak. We may feel the cases are falling and we have begun to flatten the curve, but the reduction in the positive cases can simply be due to unreliable testing,” Hassan said.Kumar, however, disagreed with this analysis and said that the RAT positivity was also decreasing this month as against August and September.“I would not deny that the sensitivity of the two tests is different, however, the RAT gives a scale of advantage owing to its readily available results. Besides, if we analyze the data, the positivity rate of the RAT tests was 10 percent in August and September which has come down to a large extent in October,” he said.He said that the overall positivity rate stood at 4.7 percent in July, 5.3 percent in August and 5.7 percent in September. “It has come down to 3.5 percent in October (till October 16). The reality is that the span of infection has reduced,” he said.Positivity rate is the number of people testing positive out of the total number of those tested.Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, stated that the decrease in cases has not been substantial as the RAT testing has increased and sampling has gone down because of harvesting.However, he stated there has been an incremental decrease in the number of sick people coming to hospitals irrespective of the testing.“Invariably, the sick patients will land in hospitals with or without symptoms, or whatever the type of testing. Severe patients would not stop coming to hospitals whatever be the positivity rate. We have witnessed that there has been an incremental decrease in the severe patients landing in hospitals,” he said.Qazi Haroon, state immunization officer on special duty for Covid-19 mitigation in Kashmir, said that the virus was “behaving well” now.“Now the deaths are mostly those of co-morbid elderly.

The MLA from Mau has been in Punjab’s Ropad jail for nearly 22 months. A senior police official, privy to the development, said the Ropad jail authorities, where Ansari is presently lodged, refused to send him to Uttar Pradesh on Monday, citing an advice from a board of three doctors “for strict bed rest for three months due to his [Ansari’s] medical condition.” The official said multiple efforts have been made to bring Ansari back to the state in the past one year but every time it failed due to one or the other reasons. He said a team of UP police was sent to the Ropad jail to bring Ansari back on a warrant to produce him in the MP/MLA court in Prayagraj on October 21 in a criminal case lodged against him in January. But they had to return without him. Besides, over a dozen criminal cases were registered against Ansari, his family members and aides during the recent crackdown launched against mafiosi in the state, the official added. Another official at the DGP headquarters said the entire proceedings to bring Ansari back was monitored by the headquarters, following which a team of 50 police personnel was constituted. He said the team visited the Ropad jail but they were informed to return without Ansari. He said the Punjab jail authorities stated that Ansari was duly examined by the board of doctors and found him unfit to travel. The official said Ansari has been in the Punjab jail since January 2019 when he was produced there in a local court on a complaint of extortion lodged by a local builder. He said Ansari reportedly got himself shifted to Punjab jail fearing threat to his life in UP jails after one of his closest aides Munna Bajrangi was shot dead inside Baghpat jail by another gangster Sunil Rathi on July 9, 2018. The officials said earlier the role of some UP jail officials was questioned when Punjab police were allowed to take along Ansari on a production warrant ‘easily’ without bringing it to the notice of state government authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-up-cops-in-punjab-to-bring-back-jailed-mukhtar-ansari-told-to-go-back/story-PpIwUvFjIKpwLfZwe0z9fO.html

Thus, there is no legal evidence furnished by prosecution in support of the charge,” it said.The court further noted that the witnesses were also not found in a position to tell where and how the accused person were residing at the time of the alleged offence.A case was registered against two groups, each comprising 10 foreign nationals, in April by D N Nagar police in Andheri under Indian Penal Code Sections 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 and 270 (acts likely to spread infection of dangerous disease).They were also charged under provisions of the Foreigners Act, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.A sessions court has already discharged them for offence under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 304(2) (homicide not amounting to murder).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-court-acquits-20-foreign-attendees-of-tablighi-event/story-KPNbajaLVsDkqyLJDSF2QL.html
20-10-2020||India||Punjab negates legally debatable Central farm laws: What you need to know||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday introduced three bills in the state assembly to negate certain provisions of the Central government’s farm bills, which were passed during the monsoon session of Parliament in September. The Punjab government’s bills are aimed at protecting farmers’ interests and may be adopted by other non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-ruled states. An explainer on the new provisions inserted in the Central laws by the Congress-ruled government in Punjab.Has the Punjab government nullified the Central laws?No. The Punjab government has added additional provisions in the three farm laws providing safeguards to farmers and to address their concerns while adopting the basic structure of the Central laws, which allows private sector in production and trading for agriculture produce. The Punjab laws allow private players to buy farm produce or enter contract farming, as the Central laws had envisaged but have also included provisions that the protesting farmer bodies in the state had been demanding. Also Read: ‘Rise above politics’: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh tables draft resolution against Centre’s farm lawsHas Punjab ensured protection of minimum support price (MSP) of farm produce?Yes. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, guarantees MSP notified by the Central government for wheat and paddy to all farmers under section 4 of the proposed law. On the contrary, the Central law has allowed the market forces to decide the best price for a farm produce. Section 5 of the bill overrides any price mechanism suggested in the Central bill. The bill also provides for penal provision and states that paying less than MSP of a farm produce by private players could lead to a minimum jail term of three years and also a fine. The Punjab version of Contract Farming bill makes it illegal to sign a contract with farmers for selling their produce below MSP. What is there in the bills for protection of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs)?The bill gives Punjab government the right to levy a fee on private players for buying produce from farmers in any form --- physically or electronically --- anywhere in the state. The provision extends to the mandi system across the state. The Central law had exempted private players from paying any fees outside mandis. The Contract Farming Bill restores primacy of APMCs in sale and purchase of agriculture produce, which was diluted in the Central laws.Also Read: Farmers force closure of Reliance stores in Mohali What are the other protectionist measures?The bill allows farmers to approach civil court against private players and a sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) court provided in the Central law. Punjab has also introduced an amendment in the Code of Civil Procedure (CrPC) 1908, debarring courts from attaching land holding below 2.5 acres in any recovery proceedings. Around 86% of farmers in Punjab have land holdings less than 2.5 acres.CM Singh has also introduced a bill to amend the Centre’s The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which nullifies its impact by maintaining status quo ante as on 4 June, when the Central law was promulgated as an ordinance. The Central law allowed the NDA government to regulate supply of certain farm produce like cereals, pulses, potato, pulses, onions and edible oilseeds under extraordinary circumstances such as war, famine, grave natural calamity and extraordinary price rise. The bill restores the state’s power to regulate essential commodities and enforce hoarding limits for agricultural produce.Can Punjab directly implement these laws?As agriculture, APMCs and lands are state subjects under entries 14, 18 and 22 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the state can frame laws on them. However, as per the entry 33 of the Concurrent List, on which both the Centre and state can legislate, the Union government is allowed to frame laws to control production, supply and distribution of products of any industry, including agriculture. The Centre has introduced the farm reform bills on the basis of this provision. It is likely to become a bone of contention between the Punjab government and the Centre and the matter may come to a head on whether the proposed changes in the Union laws by the former are legally tenable.Can the Centre negate Punjab bills?Yes, it can. As the Punjab bills are in conflict with the Central law, the Union government can use its powers by invoking Article 254 (2) of the Constitution and ask the state government to seek approval of the President before notifying these laws. Usually, the President approves a bill after taking the Centre on board. But the President is within his rights to reject it. In case, the Punjab government does not send the bills for the President’s approval citing that agriculture is a state subject, the Centre can bring in amendments in a bid to ensure uniform implementation of its laws across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-negates-legally-debatable-central-farm-laws-what-you-need-to-know/story-YG3QWAS5oTDLz2k4tjAiaI.html
20-10-2020||India||Safeguard rights of NGOs: UN human rights chief to India||UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday expressed regret at the tightening of space for human rights NGOs in India, including by the application of vaguely worded laws that constrain their activities and restrict foreign funding. Bachelet asked the Indian government to safeguard the rights of human rights defenders and NGOs, and their ability to carry on with their work on behalf of the groups they represent. “India has long had a strong civil society, which has been at the forefront of groundbreaking human rights advocacy within the country and globally,” she said. “But I am concerned that vaguely defined laws are increasingly being used to stifle these voices.” Also read: FATF plenary meeting: What next for Pakistan?In a statement, Bachelet specifically cited as “worrying” the use of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), which a number of UN human rights bodies have expressed concern about, because it is “vaguely worded and overbroad in its objective”. The act prohibits the receipt of foreign funds “for any activities prejudicial to the public interest”. The act, which was adopted in 2010 and amended last month, has had a “detrimental impact on the right to freedom of association and expression of human rights NGOs, and as a result on their ability to serve as effective advocates to protect and promote human rights in India”, the statement said. Late on Tuesday evening, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responded to the comments on FCRA by saying: “India is a democratic polity based on the rule of law and an independent judiciary. The framing of laws is obviously a sovereign prerogative. “Violations of law, however, cannot be condoned under the pretext of human rights. A more informed view of the matter was expected of a UN body.” People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the criticism and said India is a pluralistic democracy with a “robust domestic grievance redress mechanism” overseen by an independent judiciary and a National Human Rights Commission compliant with the Paris Principles. “These mechanisms are fully capable of addressing all allegations of violations of human rights anywhere in India. India has been at the forefront of promoting and protecting all human rights in line with its international obligations and remains committed to doing so in the future,” said one of the people cited above.The statement said it was expected that the new amendments to FCRA will create “even more administrative and practical hurdles for such advocacy-based NGOs”. The statement noted that Amnesty International was compelled to close its offices in India after its bank accounts were frozen over alleged violation of FCRA.  “The FCRA has been invoked over the years to justify an array of highly intrusive measures, ranging from official raids on NGO offices and freezing of bank accounts, to suspension or cancellation of registration, including of civil society organisations that have engaged with UN human rights bodies,” Bachelet said. “I am concerned that such actions based on the grounds of vaguely defined ‘public interest’ leave this law open to abuse, and that it is indeed actually being used to deter or punish NGOs for human rights reporting and advocacy that the authorities perceive as critical in nature. Constructive criticism is the lifeblood of democracy. Even if the authorities find it uncomfortable, it should never be criminalised or outlawed in this way,” she added. The statement noted that activists and human rights defenders had come under mounting pressure In India in recent months, particularly over mass protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the country earlier this year. “More than 1,500 people have reportedly been arrested in relation to the protests, with many charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act – a law which has also been widely criticised for its lack of conformity with international human rights standards,” the statement said. Charges have been filed under this law against individuals in connection with demonstrations dating back to 2018, including the 83-year-old Catholic priest Stan Swamy, whom the statement described as a long-standing activist engaged in defending the rights of marginalised groups. “I urge the government to ensure that no one else is detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly – and to do its utmost, in law and policy, to protect India’s robust civil society,” Bachelet said. “I also urge the authorities to carefully review the FCRA for its compliance with international human rights standards and to release people charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for simply exercising basic human rights that India is obligated to protect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safeguard-rights-of-ngos-un-human-rights-chief-to-india/story-K7VMAgWhWDZPFv1GX5rtOO.html

Shaikh also accused Republic TV and R Bharat of launching a ‘smear campaign’ against Mumbai Police, adding that the channels’ allegations aggrieved him as he ‘takes pride in his legacy in the illustrious police force of Mumbai.’News reports of the channels and the debates hosted by Arnab Goswami are done in complete violation of journalistic ethics, he has argued further in his plea. Shaikh, in his plea, has also taken objections to comments made by Goswami against Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.The case will be heard on Wednesday at 11am in courtroom number 4 in the city civil court.The controversy pertains to a press conference addressed by Singh on October 8, in which he accused Republic TV and two Marathi channels of ‘manipulating’ TRPs. An FIR was registered in connection with the alleged scam a day before the press conference, on October 7. The channel, however, has denied charges made against it and moved the Supreme Court, seeking quashing of the FIR, as well as the transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).On October 15, hearing the channel’s petition on October 15, the top court asked it to move Bombay high court instead.ARG Outlier Media, which owns Republic TV and R Bharat, has accused Mumbai Police and Singh of targeting the channels for their coverage of the Palghar lynching incident and the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.The high court, meanwhile, will begin the final hearing in the case from November 5. Six people have been arrested in connection with the case so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-scam-ex-mumbai-police-officer-moves-court-to-restrain-republic-tv-from-discussing-fir/story-loWgpcugmuKvw9bbXy3umO.html
20-10-2020||India||‘If a girl goes out in the evening…’: Jharkhand leader’s shocker on rape||The opposition BJP hit out at the ruling JMM after its Borio legislator Lobin Hembrom blamed parents and mobile phones for social evils including rapes in the backdrop of the gangrape and murder of a minor in Dumka last week. While the BJP trained its guns on the JMM over Hembrom’s ‘irresponsible statement’ , the ruling party remained guarded in its reply on the matter. While on campaign trail for party candidate Basant Soren in Dumka bye-election, Hembrom told media persons on Monday that the silence of parents and society over actions of youngsters were abetting kidnappings and rapes.“The parents and guardians are silent when youth consume ganja (marijuana) and liquor. Everyone has mobile phones these days and boys and girls talk over the phone frequently. Are the parents and guardians not responsible if a girl goes out in the evening? They come out of slumber when such incidents take place,” he said.Defending the state government, Hembrom said the JMM-led coalition government and the police have taken prompt action soon after the gang rape case was reported.BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said it was a shocking statement from a lawmaker. “It’s rubbish. It is almost like Talibanisation of Jharkhand,” he said.BJP’s ally AJSU party spokesperson Dev Sharan Bhagat said the lawmaker should have commented sensibly on the issue.In a guarded reply JMM general secretary Vinod Pandey said the MLA had attempted to point out the evils of the society. “The party leaders spoke to Lobin and were convinced with his clarifications,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jmm-draws-flak-after-lawmaker-blames-parents-mobile-phones-for-rapes/story-Zw3nwzTyqUAAuH3fdVG1zI.html

20-10-2020||India||‘His opinion’: Kamal Nath responds to Rahul Gandhi disapproving ‘item’ remark||Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath is facing flak for his “item” remark against state minister Imarti Devi during a campaign speech for assembly by-election.Party’s former president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said he personally doesn’t like the type of language that the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister used.“Kamal Nath ji is from my party but personally, I don’t like the type of language that he used...I don’t appreciate it, regardless of who he is. It is unfortunate,” Gandhi said while interacting with mediapersons.Reacting to Rahul’s statement, Nath said, “It is Rahul Gandhi’s opinion. I have already clarified the context in which I made that statement... Why should I apologise when I did not intend to insult anyone? If anyone felt insulted, I have already expressed regret.”Nath was on Sunday addressing an election meeting in the Dabra (scheduled caste) assembly constituency in Gwalior district, which is headed for a bypoll, where he made the remark while comparing the virtues of Congress candidate Suresh Raje with those of the rival candidate from the BJP, Imarti Devi.“Suresh Raje is a simple man. He is down to earth. He is not like the person. What is the name of the person?” As crowd responded to Nath’s question, citing Imarti Devi’s name, Kamal Nath called her an “item”, saying, “Why should I name her? You know her better than I know. You should have warned me. Ye kya item hai...”Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi to remove Nath from all party posts for his allegedly sexist remarks against state minister Imarti Devi. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers across Madhya Pradesh staged a two-hour protest of silence.“I thought being a woman you would take notice of the news on insult to cabinet minister and scheduled caste woman leader Imarti Devi and take action against state Congress president Kamal Nath while condemning the indecent remark but you have not done it so far…She broke down while sharing her pain. Elections come and go but insult to a Dalit woman like this casts a slur on the entire political arena,” he wrote.In response, Nath wrote a letter to Chouhan on Monday in which he said, “In my 40 years of public life, I have always respected women and will continue to do so. I didn’t make any disrespectful remark during my speech in Dabra meeting but still you came out with lies. The word that you are indicating has several definitions, but you and your party are trying to mislead people by telling lies.”Bypolls are scheduled to be held on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfortunate-don-t-appreciate-it-rahul-gandhi-on-kamal-nath-s-item-jibe/story-giRNTnB5sm4vHcukyg37BN.html
20-10-2020||India||Covid-19 on mind, Durga Puja celebrations low key sans idols, pandals, bhog||It’s that time of the year. The fragrance of ‘shiuli’, the delicate orange and white flowers that blossom right about now, mingles with the autumn breeze to herald Durga Puja but the frankincense is missing and a wary quiet has overtaken the sound of festivities.In the air there is the virus and the fear of it.The Bengali community in the Delhi-NCR region is staying away from Durga Puja festivities, a community affair in parks and other open spaces. And nowhere is this more evident than in Chittaranjan Park, often known as ‘mini Bengal’.. It’s two days before Durga Puja begins and Delhi’s predominantly Bengali neighbourhood has never been quieter.The parks that have for decades served as venues for larger than life themed pandals housing ornately decked Durga idols for five days every year are deserted.Keeping in mind the Covid-19 scare, puja committees in C R park, as the south Delhi locality is known, and elsewhere in Delhi-NCR have decided to keep celebrations low key, hosting rituals online, sans idols, cultural programmes, ‘bhog’ and in several places even the customary floral offerings.On Monday,12 Durga Puja Committees of Chittaranjan Park, Greater Kailash 1 and 2, Alaknanda, and Kalkaji met at a temple and unanimously decided that the puja celebrations this year would be suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.The meeting was convened by Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj and attended by the sub-divisional magistrate, police officials and other agencies.“Most of the population of C R Park and members of puja committees are senior citizens and it is important they remain indoors and avoid contact with unknown people in pandals,” Bharadwaj, a legislator of Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party, said.But almost all the committees will host a small “kalash puja/ ghat puja” to “ensure continuity of puja by these samitis”, according to a statement issued after the meeting. C R Park’s Mela Ground Committee, which is known for organising grand celebrations, featuring not just unique puja themes but also cultural performances by leading artists from Bengal, is one of them.“Unfortunately this year we are not organising Durga Puja on a large scale considering the unprecedented situation. No ‘mandap’ or ‘pandal’ will be installed to prevent large gatherings to keep the public safe from this contagious disease. “No activity will be organised except a ceremony called ‘ghot pujo’ which will be performed every day with limited visitors or committee members and a priest during ‘saptami’, ‘ashtami’ and ‘navami’ at our Mela Ground park,” Avik Mitra, a member of the organising committee, told PTI.Durga Puja is celebrated over four days -- sashti, saptami, ashthami and navami which this year fall from October 22 to 24. On the fifth day, dashami, devotees bid adieu to the goddess and the idol is immersed. In line with the Delhi government’s guidelines, 15 committee members, including two priests, will be allowed to attend the rituals physically within the park precincts, the final list for which has to be submitted to the police. For others, the ‘ghot pujo’ will be streamed live on the committee’s Facebook page.“All those who enter the premises will have to submit a self-attested declaration stating that they have not come in direct contact with any Covid positive patient in the last 48 hours.“The Arogya Setu app will be mandatory for 15 members. Hand sanitisation, wearing of masks and maintaining social distance will be of utmost priority for all the members attending the ‘ghot pujo’,” Mitra said.C R Park’s B-Block puja committee has reduced the annual five-day affair to a single day celebration with a ‘ghot pujo’ on October 24 from 7 am onwards. Only the priest and two helpers will be allowed to participate in the rituals.Unprecedented times call for unprecedented action, said Suprakash Majumdar, general secretary of the committee.“This year, the committee has decided that flowers, sweets, and fruits from individual homes cannot be offered. Nothing will be accepted by the priest due to Covid-19 restrictions. There won’t be any ‘pandal’, idol , entertainment/cultural events, sports events, ‘bhog’ distribution at our ground either,” Majumdar said. The B Block committee is, however, accepting donations in cash as well as online and via cheque, all exempt from income tax.Puja spirits are running low even beyond Delhi’s ‘mini-Bengal’. Covid on their mind, Green Park’s Matri Mandir society also has chosen to go the ‘ghot pujo’ way despite the state government’s nod for small scale celebrations.“It would have been very difficult to restart after the government allowed puja celebrations. We will stick to our plan of performing ‘ghot pujo’. We will follow all rituals and no short cuts as far as the puja is concerned,” said Debashis Saha, chief coordinator of the Matri Mandir Sarbojanin Durga Puja Samiti.While members of the committee will be paying their respects to the deity from their respective homes, the committee has decided to send money to all the workers associated with the celebrations every year.“We have decided to pay needy workers who were associated with our puja like the ‘dhaki’ (drummers), cooks, and security personnel. Also, we will donate to the PM’s relief fund,” Saha said.Caution is key in the suburban town of Gurgaon that falls in Haryana.Gurgaon’s DLF5 Durga Puja committee has capped the number of people present within the pandal at any point of time at 45. “We will keep it as simple as possible… minimalistic, functional set up for pandal decorations. Our theme this year is about embracing minimalism, acknowledging the power of nature and appreciating the value of life, people and our society. “Apart from keeping all rituals and activities of the puja at a minimum, we also intend to cut down all costs wherever possible, and use part of the savings from the funds raised to help people impacted during this time,” a committee spokesperson said.While individuals will be allowed to attend rituals physically, for those not keen to come to the pandal, especially the elderly and other vulnerable communities, celebrations will be telecast online on the committee website and its social media handles.“We have built a website for puja visit slot booking — 30 minute slots each, allowing 25 visitors in each slot and volunteers, security and sanitisation staff up to 20. No overlaps, or cross directional movement will be allowed. Attendees would be socially distanced once they are inside the venue. There will be flowerless ‘pushpanjali’ to avoid any common touch points,” the committee member said.The website will also be used to coordinate food distribution to minimise crowding.“There will be pre-packaged takeaway ‘bhog’ on one of the days. People will not be allowed to sit down and consume food. Just a clean handover of takeaway packages booked through the website,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-on-mind-durga-puja-celebrations-low-key-sans-idols-pandals-bhog/story-AaPAYCiIj7cbw9fH3fnr2K.html
20-10-2020||India||With a quiz in UP, Congress presents ‘facts’ about its role in nation-building||With the BJP accusing the Congress of ‘doing’ nothing for the country, many questions in the Rajiv Gandhi Samanya Gyan Pratiyogita (general knowledge contest) focused on the role of the party and its leaders in the freedom struggle and nation-building over the years.The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) organised the quiz contest on September 13 and 14. The prizes were given on Sunday. About 7,840 youths have won various prizes. A laptop was given in every district to the winner of the first prize while a cell phone and a tablet were given to winners of the second and the third prizes. Barring Etah, the prize distribution ceremony was organised for all the districts in Lucknow on Sunday.“Besides laptops, mobile phones and tablets, we also gave consolation prizes that included subscription to general knowledge and NCERT books,” said Anil Yadav, organisation secretary of the UPCC.“Yes, there is a lot of misinformation on the social media and those who appeared in the quiz have realised this. As we gave away prizes to the winners on Sunday, many of the winners came to us to convey how the quiz has helped them get the right information,” said Mukesh Chauhan, president of the City Congress Committee, Lucknow.Chauhan’s claims are not unfounded. About 12.50 lakh youth had registered for the second Rajiv Gandhi Samanya Gyan Pratiyogita (General Knowledge Quiz) held in all the 75 districts of the state. About 5.85 lakh youths participated in the 60-question competition held online.“Those who participated in the quiz are in the 16 to 22 year age group and they have come across the facts about the Congress (now),” said Yadav.“One of the questions asked participants to name a leader who was the first to speak about the need to fight Covid-19 in India and the obvious reply was Rahul Gandhi,” he added.More and more questions may have focused on the role of Congress and its leaders. The participants went through the study material provided to them to prepare for the quiz. For instance, the quiz asked who introduced reservation for women in panchayati raj institutions or who brought the revolution in the communications sector in India? Late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was the obvious answer to these two questions. Other questions focused on work done during the tenure of first Prime Minister, the late Jawaharlal Nehru. It also had questions on former Prime Minister the late Indira Gandhi and former Prime Minister Mamohan Singh as well.Asked whether the Congress would be able to counter the BJP’s campaign, Yadav said, “We did not intend to counter them. We provided a lot of information with facts on our online page Yuva Josh. We also provided information to the youth through preparatory quiz and YouTube videos.”SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University, said, “The Congress is the oldest party. It has done a lot and holding a quiz is a very positive move. I don’t agree with the claim that the Congress did nothing for the country. The political parties should do more positive things than just indulging in negative politics.” “The Congress leadership will have to prove itself to the people if the party wants to win an election,” he added.Uttar Pradesh BJP leader Vijay Pathak said, “The Congress is busy expanding its organisational base in Uttar Pradesh.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and assured him about it, but the state government must also tell what it is doing to provide aid to farmers,” he said.The Centre is also facing the Covid-19 pandemic as is the state government, he said.“But, the Centre will not stop funding the state. The Centre has already paid Rs 20,000 crore till March this year.To pay further debts of the state, the central government is taking a loan of Rs 1 lakh crore,” said the leader of opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly.Due to heavy rains, the soil of farms is washed away at many places. Hence, a scheme should be initiated to help farmers facing such issues, he said.Wells are filled with silt and orchards have also suffered damages due to the heavy rains, he noted.“Earlier, our government considered a photograph of losses as the survey. On the same lines, the present state government must work and complete surveys fast and immediate help should be given to farmers in rain-hit areas,” he said.He showed to reporters two past videos in which Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, were seen demanding concrete help for farmers from the then Fadnavis-led government.“Those who demanded aid for farmers earlier have a chance to keep their word now. Those in the government should be more patient, but the ruling party leaders are indulging in politics. The state should help the farmers,” he said.Targeting NCP chief Sharad Pawar, whose party is an ally of the state government, Fadnavis said, “Pawar never says anything wrong. He knows the way and when the central government’s aid will come to state.” “At present, he has a responsibility to defend the inefficiency of the present state government and he is doing that,” he added.Fadnavis further said he agreed with Sharad Pawar that the state government needs to take loan for helping farmers.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has increased the loan limit of Maharashtra to Rs 1.20 lakh crore.He also said that there are complaints that government officials have not reached out to farmers for surveys of the damage caused due to heavy rains and floods.The state should increase its manpower and get the surveys done, he said.Asked about the state government’s decision to allow women to travel in local trains in Mumbai, Fadnavis said the Railways has taken a clear stand over this and demanded information regarding the necessary number of trainsand other issues.If such details are provided, the Railways can accordingly run the trains (for women), he said.On the Maharashtra government’s decision to conduct a probe into the “irregularities” in the Jalyukt Shivar water conservation scheme, a pet project of Fadnavis, the BJP leader said, “The state government cannot shut my mouth by such inquiries.” “Leader of opposition is of the people and he will speak for the people. There were six lakh works done under the scheme in a decentralised manner and only 700 complaints are received.“I will talk more on it after the present crisis of farmers is over,” he said.On Pawar’s claim that those who left the NCP earlier were keen to come back to the party, Fadnavis said, “Not a single person (from BJP) will go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-maharashtra-govt-doing-to-help-rain-hit-farmers-asks-fadnavis/story-1MD0UbkRGNf2zLOez6pTPK.html

20-10-2020||India||Australia will participate in Malabar naval exercise with India, US and Japan: Govt||Australia will participate in the Malabar naval exercise next month involving India, the US and Japan that will bring the four key defence partners and democracies in the region together, demonstrating their collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific.In a significant move that comes amid a Sino-India border row, India on Monday announced Australia’s participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the US and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four-member nation grouping -- the Quad.The invitation by India to the Australian navy for the exercise came two weeks after the foreign ministers of the Quad held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region that has been witnessing increasing Chinese military assertiveness. In a joint statement with Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the announcement was another important step in Australia’s deepening relationship with India. The government said that following an invitation from India, Australia will participate in the Malabar-2020 exercise, which is likely to take place next month in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. The exercise will bring together four key regional defence partners India, Japan, the United States and Australia in November, it said. Reynolds said Malabar-2020 marked a milestone opportunity for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). “High-end military exercises like MALABAR are key to enhancing Australia’s maritime capabilities, building interoperability with our close partners, and demonstrating our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” Reynolds said. For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the high-end naval exercise. Australia will be returning to the joint manoeuvres after its participation in 2007. The US has been pushing for a deeper military collaboration with Japan, India and Australia against China’s growing regional influence. Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region which, in parts, is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing and mineral exploration by neighbouring nations in recent years, saying the ownership of the resource-rich maritime territory belongs to China for hundreds of years.Foreign Minister Payne said that the Malabar exercise also “showcases the deep trust between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests”.“This builds on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, to which Prime Minister (Scott) Morrison and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi agreed on June 4, 2020, and which I progressed with my counterpart, Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar, this month when we met in Tokyo,” she said.“It will bolster the ability of India, Australia, Japan and the United States to work together to uphold peace and stability across our region,” Payne asserted.Participation in the naval exercise demonstrates Australia’s enduring commitment to enhancing regional security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and increasing the capability and inter-operability of the ADF, she said.Australia last participated in Exercise MALABAR in 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-will-participate-in-malabar-naval-exercise-with-india-us-and-japan-govt/story-NU9U1bjWLyCJ4Q4CNUgwEI.html

20-10-2020||India||‘Rise above politics’: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh tables draft resolution against Centre’s farm laws||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who has been a vocal opponent of the recently-passed farm laws and has rallied across the state to convince farmers to not fall into Centre’s ‘trap’, on Tuesday tabled a draft resolution against the legislation and the proposed electricity amendment bill during the state’s assembly session and urged all parties to rise above politics.The draft resolution seeks the annulment of the farm laws and the proposed electricity amendment bill, as well as promulgation of “a fresh ordinance making the procurement of food grains on the Minimum Support Price a statutory right of the farmers and continue with procurement by Government of India through FCI and other such agencies”, a statement from his office said.The passage of three farm bills by the Centre during the monsoon session of Parliament comes with a promise that India’s agricultural sector will be reformed and more avenues of investment from private players will open up. But there have been nationwide protests against the imposition of these newly-framed laws with a fear that farmers might become slaves to big corporations. A recent survey conducted by Gaon Connection showed that more than 50% of the farmers are against the implementation of these laws.Also Read: Farmers force closure of Reliance stores in MohaliSeveral members of Opposition parties have led the charge to boycott the Centre’s laws in the form of rallies, protests with a view that India’s agricultural base will be weakened.The draft resolution aims to abolish the new farm bills along with the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and further declare a new law which would make the Minimum Support Price (MSP) policy a statutory right of the farmers. It stated that the process of procuring food grains from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Centre along with several other agencies will continue.It also mentioned the regret of the state assembly over “callous and inconsiderate attitude of the Government of India in attending to the concerns of the farming community on recent alleged farm legislation enacted by them.”Also Read: Rahul Gandhi, Punjab CM Capt Amarinder vow to force Centre to revoke farm lawsSingh also introduced three counter bills in the session - the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment Bill 2020, the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill 2020.He pointed out the bills which have been introduced today would be the basis of Punjab’s legal battle ahead and have to be carefully examined before they are presented.“The draft resolution states that Farm laws are against the Constitution (Entry 14 List-II), which mentions agriculture as a state subject and these legislations are a direct attack to encroach upon functions and powers of states as enshrined in the Constitution,” the chief minister added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-above-politics-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-tables-draft-resolution-against-centre-s-farm-laws/story-nXMY4yyAo9r66w2wmRL30J.html

20-10-2020||India||Pak ISI finds its inspiration in IS tactics, preps to rain drone bombs in J&K||Pakistan’s Army has started training terror groups in the use of explosive-laden drones to carry out attacks on targets in Jammu and Kashmir, a move inspired by Islamic State fighters who have used commercially-available drones or quadcopters to target forces in Iraq and Syria for years.According to intelligence inputs reviewed by Hindustan Times, Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence had come up with the idea of replicating the IS successes in use of cheap drones to carry out small bomb attacks and not just carry out surveillance or capture live feed for attacks to be used for propaganda. The ISI laid out its plan first at a meeting with senior Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed commanders in Punjab province’s Taxila in April this year. There was a follow-up meeting the next month at the brigade headquarters in Kotli district of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Of the options that were explored at these meetings were the use of quadcopters that could have a range of three km and could carry up to 5 kg explosives. The drones were rigged to carry and drop small quantities of munition on enemy targets.Also Read: In Pak Army approach to terror in Kashmir, building synergy is new buzzwordIslamic State fighters had almost perfected the tactic on the battleground, prompting the United States and drone manufacturers to spend millions of dollars on research and tweaks in the drone technology to stop what some called, the ‘killer bees’.Don Rassler, who studied the drones and their impact at the United States Military Academy’s center on combating terror, found that the IS innovation had inspired many copycat versions. He counted the Iraqi security forces as one of the first to deploy them to attack adversaries. By 2017, the IS’ innovation inspired a gang in Mexico caught with firearms and a drone carrying explosives.Also Read: In Pak terror plan to revive 2 routes, Pathankot airbase attack coordinator is keyPakistan’s ISI is going to be another. The Border Security Force has already spotted a spike in the number of drones in the air across the International Border with Pakistan.A senior Indian counter-terror official said the BSF and the army had been told to stay prepared to neutralise the little flying machines that could be used to target security camps and posts near the border.Also Read: In tech upgrade, BSF to get 436 drones and new anti-drone systemsBut it is unlikely that if drones fly in from across the border, it would remain one-way traffic.“If Pakistan starts it, there could be retaliatory attacks in equal measure, with or without the drones,” said the official, adding that New Delhi was likely to authorise similar cross-border attacks using drones in the first instance. “The (security) forces have started work on it after the inputs about the Pakistani plan first came in,” he said.Pakistani agencies and its instruments - arms and narco-traffickers - have used drones in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir but this has been mostly used to beat the floodlit fence to smuggle drugs, weapons, explosives and fake Indian currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-isi-finds-its-inspiration-in-isis-tactics-preps-to-rain-drone-bombs-in-j-k/story-Ay93NVBdV3H7SqBHYi7LKJ.html

20-10-2020||India||50% deposit of decreed amount to file appeals not retrospective: NCDRC||The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has done away with the requirement of asking individuals or companies to deposit half the payment ordered by the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions as a precondition for admitting their appeals.The Commission said that this condition was introduced in the Consumer Protection Act on July 20, 2020 and won’t apply to complaints or orders passed before this date.The new condition was inserted as an amendment to Section 51(1) of the newly amended Consumer Protection Act 2019 and was challenged by several individuals and companies before a two-member bench of the NCDRC.The new condition stated thus, “Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited 50% of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.”The Commission noted that prior to this amendment, parties who filed appeals before the National Commission were required to either deposit 50% of the amount required to be paid in terms of the State Commission order or a sum of Rs 35,000, whichever is less.The Commission bench headed by President RK Agrawal and Member SM Kantikar said, “We are of the considered opinion that now it is well-established that a right of Appeal is a vested and a substantive right which cannot be altered, modified by putting stringent conditions as that right of Appeal had accrued to the person concerned from the date of initiation of the proceedings i.e. from the date of filing of the Complaint before the appropriate fora under the 1986 Act.”Since the amended provision was not retrospective in operation, the Commission held that the said condition will not apply to complaints already pending in the District Consumer court or State Commission or National Commission. The Commission allowed the appeals filed by the petitioner individuals and companies to be registered as they all arose out of complaints filed prior to the amendment.Advocate Kunal Cheema who argued the case before the National Commission said, “This judgment will be helpful to all whose complaints were in existence before the new Act of 2019 came into force. So whenever the order is passed in future and they are filing first appeal, they will be able to do it as per the conditions of the old Act with a cap of Rs 35,000 and not 50 per cent of the decreed amount.”The Commission was hearing six set of appeals filed by various individuals and companies against separate orders passed by the State Commissions of Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Odisha and Karnataka. The appeals were not registered as they did not comply with the amended condition of depositing 50 per cent of the amount as directed by State Commissions. However, they had deposited Rs 35,000 as required by the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.The Commission allowed registration to all these appeals by stating, “We are of the considered opinion that the Second Proviso of Sub-Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act shall not be applicable where the person aggrieved is challenging the order passed by the State Commission in an appeal arising out of a complaint case filed prior to 20/24 July 2020 when the 2019 Act came into operation/was enforced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-deposit-of-decreed-amount-to-file-appeals-not-retrospective-ncdrc/story-rfOvLLwIjYHEBKKhXHRmkN.html

The group of foreigners was booked by the DN Nagar police on April 5 in two separate cases for not following the advisory issued in the wake of Covid-19. The Mumbai police had earlier issued an advisory and warning asking people who had attended the meet at Delhi to come forward, failing which a criminal case would be registered against them. The group failed to come forward but was traced in the first week of April following which a case was registered with the DN Nagar police station. The group was booked for attempt to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They were also booked under Epidemic Diseases Act, the National Disaster Act, Foreign Act and Bombay Police Act. Also read: Mumbai court discharges 12 Indonesians arrested over Tablighi Jamaat eventThe sessions court had discharged the accused from the charges of attempt to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Earlier this month the court further dropped other charges against the accused and they were put to trial only under section 135 of Bombay Police Act for defying the rules of national lockdown and order issued by the Commissioner of police. The prosecution had examined only two witnesses, the complainant - a police sub-inspector from DN Nagar police and investigating officer from the police station.The court after considering their evidence, observed, “The said witnesses were also not found in position to tell where and how the accused person were residing at the time of alleged offence. Thus there is no iota of evidence with prosecution to show any contravention of order by accused persons beyond all shadow of doubt. During the imposition of lockdown and their ultimate shelter in a mosque or nearby will not render them responsible for such contravention. There is no legal evidence adduced by prosecution to show that accused persons infringed the notification lawfully made under section 37 of Bombay Police Act.”The magistrate’s court while acquitting all the accused observed that, “The prosecution witnesses have clarified that the accused have not violated the norms of lockdown and order of the Police Commissioner. Their versions are contrary to the documentary evidence on record. The prosecution has not even carried out preparation of Panchanama and never recorded the statement of any other independent witness. Thus, there is no legal evidence furnished by prosecution in support of charge.”The court also noted that “The brief survey of prosecution evidence transpires that none of examined witnesses have an occasion to see the accused persons together in the form of assembly. Per contra the prosecution witnesses admitted that they have not seen accused persons contravening any directions or order issued by authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-court-acquits-20-foreign-tablighi-jamaat-members-says-prosecution-had-no-evidence/story-zF5U7lUmOyvtaAy2u3UZqN.html

He has not given information about his first wife, but about his mistress,” BJP’s Singh was heard saying in the video, according to news agency PTI.Congress candidate Kunjam described Singh’s allegations as baseless and said he will file a defamation suit against the BJP minister. “I got married 15 years back and have a 14-year-old daughter. I will file a defamation suit against him. This exposes the BJP candidate’s character. On one hand, they are staging the drama of silent fast and on the other hand, they disrespect women,” he said.Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has sought a detailed report from MP chief electoral officer (CEO) over Kamal Nath’s ‘item’ jibe. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi asking her to sack Nath from all party posts. Chouhan along with several other BJP workers in the state had observed a two-hour ‘maun vrat’ or silent fast on Monday.In response to this, Kamal Nath wrote a letter to Chouhan and said he made no disrespectful comments during the rally and accused the chief minister of spreading lies. Nath asserted that MP’s voters were aware that the controversy was another ploy by the BJP to retain power. He also targeted Chouhan for the two-hour silent protest.

However, the Urban Local Bodies are competent to decide on such issues in consultation with the public and for the development of the ULB’s themselves,” he said.The LG also refuted the rumours regarding the reduction or scrapping of the honorarium of the PRI/ULB representatives, saying such rumours are being spread by certain vested interests, deliberately misleading elected Panchayati Raj institutions /ULBs’ representatives on the honorarium issue.Earlier this month, the Union home ministry had empowered the union territory’s administration to impose the property tax following an amendment to the J&K Municipal Act, 2000 and J&K Municipal Corporation Act, 2000 through the J&K Reorganisation (Adaption of State Laws) order, 2020.For the past two weeks, different mainstream political parties were up in arms following reports that the government could impose property tax in Jammu and Kashmir. A PDP spokesman had said property tax would be akin to the despotic and anarchic rule the people have witnessed many years ago during the monarchy.“For decades people were burdened under the heavy taxation and this revival of old practice is to make people weak economically.”The National Conference had also criticised the new proposed tax in J&K. “imposition of property tax amidst economic slowdown is grave injustice with the people of JK who are even struggling to make ends meet,” NC general secretary Ali Mohammad Sager.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-stiff-opposition-j-k-lg-manoj-sinha-says-no-plans-of-imposing-property-tax/story-h49l2lGwU4CZkMNOglhuIN.html

20-10-2020||India||Paddy stubble can decompose in 25 days with microbial solution: ICAR||Initial results from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) about trials on the effectiveness of a microbial consortium to decompose paddy stubble show that the latter can decompose within 25 days amid reports of Delhi-national capital region (NCR) and several other north-western states battling “poor” air quality index (AQI), which has become an annual phenomenon in the past few years around this time of the year. Trials are in progress in up to 14,000 hectares (ha) of paddy farmland in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Delhi, said the ICAR chief. “There is no requirement for any manual intervention to pick up the stubble after 25 days. A microbial solution can help decompose paddy stubble within 25 days, but trials are still in progress,” said Trilochan Mohapatra, director-general (D-G), ICAR.Also Read: Monthly CMs’ meet necessary to stop stubble fires: Arvind Kejriwal“We had been working on the microbial consortium for a couple of years after the happy seeder, which is used for straw management, was introduced. Last year, the concept was tried out in UP, where it had worked,” Mohapatra had said earlier.The contribution from stubble fires to the national capital’s particulate matter (PM) 2.5 pollution reduced temporarily on Monday, as wind speed during the day time had picked up to 16 kilometres per hour (kmph). Though widespread stubble fires were observed in Punjab and Haryana on satellite images, their contribution had reduced because of a higher ventilation index, scientists said on Monday.The air quality early warning system under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) said the current actual contribution from stubble fires was about 7%, even though the forecast was around 19%.“The reason the impact has lowered is because of clear sunshine and good wind speed during the day. Fires are widespread and wind direction is still north-westerly, where stubble is being burnt. However, we are hoping that it won’t impact Delhi. The AQI is unlikely to worsen for a day or two because of better ventilation,” said Vijay Soni, a scientist at India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) air pollution management division.Data sourced by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) also indicated an 10% contribution to Delhi’s PM 2.5 load from stubble fires. SAFAR estimated fire counts in the neighbouring states at around 1,090. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 square (sq) metres (m) per second is considered poor. Mixing height is the level at which pollutants mix in the air.“An improvement in air quality was noticed because winds up to 18 kmph were recorded in Delhi on Monday. Similar conditions are likely to continue on Tuesday. However, from Wednesday, the wind direction is likely to gradually change to easterly and south-easterly, when the impact of stubble fires may reduce,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, who heads the regional weather forecasting centre at IMD.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar to start holding monthly meetings of the CMs of all states from northern India in a bid to find a permanent solution to stubble burning. The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has held 65 meetings with environment ministers of NCR states since 2016, a ministry official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-stubble-can-decompose-in-25-days-with-microbial-solution-icar/story-Gl7gct3RR94O1J42Dt6TVI.html

Shah was referring to the comments made by Gandhi in connection to the ongoing row between China and India in eastern Ladakh during a rally against the new farm bills in Haryana on October 7.Shah, in an interview with Zee News, said, “(The formula to drive the Chinese out within 15 mins) could have been applied in the year 1962 itself… if it was done then hectares of Indian soil wouldn’t have been lost.” “The then-PM had already said ‘Bye Bye Assam’ on Akashvani. How does Congress get to educate us on this issue now? When your great-grandfather was in power, we were losing territories to the Chinese government,” Shah further targeted Gandhi.Speaking of the soldiers from the Bihar regiment who thwarted the Chinese from encroaching on June 15 in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, Shah said, “I am immensely proud of the soldiers of 16 Bihar Regiment. At least during our tenure, we stood our ground and fought. These soldiers faced harsh weather conditions and protected our country.” Shah also said that India hopes that through diplomatic talks an amicable solution can be reached between both nations.Gandhi had said on October 7, “China would not dare to take a step inside our territory, if we were in power, we would have evicted and thrown out China and it would not have taken 15 minutes to do so.” The Congress leader has also alleged that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government had “weakened” the country as China had “dared to enter India and kill our soldiers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-1962-then-pm-had-already-said-bye-bye-assam-amit-shah-on-rahul-gandhi-s-driving-out-the-chinese-in-15-mins-claim/story-IyTZsLFgEwDr9BkPYKGlNN.html

20-10-2020||India||In Pak Army approach to terror in Kashmir, building synergy is new buzzword||The Rawalpindi general headquarters of the Pakistan army has been able to forge operational synergy since August 2019 between Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in the Kashmir Valley, according to intelligence inputs reviewed by Hindustan Times. The outcome of such a synergy has usually been coordinated terror attacks.The inputs reveal efforts by Pakistan-based terror groups, with the active support of that country’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), to launch coordinated attacks against India in the wake of constitutional changes pushed through by the Centre in August last year, effectively revoking Article 370 that conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir and reorganising the state into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh. According to a dossier prepared by Indian intelligence and security agencies, a series of meetings have taken place between senior functionaries of banned terrorist organizations including LeT, JeM, Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) and the Taliban, with Jaish commander Mufti Mohammed Asghar Khan Kashmiri coordinating joint terror operations in J & K.The first key meeting, according to the intelligence inputs, took place on December 27, 2019, when Amir Hamza, general secretary of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the parent of LeT, met with senior functionaries of the JeM at Markaz Subhan Allah, Bahawalpur, to chalk out a joint strategy to share resources and intensify operations against India.Follow-up meetings were held with the support of the Pakistani deep state on January 3-8 and January 19, 2020 in Islamabad. These meetings were attended by top functionaries of the two globally designated terrorist groups including Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, the de facto head of JeM, Maulana Ammar, brother of ailing JeM chief Masood Azhar, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, chief operational commander of L:eT and Amir Hamza. After a decision on operational synergy was taken, Mufti Asghar Kashmiri established contact with LeT’s functionaries in Occupied Kashmir to implement the plan on the ground.The second key meeting took place on May 7 in Islamabad between LeT, JeM and HM commanders, and focused on enhanced operational capabilities, including sharing of weapons caches, ammunition and support of overground workers. According to intelligence inputs, the three Islamist groups decided that HM will take the responsibility of all attacks in Jammu and Kashmir under the guidance of JeM’s Mufti Asghar Kashmiri. To coordinate action in the Kashmir Valley and Jammu, HM chief Syed Salahuddin, it was decided, would be in touch with Kashmiri and Abdul Aziz Alvi, head of the JuD/LeT in Occupied Kashmir. Before the May 7 meeting, Mufti Asghar Kashmiri already met Salahuddin in Muzaffarabad in PoK to activate the synergy plan.There are other non-state actors involved as well.After the signing of the US-Taliban peace accord on February 29, the JeM leadership had also been in touch with the Afghan Taliban so that terrorist commanders can be diverted to J&K once the Sunni ultra conservative force comes to power in Kabul. For that purpose and for training terror recruits in Taliban camps across the Durand Line, the Jaish leadership held meetings with Taliban representatives in Bahawalpur and the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad in the presence of ground commanders of Kashmir operations, the inputs show.Besides the main groups planning to create mayhem and violence in Kashmir, new proxies such as The Resistance Front (TRF), Teehreek-e-Millat-e-Islami (TMI) and Ghaznavi Force have be revived in J & K to show that terrorism in the Union territory is home-grown and indigenous. The TRF, a conglomerate of Lashkar and Jaish remnants, took responsibility for the May 2 Handwara encounter in which five security personnel including Colonel Ashutosh Sharma were killed. An LeT operative, Haider, a Pakistani national, was also killed by the security forces in the encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-army-redraws-new-kashmir-terror-plan-allots-tasks-to-jaish-let-and-hizbul/story-5orzs8wPtUnFJRHfWnV4MO.html

The American business magnate said India is “very inspiring” as it has made huge strides in improving the health of its people in the last two decades. “And now, India’s research and manufacturing will be critical to fighting Covid-19 especially when it comes to making vaccines at large scale,” he said.  Gates said scientists all over the world are involved in a particular ‘grand challenge’ -- ending the current pandemic. Also Read | Global pandemic made us realise importance of teamwork: PM Modi at Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020He said researchers are breaking down silos and rather than waiting to go through the publication process, they are sharing data on a daily basis. “Since the pandemic began, scientists have shared 1,37,000 viral Covid-19 genomic sequences,” the Microsoft Corp co-founder said. Even the pharmaceutical companies are cooperating on production ways that really have never been seen before, he added.Talking about the challenges in vaccine development, he said mRNA vaccine is an area where many have seen “great promises”.  “Probably, the first approved vaccine for Covid-19 will be mRNA,” he said but added that the vaccine cannot be counted on alone because it is very hard to scale up and has a logistical problem because it requires a proper cold chain.  Gates expressed hope that the mRNA platform matures in the years ahead so that its vaccines can be scaled up that can bring down the costs as well the cold chain requirement. He also stressed on the need for innovation in diagnostics platforms. “Even when sometimes people are tested, results come back negative because some of the tests are not sensitive to the small nano virus,” he said, adding, this also leads to infection.“So, the diagnostics are letting us down,” Gates said, stressing on the asymptomatic nature of the infection. “Right now, the current business model is identifying people with symptoms and we need to change that. We need sensitive and specific diagnostic tests which matter and we need to make it easy to access,” he said.  He also said although the RT-PCR test has high specificity, a lot of challenge is about the logistics. Gates suggested that there should be test kits that can be spread out into the community and can be stocked in medicine cabinets, community centres and pharmacies.On cooperation by the scientific fraternity, he noted that international teams of scientists are collaborating with full speed on the vaccine clinical trials.  “One or more of these vaccines will be available by early next year and as there will be multiples vaccines, it is necessary to make sure to understand how exactly and where to use each of them,” he said.Gates said the pace of science in fighting the pandemic has been remarkable. “But despite all this work, right now, as fast as the science has moved...the pandemic is still ahead of us.The first Covid-19 vaccine will probably be the fastest that humans have ever gone from identifying the new disease to be able to immunise against it,” he said. “Still we all know this virus has managed to plunge the entire global economy into a deep recession,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-research-manufacturing-critical-to-fighting-covid-19-bill-gates/story-FmOpmLRVnzIsMtxjAuba3L.html
20-10-2020||India||Working on Covid-19 vaccine delivery system: PM Modi||Not only is India at the forefront of the race to develop a vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the country is also putting in place a digitised network to deliver the vaccine to its citizens, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his keynote speech at the inauguration of Grand Challenges meeting 2020. The meeting, which will go on till October 21, was to be held in New Delhi before the pandemic and is being conducted virtually for the first time. “India is at the forefront of vaccine development for Covid-19, some are in the advanced stages. We are not stopping here. India is already working on putting a well-established vaccine delivery system in place. This digitised network along with digital health IDs will be used to ensure immunisation of our citizens,” he said. The PM stressed on the need for collaborative science and innovation to tackle large problems. “The journey to innovation must be through collaboration and public participation. Science will never prosper in silos and the grand challenges understood this well. It has taken a global pandemic to make us realise yet again the importance of team work. After all, diseases do not have geographic boundaries. They do not discriminate on the basis of faith race gender or colour,” he said. Grand Challenges, which was launched in 2003 by Bill Melinda Gates foundation, fosters innovation to solve key challenges in global health and development. The initiative focuses on fourteen major challenges including nutrition, vaccine development, develop needle free delivery system for the vaccine, cure for chronic infections, among others. At the inaugural session, Bill Gates stressed the need for research into three vital fields to remain prepared for the next pandemic – development of vaccine platforms so that vaccines against new infections can quickly be developed and manufactured, monoclonal antibodies and more effective ways of manufacturing it quickly for a pandemic situation, and diagnostic platforms that are sensitive and specific and widely available so that huge number of people can be tested and accurately diagnosed. “Given the scale of this pandemic, we weren’t prepared for it. But, we will be better prepared next time around,” said Gates. Apart from addressing challenges related to Covid-19, this year three new grand challenges have been launched – integrating tradition and technology for fermented foods for maternal nutrition, new approaches for integrating molecular surveillance into malaria control programmes, and smart farming innovations for small scale producers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-on-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-system-pm-modi/story-WzKElIgl1gwPZmbqLQBtAO.html
20-10-2020||India||IT ministry pushes for AI boost in India||The ministry of electronics and information technology is in the process of sending to the Cabinet a proposal to set up a National Mission for Artificial Intelligence to boost the use of AI in India, HT has learnt. The mission will include government projects that will be rolled out across departments and ministries, officials familiar with the matter said. The project is estimated to cost about Rs 2,000 crore, but the size of the investment is yet to be finalised. “This has been going on for many months, we are still deliberating the details of how exactly to do it but we will be approaching the Cabinet soon,” an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. “This will include AI projects that benefit startups and maximise the use of the technology in India.” It will also include setting up a Centre of Excellence for artificial intelligence and benefits to encourage AI startups. “There will be moonshot projects and fundamental research projects,” a second official said, also requesting anonymity. “India has data which is the fuel for artificial intelligence. Google and Amazon are thriving on it.” The official added that the two tech giants use natural language processing to assess people’s needs. “They seamlessly pick up languages, say for example Bhojpuri, and respond to the data; we should also be able to do that,” the official added. Once it comes to fruition, the project will then focus on analysing data needs and responding accordingly for people across India. The note to sent to the cabinet is under circulation at MEITY and is in the process of being finalised soon. The ministry of electronics and information technology will collaborate with the private sector, academia and think tanks to develop AI-based products. The ministry has already held a five-day conference, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Responsible Artificial Intelligence for Social Empowerment (RAISE) last week. The ministry is increasingly focusing on the use of AI and how it can benefit society. “AI is basically an amalgamation of software and algorithms. The products we create will be able to compete globally,” the official added. Amba Kak, director of global policy and programs at AI Now Institute at New York University, believes that the push sounds similar to the rhetoric surrounding AI across the world. “We are seeing a wave of government promotion of AI, Europe has just recently put out a strategy paper on the same,” said Kak. “There is an industry push behind governments wanting to use more AI, as governments are the biggest customers of software such as facial recognition. We should not be on a predetermined path, data driven technology needs a proper assessment,” she said “The government should ground its AI strategy in evidence of the social and environmental impacts of these technologies, whether they will work in contexts of limited infrastructure, and which communities are likely to benefit more or bear the risk of bias, exclusion and other harms,” Kak added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-pushes-for-ai-boost-in-india/story-vGoigqKPM1dnYv5mheyhwI.html
20-10-2020||India||Sack Kamal Nath from all posts: MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan writes to Sonia Gandhi||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi to remove state Congress president Kamal Nath for his allegedly sexist remarks against a woman minister in the state government. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers across Madhya Pradesh staged a two-hour protest of silence.The protesters were led by Chouhan in Bhopal, Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia in Indore, and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and state BJP president VD Sharma in Gwalior. Party workers held protest placards in their hands to condemn Nath’s remarks about woman and child development minister Imarti Devi. They demanded an apology from Nath. Nath was on Sunday addressing an election meeting in the Dabra (scheduled caste) assembly constituency in Gwalior district, which is headed for a bypoll, where he made the remark while comparing the virtues of Congress candidate Suresh Raje with those of the rival candidate from the BJP, Imarti Devi. “Suresh Raje is a simple man. He is down to earth. He is not like the person. What is the name of the person?” As crowd responded to Nath’s question, citing Imarti Devi’s name, Kamal Nath called her an “item”, saying, “Why should I name her? You know her better than I know. You should have warned me. Ye kya item hai...” Chouhan said in Bhopal on Monday, “My Dalit sister Imarti Devi was insulted by the state Congress president Kamal Nath but what is more painful is that he is not remorseful for his act. Instead, he is trying to justify his indecent remark shamelessly.” Chouhan also wrote to Sonia Gandhi, urging her to condemn the remark and sack Nath from all party posts. “I thought being a woman you would take notice of the news on insult to cabinet minister and scheduled caste woman leader Imarti Devi and take action against state Congress president Kamal Nath while condemning the indecent remark but you have not done it so far…She broke down while sharing her pain. Elections come and go but insult to a Dalit woman like this casts a slur on the entire political arena,” he wrote. “I request you to condemn the indecent remark and remove your party’s former chief minister Kamal Nath from all the party posts to teach a lesson to leaders of your party who insult women. I wish to add that if you keep silent on the insult, it would be considered that you have given your consent to the remark,” Chouhan added. In Indore, Scindia observed silence with a placard in his hand which read: “Mata bahano ka jo kare apmaan, Shastra kahen wo hai shaitan” (holy scriptures say those who insult mother and sisters are devils).  “Kamal Nath has insulted the entire Scheduled Castes and Dalit community by calling Imarti Devi an ‘item’,” Scindia said.Demanding action by Congress president Sonia Gandhi against Nath, he added: “If she doesn’t take action people will come to know as to what is difference between what Congress preaches and what it practises.” Reacting to Chouhan’s letter to the Congress president, and giving clarification in light on the protests, Nath said in a letter addressed to Chouhan on Monday, “In my 40 years of public life, I have always respected women and will continue to do so. I didn’t make any disrespectful remark during my speech in Dabra meeting but still you came out with lies. The word that you are indicating has several definitions, but you and your party are trying to mislead people by telling lies.” Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati also sought action against Nath. In a tweet, Mayawati wrote: “The ex-CM’s indecent and anti-woman remark against the Dalit woman contesting a by-poll on Dabra seat is highly shameful and condemnable. Congress high command should tender a public apology on this.” The National Commission for Women, meanwhile, sought an explanation from Nath over his remarks. The Commission has also forwarded the matter to the Election Commission for taking necessary action. “The NCW has come across several media reports where Shri Kamal Nath, Leader of Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly, made offensive and derogatory remarks against a woman minister in a political rally in Dabra,” the Commission said in a statement. “The Commission strongly condemns this irresponsible and disparaging statement made by the leader. The words used in the video are highly defamatory and shows disrespect towards the dignity of a woman.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sack-kamal-nath-from-all-posts-mp-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-writes-to-sonia-gandhi/story-flWKeCOX1GFqnRO30DSJZI.html
20-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Could India indeed have fewer than 40,000 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by February as a government-appointed panel believes? Sure, the number, reported in an article in HT on Monday, is, according to the panel, contingent on the wearing of masks, tracing, and social distancing, but a drop from the current level of around 770,000 active cases (according to the HT dashboard) to 40,000 in the next three-and-half months does seem difficult.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe last time India had fewer than 40,000 infected cases was in the first fortnight of May, when it was seeing between 3,000 and 4,000 cases a day. The panel’s projection comes against the backdrop of a consistent fall in daily case numbers, from a weekly average of around 93,000 in mid-September to around 61,000 in the third week of October, and would appear to assume that India will not see a second wave of infections. That seems unlikely for five reasons: the onset of winter, which many experts expect to set off a rash of new cases; the reopening of almost everything; the ongoing festive season, which will likely witness some amount of fervent socialising; the trend seen in almost every large country in the world (much of Europe is in the midst of a raging second wave currently, and the US is in its third); and corona fatigue (something I have written about and warned against repeatedly). Still, as the cliché goes, I will hope for the best and prepare for the worst.No country has been able to predict the trajectory of the disease, and the only correlation that has been established thus far is between the extent of testing and the stringency of measures such as lockdowns on one side, and the number of daily cases on the other. Every other link – temporal or related to the infection rate – is hypothetical. But what if this can be done?A paper on the pre-print server medRxiv claims it can be – and without much trouble, leveraging the prevalent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR tests that most countries (including India) use. James A Hay, Lee Kennedy-Shaffer, both at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, and others, have built a model that, they say, can measure where the epidemic’s trajectory is, based on the viral loads in a random sample of the population. The RT-PCR test, considered the gold standard of Covid-19 tests, is widely used, the authors say, as a Yes-No (Positive-Negative) test, but it also measures viral loads. The hypothesis behind the model is that in the early stages of the pandemic’s run in a region, viral loads in a random sample will be high because the infections are still recent – and that in later stages of the epidemic, these loads reduce because the infections are no longer recent. Thus, the authors say, the viral load can be used to actually understand whether the epidemic is waxing or waning in a region. “The distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemic’s trajectory,” they write. They also add that “the distributional properties of the measured viral loads (median and skewness) vary with the growth rate of new cases”.Clearly, more work is needed to understand the model used by the authors and stress test it under various conditions, but if it holds, this approach could actually help health administrators figure out when and whether the number of active cases in a region is declining or rising. As the authors point out, this could assist “real-time resource allocation” and shape “outbreak mitigation strategies”.Science and data, as this columnist has repeated ad nauseam, are the only things that can point us in the right direction. Everything else is just a guess.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-8QVjB7DJoh94npU5mjBGCN.html
20-10-2020||India||Odisha’s daily Covid-19 cases dip below 2000, but protocol violations continue unabated||For the first time in about 2 months, the number of new Covid-19 cases reported daily in Odisha dropped below the 2000-mark signifying a decline in transmission of the infection but health officials said the cumulative positivity rate of the state continued to be a matter of concern as it was still higher than several states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.On Monday, the state reported 1982 new Covid-19 cases from 38,740 samples, more than two months after the daily positive cases started surging beyond 2000. On August 13, Odisha had reported 1977 positive cases. But the next day it touched 2496 and kept on growing till it touched the highest single-day surge of 4,356 cases on September 25 after which it started declining gradually even as the daily positivity rate took some time to taper off.Though on Monday the daily positivity rate was 5.11 per cent, the cumulative positivity rate of 6.62 per cent was way above states like Bihar (2.5%), Gujarat (3.3%), Jharkhand (3.7%), Uttar Pradesh (3.7%), Himachal Pradesh (5.1%), Rajasthan (5.3%) and Assam (5.8%). However, Odisha’s cumulative positivity rate was below the national average of 8.04%.Additional chief secretary of Odisha’s health and family welfare department, Pradipta Mohapatra said though the total numbers are falling, the Durga Puja as well as a lackadaisical attitude towards social distancing and mask-wearing remained a matter of concern.“Most of the European countries are reporting more cases than India and US. France is under lockdown due to lack of adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. In India, the celebration of Onam led to a Covid-19 surge in Kerala. Though winter would not be a major concern for us, we are worried about possible resurgence during Durga Puja. We have instructed the district collectors to remain alert and keep doing as many tests as possible to get a zero positivity rate,” Mohapatra said.Officials said the rise in Covid-19 guidelines over the last few days was an indicator of the challenges that the state would face in controlling the epidemic. On Sunday, a bar-cum-restaurant in Bhubaneswar was sealed by the police after it was found that a birthday party being organised violated the guidelines. Similarly, a coaching institute in the city was sealed for organizing a get-together of over 50 students and their parents who had qualified in the NEET exam.On Saturday, 3 temples in Berhampur town of Ganjam district were sealed on charges of flouting Covid-19 protocols on the first day of Navratri Puja. The officials sealed Maa Kali Temple near Bijipur, Bijipur Thakurani Temple and Ganesh Temple after hundreds of people attended the Navratri ceremony violating Covid-19 restrictions. A shopping mall in Aska block of Ganjam district was sealed after hundreds of people were found inside the mall flouting social distancing norms and mandatory use of masks.“We hope people would help the police in maintaining social distance. Already 8,000 policemen including more than a dozen IPS officials have been infected by Covid-19. We have lost 41 police officials and 4 home guards to Covid-19. But despite the risk, our staff are trying their best to ensure that everyone follows Covid-19 guidelines,” said a senior police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-daily-covid-19-cases-dip-below-2000-but-protocol-violations-continue-unabated/story-PNzbqVPI8MDpMfxjCT9zIN.html
20-10-2020||India||Covid-19 curbs hit Durga Puja in Bengal, Capital||Fears of Covid-19 transmission forced the curtailment of one of India’s grandest festivals on Monday, with authorities in Delhi and Kolkata drastically downsizing Durga Puja celebrations that attract hundreds of thousands of people — a step that underlined public health concerns ahead of the month-long festive season.In the Capital, the five-day festival will mostly be a private affair bereft of theme pandals, towering idols, nightlong excursions and food adventures, with organisers – including those in the hub of festivities, CR Park – deciding to suspend public celebrations, bar visitors, and move rituals online. Greater Kailash (GK) MLA and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said the decision was taken in a meeting on Monday morning. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Around 12 Durga Puja committees from Chittaranjan Park, GK2, GK1, Alaknanda and Kalkaji attended the meeting. It has been unanimously decided that Durga Puja celebrations will be suspended this year due to the pandemic. Most of the population of CR Park and members of puja committees are senior citizens and it is important that they remain indoors and avoid contact with unknown people in pandals,” Bharadwaj said.In West Bengal, the Calcutta high court banned visitors from pandals and ordered police to set up barricades outside the structures that have already attracted many thousands of devotees who flouted distancing and mask guidelines – three days before the puja celebrations kick off. People would not be allowed within a five-metre distance for small pandals and 10 metre for big pandals, the high court ordered, while expressing concern at the crowd control measures and widely circulated reports of large crowds thronging the city’s major markets and pandals in violation of Covid-19 protocols. “In public interest, all pandals whereat Durga Puja is being celebrated this year are made no-entry zones for the members of the public,” stated the division bench of justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee. They added that the measure may not be able to control the spread of the pandemic if people came out on the streets in big numbers.The court’s order – which came in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) and was implemented from Monday night – is a big setback for organisers of the 37,000-odd pujas and artisans who spend months painstakingly building towering structures and fashioning the idols of Durga and her four children. A popular pandal in Kolkata easily attracts upwards of a hundred thousand visitors each night. “All the puja committees will incur losses to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees as all preparations have been made,” said Soumen Dutta, a puja organiser from north Kolkata. “We are staring at huge financial losses.”The decision to curtail Durga Puja celebrations come at a time India has crossed 7.5 million infections and lost 114,000 people to the disease. Experts warn that the public nature of the five-day festival – hundreds of thousands of people are often out all night, taking public transport to go from pandal to pandal, jostling with hundreds of others in a cramped humid space for a glimpse of the idol – can fuel the virus that spreads through air and bodily contact. Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said the number of cases is likely to increase as more physical interaction happens during the festive season. “The increase in the number of cases will be seen 10 to 14 days after the festival. By then, it will also be the time for Diwali. Not only higher number of cases, the increase in the pollution levels is likely to cause more severe disease with many needing ICU care,” he said.Concerns about the upcoming festival season – which include Durga Puja, Dussehra and Diwali – have mounted after experts blamed the Onam celebrations in August for the recent spike in cases in Kerala. Similar worries forced downsizing of other festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Eid and Jagannath Rath Yatra. Organisers and authorities in Delhi decided to suspend most rituals associated with the festival. Bhog (the ceremonial food offering to the goddess, distributed among devotees) will be home-delivered and pushpanjali (ceremonial first offering of flowers to the goddess), aarti (evening religious rituals) and donations have been shifted online. Puja committees will even post the text of all holy chants for devotees.The CR Park Kali Mandir Society, which attracts 200,000 people each year, has tied up with a Direct-To-Home service and a local cable operator to broadcast the rituals. “Only for religious reasons, a small kalash/ghat Puja will be attended by 10-15 committee members. This will ensure the continuity of puja by these samitis. I have also requested the district administration and local police to help the puja committees in stopping any outsiders entering these areas,” Bharadwaj added.In Kolkata – where Durga Puja is also a ₹50,000 crore industry that receives support from the state government and private players – the HC order evoked mixed reactions. “While in smaller pandals, 15 members will be allowed, in the case of bigger pandals, a maximum of 25 members will be allowed. The names of the entrants will have to be decided in advance and cannot be changed daily,” said advocate Sabyasachi Chatterjee, who represented the petitioner Ajay Kumar De. The police brass will submit an affidavit by November 5 detailing how the court order was implemented. During the hearing, the court raised questions about crowd-control measures and questioned how 30,000-odd police personnel would tackle 400,000 people – the typical crowd at major attractions. The state government said it will add more personnel but the judges expressed doubt over organising a festival when schools and colleges were closed. Durga Puja is a major event in the social and religious calendar of Bengal and people from all over the state come to Kolkata to see pandals. But the state reported a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases after puja shopping began and crowds swelled in markets. On Sunday, the state reported 3,983 new Covid-19 cases, including 813 infections in Kolkata alone – the highest in the state. The positivity rate – the ratio of the number of cases to that of tests — shot up from 6.6% on September 5 to 9.1% on Sunday. Some politicians criticised the order. “It is a very disheartening order and has come as a setback for the puja committee and the citizens. As the order is directed towards the state government, the administration will issue directions in a day or two after going through the order. But we can’t do anything which would dampen the festive spirit of lakhs of people. At the same time we have to ensure that people are safe so that the virus doesn’t spread,” said Saugata Roy, a senior Trinamool Congress MP. Union minister Babul Supriyo welcomed the order. “None of the pujas patronised by ministers and senior leaders of the TMC government were maintaining any social distancing among the visitors, we have seen. Bengal is now among the top states when to comes to spread of the virus,” said Supriyo. “Durga Puja is a festival but we have to understand that this year situations are different as there is a pandemic. Community spread has started. I don’t know how the state government will implement the order,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, West Bengal Congress chief. The Forum for Durgotsab, an umbrella body of 350 festival organisers, said that it will call a meeting of its members on Tuesday to discuss the matter and way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-curbs-hit-durga-puja-in-bengal-capital/story-2ld9BO3pPLeGqgLiJf6PKJ.html
20-10-2020||India||Agricultural exports recover from Covid-induced fall||India’s agricultural exports, a crucial source of farm earnings, have recovered from a pandemic-induced decline, but some high-value segments, such as livestock and marine products, continue to shrink, according to an analysis of government data. Exports of major farm products stood at ₹53,000 crore in the five-month period between April and August 2020-21, a rise of 14.8% compared to the corresponding period of 2019-2020, the export data show. However, between April and June, or the first quarter, widespread trade disruption globally because of the pandemic and a lockdown caused exports of major farm products to fall 2.8% in value terms from the year-ago period. Exports turned positive following a pick-up from July onwards. Overall, the farm-export earnings data is a mixed bag. During the April to August period, farmers gained from higher exports of rice, wheat, sugar, but their incomes have taken a hit from a 17% fall to ₹8,919 crore in livestock exports as well as a 15% fall to ₹8,616 crore of marine products. Exports of basmati rice, a big-ticket export item among cereals, during April-August rose 8.2% to ₹13,660 from the year-ago period, while the value of non-basmati rice exports grew 91.3% to ₹11,570 crore, the data show. To be sure, the latest data available is for six scheduled farm product categories and excludes many smaller items as well as some commercial crops such as cotton. The scheduled categories for which data are available with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority are (a) floriculture and seeds (b) fresh fruits and vegetables (c) processed fruits and vegetables (d) livestock products (e) cereals and (d) others (includes items such as alcoholic beverages). When looked at in dollar terms, which helps in neutralising the effects of currency depreciations, the fall in livestock products is steeper at 21.9%. Buffalo meat exports fell 16% to ₹7,609 crore, while goat and sheep meat shipments plunged 62.9% to ₹122 crore. Farmers benefited from a 43% rise in pulse exports to ₹1,039 crore. An agriculture ministry statement on October 10 said exports rose 43.4% in the April-September period. The agriculture ministry statement showed higher growth because it took a narrower basket which did not have categories such as livestock and marine products. “We hope that worst is over. The FAO Food Price Index in September 2020 was up 2.1% from August and now 5% higher than its value a year ago,” said Abishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. Yet, India’s agricultural exports are nowhere near their peak, witnessed prior to 2014-15, and this fall has been a major reason for poor returns in the farm sector. India’s agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14 on the back of a rise in global commodity prices. This fell sharply to $33 billion in 2016-17. The country’s net exports (i.e. exports minus imports or the agricultural trade surplus) fell to $7.8 billion in 2016-17. Exports have been muted since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agri-exports-recover-from-covid-induced-fall/story-0o92Gewb1YnjUR6k6Tq9dJ.html
20-10-2020||India||Staff crunch threatens to derail pollution fight in Delhi||Two of the key agencies responsible for ensuring the Capital follows its emergency air pollution action plan have been hobbled by staff crunch, according to data and some current employees who spoke to HT, raising questions about the city’s preparedness as it heads into the pre-winter period when air quality is known to plunge into hazardous levels.Delhi and its surrounding areas are now under the winter phase of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), a protocol that curbs certain sets of polluting activities based on the state of the air quality in the area. The implementation and its compliance fall in the domain of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Documents seen by HT show that in DPCC, out of the sanctioned staff strength of 343, only 103 positions are occupied. This includes executive and ministerial staff who do not contribute towards on-ground enforcement. In the team that is responsible for spot checks and patrolling, there are only 37 officials.Similarly, CPCB, a central body in-charge of overseeing pollution monitoring and enforcement, across the country has about 125 positions vacant in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) region alone. At present, there are 280 staffers with the agency in the Delhi-NCR region.Also Read | Delhi pollution: What AAP government has done so far in 2020DPCC officials travel the length and breadth of the 1,483 square kilometres that make up Delhi, ensuring — when required — that construction work is halted, diesel-run power generators are not used, and brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers are shut down. They also monitor civic staff to make sure dust control measures are being applied effectively.“An official who comes in the morning has to also manage night patrolling, which means he has to clock 24 hours. For years there have been no promotions and the teams are on a verge of a collapse. Nobody raises this issue because the work is not affected, but the truth is that the teams here are severely overworked,” a DPCC official said, asking not to be named.  Bhure Lal, the chairperson of Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevent and Control) Authority, the body that is ultimately in charge of the air pollution action plan, said that the situation in these agencies is a hindrance to enforcement. “Many of these officials are assigned for court duties and other tasks. These teams are majorly overworked and have great tasks in front of them and at some point work will get affected,” said Lal. In an official response, DPCC said that the pollution control body had made a requisition to the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) for the recruitment of Group B and C (middle and lower rung) posts but the process is still underway. Along with the permanent positions, the department has also requested for 126 contractual staff and 50 junior engineer and steno positions to be filled. Also Read | ‘Can think about implementing odd-even if other measures fail’: Delhi environment minister on air pollution“All the important and essential staff is in place, only some grade-2 and steno positions are to be filled,” the DPCC said in its response to HT’s queries. “Presently, no proposal/note has been sent for additional staff/increasing or augmentation of the sanctioned strength,” it added. A DPCC official, asking not to be named, said that while the problem of inadequate staff has been haunting the department for many years now, it is felt most acutely when the strict winter phase of the Grap is implemented. “During winter season, the work for teams double. They have to ensure that all the measures listed under Grap are being implemented and all violations need to be checked. On a good day, a team is able to cover four to five locations. Enforcement will surely be better if we have more hands on board,” said the official. As far as the Centre-run CPCB is concerned, it advertised in May to fill 48 jobs, including posts for scientist-B, junior scientific assistant, senior technician, junior technician and junior lab assistant. The pandemic has delayed the hiring process, a CPCB official said, asking not to be named. This official added that the agency also is struggling with inadequate funds. “The CPCB this year received a budgetary allocation of ₹100 crore, which is barely enough for the size of operations handled by it,” this person added. Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB, did not respond to calls and text messages from HT seeking a comment. A Union ministry spokesperson redirected queries to CPCB, where no response was available.Representatives of municipal corporations, which are responsible for dust suppression measures, regular cleaning and periodic watering of streets, and proper disposal of garbage, said they too are facing similar problems. The three municipal bodies (north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations) together have around 8,000 staff, a number officials say is inadequate for a city of nearly 20 million people.“With the added responsibilities during peak pollution months, we (north corporation) need at least 10,000 to 15,000 additional people in our workforce to manage the tasks assigned to us,” said Jai Prakash, the mayor of north Delhi, an area that consistently records some of the most polluted AQI numbers.The mayor added that they also lack funds and blamed the Delhi government for the problem. “The Delhi government is portraying that they are doing so much for controlling pollution but the truth is that all this is a mere show, if they truly cared they would release the funds they owed to the corporations,” he said.The MCDs are headed by members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in opposition in the assembly where chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has the overwhelming majority. AAP’s in-charge for Delhi municipalities, Durgesh Pathak, said on Monday that BJP’s councillors are responsible for the poor condition of the municipal agencies in the city. “In the last 14 years, they have only spread corruption and have not done any good for them. Their councillors have only stolen from Delhi to fill their own pockets. I am not saying this, former Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari agreed that corruption is up to the brim in the management that runs municipalities. All their problems are rooted in their own actions.”Vivek Chattopadhyay, senior program manager, clean air programme, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that the city’s pollution control boards need to hire more skilled people to increase efficiency. “Every country has deficiencies but we need to work smartly to overcome these deficiencies. If you can’t hire more numbers, hire more skilled people and give them technological support, so that they can work more efficiently and the work is not affected,” Chattopadhyay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/staff-crunch-threatens-to-derail-pollution-fight/story-WhRKeh4T1TyTunzNQUQD1L.html
20-10-2020||India||Nadda asks BJP’s north Bengal leaders to struggle relentlessly for 6 months ahead of key polls||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J P Nadda on Monday asked party functionaries in north Bengal districts to struggle relentlessly in the run-up to the crucial assembly polls due in another six months. “He said that party workers and leaders should forget everything else and concentrate on strengthening the organization at the polling booth level in every community block and put up a struggle against the Trinamool Congress (TMC),” a BJP leader, who attended the closed-door meeting, held at a hotel in Siliguri town, said on condition of anonymity. “Being aware of the violent attacks being made on our workers by the TMC, he said we have to go ahead bearing in mind that the police and administration are under the control of the ruling party. He said the next six months are crucial as this is the biggest battle the BJP faces,” said state general secretary Sayantan Basu, who accompanied Nadda. “He said BJP will restore democracy and rule of law in Bengal once it is in power,” added Basu. The media was not allowed inside the hall where Nadda interacted with BJP office-bearers from north Bengal districts. He arrived at Bagdogra airport at 11 am and left for Delhi at 6.30 pm. After his arrival, Nadda garlanded the statue of Panchanan Barma, the biggest leader of the socially backward Rajbanshi community who stood up against caste hegemony in the last century. The Rajbanshis represent a sizeable vote bank in the region, especially in Cooch Behar district. They started a movement during the erstwhile Left Front era, demanding a separate state. Nadda also offered prayers at the Anandamoyee Kali temple before heading for the hotel where he separately addressed local party leaders and representatives of different communities, businessmen and representatives of ethnic groups from the hills and the plains. North Bengal is important for the BJP. In the 2018 panchayat polls, which were marked by violence, the party could make dents only in a few rural pockets but things changed in 2019. The BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats last year and made deep inroads in north Bengal districts where it won seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight seats in north Bengal, the BJP is ahead of the TMC in 36. The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats. While addressing representatives of different communities and ethnic groups, Nadda said if the BJP comes to power then it will transform north Bengal by setting up industries and helping local artisans and farmers. Referring to the Gorkha community’s demand for a permanent political solution to the Gorkhaland issue, Nadda said, “We had promised in our election manifesto that a permanent political solution would be found and recognition would be given to the 11 ethnic groups. We are committed to this.” He also promised that a hub would be set up in the region to help growers of cinchona and other medicinal plants. The BJP government is forming rules to implement the new citizenship law, he said. “The work got delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The rules are being made,” he said. The TMC government has not implemented a lot of welfare projects, such as Ayushman Bharat, though which the Centre helps poor people, said Nadda. “The TMC is creating rifts in the society to help it stay in power. It has done nothing for the people. The BJP does what it promises,” said Nadda. TMC leaders in Kolkata did not react to Nadda’s visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-asks-bjp-s-north-bengal-leaders-to-struggle-relentlessly-for-6-months-ahead-of-key-polls/story-hKhViDXMx7hCOU0kBqJvSJ.html
20-10-2020||India||Scrutiny fair, but allegation of bias untrue: Facebook India MD Ajit Mohan||Since August , social media company Facebook’s Indian arm has been at the centre of a raging political controversy. That’s when the Wall Street Journal revealed how the company’s policy head Ankhi Das leaned on the team to stop them from taking action against Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Raja Singh’s post involving hate speech. Singh was subsequently banned from Facebook but the controversy spiralled into a political controversy with both the BJP and the Opposition targeting Facebook. In his first interview since the controversy, Facebook India’s Ajit Mohan speaks to Sunetra Choudhury what the company is doing to counter the perception of bias.Also Read | India must hold Facebook accountable Let’s start with the issue that has hit international headlines for Facebook-- the report that said your India public policy team was biased in favour of the BJP. Stepping back, it is important to talk about the context of that scrutiny. Lot of the scrutiny was about our content policy enforcement and some of it relating to what we call the designation process (which limits the presence on a platform as a whole) of particular individuals or organisations. Some of the designation process especially when it involves elected people, we are very careful about. That is meant by design as our bias is towards keeping as much speech on the platform as possible, even though there is no exception for violation of our community standards on hate speech for anyone. Since 2018, whenever content violated our hate speech policies, it was taken off. The enforcement around designation process does take inputs from multiple stakeholders. And yet, no one individual has any unilateral power to take this decision. The second part is that the content policy team that does the enforcement in the Indian context stands separate from the public policy team in India. I do think while scrutiny on our decisions is fair, I think the allegation of bias in this case is not true. That decision making power doesn’t sit with the public policy team in India These red flags were raised not just by media, but Facebook’s own team members in other parts of the world. What would you say about subsequent reports that said public policy chief Ankhi Das’s own posts showed her as a Modi supporter? If you are talking about historical engagement with political parties, we have worked with parties across the spectrum, and not just one party. I think you are referring to external expressions of individuals in the company, and the reality is that we do have people who hold political beliefs, who have experience sometimes in government. Our posture as a company is -- we value if they have done public service. So long as their work when they are in Facebook is objective and non-partisan... and our policies and processes are designed to ensure that it is objective. The fact that people have done work or hold a particular political belief or hold a political philosophy, that is okay. People inside the company are from across the political spectrum. Wherever we can, our bias is towards retaining free speech.Also Read | Is Facebook really ready for the 2020 election?The third thing I want to point out, the content that violated our hate speech policy (BJP MLA Raja Singh’s) was taken down even going back to 2018 and not after the Wall Street journal article. When it comes to designating an elected official, it is thoughtful and deliberate and the article came out while we were in the middle of that process. The public policy team doesn’t have enforcement power, no individual has any unilateral decision making power and the public policy team reports to me whereas the content policy team does not. There are also reports that came out suggesting that you acted promptly on BJP complaints? One report said that before 2019 polls, BJP complained against 44 posts, and 14 were taken off?The enforcement mechanism doesn’t take into account political affiliation. It is an objective process of whether it violates our community standards. So people in your team may have political affiliations?I am saying that we have people who have worked for political parties, public service is an experience we value. We don’t limit expression of our employees inside or outside the company. That’s a principle that we have defended overtly. Are you doing anything differently in the Bihar elections that you weren’t doing in 2019 polls?The political ad transparency, if you compare our tools to any other media platform, I do believe that we are at the forefront of raising the bar on transparency.  Would you accept that Twitter has outdone you in identifying fake news? I don’t want to do an editorial comparison with Twitter. In the context of US elections, what you’ve seen is us continuing to raise the bar on election integrity efforts. We won’t be allowing any new political ads in the last week of elections. So a lot of efforts, in the registration of voters and access to accurate information.But if some politician makes an election promise to say ‘I’m going to ban Corona if elected’, will you alert it as fake news?What I do know is that when it comes to Covid, Facebook does take down any content that can cause harm. Why did you appear before the Parliament panel but not in front of the Delhi government’s panel?On anything subjudice, we don’t have the luxury of talking about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scrutiny-fair-but-allegation-of-bias-untrue-ajit-mohan/story-alwlWmKDpARqctlLDWt0fM.html
20-10-2020||India||Unemployment rate improved in July-Sept ’19, shows NSO data||The unemployment rate in the quarter ended September 2019 improved by 1.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period of 2018, according to data released Monday. The National Statistics Office on Monday released employment indicators for the quarter ending September 2019.This is the fourth such quarterly bulletin based on the new Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) started in 2017-18 and gives estimates only for urban areas.According to the bulletin, the unemployment rate in July-September 2019 in urban areas was 8.4%. The rate was 20.6% among those aged 15-29 years and 8.3% for those aged 15 years and above. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) was 36.8%; 56.6% for men and 16% for women. This marked a marinal improvement over July-September 2018, when LFPR was 36.1%. In September 2018, the unemployment rate was 9.7%. This fell to 8.9% in the June quarter this year, although a sequential comparison of unemployment data isn’t advisable on account of seasonality. The estimates in the bulletin are based on the current weekly status (CWS) of those surveyed. In this approach, a person is considered part of the labour force if they worked or were available or looking for work for at least one hour during the survey week.Among those working in the quarter ending September 2019 in urban areas and of age 15 years or older, 49.6% were salaried or regular wage employees, 38.3% were self-employed and 12.1% were casual workers. Compared to the June 2019 quarter, the share of the self-employed in the work-force increased by 1.6% and that of the regular wage and casual workers decreased by 0.8% and 1.6% respectively. Compared to the September 2018 quarter, the share self employed and regular wage workers increased by 0.3% and 1% and that of casual workers decreased by 4.7%.62% of the urban workers of age 15 years or older were employed in the tertiary sector, 32.8% in the secondary sector, and 5.2% in agriculture sector. The share of those employed in agriculture was 6.1% higher than that in the June 2019 quarter while the share of those employed in the secondary sector was 1.2% lower. The share of tertiary sector workers remained the same. Compared to September 2018, however, the share of those in tertiary sector rose by 2.6% while that of agriculture and secondary sector workers declined by 10.3% and 3% respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unemployment-rate-improved-in-july-sept-19-shows-nso-data/story-ezQmY0JXJR5EOuLf79y4tM.html
20-10-2020||India||‘Quit NDA’: RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha tells Chirag Paswan||Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leader Upendra Kushwaha on Monday put out an offer to Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan to join hands, saying that there was no place for a leader like him in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Talking to the media in Bhagalpur after organisation secretary of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) Santosh Kushwaha joined the RLSP, Kushwaha said that the party would welcome the move if Paswan decided to quit the NDA. “There is no place for leaders of Dalits and extremely backward classes in the NDA, even if Paswan tore his chest to show his high regard for PM Narendra Modi like the legendry Hanuman,” said Kushwaha, who is the chief ministerial face of the front comprising Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Kushwaha, who opted out of the RJD-led Grand Alliance (GA) for various reasons like ‘adequate’ number of seats and inordinate delay in formulation of the common minimum programme, has formed the Grand Democratic Secular Front, which also comprises smaller parties like Samajwadi Janata Dal. The RLSP has announced its candidate for 104 seats, while the BSP and AIMIM would contest from 80 and 24 seats. Kushwaha, who contested the last assembly elections under the NDA fold, said that Paswan, the son of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, was showing one-sided love for the BJP, which was hardly showing any respect for his commitment. “Only those leaders can survive in the NDA, who can afford to bow their heads and indulge in flattery. It is high time he should come out and carry forward the legacy of his father,” said the RLSP chief. Paswan has been on the firing line of BJP leaders even since he compared himself to Hanuman and offered a platform to scores of disgruntled BJP and JD(U) leaders to fight the assembly polls on LJP tickets. BJP leader Prakash Javadekar and Bihar’s deputy CM Sushil Modi dubbed LJP as ‘vote-katwa’, while JD(U) leader KC Tyagi branded Paswan as ‘Kalyugi Hanuman’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quit-nda-rlsp-leader-upendra-kushwaha-tells-chirag-paswan/story-DPXph785BM7GX8W3pCMzQL.html
20-10-2020||India||Open to another stimulus, privatisation in focus: FM Nirmala Sitharaman||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the government, which has started a mid-year review of the economy, is open to offering another stimulus package and her policies are focused on shedding “socialist baggage” by encouraging greater private sector participation in the economy and instituting robust federal government structures.Sitharaman was participating in a virtual panel discussion on the launch of 15th Finance Commission chairman NK Singh’s book, Portraits of Power: Half a Century of Being at Ringside. Singapore senior minister and coordinating minister for social policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani were the other panellists at the event.Responding to a question whether another dose of stimulus is expected, Sitharaman said: “I’ve not closed the option to come up with another stimulus.”The government has already announced two packages as it attempts to revive an economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Between March 26 and May 17, the National Democratic Alliance government unveiled Rs.20.97 lakh crore of stimulus-cum-relief measures. A demand stimulus package consisting of Rs 73,000 crore in public expenditure was announced on October 12. The economy shrank by a record 23.9% in the three months ended June. The finance minister said stimulus packages are announced after wide consultations with different stakeholders and government arms. HT on October 14 reported that the government was considering a third economic stimulus package, combining fiscal and policy measures that could include incentives for the manufacturing and services sectors, income support for the jobless and incentives to people to spend instead of keeping their money in the bank.On India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts by various agencies, Sitharaman said the finance ministry had already started a mid-year assessment of the economy based on the latest inputs. “ ... we got lot of inputs which are very different from what we had in July. Perhaps, yes..., sometime we will have to come up with a statement, whether I do it in public or whether I do it in Parliament is one thing...” she said. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has predicted that India could see its worst recession ever this financial year with the economy contracting by 9.5%. The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) World Economic Outlook (WEO) report recently forecast a 10.3% contraction in India’s GDP this fiscal year.Mentioning key big-ticket reforms, she said that to realise the policy of Atmanirbhar Bharat Initiative (Self-Reliant India Initiative), there should definitively be a clear-cut mention of how the Indian economy has to shift away from undesirable socialistic baggage the country has been carrying all the while.“Second, I would think that federalism has got to be really more robust,” she said emphasising a continuous, real- time effort in this direction to make the country strong. She cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision that the country would progress rapidly if all the states grow at a similar speed. The third point, the finance minister emphasised was the need for the education system to catch up with the contemporary needs of the young. She said skill development and learning should be interwoven. Ambani spoke about three contributions to society -- transforming India towards a digital society, transforming the education system with the focus on skills, and transformation of energy from fossil fuel to renewables. “At any point in time we have 200 million children in India in the education system and it will take us 8-10 years to completely transform the skill base of India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/open-to-another-stimulus-privatisation-in-focus-fm/story-fvz0xqnz8LYnh9lKrY6HoI.html
20-10-2020||India||Ballia case: BJP MLA gets show-cause notice||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has served a show-cause notice to its Ballia legislator Surendra Singh, whose statements in defence of the main suspect in a murder case in the Uttar Pradesh district have embarrassed the party. “He has been served a show-cause notice,” a party leader said on condition of anonymity without disclosing more details. Reports said BJP chief JP Nadda had spoken to BJP’s Uttar Pradesh chief Swatantra Dev, after which the notice was served on the MLA. The BJP lawmaker’s defence of the murder suspect coincided with the campaign for seven assembly by-polls currently underway in the state. Opposition parties have begun targeting the BJP on the issue, the reason why the party chose to distance itself with the lawmaker. Earlier in the day, the controversial lawmaker said he would keep away from Ballia for some days after being rebuked by the party leadership for defending his supposed aide Dheerendra Pratap Singh, who was arrested in connection with a shootout in the district. “I would be staying in Lucknow for a couple of days,” Surendra Singh said without specifying a reason why he wanted to avoid visiting Ballia.The development came as the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Ballia, on Monday remanded Dheerendra Pratap Singh to 14 days in judicial custody. Dheerendra Pratap Singh had allegedly shot dead a 46-year-old man identified as Jaiprakash Pal during a meeting on the allocation of two fair price shops in Durjanpur village of Ballia on October 15 in the presence of police and administrative officials. The Special Task Force of the UP police arrested him from Lucknow on Sunday.Surendra Singh was summoned to Lucknow on Sunday by state BJP chief Swatantra Dev and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, who disapproved of his conduct in the case. “The MLA has been told in plain words to keep away from the case and to not make statements,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity. The outspoken MLA admitted he had been asked by the party leadership to lie low, but refused to concede that his staying away from Ballia was connected to the arrest of his aide .“Yes, I was asked not to make any statements in the case. See, all I wanted was to make sure that both sides were heard, that’s all,” he said. “I told the leadership that all I wanted was that the accused be punished, whosoever they might be, but uniformly and fairly,” he said. The BJP didn’t make any official comment if the MLA had been asked to stay out of Ballia so that he didn’t influence the probe. “He was summoned and snubbed by the party leadership,” was all that a BJP leader privy to the developments in the case said. Surendra Singh had not only openly admitted that Dheerendra Pratap Singh was a BJP member, but had also approached the police, claiming that a cross-complaint by family members of the main suspect in the murder case be also registered.On Friday, the BJP MLA said that Dheerendra Pratap Singh had opened fire in self-defence. He claimed that had Dheerendra Pratap Singh not opened fire, dozens of women of his family would have been hurt or killed.On Saturday, Surendra Singh visited Revati police station in Ballia and demanded that a first information report be registered on an application moved by women in Dheerendra Pratap Singh’s family who, he alleged, were injured in stone-throwing during Thursday’s incident. He also took them to the district hospital and got them medically examined.“I am carrying with me the medical reports of five women (Dheerendra’s Pratap Singh’s relatives) who were injured in the stone-pelting incident,” the MLA said before his meeting with the state BJP leadership on Sunday.In a video message that surfaced on social media on Saturday, the accused claimed he was innocent and was being framed.After his arrest on Sunday, STF officials said Dheerendra Pratap Singh claimed in a statement that his associates and he opened fire in retaliation when another group, led by a man identified as Krishna Kant Yadav, opened fire on them. He said Dheerendra Pratap Singh’s nephew Golu Singh and women members of his family were critically injured in the firing by the rival group. Golu Singh died of his injuries during treatment, the STF quoted him as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ballia-case-bjp-mla-gets-show-cause-notice/story-lYmeOIbp0yB2Vs14Dd04gN.html

20-10-2020||India||Permissions, tests, masks, checks: How a Ramlila overcame the odds||The Ramayana is the story of the victory of good over evil. When the capital’s much-celebrated Ramlila “SHRI RAM,” a dance- drama, opened on Saturday , the team of artistes at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK), which organises the annual cultural extravaganza, also rejoiced at the victory of their optimism over the all-pervading pessimism caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic. After all, they managed to stage the spectacular ballet based on the life of Lord Ram at a time when many Ramlilas across the city have either been cancelled or truncated for lack of time to make preparations, restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the viral disease, and delayed official permissions. Putting together the dance-drama -- a unique fusion of many forms of Indian classical music and folk dances, martial and acrobatic arts, masks and make-up styles -- which requires months of preparation, was a formidable challenge when pandemic is raging. Shobha Deepak Singh, who has directed this unique version of the Ramlila for almost five decades, says she was determined to try and ensure that there was no break in the annual event, first staged in 1957 under the stewardship of her mother Sumitra Charat Ram. The SBKK’s Ramlila has, over the years, seen the participation of some the biggest names in classical music and dance, and has figured prominently on the capital’s cultural calendar. “ The only thing that worried me was getting the permissions on time. But we wanted to start rehearsals, and so each of our 60 artists and technicians underwent a corona test and everyone tested negative and the rehearsals got underway in August,” said Singh, sitting in her office, decorated with Indian artefacts and artworks. “Even though everyone tested negative for the coronavirus disease, we started rehearsals in small batches with all necessary precautions. There were temperature checks everyday and when in the green room, everyone wore masks. We put up all artists in the hostel within the campus and every one underwent a test every 15th day,” said Shashidharan Nair, the choreographer of the presentation for the past 25 years. Among those who were not sure if they will be able to perform in front of a live audience was Raj Kumar Sharma, who has played Ram for the past two decades now. The coronavirus was capable of springing a nasty surprise anytime. “ Even as we rehearsed, most artists were not sure that eventually the event will be staged, pandemic was far from abating, and even by late September the permission to hold the event was still awaited, ” says Sharma, sitting in front of a large mirror in the green room with large table mirrors. Costumes, masks, crowns, bows and arrows hang on the wall.  Singh came to the rehearsals every day to ensure that new news costumes and scenes that she had introduced this year came through well. For the uninitiated, the SBKK Ramlila is also pageantry of regal costumes and jewellery, a lot of which is inspired by the works of painter Raja Ravi Verma. “I have been constantly experimenting with music, make-up, sets, lights, costumes, jewellery and technology so that our production has something fresh to offer to the audiences,” says Singh, who believes that technology and tradition co-exist. Last year, she introduced multiple LED screens on the open-air stage to display many scenes such as Hanuman bringing the Sanjeevani Booti; Ram and his army crossing the sea into Lanka over floating stones – which gave the presentation a feel of a 3-D visual extravaganza. She was satisfied with the preparations. In mid- September,. it was time for all to undergo another coronavirus test. This time, the coronavirus did spring a nasty surprise. Singh tested positive. Everyone else, thankfully , tested negative. Many artistes thought it was curtains for the show as she shifted to a hospital in Gurgaon. “ Our spirits sank. But she kept telling us from hospital to keep the rehearsal on, to be ready to stage the Ramlila even if we got the permission last day. The rehearsal went on in her absence,” says Nair. Singh returned after two weeks to a cheering welcome by the artistes. But the permission to hold the Ramlila had not yet come. Singh activated her plan B – between October 10 and 12 , the Ramlila was recorded to be screened on YouTube in case the live event had to be cancelled at the last moment. But, finally, the government gave its go-ahead, with riders, for the event. And the stage was set for the inauguration of the 64th edition of the SBKK’s Ramlila. Arrangements were made for seating about 100 people for reasons of social- distancing, unlike in the past when about 600 could see the Ramlila every day. On Saturday, it was 6 pm, half an hour before the show. Singh was inside the green room of women’s artistes, having a word with Madhavi Rastogi, who is playing Sita. Rastogi is busy adjusting her jewellery, her fellow artists lending a helping hand. There are also other young women artistes playing female characters—Kaikayee , Yaraka, Manthara—touching up their lips, faces, eyes, all finally excited to perform before the live audience many of whom, wearing masks, have already taken the seats placed at quite a distance from each other. “ I love playing Sita, which is quite an emotional roller coaster ride for me; but what saddens me is the fact that women continue to face ordeal by fire to prove themselves every day, ” says Rastogi. Singh says that for her, the Ramanaya is essentially a saga of devotion, loyalty, endearing family relationships, and respect for elders. “ So, we have always tried to make our version of Ramlila entertaining and enlightening. I have studied Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas deeply over the last 50 years, and the most important lesson I have drawn is that to err is human, to forgive divine,” she says. It is 6.30 in the evening, and the open-air stage at SBKK has come alive. The inaugural show has begun as scheduled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permissions-tests-masks-checks-how-a-ramlila-overcame-the-odds/story-opbZb8T29aSmvPsz8VNfBJ.html
20-10-2020||Editorials||In festival season, exercise due caution||The Covid-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on Durga Puja festivities across India. According to a report in this newspaper, puja organisers in Delhi have decided to suspend large-scale public celebrations. In West Bengal, the celebrations will be muted too, with many organisers taking a range of measures, as per the state’s “General Guidelines for Durga Puja 2020”. However, there is unhappiness in certain quarters over Monday’s Calcutta High Court (HC) order that banned visitors from pandals and ordered police to set up barricades outside structures that have attracted thousands of devotees already. On Tuesday, the Durgotsav Forum, an umbrella organisation of Kolkata’s 400 biggest pujas, filed a review petition against the order.While there may be some difficulties in following the HC guidelines, citizens must understand that this is a pandemic year, and wearing masks, ensuring distance and washing hands are the only ways to prevent the spread of the disease. A popular pandal in Kolkata easily attracts thousands of visitors each night. In fact, in its order, HC said it is inconceivable that Kolkata Police will “have enough personnel” to man the more than 3,000 pujas held within its jurisdiction or to meaningfully control the massive crowds, in addition to its other duties.So the onus falls squarely on organisers and the public to behave responsibly. India is at the crossroads. If caution is not exercised and safety protocols are not followed, as the experience in other countries and in Kerala during Onam celebrations have shown, the numbers could shoot up again. The festival season has a large socio-economic footprint; but this year it may be best to express faith privately. God will understand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-festival-season-exercise-due-caution/story-Fq0ZTWjDwLtbkP3HwQNxGL.html
