22-10-2020||News||WTO needs to get its mojo back. A new SDG round of negotiations would help||It is common knowledge that the Doha Round of trade negotiations has long been dead. Yet the fundamental basis of the Doha Round, namely, that the WTO must mainstream development in all its work is a sound one and worth pursuing. The WTO is on the verge of getting fresh top leadership which is a very good thing. The substantial challenge, however, is to build a consensus around a common work programme and a negotiating agenda. There is no gainsaying the fact that there is a backlash against globalisation, free trade and by extension, against international organisations such as WTO. People who have lost out from technological disruption, globalisation or free trade have found an important voice and have started asserting themselves through political choices made in national elections. These are subsequently reflected in country negotiating positions in the WTO. This is hard to ignore anymore; on the other hand, it is for organisations such as WTO to demonstrate that it is on the side of the underdog and the vulnerable in this political battle that is being played out. What better way to do this than by announcing that the WTO’s future work programme and negotiating agenda will be based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so painstakingly agreed upon by all UN members in 2015.A new SDG round of trade negotiations has numerous advantages for the WTO.First, it is hard to disagree with the SDGs themselves since all countries have publicly committed themselves to achieving it within a definite time frame; so, dubbed the Agenda 2030.Second, it will be a splendid opportunity for the much-maligned WTO to get its mojo back and secure endorsement for the principle of free trade. After all, it is a matter of consensus among economists of all hues that trade is indeed the best instrument for achieving many of the SDGs.Third, the WTO’s future work programme and negotiating agenda must be directly linked to the objectives of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO i.e. raising standards of living, ensuring full employment, expanding the production and trade in goods and services, the optimal use of resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development and finally to do this for all countries at different levels of economic development. This is very similar to SDG number eight which talks of promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth as well as full and productive employment and decent work for all. What would this entail in practical terms for the WTO? First, the WTO must carefully recalibrate the Special and Differential Treatment for countries that deserve it. Rather than junk the whole concept or excessively politicise it, there is a simple metric which can be used to redefine it. The SDG number one is described thus: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The best place to begin for achieving this goal is with the regions where “extreme poverty” is widely prevalent. The two geographical regions which display “extreme poverty” are: parts of Africa and South Asia. It goes without saying therefore that countries belonging to these two geographical regions must get Special and Differential Treatment without any question. Extreme poverty is now well defined and is backed by the Oxford Multidimensional Index of Poverty, so objective criteria may be utilised for deciding countries which are eligible. This automatically takes care of the American argument that countries such as Singapore and South Korea (or China for that matter) cannot lay automatic claim to Special and Differential Treatment.The multilateral negotiations on Fisheries Subsidies is proceeding apace and must be concluded by the next Ministerial Conference in June 2021. Again, these negotiations must be consistent with SDG number fourteen which is defined thus: Conserve and use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Developing countries and least-developed countries whose citizens depend on fisheries for their livelihood must be treated appropriately in these negotiations.Agriculture has always been a contentious subject in past WTO negotiations. Again, the SDG number two provides sufficient guidance in this critical area: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. The US, EU and other rich countries have long subsidised their agriculture, often with disastrous consequences for the economies of developing and least-developed countries. It is time to make amends. The credibility of the WTO, no less, is at stake.Electronic Commerce poses enormous challenges for developing and least-developed countries. These challenges have to do with digital infrastructure, digital literacy and data sovereignty. The SDG number nine that talks of building resilient infrastructure, promotes inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation should guide these negotiations. There is a steep learning curve ahead for several countries about the implications of digitalisation in the context of the fourth industrial revolution and developed countries need to take into account the serious digital divide that currently exists when they pursue their national interests in these negotiations.The above is obviously not an exhaustive list but an illustrative one. More crucially, it provides a template for the new round of trade negotiations and the work programme of the WTO by anchoring it in the all-important SDGs. Such a move can kill two birds with one stone: to revive the negotiating agenda as well as to resuscitate the WTO itself.(Dr Mohan Kumar is a former Indian negotiator at the WTO, former Indian Ambassador to France and currently Chairman, RIS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/wto-world-trade-organisation/story-TmP5vBUlM8IxFCc12L8uOO.html
22-10-2020||News||Expand and strengthen the Indian State||Over the past few decades, the public discourse regarding the role of the Indian State in the economy and society has become deeply flawedThe disillusionment with the Nehruvian dirigiste State and samajwadi (socialist) policies has generated a backlash against the government and especially government employees. Since the 1990s, the chorus of reducing the size of the government has reached a crescendo with government jobs as favourite target of the chatterati. The perception is that the government is oversized, and we must “reform” the government by reducing the number of officials and employees across government departments and public sector.But the reality is that India has among the lowest public sector employment ratios in the world. According to the Seventh Pay Commission, there were only 139 government employees for every 100,000 people, excluding railways and postal departments. In contrast, the United States (US), with its ”minimum government”, has 668 government employees per 100,000 residents. Most of the government employees in India work in the railways, postal department, home ministry, and in defence while areas such as health and urban development have only a skeleton of the government staffing.There were 750,000 vacancies at the level of central government alone in 2014. Around 38% posts of judges in high courts are lying vacant. In the states, the bureaucracy has been slowly diminishing due to the absence of recruitment at mid-level positions for years.Instead of cutting down the supposedly bloated government sector, what India needs is augmentation of State capacity by hiring more people. Reforming the public sector is not synonymous with cutting down the number of employees. What India needs is restructuring by redeploying its public sector workforce towards delivery of public services.There are massive vacancies in schools, totalling around one million across states. There are around 30% vacancies in the rural and agricultural ministries, which have the task of implementing ambitious governmental schemes affecting a majority of citizens. Even central universities and colleges have been reduced to a pitiable state, with more than 50% vacancies in some cases. And the less we talk about state universities, the better, for the recruitment process can be stuck endlessly.The Indian State is being reduced to a ghost State with successive governments beholden to the humbug of finance and its inexplicable opposition to public spending. It is alleged that paying salaries to government employees is wasteful expenditure and a drag on economic growth. This shallow reasoning fails to take in account the positive impact of a well-staffed and functioning State on economic growth. More judges will ensure speedy justice in the hopelessly overburdened judicial system; more policemen will mean better law and order; and more doctors mean better health care. Only in an alternative world can they be a burden on the economic growth.Government employment has also been a major source of demand due to job stability and better pay in an economy with a low per-capita income, evident in this pandemic. The inability or unwillingness to impose proper performance criteria does not mean that government should stop hiring people altogether. And the problem has never been the numbers of government employees, which was always abysmal. It is about the excessive and arbitrary powers in the hands of the bureaucracy leading to rent-seeking and ability to obstruct lives of the private citizens. We have seen this bureaucratic raj during the pandemic when 4,000 rules were issued in four months creating chaos. The solution, thus, lies in reforming the public services and not disbanding them.The rhetoric of free-market or less government fails to realise that India has historically not had a large, effective State over centuries. People lived without the protection of the State, be it under the military occupation of the Sultanate period or the extractive Mughal State. In fact, the ideal of “Apne Raja Ram” (our king is Ram) spread from village to village as people avoided interacting with the State for settling disputes and societal affairs. Despite creating the foundations of a modern bureaucracy, even colonial rule was a distant, minimalist and non-interventionist State.And the Republic of India too failed to build a strong State with an effective presence at the grassroots, and instead, exercised coercive power via police and district magistrates. Over the last few decades, even the limited gains made in augmenting State capacity are withering away. But the core point is that citizens do not desire the retreat of the State. Instead, they desire more State presence. The entire movement of the Dalits and other subaltern castes is aimed at becoming “visible to the State”, and invoke its protection against the harsh socio-economic realities of their existence. We must start appreciating the fact that after centuries we have a State. And we must learn to own it and build it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/expand-and-strengthen-the-indian-state/story-UMjuHUV0U26YmSnedLKK7I.html
22-10-2020||News||The India moment in the $100-billion club||After the announcement of its results in October, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)’s market valuation rose to $144.7 billion, pipping Accenture at $142.4 billion and IBM at $110.5 billion. All at once, TCS has become globally the most-valued company in its market segment, IT services. What does the achievement mean? Who are the global market leaders in other sectors? How big is the $100-billion-dollar market capitalisation club? And how has it evolved in the last two decades? In 2000, the most-valued company in the world was General Electric with a market cap of over $500 billion. At that time, there were 43 companies globally with a market cap of over $100 billion. The total market capitalisation of all these companies together was almost $9 trillion. Among the companies, 21 were from the United States (US), seven from Brazil, four from the United Kingdom (UK), three from Japan and the others were from the rest of Europe. There was a full spread of sectors represented by these companies, with media and telecom being the most significant — 12 of the 43 companies belonged to this sector. However, companies represented other sectors too — industrials, energy, consumer and retail, health care, big tech, IT services and financial services. If one evaluated the discrete segments, the segment leaders came from the US or Brazil. By 2010, after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the standings in the club changed, the impact of the Asian century had started to take effect, but as it were, only for China. Globally, the number of $100-billion companies had risen to 51, but the impact of GFC brought down total market capitalisation of all these companies put together, to around $8.2 trillion. Country representation had also changed. While the US still had nearly 50% of the companies on the list, China’s share had grown to the second-highest at 14%. A few other countries such as Brazil, UK, Australia and Switzerland also had companies in the club. It was financial services and energy (specifically oil and gas) companies that dominated the list, and Exxon Mobil was the world’s most valuable company. Sector leaders were relatively spread across countries — big tech from the US (Apple), banking from China (ICBC), commodities from Australia (BHP), consumer and retail from Switzerland (Nestle). India did not have any companies in the club, though China had ICBC at that time. By 2020, the world has seen the emergence of the trillion-dollar market cap companies. This is a new phenomenon with five trillion-dollar behemoths. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google’s parent) are all from Silicon Valley; the one exception being Saudi Aramco in this top set. Each of these companies can consume the entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of all but 16 countries (that have a GDP of over $1 trillion) in the world. The membership of the $100-billion club has grown to over 100 companies, with 60 of them coming from the US. The total market capitalisation of these 106 firms is over $26 trillion, with 35% of this coming from big tech. Banks and energy companies seem to be past their prime — taking only around 10% share each. China’s share has remained relatively unchanged since 2010 at 14%, with its banks being replaced by China’s big tech companies, such as Alibaba and Tencent. Countries such as Brazil and the UK have all but disappeared. The silver lining in all of this is that India has entered this club with the entry of two of its companies — Reliance Industries and TCS. The bulk of the segment leaders come from the US — Apple (big tech, at over $2 trillion), Walmart (consumer and retail, beating Proctor & Gamble), Berkshire Hathaway (financials, beating Visa), Johnson & Johnson (health care, beating United Health Group), Tesla (industrials and electronics, beating Taiwan Semiconductors), Verizon (media and telecom, beating Disney), UPS (logistics) and then we have Saudi Aramco from Saudi Arabia in energy and TCS from India in IT services. Chinese big tech firms have very high market valuations but are not segment leaders, being pipped by the US big tech firms out of Silicon Valley. In fact, no Chinese company currently is a global segment leader. Interestingly, two of the four trillion-dollar Silicon Valley market cap companies are led by CEOs of Indian origin. It is worthwhile to appreciate the full achievement of TCS. In 2000, TCS was not a listed company. It was not even the segment leader in India. By 2010, its market cap had grown to a creditable $25 billion and it had become the segment leader in India. In the next 10 years, it has managed to enter the $100 billion club, and today, it has become a global segment leader. India, therefore, is the only Asian country that can currently boast of a global segment leader. It is worth noting that the segment that TCS operates in is ruthlessly competitive. It is global and of late has suffered from the changes in US policy on immigration that has adversely affected Indian talent. Unlike big tech in China, TCS has got no protection or specific support from the Indian government in its path to leadership. In fact, most of its revenues are global.  This terrific achievement opens a fundamental geopolitical business opportunity. Can we make 2020 the “US’ India decade” with a partnership in technology, just like 2000 was the “US’ China decade”, which propelled China to global dominance in manufacturing? It will require a determined effort, but the talent is there, and the underlying national governance is based on democratic values, much-needed in developing global standards in data protection and privacy, distinct from the values espoused by China. To think Microsoft and Google are run by CEOs of Indian origin is just an indicator of the potential. Will we take it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-india-moment-in-the-100-billion-club/story-pmoISN0hYhanvOijLDkCpJ.html

22-10-2020||Mumbai||30-year-old Mumbai resident, his aide held for plotting own abduction for ₹1 lakh||Oshiwara police on Thursday arrested a 30-year-old Andheri resident who plotted his own abduction to extort ₹1 lakh from his brother-in-law along with his aide. The arrested accused Jitendrakumar Yadav, with the help of his friend Indrakumar Yadav, shot a video wherein he was seen tied to a chair and sent the video to his wife, who was in Uttar Pradesh, and his brother-in-law Sushilkumar Yadav, said police officers. The accused then sent a message and called Sushilkumar asking him to deposit ₹1 lakh in Yadav’s bank account.Upon getting the messages, Sushikumar approached Oshiwara police on Wednesday, following which a case of kidnapping was registered. A team led by sub-inspector Tushar Sawant started searching for Yadav. On Thursday morning, police found Yadav sitting in his car parked near Taraporewala Garden in Oshiwara. Dayanand Bangar, senior inspector from Oshiwara police station, said, “We brought him to police station and questioned him about his kidnapping after which he confessed to the crime. We found the mobile phone, with the video, from his possession.” “We also found the chats where he had sought a ransom from Sushilkumar, his wife and other family members. During interrogation, he said he had borrowed money from someone but was unable to replay; this led him to plot his own abduction. He further said he took his friend Indrakumar’s help to record the video at his (Indrakumar’s) home. We have arrested Indrakumar too,” Bangar said. Apart from section 364A (Kidnapping for ransom) of the Indian Penal Code, Oshiwara police also added sections 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), and 182 (false information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person) against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-year-old-mumbai-resident-his-aide-held-for-plotting-own-abduction-for-1-lakh/story-ZGoRUHwER2b0M30VcN4usK.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||As classes go online, IIT-Bombay collects ₹4 crore through crowdfunding to buy laptops, broadband for needy students||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), which is currently conducting its semester online, raised around ₹4 crore from its alumni as well as the public for its students who are in need of laptops, broadband and other infrastructure to attend the classes. Around 700 students have benefitted from the donations and are attending the online classes, said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri. In June, the institute decided to move to online mode of instruction for the entire autumn semester in view of the safety of students amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In a survey conducted by the institute, many students across all programmes had stated that they did not have the facility to attend classes online. To help these students, Chaudhuri had appealed to its alumni and to the public to help the institute purchase laptops and broadband connectivity for such students. Chaudhuri said donors will be entitled to tax benefits under section 80G of the Income Tax Act. On Wednesday, Chaudhuri took to social media to share that the crowdsourcing initiative had been a success. A fourth-year energy science and engineering student from Baramati, Pune, who is a part of the institute’s racing team, thanked the sponsor for the laptop received through the funding. Chaudhuri said that the fundraising campaign would also continue for the incoming batch of students of the academic year 2020-21. “We are thankful to the donors who came in large numbers to support our students. We hope the campaign keeps going as the new batch of first-year students will soon join IIT-B, and some of them may possibly require support,” he said. Meanwhile, the institute is working to bring students and researchers back on campus in a phased manner. A committee has been set up to devise a ‘slow reboot plan’ and resume research work at the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-classes-go-online-iit-bombay-collects-4-crore-through-crowdfunding-to-buy-laptops-broadband-for-needy-students/story-1QqrQb0IJpwk0lF3UseoUM.html

22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana initiates process to omit word ‘Punjab’ from its laws||Nearly 55 years after it was carved out as a separate state, Haryana has initiated the process to omit the word Punjab from its laws.The state government has constituted a committee to remove Punjab from nearly 237 Acts on the initiative of state assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta. Most of the acts are related to revenue and police departments and have the word Punjab in them, according to officials.Haryana was carved out as a separate state from undivided Punjab on November 1, 1966 under the Punjab Reorganisation Act. Haryana had adopted various acts which were already in force in undivided Punjab to run its administration. It was then resolved that the new state would be governed by the laws applicable in Punjab and it could make necessary amendments as per its requirements after two years.While a majority of the acts were amended over the years, Gupta had last month mooted the proposal to omit Punjab from the remaining acts.“Haryana is gearing up to do away with the name of the state of Punjab from its laws. The state government has constituted a Committee in this regard after the initiatives of Vidhan Sabha Speaker, Gian Chand Gupta,” a state government statement said here on Thursday.The committee constituted under the chairmanship of the legal remembrancer and administrative secretary of the law and justice department will review and examine the amendment of the subtitles of the acts, it said.The state government has informed the Haryana Vidhan Sabha Secretariat regarding the constitution of the committee which will submit its report to Haryana chief secretary, Vijai Vardhan, within a month.According to the order issued by Vardhan, the members of this committee will include the officer on special duty (OSD), law and justice department, deputy secretary of department of political and parliamentary affairs and OSD (rules) of general administration department.“Haryana had inherited the laws which were in Punjab’s name and the governance in Haryana has been based on these laws for the last over 54 years. The people of the state have been demanding to change the laws and add the name of Haryana,” the statement said. Gupta had held a meeting with the officers of the state government and of the Vidhan Sabha Secretariat at the state assembly secretariat on September 24, in this regard. The speaker had instructed the chief secretary to formulate a plan to omit Punjab from all the state laws and the decision to constitute the committee was also taken in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-initiates-process-to-omit-word-punjab-from-its-laws/story-FwUW0ijUr5P0lBu3qcsQIK.html
22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus cases continue to decline in Haryana||The coronavirus infections in Haryana continued its downward trend for the fourth consecutive week. Last week (October 12 to 18), as many as 7,878 new cases were reported in the state, a decrease of 399 as compared to the week before (October 5 to 11). Between October 5 to 11, as many as 8,277 infections were reported as compared to 10,096 reported the week before, a reduction of 1,819 cases. The state had reported 2,429 lesser infections during September 28 to October 4 as compared to the week before (September 21 to 27) and there was a decline of over 5,000 cases between September 21 and 27. The state had registered an all-time high of 17,616 cases between September 14 to 20. The decline in number of infections over the last four weeks has also brought down the active cases in the state. As on Thursday, there were 10,009 active cases. Testing also goes down The sampling done by health authorities to detect new infections has also witnessed a decline. The authorities tested 1,63,974 persons last week, a reduction of 22,849 samples from the week before when 1,86,823 persons were tested. Out of the 1,63,974 samples taken last week, about 1.05 lakh reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 58,743 rapid antigen tests were done. The reduction in testing has also resulted in reducing the rate of infection. As per the health department statistics, 18 of the 22 districts continued to have more than 200 total active cases and more than 15 active cases per lakh population, both critical values as per the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) parameters. Only Bhiwani, Nuh and Palwal have lesser number of cases on both counts (total active cases and active cases per lakh). Charkhi Dadri has more than 15 active cases per lakh population but less than 200 total active cases. The infection doubling rate calculated over a seven-day period is more than 28 days for each of the 22 districts, a desirable value as per the MoHFW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-cases-continue-to-decline-in-haryana/story-D34eISwJNfewUDHjJ1IcmN.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC to rope in two road consultants for utility duct study across Mumbai||In a bid to reduce the need to dig up the city’s roads for utility repairs and maintenance, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appointed two road design consultants to map all underground utilities and prepare a plan to shift all utilities to ducts. This is meant to ensure that any maintenance work on them does not damage the roads.Civic officials claim that repeated digging up of roads affects its upper layers and leads to water seepage. A proposal to approve the consultants’ appointment has been tabled before the BMC’s standing committee, which is scheduled to meet on October 26. A senior civic official from the roads department said, “Most of the time, utility agencies dig up roads without permission, in the wake of an emergency. This leads to deterioration of the roads. We realised that ducting of these utilities is essential so that if they have to be repaired, the roads will not be dug up.”As per the contract terms, the consultants will undertake a preliminary exercise of mapping the existing utilities, preparing designs and drawings for trench-free pavements with utility ducts, and preparing estimates of the project. The contract is for a period of five years. They will suggest priority locations where the mapping of utilities can be done on a pilot basis.There are 36 different utility agencies that dig up Mumbai’s roads – the highest in any Indian city – for repairing or maintaining lines of electricity, telephone, internet connections and cooking gas supply. The agencies dig up roads to lay their cables or for repairs, but when the time comes to fill them up, they do a shoddy job or leave it unattended for days.Several western countries have proper ducts for underground utilities that have entry points at regular intervals. The BMC is planning to have similar ducts across the city. Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Matunga, said, “It is a good idea to shift all the utilities to ducts, but why can they not do this when they take up road repair works. It is the same with footpaths where two different agencies work on roads and adjacent footpaths at different times, leading to uneven construction.”The design consultants have been assigned a set of 54 roads across the city to map utilities. These include some major roads like P D’Mello Road, Walkeshwar Marg, Belasis Road, Senapati Bapat Marg, Juhu Versova Link Road, Carter Road, SV Road and Malad Link Road. Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party MLA and group leader in the BMC, said, “This is a very important project, and ducting of utilities has been a long-pending demand. I will be demanding a proper presentation to be given to the standing committee on the entire project, and it should not be cleared without thorough scrutiny.”The BMC looks after about 2000km of the city’s roads, for which it takes up repair works every year. In its budget, the civic body had increased its allocation for road works by 25% this year. It had made a provision of ₹1,520 crore for more than 300km of road works.GFXRoads selected for underground utility ducting: P D’Mello Road, Walkeshwar Marg, Belasis Road, Senapati Bapat Marg, Juhu Versova Link Road, Carter Road, SV Road and Malad Link Road.

22-10-2020||City||Congress to move private members bill in Haryana assembly||The Congress has decided to move a private members bill in the upcoming Haryana assembly session, commencing from November 5, seeking punishment for firms or traders buying farmers produce below the minimum support price (MSP).Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said, “The bill will guarantee that the farmers produce will be procured at MSP and any person or firm found purchasing below this price will face a criminal case. We will see how many MLAs will disagree with our bill. The Centre’s bill will be applicable in Haryana after the government disables the contract farming law which was passed in 2007 during my regime,” Hooda said.He said the ruling party is misleading people about the contract farming law, which was implemented during his tenure as the chief minister in 2007. “The contract farming rule framed by my government says the agreed rate or contract rate shall not be less than the MSP of the proceeding year. Where there is no MSP and no agreed rate, the amount of security shall be calculated at the rate of 15% of the prevailing market rate of agreement,” he said, while asking the ruling party if the new laws have such provisions to protect farmers.Speaker to decide if the bill will be tabled or not: KhattarReacting to Hooda’s claims, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said he does not know about the private member’s bill and when such bill was last brought in the assembly. “We will check whether any contract farming law is still applicable in Haryana or not. The Speaker will have to decide whether to table the private bill or not.”“The Punjab government has passed bills which gives guarantee of MSP for paddy and wheat crops. However, the Haryana government is already purchasing Bajra, moong, mustard seed, wheat, sunflower and paddy crops on MSP. Our government is purchasing most crops on MSP and the neighbouring state has passed a bill for two crops, which are purchased by the central agencies,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-to-move-private-members-bill-in-haryana-assembly/story-71z3M5p0CHBOZkV7bBQVnO.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases below 10,000 for fifth day in a row||For the fifth consecutive day, Maharashtra reported a daily Covid-19 caseload of under 10,000, with 7,539 new cases on Thursday. However, there are concerns about the case fatality rate (CFR), with some districts recording spikes in reported deaths. The state’s overall CFR has been constant at 2.64% for the last five days. Maharashtra’s tally of positive cases touched 1,625,197 on Thursday, of which 150,011 are active. The state also reported 198 deaths, pushing the death toll to 42,831. So far, 84,02,559 tests have been carried out in Maharashtra, of which 75,066 were conducted in the last 24 hours. The state’s positivity rate is 19.34%.On Thursday, Mumbai reported 1,463 new cases of Covid-19, taking the city’s tally to 247,332, of which 17,505 are active cases. With 49 fatalities reported on Thursday, the city’s death toll stands at 9,961. There has been a gradual dip in reported cases from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which saw 1,302 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday.The rate of infection in Pune district has also decreased. On Thursday, the district reported 885 new cases of Covid-19 and 14 fatalities. Pune city reported 367 new cases, while its rural areas saw 343 new cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 175 cases. Nagpur city reported 354 new cases and 13 deaths, while rural areas of Nagpur reported 122 new cases and seven fatalities.Despite a steady decline in recorded cases, some districts in the state have seen a jump in Covid fatalities between September 15 and October 15. While the absolute number of deaths has gone down from 6,768 in the last two weeks of September to 4,534 in the first two weeks of October, CFR has spiked in some areas.A health department official, requesting anonymity, said, “If the denominator [confirmed cases] is reducing, CFR will remain higher. CFR will gradually decrease. The positive here is that we are not reporting deaths in the range of 350-400, which we did in September.”Districts such as Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Sindhudurg, Satara have seen spikes in recorded deaths between September 15 and October 15. Sindhudurg had 42 deaths on September 15, which rose by 180% to 118 on October 15. Chandrapur had 62 deaths on September 15, which climbed to 203 in October 15 — a jump of 227%. Gadchiroli recorded a five-fold increase in the same period, with the number of deaths rising from five to 25.“Some districts added their numbers late and therefore, it is seen during that period. Besides that, late tests and delayed admission in hospitals are also reasons for increase in deaths in rural parts,” said the health department official. On Thursday, 16,177 patients were discharged, taking the total number of recovered Covid-19 patients in the state to 14,31,856. Maharashtra’s recovery rate is 88.10%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-cases-below-10k-for-5th-day-in-a-row/story-1CDxpa0LS8v91UjP3ppapN.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai power outage: MERC orders inquiry, report expected in 3 months||Taking suo moto cognisance on the Mumbai power outage earlier this month, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has ordered an independent inquiry into the incident. The investigating committee has been directed to submit a report on the matter within three months prior to which an interim report is expected in a month.In its order released on Friday, MERC stated that the committee needs to “verify and analyse the submissions of all parties, to find out the root cause of the incident, to examine the adequacy of protection systems/islanding system, etc, and to verify the adequacy of responses of all concerned.” The committee also has to probe if generation and distribution companies followed protocol for restoration of power supply to the city. In a separate notification, MERC stated that the committee would include retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Dr Sudhir Kumar Goel as chairman, V Ramakrishnan, ex-member of the Central Electricity Authority and Dr Faruk Kazi, head of the electrical engineering department at the Veermara Jijabai Technical Institute. It has also directed the parties involved or the distribution companies to conduct and submit internal inquiries to the commission, and the committee constituted by it. MERC, on Wednesday, had conducted a hearing with the distribution companies on the power outage that crippled Mumbai and its adjoining areas on October 12. Many areas in the city and the metropolitan region did not receive power for almost 15 hours. According to the order, the committee will also suggest remedial measures on a medium-term basis and corrective actions to avoid such incidents in the future. State energy minister Nitin Raut has also ordered an inquiry by a six-member committee to examine the reasons which led to the massive outage. Plan to set up 1,000 MW gas power unit at Uran State energy minister Nitin Raut on Thursday asked the Maharashtra State Energy Generation Company Ltd (Mahagenco) to set-up a 1000 MW gas power unit at the Uran Gas Turbine Power Generation to support Mumbai’s growing power demands. He asked the state’s generation company to submit a project report at the earliest. At present, Mumbai’s peak power demand is close to 2800MW, which is expected to increase to 500MW by 2030. Currency the Uran station has a capacity of 672MW which can be increased with already available infrastructure, a statement issued by Raut’s office stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-power-outage-merc-orders-inquiry-report-expected-in-3-months/story-BL65UQwGQdcSqJAO3cqaiL.html

All the accused are lodged in the Palghar sub-jail and will undergo Covid-19 tests as per protocol, said Adhikari. Meanwhile, justice PP Jadhav, the Thane special sessions court judge, on Thursday postponed the bail application hearing of 62 other accused to November 3 after state’s special prosecutor Satish Maneshinde wanted the three investigative officers who registered the three first information report (FIRs) to be present in the court. The judge has asked the three officers to be present in the court on November 3. The Maharashtra crime investigation department (CID) on Wednesday had named 208 new accused and arrested 50 more people in the April 16 lynching case in which a mob attacked two sadhus and their driver. Kalpvrush Giri, 70, Sushil Giri, 35, and driver Nilesh Telgade, 30, were dragged out of their vehicle and thrashed by the mob in Gadhchinchale village, about 110 km from Palghar, after the villagers suspected them to be thieves. Until now, a total of 366 accused have been arrested, of which 11 are juveniles. Of these, 37 accused, including nine juveniles, have been released on bail, as the CID in its charge sheet did not name their involvement in the lynching. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ram Kadam on Thursday, in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, demanded that the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as the state CID was “not making any progress” in the lynching probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-mob-lynching-case-32-of-50-arrested-on-wednesday-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody/story-xwt6lQmnGCyKS6Zm7wpc2I.html

Panipat deputy superintendent of police (DSP headquarters) Satish Vats said Jain has confessed to supplying illicit liquor to other states without valid permit of the excise department with the help of liquor smugglers. “The distilleries were legal but the work was illegal and the involvement of more people cannot be ruled out,” he said.Jain was booked after recovery of illegal liquor in Samalkha of Panipat a year ago. He has been sent to five-day police remand by the court.Police officials associated with the investigation said Jain was questioned in the presence of liquor smuggler Bhupinder Singh. However, the DSP said Jain did not confess that he supplied the liquor with the help of Bhupinder Singh.The DSP said, “It has not been established yet that the liquor recovered from Bhupinder was manufactured in Jain’s distilleries. We have three more days to interrogate him and will share information after the completion of the police remand.” The findings of the Special Enquiry Team (SET) constituted to investigate the alleged liquor scam revealed that several cases of illegal liquor were reported in Haryana during April 1, 2019 to May 10, 2020, involving people associated with M/s NV Distilleries.Several FIRs were also registered following the seizure of illicit liquor. These include FIR 143 at Mulana police station in Ambala after the recovery of 1,800 cases of illegal liquor, FIR 222 at Sadar Police Station in Kurukshetra following the seizure of 14,100 liquor bottles manufactured at M/s RS distillery located in Chandrao of Karnal district, FIR 302 at Sadar Police station in Kurukshetra following recovery of 10,104 bottles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nv-distilleries-chairman-confesses-to-supplying-illicit-liquor-to-haryana-other-states/story-tiJNYnXPFLWk38qFt6payL.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Khalid petitions court, says not being allowed to step out of jail cell||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid, who is in judicial custody in connection with his alleged role in the north-east Delhi riots, on Thursday claimed that he was not being allowed to step out of his jail cell in Tihar, where he is currently in judicial custody, and nor was he being allowed meet anyone. He alleged that he was being kept in a “sort of solitary confinement”.“I have not been allowed to step outside at all. I am alone in my cell. No one is allowed to meet me. It is practically a sort of solitary confinement. I am not well for the past three days. Why am I given this punishment? I reiterate that I need security but it cannot be that I have to be in my cell all day,” he said.“Security does not mean that I should be punished like this,” Khalid told a Delhi court during the hearing, being held virtually in view of Covid-19 protocols. When contacted by HT, jail authorities dismissed the allegations. Director general (Delhi prisons) Sandeep Goel said, “These allegations are absolutely wrong. He is in a single cell. There are many other prisoners in adjoining cells.”Khalid told the judge that he was being confined with no interactions with anyone on the orders of the additional jail superintendent. Khalid also said he has not been keeping well for the past few days and as he was confined to the cell at all times, he was suffering both mental and physical discomfort.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat summoned the jail superintendent and posted the matter for further hearing to Friday. Khalid was on Thursday produced before the court at the end of his judicial custody in connection with the Delhi riots case registered against him. A Delhi court, on September 24, had sent Khalid to judicial custody till October 22. He has been accused of hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots in north-east Delhi in February, which had left 53 dead over 400 injured. On Thursday, the police moved an application to keep Khalid in judicial custody for another month.The court will pass an order on this petition on Friday.During the proceedings, the judge also pulled up assistant jail superintendent (Jail No 2) Pradeep Sharma for not un-muting the microphone when Khalid told him that he wanted to speak to the judge. Khalid alleged that the official told him that the mic will be unmuted only if the judge permits it.“If an undertrial wants to say something, then un-mute the mic and let him speak or you tell us that he wants to say something,” the judge said.When Khalid’s counsel, advocate Trideep Pais, told the court that no adverse steps should be taken against him by the jail authorities for putting forward his grievances, the judge told the jail officer, “Khalid should not be punished for putting forward his grievances. You should take care of it.”On October 17, the court had directed the Delhi Police to give adequate security to Khalid after the former JNU student sought security on account of his “ideological differences and dissenting opinion”.Khalid’s lawyers and parents have denied the police’s allegations. His friends have said that Khalid was targeted for being a prominent face of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests. His lawyer had told the court last month that while Khalid was against the CAA, he was not involved in the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/khalid-petitions-court-says-not-being-allowed-to-step-out-of-jail-cell/story-zryy7KR5MaZOGfSEJ1DpjP.html

22-10-2020||City||Sisodia for scrapping class 10, 12 boards after NEP is implemented||New Delhi: Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday suggested that board exams of classes 10 and 12 should be scrapped after the complete implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Addressing NCERT’s (National Council of Educational Research and Training) 57th general council meeting, Sisodia also said the syllabus of all classes should be reduced to 50% for this session in view of the pandemic. According to a statement issued by Sisodia’s office, the deputy chief minister gave some important suggestions to realise the vision of NEP 2020. Concurring with Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on the “transformative value of NEP 2020”, Sisodia said the transformation should be holistic and not piecemeal. He said it is about “time we introduce multi-year, stage-wise classes and external assessment at the end of each stage, replacing the existing year-wise classes and two board exams in classes 10 and 12.”“The NEP can attain its full potential if the existing one year, per grade system is removed. It means, instead of an existing class system where all children of a class move together in all subjects despite being at different learning levels, the multi-year stage will help children move as per their learning needs in different subjects at their own pace. He said a stage-wise curriculum with a clearly stated learning goal in terms of knowledge, skills, and values should be created,” the statement read.The Delhi education minister suggested there is no need for the class 12 board exams as the National Testing Agency (NTA) is mandated to conduct entrance exams for admissions in higher education institutions. Expressing concern over the current academic session, which has been disturbed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Sisodia suggested that the syllabus on all classes should be reduced to 50%. “He suggested that next year’s entrance exams such as JEE, NEET should be based on this reduced syllabus to align with the current year’s class syllabus. He suggested CBSE should not hold class 12 board exams before May 2021 so that students get some more time to study. Generally, the exams are held in February and March,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-for-scrapping-class-10-12-boards-after-nep-is-implemented/story-tT7nxa34nN7lfC3hgD2dNJ.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||Delhi boy reunited with family in Gurugram after six years||A boy who went missing from Ghitorni in Delhi, when he was three years old, was traced to a child care institute (CCI) in Gurugram last week. On Thursday, he was reunited with his parents after six years by the recently launched missing cell of the Gurugram Police. The boy was counselled to deal with emotional trauma, said officials. The police said the boy had gone missing from outside his house while his parents were away for work on April 6, 2014, and the police had registered a case of kidnapping at the time at Vasant Kunj police station in New Delhi. The Gurugram police had found the boy in DLF Phase-1 and had sent him to the CCI in Sector 35. Despite repeated attempts, the boy could not be identified as he could not tell them the names of his parents. Sonia Yadav, member of Child Welfare Committee (CWC), said that the teams from police and CWC had tried to locate the family members from nearby areas but did not succeed. “His information was uploaded on Zonal Integrated Police Network (Zipnet) but we could not get any leads. The boy was regularly counselled as he was not emotionally well and required regular counselling sessions. He hardly interacted with anyone in the CCI and started his regular schooling in a private school,” she said. The police had launched a special cell in September to reunite children with their families. The members were asked to meet all the children, take details from CCIs and to check Zipnet. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the police teams have visited five CCIs since September and have interacted with more than 50 children. The teams, while using Zipnet to match missing children’s photographs with children found at various CCIs in the city, identified the boy by matching his photos to a Delhi missing boy and approached the Vasant Kunj police station to take all details,” he said. The police said they informed the station house officer of Vasant Kunj and later Ghitorni police stations, who, in turn, informed the parents of the missing boy, who lived in a farmhouse in Ghitorni. They reached the CCI immediately and identified their son. Rao said the CWC informed the Delhi counterparts and handed over the child through them. “Our aim is to reach out and reunite all missing children with their family members. We tried to counsel the boy before meeting his parents on Thursday. It was a joyous occasion for the family, which is originally from Madhya Pradesh. Our efforts are on to trace other missing children from all CCIs through the face recognition tool on Zipnet and restore them to their family,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/delhi-boy-reunited-with-family-in-gurugram-after-six-years/story-b9lD0BBqvRiZNq9F6zJrNJ.html

The cash equivalent of LTC will be given to Delhi government employees by way of reimbursement if the employee opts for this in lieu of LTC in the block of 2018–21.“The employees who are entitled to business class airfare will get ₹36,000 LTC, followed by ₹20,000 for the employees who are entitled to an economy class airfare. The employees who are entitled to rail fare of any class will get ₹6,000 as LTC,” Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said. It has also been decided that a special festival package of advance will be accorded to all the Delhi government employees for any important festivals up to March 31, 2021. An amount of ₹10,000 will be paid to the employees as advance, under the initiative, he said.“The special cash package has been announced in a bid to boost the consumption expenditure and incentivise employees. The Delhi government is very hopeful that through these steps it will bring some ease to lives of the employees and they will be able to happily celebrate the upcoming festival with their family,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-announces-mega-festive-package-for-employees/story-zGjbhvyeCXgEWeN1Ukfz4I.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||14 societies to get genset exemption||At least 14 residential societies that are reliant on diesel generator (DG) sets for electricity are likely to get exemptions till November 30 from the ban imposed by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca).Senior state officials privy to the matter, however, said the chief minister will take a call on the deadline on Friday. Based on the meeting, final reports will be submitted to Epca. DG sets are banned under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) implemented from October 15 to tackle air pollution levels during winter.Earlier this week, Epca chairman Bhure Lal directed the Haryana power department to submit a comprehensive affidavit on power supply to societies still reliant on diesel gensets. Epca also asked the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) to fix a time frame for setting up power connections to such residential societies.On Thursday, environmentalist Sunita Narain, an Epca member, said, “Epca has received communication from Haryana government that they are finalising deadlines and getting affidavits from builders. Chief minister has called for a meeting on Friday to finalise the deadline, which will be given to Epca.”At present, 17 societies in Gurugram are dependent upon DG sets, out of which 14 are in the list for getting exemptions.Trilok Chand Gupta, additional chief secretary, power, who is also the chairman of HVPNL, said, “At least 14 societies have given detailed reports with charts explaining the reasons for the delay in the connection and the final deadline sought by them to set up the electricity infrastructure. Some have sought two weeks’ time or months’ time. The department has planned to go for November 30 as the final deadline for these residential societies.”He said that in affidavits, developers have given four to five different timelines to reach to the final process of electricity connection. “They have to apply for a tender, submit bank guarantee, land and facility to set up the power sub-station to finally switch from DG set to regular connection. Based on their reports, the department has planned to go with November 30 as the deadline, which will be finally confirmed by the chief minister tomorrow (on Friday),” said Gupta.According to him, three builders have not submitted deadlines, citing fund deficiency for setting up electricity infrastructure. “From December 1, residents living in these societies will have to bear the brunt as they won’t be allowed to run diesel gensets,” said Gupta.He said that until last year, there were problems on the part of the distribution company, which have been resolved this year. “From 80 residential societies running on DG sets in 2019, the number this time has come down to 14. The state, at present, has surplus power of 4000 Megawatt (MW). Nearly 8000 MW is being transmitted by the HVPNL,” Gupta said.As reported by the HT earlier, this is the fourth consecutive year that Gurugram is likely to get an exemption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/14-societies-to-get-genset-exemption/story-TxvUFJaC12Qqy7wzoNFfrK.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG to involve residents in Grap implementation||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is looking to create a mechanism to share hourly or bi-hourly air quality index (AQI) updates of the city’s 24 monitors with residents so that they can assist in spotting sudden spikes and inform them about environmental violations, such as waste burning, construction with uncovered materials, and large-scale constructions during the ban.Currently, after spotting sudden spikes in air pollution levels of any of the 24 monitors, the staff at the MCG’s lab inform the enforcement wing officials on the ground to scan areas within the radius of the local monitor for environmental violations.However, officials said that with the cooperation of residents, checks on such illegal activities can be curbed at a faster rate. “Through greater participation of residents, our scale of monitoring violations will also increase manifold and this way we’ll be able to keep a check on violations causing air pollution. We are working on a mechanism to share quick-time data of our air lab with residents of Gurugram,” said Chahat Sanghvi, consultant, MCG.Sanghvi highlighted that the MCG has a toll-free number — 18001801817 — and an email address — grap@mcg.gov.in — to which residents can report pollution-related incidents.Since the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures in the city, the MCG has issued 96 fines from October 15 to 22, amounting to around Rs 20 lakh. Of the 96 violations, 61 were of dust mitigation, 15 of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, 14 of garbage burning, and six of illegal waste dumping.“Besides setting up mechanisms for letting residents know about spikes in local pollution levels, the MCG should also create a system through which residents who lodge complaints are informed of the action taken against the offender and the fine which was levied, so that residents feel that their cooperation is resulting in making a difference on the ground,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council, an umbrella body of the city’s residents’ welfare associations (RWAs).The MCG has increased its focus on involving residents for effective Grap implementation over the last week.On October 17, during an internal meeting, the MCG had set a four-hour deadline for its officials to address complaints regarding garbage burning and a 12-hour deadline for any complaint related to construction and demolition (C&D) waste materials.The MCG’s air lab officials also have the role of monitoring the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Sameer app to ensure that all social media complaints related to dumping of waste, garbage burning, dumping and other pollution-related matters are resolved within the given timeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-involve-residents-in-grap-implementation/story-NcMFGkImCGWoL8Btj7i2RO.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||Area near Belvedere Tower Metro station most polluted spot in city: MCG data||The locality surrounding the Belvedere Tower Rapid Metro station is the most polluted while the Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park is the least polluted of the 24 locations where air quality monitors are installed in the city, according to the data compiled by the air lab of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) from October 15 to 22.The five most polluted spots across the city are Belvedere Tower Rapid Metro station, Sector 51, Vikas Sadan, Sector 42, and TERI Gram, while Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, Rezang La Chowk, Shyam Chowk, Vatika Chowk and Ghoda Chowk are the five least polluted spots.Gurugram recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 215 (‘poor’) on Thursday, a slight improvement from an AQI of 263 on Wednesday.On October 15, the day the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures were implemented across the National Capital Region (NCR), the MCG opened an air lab at its Sector 42 office to monitor air quality index (AQI) of monitors installed across various points in the city.MCG officials said that the rationale behind opening the lab was to spot sudden spikes in pollution levels, which could be caused by localised actions such as burning of waste and biomass, and large-scale constructions, as well as to inform their enforcement wing officials to scan the areas to curb such violations.“Through constant supervision of AQI data at regular time intervals and analysing the same, we have been able to gauge a daily pattern of AQI. Thus, whenever there is a sudden spike in the AQI data of a location, especially during non-peak traffic hours, workers at the air lab relay this information to enforcement wing officials on the ground, who then scan the area to see if localised environmental pollutions are causing this rise and accordingly, start fining violators,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.The MCG has a five-member team working out of its Sector 42 air lab.“While scrutinising data of Sector 51, the second-most polluted spot in the city — already identified by the pollution control board as a pollution hot spot due to biomass, waste and plastic burning being a common practice — we observed a sudden spike in pollution levels earlier this week. We immediately sent this message to enforcement wing officials on the ground, who were able to spot two areas where open burning of waste was being done and accordingly, doused the same,” an official with the air lab said.Another rationale behind opening the air lab was for officials of MCG, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), to interpret which areas need the highest concentration of remedial measures and accordingly, allocate their resources for water sprinkling, dust clearing, and higher supervision of environmental pollutants.“The air quality monitors have been installed at key traffic junctions to give us constant reading of localised air-quality index in such areas. We use the data, to interpret areas where remedial measures are needed to bring the AQI levels down,” said MD Sinha, additional chief executive officer, GMDA.Citing an instance of allocating resources based on data, a senior MCG official said that due to a high concentration of vehicles at the Sirhaul toll, air pollution levels in areas located in close proximity tend to be high. The average AQI at Belvedere Tower Rapid Metro station, located near Sirhaul toll, is 294, the highest in the city.“After realising that the air quality in areas such as Belvedere Tower is one of the worst, we have increased mechanised cleaning of stretches, sprinkling of water on trees and roads in such areas, besides increased supervision of environmental violations,” the MCG official cited above said.Anup, a member of Belvedere Park RWA, said, “When we wake up in the morning, there is always a pungent smell outdoors, which is not just limited to the stubble burning season but something which is sporadically prevalent throughout. The high levels of pollution in the area could be caused due to high volume of vehicles on the Cyber City-Sirhaul toll stretch and from the industries located in nearby Udyog Vihar. However, these are just assumptions and officials need to do a proper survey of the area to find out the exact reasons.”MCG officials also said that they use the air lab data on a periodic day basis to check for biggest rise and drop in localised pollution levels. Citing an example, an official said that the biggest drop in AQI in the city was at TERI Gram, from 298 on October 18 to 190 on October 22. Similarly, at Sector 14, the AQI rose from 116 on October 18 to 354 on October 22. Sachin Panwar, a Gurugram-based air quality expert, who is currently an air-quality consultant with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), said that numerous factors determine the AQI at different locations within the city. “Factors such as wind speed, altitude, temperature fluctuation, biomass and waste burning, concentration of vehicles, vary from one place to another within a city. The same is true for Gurugram as well,” said Panwar.Panwar said that these factors also play a major role in the overall AQI reading in areas such as Vatika Chowk, which, despite having a high concentration of vehicles from the national highway and state highways merging there, is far less polluted than the lush-green TERI Gram.The average AQI reading at Teri Gram is 225, while the average AQI reading at Vatika Chowk is 86.“The waste plant and rural areas where instances of biomass and waste burning are common are located in close proximity to TERI Gram which results in it having a high AQI reading. In contrast, Vatika Chowk, despite having a high volume of vehicles, does not have any waste processing plant or rural villages in close proximity. It is located in an open area and the wind speed tends to be high, which results in pollutants not settling there,” said Panwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/area-near-belvedere-tower-metro-station-most-polluted-spot-in-city-mcg-data/story-3f3ZplmnVpzrhVu19Xr4KL.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||One monitor in each sector the aim, as agencies ramp up installations||Until December of 2019, the city only had two air quality monitors, a number which currently stands at 24. With the objective of installing a monitor in each sector to keep a constant check on localised pollution levels, public agencies have added 22 more such monitors over the last 10 months, and aim to add 140 more.The Beta Attenuation Monitoring (BAM) air quality monitors at Vikas Sadan, installed in 2012, and Gwal Pahari, installed by India Meteorological Department (IMD) in 2018, were the city’s only air quality monitors until last December.In January this year, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) installed 20 of its own low-cost monitors, procured through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds, for real time monitoring and localised remedial action.GMDA has installed these monitors at Vatika Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, Sector 32, Mayfield Garden, Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, Sector 42, Sector 47, Sector 30, Sohna Chowk, Ghoda Chowk, Sector 14, Atul Kataria Chowk, Sector 18, Rezang La Chowk, Atlas Chowk, Shyam Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Belvedere Tower Metro station, TERI Golf Course at Bandhwari, and TERI retreat centre at Bandhwari.“For the first one year, we will be simply analysing the data from the monitors, based on which we will create a set of scientific guidelines and parameters upon which a regular low-cost monitor should be operating. These monitors will help us compile a data on areas where pollution levels are high so that we can accordingly execute remedial measures there,” said MD Sinha, additional chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA.Sinha said that the 20 monitors are part of GMDA’s long-term plan of installing 140 monitors, one in every sector of the city. “Once we know the parameters and guidelines for operating a low-cost monitor, we will replicate the same at all corners of the city. Currently, the entire process is at a pilot stage,” said Sinha.Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) also installed BAM monitors in March this year at Sector 51 and TERI Gram, in addition to the monitor at Vikas Madan.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of HSPCB, clarified that the daily air quality index (AQI) of Gurugram is calculated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) based on the average AQI of the four monitors (three of HSPCB and one of IMD).“The BAM monitors have one of the highest standards in terms of measuring different types of air quality along with precise accuracy. Besides AQI, they calculate parameters such as PM 2.5, PM 10, wind speed, wind direction, other polluting gases such as carbon, sulphur and nitrogen. Based on all our monitors’ data, CPCB calculates the average AQI of the city,” said Singh.As per both HSPCB and GMDA officials, the low-cost monitors, cumulatively, cost less than Rs 25 lakh while one BAM monitor costs around Rs 1 crore. A GMDA official privy to the matter said that the accuracy of a low-cost monitor is around 90-95% of a BAM monitor.“Instead of spending in excess of Rs 20 crore for setting up of BAM monitors, we felt it was more practical to use these funds for pollution remedial measures. If the accurate AQI reading at a particular point is 300 and it is reflecting as 295 on the low-cost monitors, it makes little difference to us, as we aren’t using it for scientific purposes. We want to simply use these monitors as a reference point, to understand which are the areas across the city which are high on pollution levels and allocate our resources accordingly to bring them down,” said a senior GMDA official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/one-monitor-in-each-sector-the-aim-as-agencies-ramp-up-installations/story-5wTV0uBzxxoGVOgx3ZI8wL.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||Man nabbed with 280 kilos of marijuana worth Rs 40 lakh||Police on Wednesday night arrested a 35-year-old man for smuggling 280 kilograms of marijuana worth Rs 40 lakh from Agra in Uttar Pradesh for distribution in Gurugram. A manhunt has been launched for the man’s supplier from Agra, who allegedly sold the marijuana to the arrested suspect, police said. According to the police, they acted after receiving a tipoff about a man who was transporting marijuana procured from Uttar Pradesh to Gurugram. Based on these inputs, two police teams were deployed near a private hospital in Sector 49 on Wednesday night, when the suspect unloaded the jute bags from a vehicle and was about to board an autorickshaw. The suspect was surrounded by officers of the Palam Vihar crime investigations unit and asked to surrender, said police. The arrested man was identified as Bhupinder Singh alias Vishnu, a resident of Shahganj in Agra of Uttar Pradesh. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that when they checked the bags they found marijuana in packets that had been covered with a dirty cloth. “The teams questioned Singh and he revealed that he was a drug peddler and was involved in supply of narcotics from UP to Gurugram for the last three years,” he said. Police said after the drugs were recovered, they questioned the suspect and got to know crucial details of the organised crime and how he allegedly used to run his business and who was the main kingpin delivering the marijuana to him in UP. Singh, with the help of his associate, used to allegedly pack the drugs in small packets of 10-100 grams. Police said they have received information of his suppliers in area, but the end users are yet to be identified. According to police, the suspect has a prior arrest record in cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in Gurugram and in different districts of Uttar Pradesh. Sangwan said they are also probing the distribution network in districts where the consignment was headed. “Singh said he had bought the consignment for Rs 40,000 and was going to sell it for Rs 5 lakh. He used to sell nearly 300 kilograms of marijuana every month to different drug peddlers across the city and also was in touch with peddlers of Rajasthan and Nuh,” he said. The suspect was produced before a court on Thursday and was sent to two days police remand, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-nabbed-with-280-kilos-of-marijuana-worth-rs-40-lakh/story-lCVHMkjgd6lC473Gl2hhtI.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||Duo rob woman of gold, cash on pretext of lift||Two men posing as cab drivers duped a 51-year-old woman of cash and jewellery on the pretext of offering her a lift from Rajiv Chowk to Ferozepur Jhirka in Nuh on Wednesday morning. The victim, Popri Kaur, a resident of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, was asked by the driver and his associate to remove her gold jewellery and put it in a paper bag along with her cash, due to increased robberies in the area. She was driven around in the cab for about 20 minutes and dropped off at Subash Chowk, when she realised that the duo had switched the bag with another that had artificial gold ornaments.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the victim had returned from her daughter’s house in Delhi and was waiting at Rajiv Chowk for public transport. Two men in a cab approached her and offered her lift. “Kaur told them she was heading towards Ferozepur Jhirka, to which they said they were also going towards the same area. She boarded the cab and sat on the rear seat. After travelling for three kilometres, they asked her to keep her jewellery and cash in a packet, and to keep it in her bag. They told her that the police teams were inspecting the area as robberies had increased,” he said. After realising that she had been duped, she borrowed a mobile phone from a passerby and called the police control room, following which a van escorted her to Sadar police station. The complainant also said that the street was busy at the time of the incident. On her complaint, the Sadar police filed an FIR under sections 379 (theft) , 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (fraud) of the Indian Penal Code on Wednesday evening. Sangwan said that a team of police and crime branch has been formed to trace the robbers, and that patrolling has been intensified in the area. The police suspect the role of a Delhi-based gang, which has been active in the area for the last month. The gang members pose as cab drivers and target women waiting for transport between Rajiv Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk during the morning rush hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/duo-rob-woman-of-gold-cash-on-pretext-of-lift/story-LjaCScRo21JaskvEY1n4qK.html
22-10-2020||Gurugram||Covid cases in district may surge due to festive rush, warn health care officials||The trajectory of Covid-19 cases in the city is likely to go upwards in the next few days, said district health department officials, citing reasons like rush in market and public places due to festive season and the prevalence of other Influenza like illness, like H1N1, due to changing weather conditions. Health department officials said they were now focusing on increasing the number of tests in rural areas of the district and bring them at par with urban areas to arrest the spread of Covid-19 in the coming weeks.The department officials said that the number of daily new cases have again started showing an uptick, after having reached a plateau earlier this month. For the second day in a row, more than 300 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Thursday. On Thursday, 324 new cases were reported, up from Wednesday’s 304. It is almost after a month that the number of daily cases have shot up above 300.Data available with the district administration shows that the daily positivity rate of cases is fluctuating between 10%-11%, while the average positivity rate is around eight percent. Until the first week of October, the test positivity rate was seven percent. “In June, the test positivity rate of the district was 18%. Although the daily numbers can increase, the target is not to let positivity rate get as high as it was in June this year,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Going by the strategy — “test, track and treat” — Yadav said that to test and track people who are not coming forward, the department has been holding camps in areas which had not been covered earlier. “It mostly includes rural areas,” said Yadav, explaining that it is likely that people from rural pockets will come out in large numbers during the festive season. “In urban areas, people are coming for walk-in tests, with some of them even getting tested twice or thrice. Now, we are targeting rural areas like Bhora Kalan, Kasan and rural pockets where camps were not organised frequently,” said Yadav. Dr MP Singh, nodal officer for camps and containment zones, health department, said that earlier 70% tests were being conducted in urban areas and 30% in rural areas. “From October 19, we have been doing almost an equal number of tests in urban and rural zones,” Singh said.Health officials said that these camps will be helpful for people who are developing flu like illness due to changing weather and rising air pollution. “Already there is an increase in the footfall of patients in government hospitals reporting respiratory illness due to poor air quality. Therefore, evening camps are being conducted for people who cannot visit hospitals during day time due to office hours. They can easily get themselves tested in these camps,” said Yadav, adding that two testing vans had been deployed for the purpose.According to him, from November till February is crucial time for H1N1 infection, where patients have almost similar symptoms like Covid-19. Yadav said that the department has been working on a plan to start screening and testing of H1N1 to prevent burden on the existing health infrastructure. Currently, in Gurugram the total count of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus has touched 26,500. However, active cases are 2,568, out of which 2,380 are in home isolation and 172 are in home isolation. The Covid-19 toll stands at 196, with one fresh death reported on Thursday. The recovery rate is almost 90% and the cases are doubling every 79 days, according to the daily health bulletin prepared by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-cases-in-district-may-surge-due-to-festive-rush-warn-health-care-officials/story-35SI706UVc83TWl3nc1QVK.html

These student candidates, who had appeared in the evening shift on October 6, faced some technical issues while attempting the computer-based exam, officials said. The NTA has informed aspirants of the new date through text messages, which read, “Dear candidate, due to technical reason the Computer Based Test (CBT) for the programs of study of JNUEE 2020, M.Phil and Ph.D. Historical Studies... requires re-examination. While we regret the inconvenience, we intend to provide a fair and equal opportunity again to all candidates who appeared for the above-mentioned programs of study.” “It is in this regard that a re-examination...will be held on October 28, 2020. The revised admit card for re-examination will be available on the JNU-NTA website shortly,” the message continued. NTA director-general Vineet Joshi said around 700 to 800 students will have to take the exam again. “Not all students will have to reappear in the exam. Only those who had taken the exam in the JNU entrance exam (JNUEE) for historical studies on October 6 in the evening shift will have to reappear. Some technical issues were reported in that shift and the NTA always believes in giving fair and equal opportunity to all candidates,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nta-to-reconduct-jnu-entrance-exam-for-mphil-phd-in-historical-studies-for-section-of-candidates/story-hGQI9RbYWcRW0nIS53eH9J.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Why hasn’t govt started e-registration of legal documents, HC asks Delhi chief secy||The Delhi high court Thursday asked the Delhi chief secretary to file an affidavit on why a system can’t be put in place for the e-registration of legal documents such as property deeds and wills, etc., while stating that the government attitude towards e-registration is “completely averse”. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan made the remarks after it was informed that the Delhi government is yet to start the online registration of legal documents, despite the pandemic and social distancing norms in place. The high court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Gaurav Gambhir claiming that sub-registrars in the national capital are refusing to register wills and other documents of senior citizens, persons with co-morbidities and pregnant women by citing the risk of Covid-19 infection. Gambhir had told the court, during the last hearing on August 31, that Maharashtra, West Bengal and Haryana have all started online registration of legal documents, thereby doing away with the need for the citizen to go to the sub-registrar’s office“Your attitude appears to be, “we will do what we feel like”….You are not doing online registration of legal documents at all. As we are doing online filing of cases, and recording evidence via video conferencing, we want you (Delhi government) to also move towards an electronic system. We want to reduce the human interface between your officials and the public,” the bench said. “We do not want the public to go to the sub-registrar offices and stand in queues, especially during the pandemic. There are many other benefits also of e-registration,” the bench said. The court further said if applying for passports, filing tax returns, submitting board exam forms by class 10 and 12 students, etc., can be done online, and if in all such cases the documents can be verified electronically/ digitally, “then why cannot the government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi?” It then directed the chief secretary to file an affidavit before the next date of hearing, answering the points raised by the bench and keeping in mind its earlier orders in the matter. The bench will further hear the matter on November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-hasn-t-govt-started-e-registration-of-legal-documents-hc-asks-delhi-chief-secy/story-RIhKvLBQ7ID6HTvgXBUG2K.html

The CPWD owes Rs 110 crore to DJB while DDA is to pay Rs 106 crore,” Chadha said in a statement.“While it’s commendable how all government departments have come together to fight Covid-19, we cannot overlook the paucity of funds, which is a huge challenge for all government departments at present. If the DJB gets its dues from the two government departments, it will help in taking up several projects that have been in the pipeline,” Chadha said. The DJB had issued notices to seven government departments to recover its pending dues from them last month.HT tried to reach out to Puri for a comment but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/raghav-chadha-meets-puri-over-pending-dues-of-cpwd-dda/story-JdHgQtiulAlbFYRt3s985I.html

At around 7.50pm, my 12-year-old nephew realised that our American bulldog was missing and he then heard him howling in pain. We realised the noise was coming from our neighbour’s house and we immediately rushed there. We found our dog battered and took him to a hospital in Bisrakh. Our neighbours had lured him to their house on the pretext of giving him treats and then they attacked him brutally,” said Nagar.He said that the dog had suffered multiple injuries and required three days’ treatment.“These people had attacked our dog almost a month back as well by throwing a brick at him but we had resolved that issue. We don’t know what their issue with our pet is. They are involved in some sort of black magic and have threatened us with political connections as well,” he said.The family alleged that when they approached police, their case was not registered and it was only after much insistence that an FIR was lodged against the three suspects at the Ecotech 3 police station under relevant sections of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Police officials said that a probe in the matter is underway and that the medical examination was inconclusive.“The suspects claim that the dog had found his way into their house and they were only defending themselves.

22-10-2020||City||Noida police provides self defence training to 60 women||Noida Police started a three-day self-defence training session for 60 women in Surajpur police line on Wednesday.The candidates, which included trainee constables and residents from Noida and Greater Noida, would be trained various techniques and combat skills to defend themselves in case of attack with knives or other weapons. GB Nagar’s deputy sports officer Poonam Vishnoi headed the programme under Mission Shakti, a state government initiative to bring down crime against women. Vishnoi said that the aim of the programme was women empowerment. “The self-defence training and techniques are important to defend oneself when in need. We focus on physical training as well as mental training, which is significant as one has to first promptly assess the threat and then apply the techniques,” she said. “There are instances when women are harassed. We train them on how to defend themself if confronted with a knife or gun wielding attacker. We teach them how to turn the weapon’s direction and snatch it from the attacker. We also train them in hand-to-hand combat,” said Vishnoi, a recipient of UP government’s Laxmibai Bravery Award. “Half of the participants are trainee police personnel and the rest are residents. The three day programme is held from 7 am – 9 am in the Surajpur police line,” she said. The week-long Mission Shakti programme comprises of four steps - awareness generation, women empowerment, enforcement, and prosecution.

22-10-2020||Noida||After ‘mass conversion’ by Karhera residents, Ghaziabad police files FIR for promoting enmity between groups||The Ghaziabad police on Wednesday registered an FIR against unidentified persons for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, in connection with an alleged conversion incident at Valmiki Basti in Ghaziabad’s Karhera earlier this month. In the FIR, based on a complaint by a Sahibabad resident, it has been alleged that alleged that at least 236 Dalits embraced Buddhism on October 14 to protest the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman Dalit woman in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, which has sparked outrage across India.Senior district and police officials, along with the Sahibabad MLA, had rushed to the Valmiki Basti on Wednesday after they had come to know about the alleged conversion. Locals allegedly showed them conversion certificates and raised local issues, besides demanding justice for the Hathras victim.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey had on Wednesday denied that the Hathras issue was raised before him.He had, however, ordered an inquiry by an additional district magistrate (city) on the basis of which the administration released their report of findings late Wednesday.The signed report had stated that there is no evidence of religious conversion at Karhera; the conversion certificates which were shown had no names, correct address or even any serial number, besides the date of issuance of the certificates; there are some certificates which are blank and have no details filled in and the local residents have raised their local issues in their memorandum of demands, which mention no issue of conversion.“We have filed an FIR in connection with the (alleged religious conversion) incident after a man from Pappu Colony in Sahibabad gave us a written complaint. The matter is being investigated and an FIR has been filed against unidentified persons,” said Keshav Kumar, assistant superintendent of police (Sahibabad).Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, did not take calls when approached for a response on Wednesday and Thursday. The FIR lodged at Sahibabad police station mentions two IPC sections, 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) and 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill, etc).“Regarding the conversion, the related certificates mention no names, date, addresses or serial numbers and anyone’s name can be written on them. It seems it is a criminal conspiracy intended to promote violence and hatred..,” the complainant alleged in the FIR.Pawan Valmiki, who headed discussions with the district officials on Wednesday, said he converted to Buddhism on October 14 and had never met the complainant.“We communicated to the district officials about our decision to adopt Buddhism, when they came here on Wednesday. There are some politicians who are unnecessarily dragging the conversion into a controversy and need to apologise. The certificates have proper names, date, etc., on them while the address mentioned is stated only as Ghaziabad. We have no links with any political party or any agenda but we have heard that an FIR has been filed in the incident,” he added. Aman, 26, his brother, said rumours were spread about locals of Valmiki Basti having “links to Pakistan and even funding from a political party”. “This is all we heard ever since Wednesday. Anyone can come to our house and see the conditions we live in. I worked as a motor mechanic with a small roadside shop. My shop was shut during the lockdown. My brother and I are left with no jobs. Anyone can come and check my family’s bank accounts to see if there has been any funding from anyone. Even at this age, I have no bank account in my name,” he said. “My brother, his wife and my parents also converted to Buddhism on October 14. We did not get anything being a Dalit. So, we converted. But now there is an FIR. I find no reasons for it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-mass-conversion-by-karhera-residents-ghaziabad-police-files-fir-for-promoting-enmity-between-groups/story-7RPHw7519SjJhOkw94FjmJ.html
22-10-2020||Noida||Since Grap came into effect, Noida has issued fines totalling ₹27 lakh for causing pollution||The Noida authority has so far imposed nearly Rs 27 lakh in fines since October 15 when the graded response action plan (Grap) was implemented in the city to contain air pollution.The authority is acting against violators daily and imposing the penalty against whosoever is found violating rules -- banning of diesel generator sets, compulsory dust control system and other measures -- across the city, said officials.Grap was put enforced as the smog started to envelope the Delhi-NCR, including Noida. Although the authority was lenient on the first day of the implementation, the subsequent days saw its officials and project engineers inspect construction sites. As per the guidelines from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and also the national green tribunal (NGT), ever contractor, realtor and individual engaged in construction work has to make sure that the construction material lying on city roads or plot should be covered with a green sheet, water to be sprinkled on materials regularly and vehicles transporting material should be properly covered. Apart from this throwing garbage or burning it in open is also an offence.“Our teams are out on the field daily to ensure the rules are being followed at the sites. If our team found violating the rules then it takes required steps and impose penalty,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty of the Noida authority monitoring the implementation of Grap on the ground.On Friday it imposed Rs 42,500 penalty against eight persons for flouting norms, on Saturday Rs 11.15 lakh against 23, on Sunday Rs 3.37 lakh against 19, on Monday Rs 5.65 lakh penalty against 16, on Tuesday Rs 4.14 lakh penalty was imposed against 17 and on Wednesday nine were fined Rs 2.20 lakh. The penalty ranged from Rs 500 to Rs1 lakh depending on the violation, said officials.In six days, the authority has acted against over 100 violators that include vendors, shop owners, contractors, companies and individuals except the realtors. The authority said that the most of the realtors’ construction activities were shut due to the economic crisis that the realty sector faced in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The authority has also started collecting and treating the construction and demolition waste at its plant set up at sector 80, where they recycle the waste.On Sunday the authority collected 180 tonne of construction waste, on Monday it collected 100 tonne waste and on Tuesday it collected 350 tonne of waste out of which bricks, tiles and slab among other products are made, said officials. To reduce air pollution the authority has been cleaning city’s all main roads with mechanical sweeping machine and sprinkling treated water on dust on roads.“The Noida authority should intensify the action against the violators because many still flouting rules and do not cover the construction material. And also the road cleaning exercise should be improved,” said NP Singh president of Gautam Budh Nagar district development RWAs (DDRWAs), an umbrella group of RWAs in district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/since-grap-came-into-effect-noida-has-issued-fines-totalling-27-lakh-for-causing-pollution/story-Lj24A3Sr7Ds6ku1SjbOqqI.html
22-10-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad air in ‘very poor’ category, may remain there for next 3-4 days||The air quality index (AQI) in the three cities of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida deteriorated on Thursday stood in the ‘very poor’ category as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s bulletin. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the weather played an important role in turning the air foul and that the hazy conditions are likely to persist for three more days. According to the CPCB, the AQI of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida was recorded at 308, 318 and 328, respectively, all in the ‘very poor’ category.’ The wind speed had drastically reduced on Thursday, said IMD officials, which resulted in pollutants being trapped in the atmosphere. “Overcast conditions on Thursday led to an increase in moisture content (but not enough to force pollutants to settle). The wind speed was high initially with easterly winds blowing at about 6-8kmph in the morning, but the direction changed to north-westerly and the speed dropped to about 0-3kmph. So, the dispersal of pollutants did not happen. It is likely that the conditions will remain the same for another three or four days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. As a result of the prevailing conditions, all four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad, two in Greater Noida and three of four in Noida were recording readings well above the AQI value of 300(‘very poor’ category) at 7pm Thursday. One station of Noida did not show reading due to technical reasons. The forecast by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) on Thursday said that calm surface wind conditions will lead to low ventilation, meaning low dispersal of pollutants. “It is forecasted that the air quality will be in the ‘poor’ to marginally ‘very poor’ categories on October 23 and 24. A significant increase in stubble fires in Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring regions with Safar synergised stubble fire counts stood at approximately 1428 yesterday, the highest this season so far. However, as the boundary layer wind direction is not fully favourable for pollutant transport towards the Delhi region, the Safar model estimate that the stubble burning share in PM2.5 is 9% for today,” the Safar said in a statement. According to official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory, a Division of Agricultural Physics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, the instances of stubble burning in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh stood at 11,320 during the period from October 1 to October 21. The figure is high considering that the three states accounted for 6,777 and 6,190 fires during the same period in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The officials of UP pollution control board (UPPCB) also attributed the sudden rise to meteorological conditions. “There has been no spike due to any local conditions in the city. The higher range of pollution is primarily due to prevailing meteorological conditions. On our part, we are taking up pollution abatement measures and also carrying out enforcement drives,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida. Utsav Sharma, the regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad, also said slow wind speed led to the hike in pollution. “The wind speed was almost zero during the major part of the day and this led to saturation of pollutants and lesser dispersal. Locally, we are carrying out checks at industrial units, farms and construction sites. After we recommended penalty against the contractor taking up the work at CISF-Road in Indirapuram, the contractor has covered the open areas,” he said, adding that the PM2.5 levels also increased as a result of meteorological conditions prevailing on Thursday.“Exposure to PM2.5 has both short and long-term impacts -- in the short term it can cause irritation in the eyes, nose and throat, as well as coughing, sneezing and shortness of breath. However, prolonged exposure to PM2.5 can cause more serious and permanent respiratory problems such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and heart disease. Research shows that every 10 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) increase in PM 2.5 increases mortality between 3%-26%, chances of childhood asthma by 16%, chances of lung cancer by 36%, and heart attacks by 44%,” said Dr Gyan Bharti, pulmonologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-air-in-very-poor-category-may-remain-there-for-next-3-4-days/story-frHjNBacQrcb6FzSrcHgYO.html
22-10-2020||City||Four LDCA office bearers booked for fraud||The city police on Thursday booked four office-bearers of Ludhiana District Cricket Association (LDCA) for misappropriation of funds.The accused have been identified as Vinod Chitkara, honorary general secretary of LDCA, Rajinder Nath Mahajan, president, Rajiv Bajaj, honorary treasurer, and Satish Garg. The FIR was registered at Division Number 8 police station, following the complaint of Naresh Marwaha (ex-joint secretary), alleging fraudulent activities in the day-to-day working of the association and misappropriation of funds.Confirming this, Division Number 8 SHO inspector Jarnail Singh said that the four accused have been booked under Sections 409, 419, 420, 465, 467, 471 & 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The FIR states that Rajiv Bajaj had submitted an undertaking that he had resigned from the LDCA in 2016, and since then he was not working as the honorary treasurer. But, certain documents pertaining to the year 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, showed that even after resignation, Rajiv Bajaj was still working as the treasurer of the association.According to the FIR, it is alleged that for many years, neither the annual general meeting nor the elections of LDCA were conducted.“Though the said meeting was not conducted, in the minutes of the meeting, it was specifically mentioned that the officials were present and their signatures were collected later,” said Marwaha in his complainant.Marwaha said, “I never left the association. I saw the corruption and reported it to the president. But none of the officials paid heed to my complaint. After this, I stopped going to the ground. Since 2003, budding players have been burdened with fee charges, even as the LDCA has all the required funding and equipment to support them.”“When I filed the complaint, the officials gave false statements in the police station saying that I was released from the association as a result of the 2015 elections, although no such elections were conducted. When I challenged them to show the proof, they had nothing to substantiate their claims,” said Marwaha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-ldca-office-bearers-booked-for-fraud/story-LYC5vW1fkRBwU5jCDXOmWK.html

22-10-2020||Noida||Active cases declining in Uttar Pradesh, say health officials||The Uttar Pradesh health department on Thursday said all 75 districts in the state had crossed their peak Covid-19 cases and were now witnessing a decline. Amit Mohan Prasad, UP additional chief secretary (health), on Thursday, however, cautioned people against laxity. He said that there was a decline in active cases too -- from a peak of 68,235 on September 17 to 29,131on October 22. “Different districts had peaked at different times thanks to the efforts and different strategies that we had adopted,” Prasad, said. “This has resulted in active cases in the entire state decline over the past 35 days.”HT analysed the seven-day average of daily cases data provided by the state health department from July 24 to October 22. It revealed that the peak for Ghaziabad was on September 17 at 263 average new cases over seven days and for Gautam Budh Nagar, it was September 11 with 219 cases. The official records from the state Covid-19 control room also indicated that it was around mid-September when the two districts had the highest number of active cases and the highest single day spike of cases. On September 14, Ghaziabad had the highest number of active cases at 2126 just two days after it hit the highest single day spike, at 303 cases. Gautam Budh Nagar district 2008 active cases on September 13, which was its highest, while its sharpest spike was on September 10 with 251 cases. “Since then we saw a decline in active cases and our positivity rate has also declined. However, it is a time when residents have to take extra precautions against Covid-19 and continue it further,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate did not respond to calls despite repeated attempts. “We also observed that incidence of cases was very high during the middle of September. Thereafter there has been a decline in active cases and fresh cases. We are, however, continuing with regular testing and surveillance to check spread of infection,” said an officer from the Ghaziabad health department who wished not to be named. Meanwhile, independent experts said that the state was following the national trend of decline in cases. “But it cannot be surely said that further peaks my not come. Such instances have been observed in other countries as well. The infection may arrive again as long as we have a large proportion of susceptible population available,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). “A change in weather can also aggravate infection as micro-organisms are more active during low temperature. So, people must take every precaution even though the records show decline in number of new cases.”“After mid of September there is decline in cases and the severity of infection has also reduced. We have observed that people are recovering fast. Still, we cannot say that the trend is of recovery has started even though the figures tell us that there is decline in number of fresh cases. So, wearing face masks, frequent hand washing and social distancing should be practiced for long and it would be better if we make it part of daily routine,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/active-cases-declining-in-uttar-pradesh-say-health-officials/story-BQDk3O5kr3v62eaP0TkCAM.html
22-10-2020||City||Of 10,000 farm fires in Punjab this year, 25% recorded in last 2 days||Patiala The number of stubble burning cases in Punjab has crossed the 10,000 mark this season, which is double the figure for the corresponding period last year. Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, recorded 2,758 farm fire cases on Wednesday and Thursday, which nearly 25% of the total 10,775 incidents recorded this season. Last year, 4,085 cases were reported for the same period, while the number was 3,229 in 2018. For the last three years, Punjab government has been taking measures to check farm fires by giving subsidy on the machinery to handle in-situ and ex-situ stubble management, spending above ₹500 crore on subsidy in last two years. Paddy straw burning is a yearly phenomenon, leading to war of words between states and even ire from the apex court. This year again, the Supreme Court has appointed one of its retired judges to monitor stubble burning. On Thursday, Tarn Taran recorded highest 240 farm fires, followed by 224 in Ferozepur, more than 100 each in Patiala and Gurdaspur. Pathankot recorded only 3 farm fire cases, the lowest for a district. Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts account for almost 30% of the total cases reported so far, said a Punjab Pollution Control Board official. With only 60% of the crop harvested, the number of farm fires are expected to peak in the next two weeks. “The number of farm fires will multiply in the next two weeks, when Punjab will record highest cases of the season. Usually the trend starts picking after October 25 and decline after November 10,” said an official of agriculture department. He said that farmers are not adhering to the advice of the government. Meanwhile, PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg said the Punjab government was working overtime to tackle the menace through awareness and other measures. “Farmers are using machinery for in-situ an ex-situ management. And those who are burning straw will be made to pay environmental compensation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/of-10-000-farm-fires-in-punjab-this-year-25-recorded-in-last-2-days/story-zJ59OSVVUTfTqaDU8arGeP.html
22-10-2020||Noida||Recoveries outnumber new Covid-19 cases in October in Noida||The number of recoveries is now more than new and active cases of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease detected in the month of October so far in Gautam Budh Nagar district. While as many as 3,816 Covid-19 patients have recovered between October 1 and 22, the number of new cases detected in this month so far is 3,442. However, the number of deaths due to Covid-19 recorded in this month so far in the district is 13, which has become a matter of concern for health officials.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that early tracking has proved beneficial in raising the recovery rate. “If somebody tests positive and the treatment begins on time, it will automatically raise the recovery rate and lower the case fatality rate (CFR). On September 30, the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in the district was 88.15%, which has gone up to 93.46% on Thursday,” he said.On the district’s testing rate, the DM said: “Our testing rate per million per day is over 1,750, which is much better than other best districts in north India. Besides, when commercial and business activities have been permitted to reopen, the rising recovery rate indicates that we are going in the right direction to control the pandemic,” he said.Chief medical officer (CMO), Gautam Budh Nagar, Dr Deepak Ohri said that all those patients, who succumbed to Covid-19 in October in the district, had co-morbid health conditions as well. “The infection becomes fatal if the infected patient has some other serious ailments such as cancer, kidney failure or heart diseases as well. Despite 13 deaths in October so far, the district’s CFR is 0.40%, which is much better than the state’s CFR of 1.46% and national CFR of 1.68%,” he said.The CMO further said that teams of doctors are continuously following up on infected patients, whether they are in home isolation or admitted in Covid-dedicated facilities in the district. “Not only that, the testing is being carried out at war level. We hope that in October, we will cross the testing figures of last month, which was 75,442,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/recoveries-outnumber-new-covid-19-cases-in-october-in-noida/story-ZER6wcEwX25CP4SWCQi2aN.html

Only eight committees have so far come forward to seek permission for Ravana Dahan in the city. Last year, Ravana Dahan was held at around 80 locations in the city, but this year most Dussehra committees have decided not to celebrate the festival fearing Covid-19 spread. The number of committees applying for permission may increase in the coming few days, but Dussehra celebrations are still set to remain subdued. Keeping in mind the safety of residents, the Dussehra committees of Model Town extension, Focal Point, Basant Avenue among others have decided not to organise Ravana Dahan this year as it will be an uphill task for organisers to manage the gathering.President of Focal Point Dussehra committee, Sushil Bedi said, “There is a lot of risk in organising Ravana Dahan this year. So we have decided not to organise it.” General secretary of Krishna Mandir Trust, Model Town extension, KP Gosain said that the administration has allowed committees to organise the event with limited gatherings and amid precautions. “But if anything wrong happens, the administration will take action against the organisers only. It is difficult to manage the crowd at any event that is being organised in the open, so we have decided not to organise Ravana Dahan in Model Town extension this year,” he said.Meanwhile Dussehra committees of Daresi, Upkar Nagar, Aggar Nagar, among others, have decided to celebrate the festival but with limited gathering. No Ramlila fair will be organised this time and the size of effigies has been reduced.Chairman of Aggar Nagar Dussehra committee Subhash Gupta said, “We will be organising Ravana Dahan and effigies of Kumbhakaran and Meghnath would also be burned. But the event would be held in presence of limited gathering and only the area residents would be allowed to participate in the event. The size of effigy has also been reduced from 40 feet to 15 feet.”Member, Shri Ram Lila Committee (Daresi), Dinesh Marwaha said that they will broadcast the event through social media and local cable operators.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “Only eight committees have applied for permission this year as compared to 80 last year. Permission has been granted to all the committees and they have been directed to limit the gathering and a maximum of 50% gathering will be allowed as per the capacity of the ground. Further, wearing masks, social distancing, hand sanitisers, thermal screening of visitors etc will be necessary and the committees will also have to depute volunteers to manage the crowd.” Residents are also advised to avoid gathering during Dussehra celebrations as the pandemic is not yet over, said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-8-dussehra-committees-seek-permission-for-ravana-dahan-in-ludhiana/story-dlC83nBKS8M876pztIY6LP.html

On this day (two months after Partition), Lashkars armed with axes, swords and guns backed by Pakistan Army attacked Jammu and Kashmir and unleashed atrocities on men, women and children, according to the Indian Army.A two-minute silence followed by prayer was held in the memory of those who had sacrificed their lives during the invasion.“Around 70,000 unarmed civilians were butchered, women were abducted, raped and horrible atrocities were unleashed upon Hindus and Sikhs,” said SOS International president Rajiv Chuni.“Without any help or aid from the government, our third generation is suffering now. The J&K state cabinet proposed Rs 25 lakh as ex-gratia grant to each family affected by 1947 invasion, reservation to the wards of displaced persons from PoK in professional and technical education colleges and 8,500 government jobs for unemployed youths. We are surprised that the Centre has not even touched the second and third components of the recommendations and only the first component of the package has been partially released, which in itself is a joke,” he said.Kundan Lal, one of the participants alleged that the central leadership often made tall claims to retrieve PoK but failed to stop the China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor. “We had houses and properties in PoK, but India did nothing to take back what is rightfully ours. It’s high time that the same was restored to us,” he demanded.Jammu Kashmir Unity Foundation, a think tank of intellectuals and prominent persons, held a webinar titled ‘Pakistan Invasion: Not a Tribal Raid’.After recalling the sequence of events that led to the carnage of the people of J&K in 1947, the panelists demanded that Centre should approach the International Court of Justice to ensure a global-level censure and punishment of Pakistan for inflicting genocide on the people of J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pok-refugees-observe-black-day-in-jammu-seek-retrieval-of-territory-from-pak-china/story-rZXes1FKxbP14czz0eFnXP.html

22-10-2020||City||Political corruption slowly creeping into BJP, says former Himachal Pradesh CM Shanta Kumar||Known for ruffling feathers in his own party, veteran leader and former chief minister Shanta Kumar has kicked up dust again stating that “political corruption” was slowly creeping into the BJP.He was referring to a plea against him and Vivekananda Medical Research Trust (VMRT), which he heads. Filed by a Palampur resident, Bhuvnesh Chand Sood, the plea was rejected by the high court on October 16.VMRT runs a multi-specialty hospital and a naturopathy institute in Palampur, the hometown of the veteran leader.Kumar alleged that the plea was filed on the behest of some BJP leaders. “I was deeply hurt. I would not have minded much had the case been filed by Congress or any other political opponent. This was done by my own party people,” he alleged.However, the court has done justice by rejecting the plea, he added.He said this mischievous act was to belittle him in the eye of the public. Kumar said that the daughter-in-law of one of these leaders got treatment at the trust-run hospital and the person called him up to compliment the good work being done by the trust.The 86-year-old, however, did not name any leader. “I can sue the petitioner for defamation, but I have no ill-will towards him or anyone,” he said.It is worth mentioning that the high court while rejecting the plea had said, “What we can, therefore, prima facie, infer is that the petition has been set up as a dummy and the petitioner has, therefore, indulged in public mischief for oblique motive.”The petitioner had alleged that the trust had committed a fraud by setting up a commercial hospital instead of charitable.BJP state chief refuses to comment When asked about Shanta Kumar’s remarks during a press conference at Palampur, BJP state president Suresh Kashyap refused to comment claiming that he had no knowledge of the statement given by the veteran leader. He, however, downplayed the reports of infighting in the party. On the friction between Jawalamukhi MLA Ramesh Dhawala and state party organising secretary Pawan Rana, Kashyap said that some differences occur in such a large family and they are resolved on the party platform.Also Read | Kangana invites Shanta Kumar, Bali to brother’s marriageEx-minister Anil Sharma alleges harassment Meanwhile, former power minister Anil Sharma has accused the state government of harassing him and his family.

22-10-2020||City||Nadda hits out at Punjab govt over protests against farm laws||BJP national president JP Nadda on Thursday made a veiled attack on chief minister Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government over the protests against Centre’s farm laws.Nadda was speaking on the sidelines of the virtual foundation stone laying ceremonies of six district party offices coming up in Palampur, Dharamshala, Nurpur, Dehra, Sunderngar and Kullu.Addressing BJP leaders virtually, Nadda said with the farm laws enacted by the central government, farmers are no longer bound to sell their produce in specific markets. “Farmers of Punjab were being misled by some people for their political interests,” he said.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the inspiration behind building the party’s offices in Himachal.Nadda recalled that when PM Modi was in-charge of the party affairs in Himachal in the 90s, the state BJP unit was functioning from two flats.“I am proud to say that of the proposed 719 district offices, work on 432 has been completed, 73 are awaiting inauguration, and 196 are under construction,” he said.In Himachal, he said, foundation stones of two offices have already been laid and that of six were laid on Thursday. “The work should be completed in a time-bound manner and these offices should be equipped with all the modern facilities,” he said.Stating that a party couldn’t function without karyakarta (worker), karykram (programme), karyakarini (executive), kosh (fund) and karyalaya (office), he said a party office functions round the clock and ideological grooming takes place here.Nadda said it was due to the timely and bold decisions taken by PM Modi that India fought the virus more effectively compared to most advanced countries.He also listed the schemes by the Modi government which provided relief to the needy and poor during the pandemic.Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and former CM Shanta Kumar attended the event virtually while Rajya Sabha MP Indu Goswami and state party president Suresh Kashyap were present at the Palampur venue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nadda-hits-out-at-punjab-govt-over-protests-against-farm-laws/story-FkkP3417wFWGW72bWwBg1M.html
22-10-2020||City||Congress spreading lies about farm laws: Anurag Thakur||The recently enacted agriculture laws would change the farmers’ economy and its opposition was unwarranted and uncalled for, said Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur here on Thursday.He chided Congress for spreading falsehoods on the agriculture bill and said people would not be misled by these attempts. He said Congress was anti-people and had always misguided the people for its own gains and benefits.During its six-year tenure, Thakur said, the PM Narendra Modi-led government had made a record increase in support price of various farming commodities and had paid Rs 75,000 crore to the farmers under the minimum support price.The Union minister said farmers will always get the benefit of minimum support price and a sum of one lakh crore rupees has been made in the budget for infrastructural development in the agricultural sector.Earlier, the minister inaugurated the building of a civil hospital constructed at a cost of around Rs 5. 66 crore at Nadaun and also unveiled the online community building at Bhadrol village and the Mahila Mandal Bhawan Baihar.While addressing the people, he said the central government had given projects worth several hundred crore rupees to the state including national highways to change the lifestyle of the people and the inauguration of Atal Rohtang tunnel at Manali was an example of that.He informed that Himachal has been provided an interest-free loan of Rs 450 crore for 50 years. A huge budget has also been given for capital expenditure.Thakur said that Hamirpur was the only Lok Sabha constituency in the country which has been given three medical institutes by the central government. Of this, Rs 1,100 crore is being spent on AIIMS in Bilaspur, 550 crore on PGI’s satellite centre in Una and Rs 322 crore on medical college in Hamirpur.State health and ayurveda minister Dr Rajiv Saizal said Himachal has emerged as a leading state in the field of health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-spreading-lies-about-farm-laws-anurag-thakur/story-DzAzKRrA1jX1HF0VoRiLAM.html

He said that today some BJP ministers in the state have become unbridled and the situation between the government and the bureaucracy is becoming confrontational.Attacking the central government, Rathore said it is doing its best to suppress the voice of the farmers in the country. He said the Congress will continue the farmers’ fight till the Centre withdraws its black laws.Reacting to the students’ movement going on in Himachal Pradesh University (HPU), Rathore said that HPU administration should talk to the students and accept their genuine demands. He accused the HPU V-C of arbitrariness and acting like a dictator. “The V-C should let go of his ego and listen to the struggling students and resolve their issues,” the Cong leader said.Rathore said the panchayat elections in the state should be conducted before snowfall in the upper regions. He said that since the state government completely failed to carry out development works in the state, the BJP would see a crushing defeat in these elections.He alleged that every section of the state was unhappy with the present regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/solve-internal-rift-before-slamming-oppn-hp-cong-tells-bjp/story-fJWOrRZ26W2qRejlGAnlzH.html
22-10-2020||City||HP minister lashes out at Cong for misleading farmers on agri laws||Urban development and cooperation minister Suresh Bhardwaj on Thursday lashed out at Congress stating that it was misleading farmers on the agrarian laws which were meant to revolutionise the agriculture sector in the coming times. He said the opposition party was acting as a lobbyist for anti-farmer forces.In a statement issued here, Bhardwaj said, “Congress is misleading the farmers and playing in the hands of the people who had earlier been exploiting the agrarian community.”He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government has been working towards doubling farmers’ income and has also initiated several schemes and programmes. “After realising the needs of these laws, the government took the call. But Congress could not digest it as it does not want farmers to come out of the shackles of a fragmented system,” he said.The minister said Congress and others joining them to oppose these laws were not the well-wishers of farmers but acting at the behest of middlemen.“The newly enacted laws are not going to harm the farmers, but will give them the freedom to market their produce,” he said.Bhardwaj said Congress is claiming that the new laws will hit APMCs, but during the UPA rule, it had been advocating abolishing the APMCs and even promised the same during the 2019 general polls,” he said.The minister said the APMCs and marketing board will continue to function as usual. “These bills are not about MSP and there will be no change in government procurement under MSP. It allows the development of private mandi infrastructure in the state and ensures seamless market access to farmers,” he said.“It will improve the agribusiness supply chain and curtail price fluctuation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-minister-lashes-out-at-cong-for-misleading-farmers-on-agri-laws/story-DN5daEtbMCRXJbv5SKzMaP.html
22-10-2020||Pune||PMC issues work order for Ambil Odha retaining wall; encroachments a hurdle||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has finally accepted the standing committee’s proposal to build a retaining wall along Ambil Odha for which the civic body has now issued the work order to a contractor. However, given the encroachments at various places along the Ambil Odha,a stream that flows through Katraj, Dhankavdi and Sahakarnagar areas, it will be difficult for contractor to complete the wall on time. Last year, the wall was washed away during the September flash floods wreaking havoc in the area. The floods claimed 26 lives of which seven were residents of Tangewala colony in Sahakarnagar. Additional commissioner Shantanu Goyal visited Dhankavdi, Katraj and Bibvewadi on Wednesday after signing the orders for construction of a three km retaining wall. The superintendent engineer incharge for the project (name withheld on request due to office rules), said, “Work order has been issued and there are twenty spots which have been selected. The work will take place under phases and the work mobilisation will take place in the next few days. An estimated cost of Rs 10 crore is being spent for the first phases which would cover 10km of the nullah area in a few months time ”The administration has allocated Rs 20 crore for the construction of the retaining wall and the tendering process is underway for the same. The tendering process came under cloud as the PMC had not completed the land acquisition process for the construction work and currently only 60 per cent of the land has been acquired. Goyal had visited the area to take into consideration the acquisition of the remainder area for the wall construction work. Corporator Ashwini Kadam, said, “The work order for retaining wall tender has still not been issued and administration is completely lax in handling the issue. Despite witnessing last Sept 25 deluge, no progress has been made on ground. On October 18, it was a repeat of last year’s nightmare and despite, informing the administration about the retaining wall work, they have not bothered to complete the work.” Additional Commissioner Goyal said that instructions have been issued to start the construction work at the earliest as the standing committee has already given approval for the said project. However, elected representatives alleged that both MP Supriya Sule and deputy CM Ajit Pawar had issued a stern warning to the administration regarding inaction and inordinate delay in carrying out the construction work. The administration is also mulling over removal of the illegal constructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-issues-work-order-for-ambil-odha-retaining-wall-encroachments-a-hurdle/story-V61lDGasvyiNWH7vDibNnI.html

Our government will work to curb internal pollution sources but for external sources like increasing stubble burning, we’re requesting Centre and neighbouring states to help,” Rai said. “From October 26, we are starting a big campaign in 70 constituencies of Delhi where awareness drives will be launched to raise awareness regarding air pollution and its solutions for the citizens of Delhi. We will put all our efforts to control internal pollution. I request everyone to collectively participate in our campaign to reduce air pollution and make the environment safe for everyone,” the minister added. Civil defence volunteers were seen giving roses to people and requesting them to participate in the campaign and follow the traffic rules, especially to switch off the engine of their vehicles while waiting at the red light.Drivers switched off their vehicles’ engine at traffic signals as part of the Delhi government’s ‘Red Light On, Vehicle Off’ campaign to curb air pollution. “This drive will not only reduce pollution but save fuel as well,” an Environment Marshal deployed near ITO traffic signal told ANI.Meanwhile, Anand Sharma, ADG, IMD expressed concerns over the rising air pollution levels in the national capital.“Both PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels will increase on October 24 and coming days, resulting in poor air quality.

22-10-2020||Jaipur||International betting racket used religious chants as codes, busted||Jai Mata di, Jai Govind dev ji, Balaji Maharaj ki jai, etc, may sound like common greetings or chants to seek divine blessings, but were being cleverly used to refer to WhatsApp groups and codes by some Rajasthan bookies, running one of the biggest online betting rackets, which was busted in a raid by a special team of Jaipur police on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, leading to the recovery of Rs 4.18 crore in cash and arrest of two persons.Jaipur city police commissioner’s special team (CST), which cracked the case, claimed the bookies were using such nondescript codes and names during the betting operation to hoodwink the police and to ensure there was no leakage of suspicious information. “As the cricketing season is on, the CST team was collecting information on the organised gang involved in betting. In the past two weeks, two raids were done by the CST and local police, in which transaction details of crores of rupees were obtained. After further developing inputs obtained in previous two operations, the CST team members, Dwarka Prasad, Mahipal and Rajesh Kumar, came to know that bookies, part of an international betting racket, were ready to disperse off crores of rupees earned so far during the ongoing cricket leagues,” said Anand Shrivastava, CP, Jaipur city police. Acting on the tip-off, the CST and the local police raided a residential complex in Kotwali police station area and arrested two persons identified as Randheer Singh (45), a native of Rajkot district and Kripal Singh Jodha alias Ankit Jodha (41), a native of Ajmer. Rs 41,880,500 in cash, two cash-teller machines, nine mobile phones and a calculator was recovered from the possession of the accused. They were booked under Section 420 (cheating), 419 (cheating through personation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and other relevant sections of the IT Act and Rajasthan Public Gambling Ordinance. “During the investigation, it was found that the WhatsApp groups and social media groups formed by these bookies, to maintain the transaction records, were given misleading names such as Jai Mata di, Jai Govind dev g, Balaji Maharaj ki jai, Khoriyar Mata ki and also names of other Indian gods and goddesses to avoid any suspicion. Code word ‘kilo’ was used to denote a lakh and ‘chicken’ was used to denote a crore. These accused were very secretly operating their groups,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, additional CP, crime. Lamba added that the betting racket was operated by an international bookie identified as Rakesh Rajkot, through his website diamondexch.com. Rajkot lives in Dubai. “To disperse of the money earned through betting, Rajkot and his other aides had opened a banking enterprise named as RC Enterprise, which had 321 branches operational across Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Bhavnagar, Mumbai, Kacch , Junagarh and Bhavnagar. In Jaipur, the center in Kishanpole market was operated by Rakot’s manager, identified as Randheer Singh,” the additional commissioner said.Explaining their modus operandi, another police official said that kingpin Rajesh Rajkot would give ‘Lines’ to various administrators-- of his betting syndicate—located in different cities, through his website diamondexch.com.‘Lines’ in their betting lingua franca meant credit lines for setting rates on winning, losing, average scores per session etc. Rajkot had distributed ‘super master Id’ to his local men in every city, allowing them to hand out ‘master Ids’ to rope in more bookies. These ‘master Ids’ enabled around thousands of punters, who could then place bets using the website. Every account had a fixed credit limit, said the police official.Further investigation in the case is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/international-betting-racket-used-religious-chants-as-betting-codes-busted/story-1qB5IL8wO6BOpXEuZmpewJ.html

22-10-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan government writes to speaker, special session for farm bills likely from November 2||To introduce bills to counter the three farm laws framed by the Centre, the Rajasthan government has written to the assembly speaker asking him to call for a special session from November 2. The state government does not have to approach the governor for permission to convene a session since the last one in August was adjourned, not prorogued. The fifth session of the 15th assembly had started on August 14 and adjourned sine die on August 24. Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “We have written to the speaker and the session is likely to begin from November 2.” On the issue of asking for the governor’s approval, he said the last session was adjourned and not prorogued, hence the speaker could resume the session. Also Read: Kejriwal, Amarinder Singh in war of words on Twitter over farm bills passed by Punjab assemblyA senior official, on condition of anonymity, said the draft of the bills had been prepared and sent to the law department. The bills were along the same lines presented by the Punjab government. There were some changes, such as the one where state bills allow private entities to buy farm produce or enter contract farming, as the Central law envisaged, but the purchase from farmers has to be on minimum support prices (MSPs). There would be penal provisions on those paying less than MSPs. The farmers would have the right to discontinue the contract after its tenure is over, he said. On Tuesday, the Punjab assembly had passed farm bills and pledged to protect the interests of state farmers, who were concerned about the Central legislations, which they said might deprive them of the government-fixed MSPs for their produce and put them at the mercy of big businessmen. In Punjab, MSPs are provided for wheat and paddy, but in Rajasthan, seven crops—wheat, gram, mustard, moong (lentil), urad (black gram), soyabean and groundnut—are covered under MSPs.Also Read: Agri reforms: The disjunct between the right ends, wrong meansBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Satish Poonia said the Congress was not just confused about the issue, but also about its leader and leadership, reiterating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured farmers that MSPs, Mandi system etc. would continue. The Modi government was committed towards doubling the farmers’ income, he said. Poonia added the Congress did not want the condition of farmers to improve, that they were happy to oppose laws brought in by the Modi government in the interest of the farmers. “By calling an assembly session against these welfare laws, the Rajasthan chief minister wants to show his commitment and loyalty towards Congress chief Sonia Gandhi,” he said. Refuting the BJP’s allegations, Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said the party was committed towards farmers and the poor of the country. Through the farm reforms, the government of India had interfered in the state’s jurisdiction, which was not in the farmers’ interest. The state government would be bringing in laws to ensure that the farmers are protected and their produce is purchased on MSPs. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said agriculture was a state subject and the Central government should not have attempted to frame laws. This portrayed a trust deficit between state and centre, especially states ruled by non-BJP parties, which was a matter of concern. In July, the Rajasthan governor had returned three cabinet proposals on grounds that the assembly session be called on a 21-day notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-government-writes-to-speaker-special-session-for-farm-bills-likely-from-november-2/story-NY2ZdkwBPeL7PUwMyVRxUK.html
22-10-2020||Pune||Nine more arrested in Rs 20 crore MD seizure case in Pune||The crime branch officials of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police arrested nine more persons, including a Nigerian national and a Chhota Rajan aide, in connection with the Rs 20 crore mephedrone (MD) racket that was busted earlier this month.The accused arrested by police used to manufacture drugs at a factory in Ranjangaon MIDC and sold them at high prices in various markets in Pune and Mumbai.While the PCMC police have already seized mephedrone (MD) worth Rs 20 crore in the market, other material worth Rs 90 lakh was confiscated and properties worth Rs 75 lakh has been attached this week.PCMC police chief Krishna Prakash said that the arrested persons had planned to start the second drug manufacturing factory in Palghar district of Thane and had bought two-acre land from the proceeds which they had earned by selling the banned 112kg MD.“Earlier, we had arrested five persons with 20 kg MD worth Rs 20 crore on October 7. After that we had formed six teams to further investigate the case and unearthed the racket,” said Prakash.During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the accused had conspired to manufacture MD at a defunct factory, Sanyog Biotech Pvt Ltd, at Ranjangaon MIDC. They had manufactured 132kg of MD in December 2019 of which they sold 112kg and 20kg has been seized from their possession. The kingpin behind the drugs racket has been identified Tushar Suryakant Kale, who is a resident of Borivali and has been linked to the Chhota Rajan gang and another notorious criminal Rakesh Shrikant Khanivdekar alias Rocky of Vasai. It is a major breakthrough and such crackdowns will continue to break the back of the criminal syndicates operating in the region, said Prakash.Among the nine fresh arrests, police have apprehended a Nigerian national identified as Jubu Ukodo, a resident of Vasai, who has been charged with selling the 112kg of MD. He had earlier served 10 years’ imprisonment in Kolhapur jail in a drugs case. He has also been accused of tampering with a visa document and a separate case will be filed against him, investigators said.On October 7, the large scale racket was busted after senior police inspector Shriram Pol had received a tip off regarding the operations of the syndicate. Following the input, the police team had nabbed Anandgir Madhugir Gosavi (25), Chetan Fakkad Dandavate (28), Sanjiv Kumar Bansi Raut (44), Akshay Shivaji Kale (25), and Tausif Hasan Mohammad Taslim (31), on Chakan-Shikrapur road wherein 20kg of MD were seized from their possession. Akshay Kale had kept the drugs at his house and they were seized while he was going to sell them in the market.As the investigation progressed, the PCMC police arrested Kiran Rajguru, Ashok Sankpal and Kiran Kale who informed them that drugs were manufactured at Sanyog Biotech Pvt Ltd in Rajangaon MIDC. Accordingly, the factory was raided, contraband recovered and sealed. Tushar Kale and Khanvidekar emerged as the gang leaders and separate teams were deployed who searched for them at different places in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Vasai, Nasik and Palghar.Tushar Kale and Rocky had planned about setting up a drug factory despite being in jail and had hired Ashok Sankpal’s Sanyog Biotech company, which was defunct. Kiran Kale who works as a director with another company in the same area had intervened with Sankpal and the other accused in the case . A meeting was held at his office where it was decided to produce MD at the rate of Rs 60,000 per kg. Tushar Kale had paid Rs 67 lakh as advance money for buying a large quantity of drugs. The police have frozen all their bank accounts and also attached two-acre land in Palsai village in Palghar district .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/nine-more-arrested-in-rs-20-crore-md-seizure-case/story-5SmQzfNZdL0AGBI45JQOmI.html
22-10-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand forest department to procure sound guns to deter wild animals from entering villages||The Uttarakhand forest department authorities have decided to purchase sound guns from Indore in Madhya Pradesh (MP) in a bid to prevent wild animals from entering into villages, forest officials said. Kundan Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO), Haldwani forest division, said, “We have decided to buy five sound guns from Indore in MP. The cost of each gun is Rs 50,000.” There are many villages under the Haldwani forest division, which is adjacent to five forest ranges such as Chhakata , Nandhaur, Jaulasal, Danda and Sharda. Villagers living on the fringes of these forest ranges are under constant threat from wild animals to their lives and properties.Also read: Uttarakhand forest department uses solar repeller technique to check movement of wild animalsVillagers often fall prey to leopards, wild boars and other wild animals, including elephants. “Usually, the forest department guards conduct patrolling to prevent man-animal conflict in these villages. But such measures are not enough to prevent wild animals from entering these villages,” said Kumar. “Sound guns can act as a deterrent. There is a loud noise within a radius of upto 250 metres (m), when sound guns are fired in the air. The loud noise is likely to scare away wild animals. This is a simple and effective way to shoo away wild animals from entering these villages,” the DFO said. “In the first phase, five sound guns will be bought. The guns will be distributed among the staff working in Chhakata, Danda, Nandhaur, Jaulasal, and Sharda forest ranges in a bid to prevent man-animal conflict,” he added. Rampant leopard and elephant attacks continue to claim human lives in these areas.In September, a woman (55) was killed in an elephant attack in Nainital district, when she had gone to an adjoining jungle to cut grass. On August 30, a man (47) was trampled to death by an elephant in Devchauri range of the Ramnagar forest division, when he had taken his cattle for grazing in a nearby forest.Earlier in June, Bhuwan Ram (51), a forest guard was killed by an elephant at Karakot in the Haldwani forest division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-forest-department-to-procure-sound-guns-to-deter-wild-animals-from-entering-villages/story-zB1NwNWW42PRfw9xKYwbNK.html
22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers in Punjab’s Amritsar extend rail blockade till next week||Farmers in the Majha region of Punjab on Thursday decided to extend the rail roko agitation for a week even as farmer organisations in other parts of the state lifted the blockade for goods trains till November 5 following the Punjab government’s bid to block the Centre’s farm laws. The state core committee of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which holds sway in the border districts, said the farmers would continue the blockade at Devidas Pura village in Amritsar district till next week when a decision is taken. The farmers have blocked traffic on the Amritsar-Delhi route for the past 29 days. KMSC state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said the agitation has been extended in view of the indifferent attitude of the Centre. “The next course of action will be announced on October 28 after a meeting of the state core committee,” he said. “As far as the movement of goods trains is concerned, our sit-in at Devidas Pura will not affect the transportation of essential goods as there is an alternative route for these trains from Beas to Tarn Taran to Amritsar. We have postponed the blockade at Basti Tenkan Wali in Ferozepur till the next meeting, so the movement of goods trains will not be affected on that route,” he said. Reacting to the Bills and resolutions passed in the Punjab assembly, he said the farmers supported the resolution rejecting the farm laws of Centre but the Bills were contradictory. “On the one hand, the Punjab government passed a resolution to reject the Centre’s laws, while on the other, it imposed tax on purchase of farm produce outside mandis and allowed the farmers to move court in case of any dispute arises,” he said. He criticised Congress workers distributing sweets after the passage of the Bills. “The Punjab government has passed the Bills and resolution under pressure of the farmers’ agitation. We have not achieved our goal which is the revocation of the three farm laws of the Centre. Till we don’t achieve the goal, our agitation will continue,” he said. Pandher said that a gathering of farmers will be organised at Ranjit Avenue in Amritsar on Friday. Meanwhile, the blockade on the rail track near Butari station in Amritsar district has been lifted for goods trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-in-punjab-s-amritsar-extend-rail-blockade-till-next-week/story-BklmM1QXjiIBlTWsaJQFpN.html

City restaurants until October 5 were only allowed to provide takeaway services, but now have been given the nod to resume dine-in operations. Restaurants have now appealed to the civic body that the current dine-in timings, which are currently until 10pm, should be extended till 11:30pm. Siddharth Shirole, MLA from Shivajinagar said, “The Pune restaurant association had approached me and they had requested me to help them extended the timings to allow dine-in facilities until 11:30pm which currently is 1pm. I have spoken to the PMC commissioner who has promised me that the deadlines will be extended post the Dussehra festival.” Pune restaurant and hoteliers association, in their letter to the civic body, stated, “In these dire times of financial crises it would be helpful to allow dine-in timings up to 11:30pm daily. The current take away or parcel businesses constitute only a small percentage of the business, also the dine-in operations which are limited until 10pm has deferred customers from walking into restaurants as they will be forced to leave at 10 pm.” The letter also states that many will remain unemployed if the current 10pm deadline remains.

22-10-2020||Pune||Couple reveal burden of being first Covid cases in city, call for positivity in difficult times||The Pune couple who were first to test positive for the Covid-19 infection in the city after returning from a trip to Dubai in March 2020 have revealed that the infection has taught them value for life and brought them closer as a family. From facing social isolation from neighbours, taunts for being well off, the family reveals the hardships and the positivity they gained in the past seven months. Since the first two cases in March, Pune district has reported over 3.25 lakh cases, of which 2.81 lakh have recovered, 6,562 were declared dead and currently, 37,613 are active cases. The couple informed HT that they have stopped watching Covid news. “We have stopped watching the news and even following the reports as it brings back bad memories for the family. All we want is to look forward in life towards a better life,” said the 43-year-old woman, who returned along with her husband and daughter from Dubai on March 1, 2020. The woman said it was her first trip to Dubai and it was special as it was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. “It was wonderful until we reached home. We were perfectly alright, we were not checked at Dubai or the Mumbai Airport where we disembarked,” recalls the housewife. It was after some days that the husband who is 51-years old developed a fever and suggested going for a check-up. “We were not told by anyone but we went on our own and then immediately put in isolation, we were not informed of anything nor were told what we had,” said the wife. It was on March 9 that the couple tested positive for Covid-19, while their 24-year-old daughter tested positive on March 10, 2020. According to the wife, the past seven months have been of introspection and looking back. The family feels that these are bad memories which are just an episode they would not like to revisit. Instead, the family feels that Covid-19 has taught them to value life, brought them closer as a family. The husband was also the first one to donate plasma and was thrilled when he helped two patients recover from the virus. It helped him rethink the ordeal and also be happy for helping the society at large. “When we were in isolation at the Naidu hospital, there was neither network nor any connection to know what was going on, my children were in a separate isolation ward and had no idea of knowing what was happening to them or to us. I spent a lot of time crying and was afraid, but my husband was calm and he believed that things would be alright,” she added. According to the woman, since they were the first couple, the doctors had no idea of how to deal with them. “For the first two days after detecting the virus, no one came to their ward nor was there any kind of prescription or treatment. Then we were given medicines for four days and doctors would come to check upon us. We were shifted to the general ward after five days and after 17 days, we were allowed to go home,” she said. There was another ordeal waiting for them when they reached their society from the hospital. The news of them contracting the virus had reached their neighbours who now looked at them differently. “I felt bad to be treated like that but some of our friends stood by us and were there to welcome us back. This ordeal made us feel guilty as if we were the cause for many of the problems that arose due to Covid-19, but looking back, it could have happened to anyone,” said the wife. Dr Sudhir Patsute, medical superintendent, Naidu Hospital blamed the media for creating hype and causing fear among people. “We are already experienced in dealing with diseases and such cases, and were ready to accept any case, since we had been learning from China that Covid-19 was mild and also asymptomatic. So, when we got the first couple, we were very cautious in our approach. They had come back from Dubai, it was frightening for the laymen but with the readings, it helped understand the mortality and morbidity rates, we knew it was not Ebola virus,” Patsute said. “Here we knew 98 per cent of patients will be safe, but as all diseases, we took precautions,’’ he said. The 24-year old daughter of the couple who is an IT professional said she learnt to be patient. “I am an extrovert like my father and we are a very social family who loves going for outings and travels, but this ordeal made us think of being happy with what we have. All I know is that if you test positive for Covid-19, then take it positively and look at quarantine as an extended holiday. My father is the source of all things positive and he taught us to relax, meditate and to be happy,” the daughter of the couple said. Looking back at the incident, the girl revealed that almost everyone made the family feel guilty for bringing the disease back home, but it could happen to anyone. “We faced a lot of negativity from senior citizens, faced taunts on being well off, that we wanted to travel, but we learnt to ignore these and lead a better life,” she said. The wife recalls that while leaving the hospital after the treatment, the doctors informed them that they had a mild level of coronavirus and was not at all scary, with all of them being healthy. “We were not even prescribed medicines after the isolation period, and the look of surprise on the visiting doctor from Sassoon, when informed that we were off medicines, was indeed funny, now that we recall when she prescribed multivitamins as medicines,” the 43-year old said. The family feels that the first thing that any person should do if detected with Covid-19 is to support them and be positive and don’t let depression get to you. “Take the precautions seriously and wear the mask and carry a sanitiser, it is the new way of living,” the family said. Patsute said the medical staff are now relieved from the pressure of the past six months.“But, we are ready for the virus to reach its peak again in January 2021. We expect some cases to rise from what we learnt from H1N1 that diseases take time to disappear. With Covid-19, it will continue until one or two years, or it is not humanely possible to eradicate the disease, but a good vaccine can help.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/couple-reveal-burden-of-being-first-covid-cases-in-city-call-for-positivity-in-difficult-times/story-VU23ZBXHFeZ0sMCFMb7KOK.html
22-10-2020||Pune||Pune administration, hospitals cautious despite vacant Covid-19 beds||Despite many private hospitals now having vacant beds available which they can put to use like in the pre-Covid times, the hospital’s board has decided not to appeal to the administration to waive off the price restrictions. The board has said that although currently, the cases might be going down, it is likely that there might be a surge following Diwali season in November for which the city needs to be prepared. According to the Covid care centre dashboard, as of Wednesday, of the 7,637 vacant chargeable beds in private hospitals, 4,937 are vacant and of the 289 ventilators, 123 are vacant. With more than 50 per cent of the allocated beds now vacant, the hospitals are allowing treatment of non-Covid19 patients. However, they are not ready as of yet to appeal to the government to give up the requisition of beds under the epidemics act. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, hospital board of India and Indian Medical Association (IMA) Pune chapter said, “It is true that the allocated Covid-19 hospital beds are now vacant, however, we have not yet appealed to the government about giving up the requisition as we all are aware that the second surge is just around the corner in the month of November. After Diwali, both the hospitals and the administration is expecting a surge and so it would be unnecessary to give up the requisition just for 10-20 days. The beds need to be available for this surge so that there is no last-minute rush or shortage of beds like last time.” He also added that although these vacant beds are allocated for Covid-19 patients as they are now vacant the hospitals are admitting non-Covid-19 patients temporarily. “During a verbal communication with the administration too, we agreed that it would not be right to open up all the private hospitals as earlier but it was also decided that private hospitals can use the vacant beds for non-Covid19 patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-administration-hospitals-cautious-despite-vacant-covid-19-beds/story-fxyzBQ4deFRwy67Wo4ZZGN.html

Geeta Bhatt, a member of right-wing teachers’ group National Teachers’ Democratic Front (NDTF), will replace Joshi.“Dr Geeta Bhatt, Director, Non- Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB) has been appointed as Pro-VC, the University of Delhi in place of Prof PC Joshi, Department of Anthropology, with immediate effect till further orders. Dr Geeta Bhatt will continue to discharge her existing responsibility in addition to this appointment. This is issued with the approval of the competent authority,” said PC Jha in a notification.The joint registrar’s office appointed Jha as the registrar with Tyagi’s approval on Wednesday.Joshi had been serving as in charge of the university as the pro-vice-chancellor in absence of Tyagi since June. Tyagi has been on medical leave.Joshi did not respond to calls and texts for comment.Jha told HT that Joshi went ahead with the university’s Executive Council meeting and appointed a new registrar even as he had been appointed the same day. “The VC [Tyagi] has decided to replace Joshi with Geeta Bhatt. I will continue to hold the position of the registrar. I will soon join...”Earlier, on Wednesday two factions--one backed by Tyagi and another by Joshi--appointed separate people as the registrar. By the end of the day, Joshi appointed a third person to the key post.The chaos began when the joint registrar’s office issued a notification on Wednesday morning naming Jha as the director of the university’s south campus and as interim registrar from October 21. Hours after the appointment, Joshi wrote to Jha accusing him of “illegally occupying” the registrar’s office. “In case you are not vacating the office immediately, you will be forcibly moved out of office and action initiated against you,” Joshi said in the letter to Jha.Joshi later held the Executive Council meeting, where a resolution was passed to appoint Vikas Gupta as the registrar. Suman Kundu, who had been working as the acting registrar since September 2, presided over the meeting.The meeting was later declared “invalid” in an unsigned email issued by the registrar’s office on Wednesday night. “A notification... was issued by the Registrar, Prof. P.C. Jha with the approval of the competent authority, for postponing the Executive Council meeting scheduled on October 21, 2020 for revision of agenda items. However, Prof. PC Joshi, Pro-Vice-Chancellor decided to go ahead and conduct the meeting of the Executive Council…. This is in complete violation of the above mentioned notification. This meeting, therefore, is illegal and void,” said the email.On Thursday, the registrar’s office on the university’s North Campus was double-locked --one by Jha and another by Joshi’s team, said an official, requesting anonymity.Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts.Bhatt said she joined as the pro-vice-chancellor on Thursday.Balaram Pani, the Dean of DU Colleges, said the university’s highest decision-making body, the Executive Council, needs to pass a resolution naming Bhatt’s as the pro-vice-chancellor as per the statutory rules. “The EC [Executive Council] has to clear each and every appointment as per DU’s rules and regulations. This is very unfortunate that a new pro-vice-chancellor has joined the office without EC’s approval. We request the Union education ministry to intervene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/du-pro-vc-removed-from-post-a-day-after-clearing-registrar-s-appointment-against-vc-s-decision/story-7ppuwLNdaWGMMpSrLR21MP.html

He said that this is being done on the orders of additional jail superintendent.Khalid also said that he is not well from the last few days and due to the orders to keep him confined to the cell all the time, he is feeling discomfort, not just physical but also mental.The court then summoned the jail superintendent, and posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.On October 17, the court had directed the Delhi Police to give adequate security to Khalid. The order came on a petition filed by the JNU student seeking adequate security because of his “ideological differences and dissenting opinion”.Khalid was arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the communal violence that took place in Northeast Delhi in February this year.A Delhi court had on September 24 sent Khalid to judicial custody till October 22.

Police stopped state BJP president, Ashwani Sharma, Union minister of state Som Prakash, former state president Vijay Sampla, general secretary Jiwan Gupta, and former state minister Manorajan Kalia among others at Surya Enclave and took them to Circuit House, where they held a protest and termed the move as a bid to suppress the voice of Dalits. The march was to culminate at chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s residence in Chandigarh. Former minister Manorajan Kalia said that it’s the duty of the police to maintain law and order, “instead they are crushing our democratic rights”. “The Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal also took out marches over the past few days, then why didn’t the police stop them? We were detained just because we raised a voice against atrocities on Dalits and the scholarship scam by cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, who has been given clean chit by the CM,” Kalia said. Party general secretary Jiwan Gupta said, “We will continue our fight against the Congress government.” Police authorities said that the BJP leaders were detained to avoid a faceoff with farmers protesting against the new farm laws as recently state BJP president Ashwani Sharma’s car was attacked by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/police-detain-bjp-leaders-in-jalandhar-after-launch-of-insaaf-march-against-amarinder-govt/story-znAjjkwtE9nAqtq88yAhRJ.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court dismisses Tahir Hussain’s bail plea||A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed the bail application of Tahir Hussain, the suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor from Nehru Vihar, in the three first information reports (FIRs) registered against him in connection with the north-east Delhi riots that had broken out in February.The court observed that during the communal riots Hussain had held a powerful post of a councillor. “It is prima facie apparent that Hussain abused his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration,” the court said.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said that there is enough material on record to presume that Hussain “was present at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as ‘human weapons’, who at his instigation could have killed anybody”.Also Read: Delhi riots: Umar Khalid’s judicial custody ends on October 22Hussain’s legal counsels have in the past denied all the allegations and said that he was a victim of political rivalry. Hussain had in his interviews before his arrest had said that he was a riot victim and not an accused. He had also claimed that his family members had to flee the neighbourhood during the riots because they were feeling unsafe. “It is common knowledge that the dreary day of February 24 saw parts of north-east Delhi gripped by a communal frenzy, reminiscent of carnage during the days of partition. Soon, the riots spread like wildfire across the smoke-grey skyline of the national capital, engulfing new areas and snuffing out several innocent lives. The Delhi riots are a gaping wound in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a major global power,” the judge said in his 18-page order.The judge, while dismissing the bail plea, said that the allegations against Hussain are “extremely grave in nature”.He said “even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the accused, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house became the hub for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since the partition in Delhi.”He added: “The spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a premeditated conspiracy. At this stage, I am reminded of a famous English saying that goes ‘when you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind to have carried the spark a bit too far and spread the fire’ ”.The judge said: “When the applicant (Hussain) is at the receiving end, he cannot pass the buck. He cannot plead that he had no role to play since he did not participate physically in the riots. It is prima facie apparent that the applicant abused his muscle power and political clout to foment communal violence in the area.”Delhi Police’s Special Cell has charged Hussain for rioting, murder and inciting rioters. He has also been charged for hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots and funding the communal carnage. Several civil society members and student activists have criticised the Delhi Police for its lopsided investigation into the riots, which had claimed 53 lives and left around 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-dismisses-tahir-hussain-s-bail-plea/story-xGS6ioyQ9gCgshd9kfFpIO.html

The protesters threatened to sit on a relay hunger strike if their demands are not heard. They said they have been on a partial strike because they don’t want patients to suffer, but if they are not paid their dues even this month, they will be forced to go on a complete strike.

22-10-2020||Lucknow||Worried about hygiene of prasad at temples, UP govt launches operation BHOG||To ensure that devotees get hygienically prepared, healthy and safe Prasad at langars, bhandaras and bhogs at places of worship, Uttar Pradesh food safety and drug administration (FSDA) has launched the ‘blissful hygienic offering to god’ (BHOG) project in the capital city of Lucknow. “Religious places are an integral part of the Indian society and the food served at these places is considered pure. But one has to also take care of safety. The FSDA wants all religious places to maintain hygiene while preparing prasad. That is why vendors selling prasad outside temples will be trained to prepare it hygienically,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, designated officer FSDA, Lucknow.He said that in the first phase, four temples- Hanuman Setu, Aliganj Hanuman temple, Mankamneshwar temple and Gulacheen temple in Aliganj-- and one Gurudwara at Ashiana have been selected for the training of prasad and bhog vendors as per food safety regulations.“Our aim is to create awareness about best practices right from purchasing raw material to serving the food. We just want them to follow some simple things. For instance, cooks who prepare ladoos would be expected to wear gloves, aprons or caps, clean the utensils daily and use quality food material,” Singh said. The FSDA will also certify the prasad prepared by the shops in front of these temples. The quality report would be shared with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and those not following the norms will face action. Also Read: With 3 months left for it to begin, security personnel for Kumbh Mela to arrive in phases“The project was conceived in 2015 when Sanjeev Patil, the CEO of Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, Maharashtra found that foreign pilgrims were sceptical about the hygiene of the prasad and refused to eat it. The first pilot project was started at Siddhivinayak temple,” Singh added. Singh made it clear that the project doesn’t aim to interfere in the daily work of temples. However, it would train prasad vendors and handlers and carry out routine inspection of temple kitchens.

However, a temple office-bearer said on condition of anonymity, “Temples already take care of hygiene whenever the bhandaras are organised. While we haven’t got anything against the initiative, at the same time, it should be ensured that the food safety department cannot dictate terms to temples over the preparation of bhog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/worried-about-hygiene-of-prasad-at-temples-up-govt-launches-operation-bhog/story-rJbVEhohRRJ096YdRUzj3H.html
22-10-2020||Education||Chaos in Delhi University over the appointment of Registrar||Two Delhi University (DU) factions backed by the vice-chancellor and acting vice-chancellor appointed separate people as the registrar on Wednesday. By the end of the day, the acting vice-chancellor appointed a third person to the key post even as many questioned the legality of the meeting where the appointment was made.The chaos began when the joint-registrar’s office issued a notification naming PC Jha as the director of the university’s south campus and as interim registrar from October 21. “He has been appointed as Director South Campus in place of Prof Suman Kundu… with immediate effect till further orders. He will also act as Registrar, University of Delhi, as an interim arrangement, with immediate effect till further orders,” the notification said.Also read: 74% seats filled in DU colleges but fewer admissions in reserved categoriesOfficials familiar with the matter said vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, who has been on medical leave, backed Jha’s appointment. Hours after the appointment, PC Joshi, who has been in charge of the university as the acting vice-chancellor in absence of Tyagi since June, wrote to Jha accusing him of “illegally occupying” the registrar’s office.“In case you are not vacating the office immediately, you will be forcibly moved out of office and action initiated against you,” Joshi said in the letter to Jha.Joshi later held a meeting of the university’s executive committee, where a resolution was passed to appoint Vikas Gupta as the registrar. Suman Kundu, who had been working as the acting registrar since September 2, presided over the meeting.Joshi, who is the chairperson of the committee in Tyagi’s absence, also announced that Kundu would act as the director of the South campus and will also work “as acting registrar till permanent/new registrar joins duty”, contradicting the joint registrar’s notice.The DU Teachers’ Association called the events of Wednesday “unprecedented chaos”. Rajib Ray, the head of the association, called the removal of one official and “threatening letters” extremely disturbing. “While one registrar occupied the office, the other was acting as member secretary of the scheduled meeting of the executive council, which the former had cancelled/postponed. This has never happened before in the history of the university.”Pankaj Garg, a former DU academic council member, said the controversy is going to diminish the university’s image as an Institute of Eminence.Rajesh Jha, an executive committee member, confirmed Gupta’s appointment during the panel’s meeting. “The meeting started after a long wait following the letter of appointment for a new registrar and director South Campus...”Tyagi and Joshi did not immediately respond to HT requests for comments.

22-10-2020||City||Maharashtra: Centre’s panel issues advisory for forest staff during Chandrapur tiger capture||The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) authorities have issued an advisory to Maharashtra chief wildlife warden (CWLW) to ensure the forest department’s employees’ safety following allegations by activists that the staff was being used as bait to trap an elusive male tiger (RT1). NTCA recommended the use of only “human dummies with a bent posture” as bait and not humans while capturing the tiger and asked for a report at the earliest regarding the allegations.So far, the Maharashtra forest department authorities have failed to capture RT1, who is said to have killed eight people and injured three others since January 2019 at Rajura in the Central Chanda forest division in Chandrapur district. The CWLW has renewed the capture order four times since February.HT had reported on October 18 that forest staff members have been stationed inside two camouflaged cages that are located 40 metres away from the main trapping area with a calf as bait since October 11. The cages are located under a bridge at compartment 170 near the core Rajura forest area. The state forest department authorities have categorically denied that human beings were being used as baits.However, the method to capture the elusive RT1 drew flak after a letter issued by the Rajura range forest officer (RFO) stated that the forest staff would be deployed daily between October 11 and 18 from 8 pm and 6 am and “seated in bait cages”.NTCA’s advisory letter, which was shared with the CWLW on October 19, stated that two wildlife welfare groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Earth Brigade Foundation and Prakriti Foundation had drawn the former’s attention citing news reports published from Nagpur regarding the alleged use of frontline forest staff as bait to capture RT1. “It is requested to ascertain the veracity of the media articles and take the necessary corrective action, if required. An action taken report in the matter may be submitted to this authority (NTCA) at the earliest,” read NTCA’s letter.SP Yadav, member secretary, NTCA said, “While we are yet to receive Maharashtra’s response on the allegations, we reiterate that all efforts should be made to trap the tiger as per our guidelines. We will independently verify the allegations and ascertain whether all norms have been followed during this operation.”NR Praveen, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Chandrapur, said, “We have not received any advisory from the NTCA yet, but we maintain that there is no breach of the guidelines. Human beings have not and are not being used as bait.”Forest officials, who are heading the operation to capture RT1, said they had made progress using the method. “After a gap of almost 16 days, RT1 made its way to the large trapping area under the bridge late at night on Tuesday, where we have kept a calf as bait. The tiger was just a few feet away from entering the makeshift cage, and our staff was ready in their respective cages located 40 m away to trap the animal. However, at the last minute, the elusive tiger decided to make a hasty retreat,” said Arvind Mundhe, deputy conservator of forest (Central Chanda).“We are certain that the tiger will come to the area again. We are sticking to our plan of capturing the animal,” he added.Wildlife activists said any operation to capture the tiger after sundown was against NTCA’s guidelines. However, Mundhe maintained that the forest staff was unable to spot the animal during the day.Activists alleged that the Maharashtra forest department did not have expert teams comprising wildlife biologists, local trackers, skilled, trained wildlife veterinarians, camp elephants and mahouts to capture wild tigers on the move.“Worse, the total lack of coordination and mismanagement in the RT-1 capture operation. The low-ranking forest guards and temporary staff, who sit inside cages, at night, allegedly for their own safety with live baits, are hoping to capture the predator in its natural habitat. God forbid, if the tiger retaliates and there are any injuries to the staff, the department will promptly issue orders to kill it,” alleged PV Subramaniam from the Earth Brigade Foundation.WHAT MAHA FOREST OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE DOING?Forest staff members have been stationed inside two camouflaged cages near a trapping area located under a bridge since October 11 to catch the elusive RT1. A calf has been left as bait for RT1. At compartment number 170 in the core Rajura forest area, the caged forest staff is perched on elevated structures covered by leaves on either sides of the main trapping area. The small cages are situated 40 m away from the bridge. The staff is holding onto a rope pulling up the steel gate of the main cage, which is to be used for trapping the animal. The plan is to pull the ropes the moment the tiger steps into the cage, shut the gate, and then quickly mobilise a team of veterinarians, who are stationed 200 m from the trapping site. The veterinarians are expected to tranquilise the feline within 10 minutes after it is caught. The department has roped in 25 Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) officers, 35 employees from the Central Chanda forest division and three veterinarians, each of whom will be assisted by seven staff members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-centre-s-panel-issues-advisory-for-forest-staff-during-chandrapur-tiger-capture/story-VIW806VEtmJfVAy9sQBFtN.html

Sangma’s reaction came after the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) staged a protest against the proposed visit of the representatives of the All Bengali Youth and Students’ Organisation (ABYSO) and cited that it is an attempt to interfere with the state’s internal affairs.The KSU has blamed ABYSO of trying to disrupt peace in the tribal-dominated north-eastern state.The protests by the members of the KSU North Khasi Hills District and KSU South Khasi Hills District on Wednesday were held at Toll Plaza, Pahammawlein in Ri Bhoi district and Sohra in East Khasi Hills district.Also Read: Human rights body notice for Meghalaya govt over deaths of 877 infants in 4 monthsThe students’ body had launched a poster campaign at prime locations of Shillong on Wednesday. However, the police swiftly moved in and removed the provocative posters.Meghalaya Police tweeted late evening and appealed for peace among all sections of the society and not to pay attention to the swirling rumours. The state government, which is facing a law and order challenge amid the Durga Puja festivities and the upcoming Christmas celebrations, is pulling out all stops to ensure peace and tranquillity prevails in Meghalaya that has been hit hard by a growing trust deficit between the tribals and the non-tribals. The ABYSO, led by Chandan Chatterjee, had sought permission and security to visit Ichamati in East Khasi Hills district to take stock of the alleged “institutionalised harassment” of non-tribal women and children.The state government has denied the allegation levelled by ABYSO after a probe was conducted by the district administration.CM Sangma said on Wednesday that the government has decided to talk to the different warring groups in a bid to resolve the “confusion” and “misunderstanding” over the Ichamati imbroglio. “We are in the process of talking to all the stakeholders, including the Central government,” Sangma told media persons on Wednesday.Also Read: Meghalaya minister sounds alarm over leak from uranium effluent tanks in remote villageThe Ichamati incident was the offshoot of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 protests that had engulfed the state earlier this year.The protests had culminated in the death of a staunch KSU activist, Lurshai Hynniewta, on February 28, when clashes between the Khasis and the Bengalis had erupted following a public meeting by the students’ union supporters. Ichamati is located on the Indo-Bangladesh international border and is a trade route for export of limestone to the neighbouring country.Sangma said the government is communicating with all the parties concerned in a bid to ensure that the law and situation does not aggravate. “Normalcy will be restored by holding talks with all the parties,” he said.The CM owned up to the fact that the Ichamati had snowballed into a row a few months ago, but assured that the misgivings were addressed by his government. He sounded confident about finding an amicable solution to the ethnic unrest.“We are on the job. We are trying to ensure that we get a handle over the provocative comments being made by various groups,” Sangma added.P Jyrwa, under secretary, home (political) department, Meghalaya, wrote to ABYSO’s Chatterjee on Tuesday and stated that the government did not recommend visits to Ichamati by the organisation or other non-governmental organisations (NGOs).She informed that the state government had conducted an enquiry into the matter and a report on it was submitted to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).The enquiry was ordered by East Khasi Hills deputy commissioner. Representatives from the District Child Protection Committee were a part of the probe panel.“The report found that there are no cases of harassment faced by the residents of Ichamati and particularly women and children,” Jyrwa asserted.She also cited that the report did find that there were instances of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced economic hardship faced by the local residents. “The state government is aware of the ground realities and has initiated adequate steps to alleviate the hardship faced by the Ichamati residents,” Jyrwa said.Besides, the issue of non-renewal of the trading licences of the residents has been taken up with the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) authorities by the East Khasi Hills deputy commissioner, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khasi-students-body-targets-bengalis-meghalaya-government-on-alert/story-FkMwtGx0ZLUUcM6RyZBWDN.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Centre notifies protected buffer around Maharashtra’s Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary||The Union environment ministry has published the final notification for the buffer area around Maharashtra’s 351.16 sq km Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur district. The final eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of the sanctuary now will have an area of 250.6 sq km spread across 200 m to 6.01 km against the originally proposed 230.6 sq km in the draft notification of 2019. The 20 sq km accounts for a 9% increase in the protected area.The notification was published on October 15 and made public on Wednesday.There are 41 villages in the notified ESZ in Kolhapur and Vaibhavwadi Sindhudurg districts. “The minimum extent of the ESZ (200 meters) was due to the non-availability of forest land near Kurli village of Sindhudurg district. However, we have managed to protect much more area than in our draft notification towards the western end of sanctuary. With this, over 70% of existing area is protected around the sanctuary,” said V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest (Kolhapur).Also read: Maharashtra re-examines ‘wetland’ status for Navi Mumbai flamingo havenLocated towards the southern hills of the Sahyadri range of the Western Ghats in the catchment areas of Shahu Sagar and Laxmi Sagar reservoirs, the sanctuary is home to 264 bird species (migratory and resident), 47 species of mammals, about 59 species of reptiles, 20 species of amphibians and 66 species of butterflies across the mixed landscape of semi-evergreen, evergreen and tropical deciduous forests. Important wildlife there includes the leopard cat, common palm civet, common mongoose, Indian wild dog, sloth bear, Indian giant squirrel, elephants, gaurs, tigers, and leopards.“The extremely close vicinity of RWS [Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary] to human habitation and ongoing developmental activities necessitates the requirement of proper safeguards and control over such activities. It is necessary to conserve and protect the area, the extent, and boundaries … from an ecological, environmental and biodiversity point of view and to prohibit industries or class of industries and their operations,” the ministry said in its final notification.Establishing an ESZ around a wildlife area helps conserve the ecosystem since only agriculture, small scale industries, and minor infrastructure work are permitted in an ESZ. Mining and red category industries are prohibited. “The final notification enhances protection for this zone. Now the deemed ESZ of 10 km will cease to exist. This will help in the execution of development projects in a smooth manner outside the notified area while stressing the importance of stringent measures in the notified area. It will overall strengthen wildlife conservation and ensure mining and pollution-causing industries are prohibited in the notified ESZ,” said Ben.Activist Satyajit Chavan said, “This is a welcome decision as peripheral areas around the sanctuary were being eyed by the mining lobby. We hope other areas such as the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi corridor will also get similar protection.”Similar to other ESZ notifications, a list of prohibited, regulated, and promoted activities have been listed in the final notification. It has called for the preparation of a zonal master plan within two years from the date of publication for the protection of the ESZ. An ESZ monitoring committee headed by the Kolhapur district collector has also been constituted. “The monitoring committee will ensure proper enforcement of allowed, regulated, or prohibited activities in the ESZ,” said a Union environment ministry official, requesting anonymity.In December 2018, the Supreme Court directed the ministry to declare ESZs around 21 national parks and wildlife sanctuaries without buffer zones. “We have finalised the ESZs around almost all sanctuaries and national parks. We now aim to propose more protected areas including conservation and community reserves,” the ministry official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-notifies-protected-buffer-around-maharashtra-s-radhanagari-wildlife-sanctuary/story-B64AVytPNwajMRnJoPxk8I.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi air quality likely to improve today with change in wind direction; worsen over weekend||Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) is likely to improve slightly on Thursday because of a change in wind direction, but will worsen over the weekend. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the AQI at 6 am on Thursday was 251, which fell in the poor category. AQI between 201 and 300 is considered in the poor category.Delhi’s average AQI was 256 on Wednesday. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast that the wind direction would change to north-easterly on Thursday, which could lessen the impact from stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh (UP).However, they warned that the AQI would worsen on Friday and Saturday (October 23-24) due to reduced wind speed. Also read: Staff crunch threatens to derail pollution fight in Delhi“We are expecting that the AQI will worsen because of a reduction in the wind speed from Friday. The AQI may touch the lower end of the very poor category,” said a senior scientist. The average wind speed is likely to remain up to 10 kilometres per hour (kmph) and may even reduce further over the next three-four days. Slow wind speed and a drop in temperature are not favourable for dispersion of pollutants, they added. The national capital’s minimum temperature on Wednesday had dipped to 14.3 degrees Celsius (C), four notches below normal. The maximum temperature was 35.2 degrees C, two notches above normal. The minimum and maximum temperatures would be around 14 and 35 degrees C, respectively, over the next three-four days, the scientists said.As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), and the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences’ (MoES) air quality forecasting wing, the AQI would worsen in the national capital over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-likely-to-improve-today-with-change-in-wind-direction-worsen-over-weekend/story-vNkZQhbsdBhTRevp34kySO.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: No adverse effect of Oxford University vaccine on 163 Mumbai volunteers during clinical trials, says BMC||As many as 163 volunteers in Mumbai have participated in clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccine produced by the University of Oxford and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may enrol an additional 50 before concluding the selection process of the pan-India trial in Mumbai. Both BMC-run King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital and BYL Nair Hospital started clinical trials of the vaccine last month in Mumbai . “We are planning to include 50 more volunteers, 25 each from the two hospitals, for the trial. We are expected to run the trial on 200 volunteers. But if experts believe 163 candidates are enough for the conclusion of the second phase, we may stop selecting more candidates,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), each volunteer is covered with Rs 1 crore life insurance if they die due to any side effect during the trial. Also, they have Rs 50 lakh medical insurance if they develop any adverse effect from the vaccination. “So far, none of the participants has not had any adverse effect,” said Kakani. Also read: Mumbai’s doubling rate crosses 100-days mark, says BMCThe vaccine induces a strong immune response. It provokes a T-cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with Covid-19) response within 14 days of vaccination and an antibody response within 28 days.Every participant has to undergo RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test to check if they are carrying Covid-19 pathogen. Then, through rapid antibody testing, the participants are cross-checked if they were infected with the virus in the past. Most participants are between the age group of 20 and 45 years. In the second week of September, both hospitals had to halt the trial after a participant developed an adverse reaction in the United Kingdom. Later, the Drug Control General of India granted permission to run the second and third phases of the trial. However, both civic hospitals had to seek final approval from their ethics committees before starting the process of screening volunteers. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) – which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume –partnered with British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-no-adverse-effect-of-oxford-university-vaccine-on-163-mumbai-volunteers-during-clinical-trials-says-bmc/story-Z4DV9ZIOcrdtahRCGPMykN.html

22-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The measure of his days||His routine stayed the same for more than 50 years. Every day he would be in his tailoring shop, working with the fabrics, the sewing machine, the inch tape and the scissors. On Sundays he would stay at home.The ritual never changed despite the ups and downs of life, including the passing away of his wife and two of his four sons.But then, the coronavirus arrived.Nathuram Ahuja hasn’t been out of his home in Gurugram’s Ram Nagar for eight months. His shop in the Sant Lal Market building, in Sadar Bazar, hasn’t opened since the first pandemic-ridden lockdown began in March.“In tailoring, you have to be very close to your customers as you take their naap (measure) for fitting... but now you have to stand as far away from people as possible if you want to stay safe,” says Mr Ahuja, his voice laced with exasperation. At 85, he falls in a category of people to whom the coronavirus infection can be potentially lethal. His loving family has urged him not to step out of the house under any circumstances. Mr Ahuja has obliged. “There are little grandchildren at home.... I’m trying to be safe, so as not to pass any disease to them... otherwise what has to happen will happen.”Mr Ahuja’s dimly lit shop appears like a world suspended in some other era. During a brief visit last year, the place was crammed with aged objects that resonated with beauty as well as utility. The customised wooden closet, with its long wide glass window, instantly transported the visitor to those old days when pieces of furniture were handmade by carpenters one had personally known for long.“The shop is closed but I’m paying the rent every month.”The gentleman talks of his legs, that have started to ache lately. “I felt more fit when I would go to the shop daily, and sit there even if there was no work... now I just eat and lie and my body has started to rust and hurt.”He wakes up every morning at 6. The rest of the family is asleep at that hour. He turns on the water pump, takes his bath, perform his pooja with a special emphasis on Lord Hanuman, and finally sits down to read an adhyaya (chapter) of Bhagwad Geeta. “My bahus (daughters-in-law) give me breakfast at 10.30.... I have two rotis and subzi in the morning, two rotis in the afternoon and two rotis at night.”All day long, Mr Ahuja thinks of “these times and this life that has to be lived.” The only distraction he permits himself is in the evening, “when I watch a half-hour TV show on Sai Baba.”He goes to sleep by 9.30.Suppose the vaccine arrived in a few months and coronavirus became history, would Mr Ahuja again resume his former life, or has he grown a tad too used to staying at home?The gentleman replies immediately: “I will at once open my shop.”This Wednesday noon the market corridor has some of its shops open. But Ahuja Tailors is lying shuttered..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/the-measure-of-his-days/story-5G1bWlWSgBv1jPDQFLigBO.html

I am not an arrogant man but I am making such claims on your (public’s) behalf,” said the former chief minister of Haryana.He further said that the Baroda bypoll may be his last election as he is getting old and wants the next generation to take the lead. “You have blessed me several times. This time, I urge you to forfeit the security deposit of the BJP candidate (Yogeshwar Dutt).

22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Manesar land case: SC asks Haryana to name officials who excluded land parcels from deemed award||The Supreme Court has asked the Haryana government to furnish names of officials who passed orders for excluding land parcels from the deemed award, ordered by the apex court, in Gurugram’s Manesar. These land parcels were apparently excluded on account of execution of collaboration agreements between landowners and developers after August 27, 2004, the day Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was notified to acquire the land. The apex court has also sought to know the present status of development at the site with pictures. The apex court was hearing a prayer seeking clarification whether its 2018 judgment, would also cover land parcels purchased prior to notification of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act but transferred by landholders between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010 by way of collaboration agreements in favour of other parties.The top court had restrained three real estate developers and landowners from creating fresh third-party rights on 268 acres which was once sought to be acquired for creating an industrial township in Manesar in Gurgaon but was dropped from the acquisition by the Congress regime in 2007. The 268 acres was a part of the 688 acres being acquired for public purpose and dropped during the Congress rule. A CBI investigation was ordered in 2015 and the decision to drop acquisition proceedings was set aside by the apex court in 2018. The apex court had also ruled that 688 acres shall vest with the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation and all licenses granted in respect of lands covered by the deemed award of August 26, 2007 will stand transferred to HSIIDC. Realtors claim their land outside the scope of SC order Senior advocate Dushyant Dave who appeared for Paradise Systems said the land purchased by his client was well before the issuance of Section 4 notification and was part of Section 6 declaration. However, it would be outside the scope of judgment and as such his client was entitled to develop the land, Dave said. Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade who appeared for Frontier Home Developers supported Dave’s submission and stated that the factual contours in the case of his client were identical. Counsel for Karma Lakeland Brijender Chahar, accepted that his client was the holder of the land on the day when Section 6 notification was issued. He said that collaboration agreement in the case of his client was executed before Section 4 notification was issued. In its October 13 order, the apex court said for facilitating the decision, the state government should submit whether there are similar such cases as well. “Orders passed by the state government in respect of three land parcels should also be placed on record. The government should also submit whether any appeals or revisions were preferred against the original orders. Copies of the orders must be furnished and names of the officials who passed the orders must be disclosed,” the apex court said.What did the SC order in 2018: The August 24, 2007 decision to drop acquisition proceedings for 688 acres of land in Manesar and around was set aside and was termed as a clear case of fraud on power. Award for this land deemed to have been passed on August 26, 2007. The 688 acres shall vest in HSIIDC and all licenses granted in respect of lands covered by the deemed award of August 26, 2007 will stand transferred to HSIIDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manesar-land-case-sc-asks-haryana-to-name-officials-who-excluded-land-parcels-from-deemed-award/story-EaeWPW0GGZHtkBX6As19yH.html

22-10-2020||City||Police Commemoration Day: Jobs for kin of slain cops in state by Nov 1, assures Khattar||In a significant development for dependents of 50 slain police personnel, whose kin are yet to receive ex gratia benefits, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that one member of each of these families will be provided a government job by November 1 this year. The CM announced this while speaking at a ceremony to mark the Police Commemoration Day at Police Lines, Moginand, in Panchkula on Wednesday. On October 21, 1959, ten soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had lost their lives in an ambush attack by Chinese soldiers while they were patrolling the Indo-Tibetan Border in Ladakh. Since then, October 21 is observed as the Police Commemoration Day. CM Khattar said that at present, only 50 ex gratia cases are pending in the police department. “I have talked to the director general of police (DGP), Manoj Yadava, and decided to give a government job to one family member each of the 50 police personnel under the ex gratia scheme of the state government by November 1,” he said. The state government has implemented a new ex-gratia scheme for the state government employees. Under this scheme, if an employee dies before the age of 52, one of his or her family members will be provided a job in the government. While paying rich tributes to 264 martyrs of Central Armed Police Forces, including two from Haryana Police, who sacrificed their lives during the last one year, the CM said that this day is dedicated to the bravehearts who sacrificed their lives to maintain the unity and integrity of the country and ensure the security of life and property of citizens. He added that the compensation amount provided to the next of kin of deceased police personnel has been increased from Rs 17 lakh to Rs 30 lakh under the Accidental Insurance Death Cover. Khattar also appreciated the role of Haryana Police for working as frontline corona warriors. He said more than 2,500 police personnel got infected with Covid-19 in the line of duty. Out of these, six have lost their lives. Rs 30 lakh ex gratia to cops killed in Sonepat The chief minister also announced that the family members of SPO Kaptan Singh and constable Ravinder Singh, who lost their lives in an attack by anti-social elements during night patrolling on June 30 in Sonepat, would be provided an ex gratia amount of Rs 30 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-commemoration-day-jobs-for-kin-of-slain-cops-in-state-by-nov-1-assures-khattar/story-s2WcPNb3tiUIIceopSxzMK.html

22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers allow passage of goods trains till November 5||Punjab farmer bodies on Wednesday announced the easing of their three week-long ‘rail roko’ agitation by allowing passage of goods trains in the state, a day after the assembly passed four bills and a resolution to negate the three new farm laws enacted by the Centre.“We have decided to allow only goods trains from today till November 5,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala of BKU (Dakounda) after meeting of 30 farmer organisations in Chandigarh. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh welcomed the announcement, saying it was in the interest of the state’s economy and its revival. He said the farmers had shown their love and concern for the people of Punjab with this move as it will allow the state to get its much-needed coal supplies. Farmers, who have been protesting since September 24, however, said passenger trains would not be allowed and their representatives would keep vigil at the railway stations.Patiala said the protest outside the premises of state BJP leaders and gherao of business establishments owned by the corporate houses would continue until November 5. “The next course of action will be announced in a meeting fixed for November 4,” he added. On the four Bills passed by the assembly, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said it was a “big achievement” of farmers’ agitation. “It has happened for the first time that a special session of the assembly was called and the bills were passed under pressure from farmers. It has marked a beginning of big political movement and it could spread to other states also,” he added. Rajewal said the farm bodies are prepared for a long fight. Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari kisan union, said they are considering lifting gherao of fuel stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-allow-passage-of-goods-trains-till-november-5/story-1uHTENBSdewhyGeoTfsRBN.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government discusses staggered office timings; decision on allowing all in Mumbai local trains likely to be taken soon||To permit private employees to travel by local trains, the state government on Wednesday discussed the implementation of staggered office timings, along with the introduction of colour-coded quick response (QR) based system for the suburban railway network.Vijay Wadettiwar, relief and rehabilitation minister said that the decision over allowing all passengers will be taken soon. “We have been assessing the possibilities of allowing opening up of the train travel in a phased manner and prioritising sectors. The citizens of Mumbai will not be made to wait longer,” he said.According to the officials from the relief and rehabilitation department, the permission to all passengers to travel in locals immediately was not possible.“We have been identifying the sectors that can be prioritised for the travel and at the same time would not put a burden on the train services. After assessing the experience of women commuters travelling in non-peak hours for next week, another segment of commuters is expected to be allowed. We may choose essential services like pharmaceuticals, food industries to be allowed board locals,” the officer said.The officer further stated that a few other sectors like restaurants, call centres may be allowed to travel on non-peak hours so that the services do not get burdened. He also pointed out that though both railways have been operating more than 40% of their total pre-Covid services, the passengers allowed currently are not in the proportion. This means there is room for more passengers to be allowed at least in non-peak hours.Central and Western Railway authorities along with passenger unions suggested the change in the office hours to reduce crowding inside local train compartments.“The government is concerned and wants to permit everyone to travel by local trains. We suggested the change in shift times until the coronavirus pandemic lasts. The change in office hours will drastically reduce overcrowding. The state government can only ask the private sector companies to implement change in the office hours.” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association who attended the meeting.“We have received inputs from associations representing jewellery, passengers today. The rolling out of the plans will help the suggestions we received from them. Instead of regulating any sector, we want to encourage them to go for the staggering of the office timings.” said the official from the relief and rehabilitation department.Railway officials also suggested the implementation of adopting a colour-coded QR based ticketing system.Commuters would be provided time slots within which they can travel for work. These time slots would be designated different colours and could be displayed on the QR code on tickets and travel passes. Passengers will be allowed to commute during the particular time slots available to them.“The Kolkata Metro is having the colour coded QR based systems which can also be introduced on the local train network here. We have recommended the same to the state government. It could be helpful once trains resume for the general public.” said a senior railway official who attended the meeting.However, the state government officials stated that the implementation of colour coding could not be possible because of the quantum of passengers. “The colour coding and booking of the tickets that are being implemented by Kolkata Metro may not be applicable here in Mumbai for the huge quantum of passengers.” said a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-discusses-staggered-office-timings-decision-on-allowing-all-in-mumbai-local-trains-likely-to-be-taken-soon/story-sqscu2O3syvJxI72i0JjpL.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Survey of flood damage almost over; Maharashtra chief minister hints at relief before Dussehra||Amid growing demand of compensation for a massive crop loss suffered due to retreating monsoon, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the spot survey to ascertain the damage is nearly complete and hinted that the compensation could be announced in a couple of days. Thackeray toured Osmanabad district on Wednesday and visited some flood-affected villages.Farmers from more than 10 districts of central and western Maharashtra have sustained heavy losses to harvest-ready crops on more than 10 lakh hectares. Crops of soybean, sugarcane, cotton and pulses like moong, urad have suffered major losses. Solapur, Sangli and Satara in western Maharashtra and Osmanabad, Latur and Beed in central Maharashtra saw maximum rainfall last week. More than 60 people died due to downpour in these districts last week.Thackeray refrained from announcing any financial aid during the visit but said that nearly 80% of spot inspections have been completed by the district administration and the state cabinet will meet on Thursday or Friday following which an announcement is expected.“The spot inspections are nearly 80-90% completed; we have got an estimate. In a day or two, the [state] cabinet will meet. Whatever we decide will be to bring your life back on track,” Thackeray told a group of farmers gathered in a village in Kategaon taluka of the district.Later, speaking to reporters, the chief minister said, “My nature is to carry out work properly. To start something with much show and then get stuck in between is of no use. Similarly, announcing something which I cannot do, is also useless. While I am speaking to you, the work on finalising compensation is on in Mumbai. Day after its Dussehra, then Diwali will follow, in the time of festivals I will not allow my people to have tears in their eyes.”Thackeray lamented that in the absence of Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation due from the Centre, the state was unable to announce an immediate relief package. He added that the state government is also looking at borrowing funds for giving out financial aid to farmers.“A large sum of the fund is yet to come to us from the Centre. If the money that is owed to us would have been in our hands, then we would have given aid as Telangana has done. The GST compensation owed to us is our right and it must be given to us. Once that comes, we can make changes but so far there is no sign of it. In such a scenario, we are exploring all options including borrowing funds. We will decide on it a day or two,” the chief minister said.In a response to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had replayed old video clips of Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar wherein the two leaders had gone to flood-affected areas when Fadnavis was the chief minister in October last year and demanded compensation without spot surveys.Thackeray, during his visit to flood-affected areas, had demanded a compensation of Rs 50,000 per hectare for crop losses. “Yes, my clip is viral, but when I demanded that there was no Covid or the GST was not stuck. I am sincerely saying that whatever is possible to do for our farmers we will do it,” he said.The CM also said that he has no time to look at the Fadnavis’ criticism where he had termed CM’s behaviour as “flippant”. “I don’t have time to listen to their criticism. My attention is towards my farmers and my people, I don’t have time to look at these ‘thillar-chillar’ (loose change),” he told reporters in Osmanabad.The chief minister said that they are also going to meet representatives of insurance companies as there are some issues with crop insurance scheme in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/survey-of-flood-damage-almost-over-maharashtra-chief-minister-hints-at-relief-before-dussehra/story-qrtCNIZgs8l8YmU0i4g3mO.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows Jains to serve meals to devotees in temple dining halls during Ayambil Oli||In a relief to the Jain community, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday allowed them to conduct the ritual of feeding devotees during the nine-day Ayambil Oli or Ashwini Navapada festival in their temple dining halls. The community had approached the court through Atma Kamal Labdhisurishawji Jain Gyanmandir Trust and stated that the as feeding devotees was a mandatory annual service for community members, they should be granted permission for the same. The trust assured the court that the dining ritual would be held only in those temples that had dining halls admeasuring nearly 1000 sq feet and 40 persons would be admitted in the hall per hour. The court accepted the assurance but directed the community to follow SOPs issued by the state government for the functioning of restaurants during the pandemic. A division bench of justices S J Kathawalla and V G Bisht while hearing the petition was informed by advocate Praful Shah that the nine-day festival commencing on October 23 till October 31 was part of the mandatory religious rituals of the community wherein members were offered meals over the entire period of the festival. Shah informed the court that the community was cognizant of the pandemic situation but were willing to abide by court orders. He also submitted that on its part the community would ensure that the meals would be distributed only in those temples which had a dining hall admeasuring 1,000 square feet. He added that the community would also ensure that at any point of time only 40 devotees would be admitted to the hall during the meal distribution. When asked to respond, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the state was not inclined to permit the community and it was on the court to decide. Kumbhakoni further submitted that after the state allowed trains and restaurants to start functioning, it had come to know from the staff that none of the social distancing norms or Covid-19 protocols were being observed. Hence, the state was opposing the petition. After hearing the submissions the court observed, “We are aware that it is not possible. But it cannot be time immemorial,” said justice Kathawalla and said that in light of the submissions by the petitioners it was allowing it to observe the Ayambil Oli rituals. The court further reiterated that the community members would only have access to the dining hall and not the temple and all protocols laid down by the state government for restaurants would have to be observed during the nine-days. The court also sought a list of temples which had dining halls of the specified measurement and to ensure that meals were not distributed in smaller halls and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-jains-to-serve-meals-to-devotees-in-temple-dining-halls-during-ayambil-oli/story-C9w6LJavq5ljUz6okqDQ2N.html

22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC House meet row: More embarrassment for mayor as BJP backs councillors||A day after facing the ire of her party councillors, Chandigarh mayor Raj Bala Malik on Wednesday remained under attack from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership.State party in-charge and organisation secretary Dinesh Kumar came out in support of the agitated councillors, who had cornered the mayor by boycotting the municipal corporation’s General House meet on Tuesday. Adding to Malik’s embarrassment, Kumar said: “The mayor should have accepted the councillors’ demand for holding a physical meeting instead of sticking to her decision of a virtual meeting.”Stating that the organisation is supreme and each individual should listen to the party consensus, Kumar said: “We tried to convince her, but she remained adamant, and said the next meeting would be virtual. If she can be insistent, the organisation can also state its opinion and follow through.”In an unprecedented move, 18 of the 20 BJP councillors on Tuesday boycotted the House meeting, forcing Malik to adjourn it for lack of quorum. Even the city party chief and councillor Arun Sood didn’t attend the meeting, while all the Opposition members were present. Left red-faced, Malik had stated that she didn’t know about the party’s decision to boycott the meeting.‘No action planned against her’However, Kumar ruled out any action against Malik for not toeing the party line. “There is no question of taking action against anybody. But the next House meeting will be a physical one. In virtual meetings, no conclusive decisions could be taken, and even proper discussion didn’t take place,” said Kumar.Meanwhile, Arun Sood said that he has informed the party high command about the entire incident, and it is up to them to decide on the future course of action.Sources said a section of BJP councillors are pushing for bringing a no-confidence motion against Malik in case the next meeting is also virtual. Malik’s one-year term ends in around two months.Elected as a councillor on the Congress ticket in the last House, Malik had joined the BJP in 2014, and got re-elected in 2016. She didn’t comment on the issue. BJP attacks MC commissioner tooCarrying on with their attack on MC officials, the BJP on Wednesday targeted commissioner KK Yadav, accusing him of discriminating against party workers and working under the influence of Congress.Chandigarh BJP general secretaries Ramveer Bhatti and Chandrashekhar, in a press statement, said: “Despite locking the government building (during a protest at the MC office on Tuesday), Congress leaders have faced no action, whereas when BJP workers go to meet the MC commissioner, they are made to wait unnecessarily and false complaints are lodged against them.”Taking a jibe at Yadav, Bhatti said he fears of coronavirus infection only when a meeting of 35 councillors is to be organised in the assembly hall, but had no fear when so many people (Congress workers) gathered outside the MC building.Responding to the allegations, Yadav said: “I am sincerely doing my duties as laid down by the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-house-meet-row-more-embarrassment-for-mayor-as-bjp-backs-councillors/story-FehucjUOH7CYU4Xs7XS1hK.html
22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Man who supplied bike to Gurlal Brar’s shooters held in Chandigarh||After struggling for 10 days to make a breakthrough, Chandigarh Police on Wednesday finally arrested a Mohali man for allegedly supplying a motorcycle to the duo who gunned down gangster Lawrence Bishnoi’s close aide Gurlal Brar outside a mall in the Industrial Area past midnight on October 11. Identified as Gurvinder Singh, alias Dhadi, 23, of Rurki Pukta village in Gharuan, Mohali, the accused has also named the two shooters.“He had provided the motorcycle used by the shooters to commit the crime. The shooters have been identified as Neeraj Chaska and Mani,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. Gurvinder was in a Hyundai i20 when he was arrested following a tip-off at a special naka near the Poultry Farm Chowk on Dakshin Marg near Hallomajra. He had earlier been arrested in a drugs case in Kharar this year, but was released on bail to decongest jails amid the Covid-19 pandemic, said police. Hours after Brar, 26, was shot dead, slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group had taken responsibility, claiming that the murder was executed to avenge the death of an aide, who was killed at a fair in Kotkapura, Faridkot, in 2017. That murder was executed by the Bishnoi gang, and Brar had reportedly conducted the recce.“Gurvinder disclosed that he along with his friend Gurmeet Singh, alias Geeta, of the same village were asked by Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, who is running the Bambiha gang, to provide a motorcycle with fake number plate to the shooters,” said Chahal.As the bike was old, the two got it repaired and fitted a fake number plate on it. They handed it over to the two shooters at Sunny Enclave in Kharar on October 8, and were constantly in touch with them through WhatsApp audio and video calls, said police. The two are drug addicts and also supply drugs. They were also arrested on the charges of murder bid in Kurali in 2018 and remained in jail for about eight months, where they came in contact with other criminals, said police. All about the gang rivalryWhile Gaurav Patial planned the murder, the shooters, arms and ammunition were arranged by gangster Dilpreet Singh Dhahan, alias Baba, from behind bars, said police.After Bambiha’s encounter, Dilpreet along with Sukhpreet, alias Budha, had been running the gang. Gaurav took over the operations after Dilpreet got hooked to drugs.While Dilpreet was arrested in a police encounter in Chandigarh in 2018 and is lodged in Ropar Central Jail, Gaurav is calling the shots from Armenia. Sukhpreet had also escaped to Armenia, but was extradited and is in jail at present.Running an extortion racket, the Bambiha group are at loggerheads with Lawrence Bishnoi and Sampat Nehra gang, both of whom are also lodged in different jails. Chandigarh Police have already sought the production warrants of Dilpreet and Sukhpreet, while Gaurav’s extradition is in process. More about Gaurav Patial, alias LuckyIn May 2012, a case was registered against Gaurav for the murder of kabaddi player Saudagar Singh, who was axed to death in full public view outside the district courts complex in Phase 3B1, Mohali. He was sentenced to life term in September 2015, but jumped parole. In July 2014, he was named in another murder case in Mohali, and was declared a proclaimed offender In January 2018. His name figures in the wanted list of the Mohali police. He along with Dilpreet was also involved in the firing at Punjabi singer Parmish Verma in Mohali in April 2018, and had allegedly collected ₹20 lakh protection money from the singer. How police traced the accusedThe practice of writing the mobile number of the violator on the traffic challan slip helped Chandigarh Police trace the accused, Gurvinder Singh.After Brar’s murder, police had found a black 150cc Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle bearing a Chandigarh registration number at the mango orchard in Sector 28. On reaching an address in Sector 41 on the basis of the vehicle number, police hit a dead end as they found a 220cc bike with the same number. Tracing the engine and chassis number of the recovered bike, police found the original owner in Rupnagar, who had sold the bike to a man in Fatwan village of Mohali. The vehicle was further sold in 2014 through an agent in Kharar, but he did not have the details of the buyer. So, the probe again hit a dead end.However, during verification, police found a traffic challan dated December 10, 2016, wherein the said bike (PB-12-Q-2660) had been impounded from one Kulbir Singh.The Ludhiana address on the challan slip was found to be fake, but police managed to trace Kulbir through the mobile number written on it.Kulbir told police that he had given his bike to one Gaganpreet Singh of Rurki Pukta village in Gharuan.Gaganpreet was apparently hospitalised when accused Gurvinder and Gurmeet, of the same village, took his motorcycle and handed it over to the shooters with a fake registration number plate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/man-who-supplied-bike-to-gurlal-brar-s-shooters-held-in-chandigarh/story-1GBIDDW0mLyQOYNZdAWKlJ.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Bombay HC raises concerns over ‘investigative journalism’ by news channels||The Bombay high court (HC) while questioning the News Broadcasters Federation (NBF) on why no suo motu action was initiated with regards to complaints against the alleged media trial in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, also asked Republic TV how its statements asking the public to decide on who should be arrested in the case amounted to ‘investigative journalism’. The court while hearing responses of various news channels on the allegations made by the petitioners in the various public interest litigations (PILs) against them was informed that the reporting was not intended to influence or prejudice the minds of the judges or the court, and that the contentions of the petitioners were unfounded. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the responses of NBF, was informed by advocate Siddharth Bhatnagar that the self-regulating authority had been abiding by the standards set out in the Cable TV Regulation Act just like other such bodies. Bhatnagar submitted that various courts including the Supreme Court had refrained from interfering in the existing mechanism. Bhatnagar, however, was unable to respond to the court’s query as to why NBF had not taken any suo motu action against member channels after receiving complaints of media trial being conducted in SSR case. Thereafter, advocate Malvika Trivedi for Republic TV responded to the allegations and sought to clarify that the submissions made by the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) and News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) regarding Republic TV walking out of NBA due to harsh action initiated by them was not true. She submitted that Republic TV left NBA as there were some disagreements between the NBA authorities and Republic TV on the issue of a reporter who initially worked with another channel but later joined Republic TV. She, however, added that it was just a clarification and would not have any impact on the ongoing case and hence would not go into the details of the disagreement. Trivedi then countered the claims of the petitioners that the channel had tried to malign the name of the Mumbai Police by accusing it of not carrying out proper investigation in the case. “There were some lacunae in the investigation by the Mumbai Police which the Supreme Court observed and hence allowed the investigation to be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” she said, adding that it was Rajput’s family that demanded transfer of the investigation. She also said that the public was also curious to know the real facts. She further submitted that the reporting was part of the investigative journalism undertaken by the channel. The court, then, referred to the hashtag ‘arrest Rhea Chakrobarty’ which was publicised by the channel and sought to know whether asking the public on who should be arrested was ‘investigative journalism’. Trivedi responded saying that it was on social media. “These are public tweets and public opinions. The petition does not ask for relief pertaining to this. I am only saying that there is a reason and context of these tweets. Any person, who is aggrieved and has a locus standi, can approach the self-regulatory authority and get relief.” The bench then, assuring the channel that the bench was not singling it out, sought to know why the channel took the stand that it was a murder while investigation was underway in the case to decide whether it was a homicide or suicide. The court also asked if the stand taken by the channel was oart of ‘investigative journalism’.Trivedi then drew the court’s attention to previous cases wherein the media had played a vital role in investigations and had also received applauds for contributions based on which arrests were made. “The Supreme Court has appreciated the work done by Republic TV in one of the cases,” said Trivedi. While continuing hearing responses of other channels, the court observed that it did not intend to throttle the voice of the media, but expected the media to exercise restraint while reporting on sensitive issues and not cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ which was referred to by the petitioners. The court will continue hearing the matter on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-bombay-hc-raises-concerns-over-investigative-journalism-by-news-channels/story-FGD9eKGcQ82WiIvVdtL97N.html

The incident took place on October 13. The juvenile accused has been charged under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.According to the police, the accused was known to the survivor. The girl lives with her younger brother and her mother, who is a widow and works as domestic help. The boy’s father is a daily wage labourer. On October 13, while her mother was at work, the girl stepped out to buy groceries and met the 14-year-old on her way home. Inspector Shatrughan Mali of Panvel City police station said the boy lured the girl by saying they would play together, but took her to the terrace of the building where he lives and raped her. “The boy threatened the girl that he would kill her brother if she told anyone about the incident. The girl was scared as she and her brother were home alone, and she assumed the accused could harm her brother as well,” said a police officer.On October 16, the girl complained of pain in her abdominal and told her mother she had been raped. The mother took her to a doctor and then, on October 17, she filed a complaint with the police. The 14-year-old was apprehended the same day and has been handed over to his father. The police are waiting for permission to present him before the juvenile court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/14-year-old-boy-nabbed-for-raping-11-year-old-girl-in-navi-mumbai/story-njd320MrMZb6KDa8wSygyN.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s doubling rate crosses 100-days mark: BMC||For the first time in seven months, the doubling rate for Covid-19 in the city has crossed the 100-day mark. On Wednesday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said Mumbai’s doubling rate is now 102 days and the average growth rate is 0.69%. BMC calculates the doubling rate by analysing seven days’ data.On Wednesday, Mumbai reported 1,609 new cases and 48 deaths. The city’s Covid tally stands at 2,45,869 with 20,216 active cases. The death toll is 9,912 and so far, 2,15,269 have been discharged after being treated for Covid-19. The city’s discharge rate is 87.5% and the fatality rate is 4.03%. BMC is conducting approximately 15,000 tests daily and the overall growth rate for Covid-19 in the city has come down from 8-10% in March-April to 0.69% in October. According to BMC, the city’s doubling rate — the number of days it takes to double the number of new cases of Covid-19 — was as low as three days on March 11. More recently, the doubling rate was 93 days on August 25 and came down to 54 days on September 14, when there was a surge of infections after Ganeshotsav and other festivals. In October, the doubling rate has steadily increased from 66 days on October 1 to 69 days on October 10, and 102 days on October 21. The doubling rate is highest (above 130 days) in areas like Worli, Byculla, Mazagaon, Parel, Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim. In Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli and Goregaon, the doubling rate is below 80 days.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “The fight is a collective fight and we all need to collectively fight the virus. Our aim is mission zero and we are taking every step towards it.” BMC said campaigns like ‘Mission Zero’ and ‘My Family, My Responsibility’, aimed at detecting and treating the infected, have helped control the spread.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based doctor, advised caution. “The doubling rate is calculated by taking the average of seven days, and this is why the indicative figure is higher. However, this doesn’t mean cases are going down. The number of cases has been only going up over the past two months owing to increased testing. Hence, citizens still need to take utmost precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-doubling-rate-crosses-100-days-mark-bmc/story-H967Ge5Q0gnalEyfq6bcWK.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||TRP fraud: Mumbai civil court refuses to restrain Republic TV from using ‘Hansa report’||The Mumbai civil court on Wednesday refused to restrain Republic TV and its anchor Arnab Goswami from using internal documents of Hansa Research Group Private Limited, referred to as ‘Hansa report’, in connection with TRP fraud. Hansa Research Group had last week filed a suit against the channel and Goswami for use of internal documents and publishing it on the channel to prove the its innocence in the TRP scam, and urged the court to restrain Republic TV from using the documents further. In the suit, Hansa claimed that after the Mumbai police commissioner’s announcement about the TRP scam, the channel used parts of the reports to prove their innocence, and said that the documents referred by the channel were internal documents. It is claimed that the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) and Hansa Research Group had prepared a draft detailing the facts of the TRP case to file a formal complaint with the Mumbai Police. The draft was shared only with BARC officials as it was an internal communication between BARC and Hansa Research. Hansa Research Group claimed that a draft prepared by its employees, which was yet to be approved by authorised officials, could have been accessed by the channel which, in turn, used it to prove their innocence without Hansa’s consent. The group further claimed that the paper shown by the channel as ‘Hansa report’ was an internal communication and was not for public consumption. In view of this, the group claimed that the use of the document and referring it to as ‘Hansa report’ is causing tremendous damage to its reputation, and sought that the channel be restrained from using it further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-fraud-mumbai-civil-court-refuses-to-restrain-republic-tv-from-using-hansa-report/story-VaFNJx9ih5DvSb3oHvB9xI.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||TRP Fraud: Mumbai crime branch probes role of two more TV channels||Mumbai Police’s crime branch while investigating the television rating points (TRP) fraud has found the involvement of two more channels — a movie channel and a news channel. The involvement of the channels in the fraud came to light during the questioning of two former employees of Hansa Research Group Private Limited — Dinesh Vishwakarma and Ramji Varma, who were arrested on Tuesday. Both the accused have been remanded in police custody till October 23. Inspector Sachin Vaze, who is heading the CIU (criminal intelligence unit) and is also part of the investigating team, said, “Vishwakarma and Varma revealed that they were working for a movie channel, and had distributed money for TRP manipulation. Another news channel’s name also came up during an inquiry. Both the channels were allegedly involved in manipulating TRP”. “We have not added both the channels’ names in the first information report (FIR) yet. We are conducting an inquiry and once the evidence is found, their names will be added and action will be taken against them,” said a senior crime branch officer. Meanwhile, crime branch also added four new sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the case which includes section 174 (non-attendance in obedience to an order from public servant), 179 (refusing to answer public servant authorised to question), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 204 (secreting or destroying any document to prevent its production as evidence) of IPC. Vaze confirmed that the sections were added. “The sections are added in the FIR because some people are not cooperating in the inquiry and did not come to join the investigation after being summoned,” he said. On October 6, crime branch had registered a FIR into the fraud at Kandivli police station under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC and had arrested four accused — Vishal Bhandari, 20, a former Hansa employee; Bompalli Rao Mistry alias Sanjiv Rao, 44; and Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema owners Shirish Shetty and Narayan Sharma. Meanwhile, crime branch on Wednesday recorded the statement of three senior Republic TV employees, including the news channel’s chief financial officer (CFO) S Sundaram, executive editor Niranjan Narayan Swamy and distribution head Ghanshyam Singh. They were asked to come again on Thursday for further inquiry, said a crime branch officer. The channel’s COO Priya Mukharjee was summoned on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-fraud-mumbai-crime-branch-probes-role-of-two-more-tv-channels/story-bJ3JikDjEuzLjn3kt8eaNK.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Palghar lynching case: Maharashtra CID names 208 new accused, 50 arrested||The state criminal investigation department (CID) on Wednesday named 208 new accused in the April 16 Palghar lynching case and arrested 50 more people. The arrested accused will be produced before the Dahanu court on Thursday, confirmed Amrut Adhikari, who will be representing the arrested. So far, 355 people have been arrested and 11 minors were apprehended in connection with the case. Later, 28 accused and nine minors have been released on bail as the CID in its charge sheet did not name them for their involvement in the lynching. The bail hearing of 62 accused in the case will be heard by special sessions judge PP Jadhav at Thane on Thursday, said Adhikari.Meanwhile, five months after Gaurav Singh, former SP of Palghar, was sent on compulsory leave by home minister Anil Deshmukh, he has now been posted as the superintendent of the Maharashtra Police Academy in Nashik by the home ministry, according to an order dated October 14.Singh was asked to proceed on compulsory leave on May 8 after the CID took over the investigation into the incident wherein two seers and their driver were lynched to death by a 1,000-strong mob. Kasa police, which was handling the investigation, had come under strong criticism for mishandling the probe.Singh had then suspended two officers who were part of the investigation. However, the state later sent Singh on compulsory leave. An online petition was undertaken to get Singh back to Palghar.The state also dismissed the service of the then Kasa police in-charge assistant inspector Anandrao Kale, slapped compulsory retirement on two policemen, and penalised 15 constables for dereliction of duty.The state government, in response to a petition in the Supreme Court seeking handover of the case to a central agency, had last Wednesday said that no dereliction of duty was found from Singh’s side and thus, he was given a clean chit. Singh had reached the spot within an hour after the crime and had taken necessary action against the officers, the Apex court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/palghar-lynching-case-maharashtra-cid-names-208-new-accused-50-arrested/story-fntT5EuB6vwJPDPgz8p5jO.html
22-10-2020||City||Maharashtra government binds CBI to take its approval before probing cases from state||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday withdrew the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, making it mandatory for the Central agency to seek the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s permission before taking up cases within the state’s borders. Vineet Agrawal, principal secretary (special), home department, confirmed an order to this effect was issued. Maharashtra became the fourth state to issue such an order, after West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.CBI, which functions under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, will have to approach the Maharashtra government for permission to investigate on a case-by-case basis, another senior bureaucrat, who did not want to be named, said.Maharashtra’s move came a day after CBI decided to probe the alleged manipulation of Television Rating Points (TRP) after registering a first information report (FIR) on the recommendation of the Uttar Pradesh government. Earlier this month, the Mumbai Police shone light on the alleged scam. They are probing three channels, including Republic TV. The state police have registered an FIR for cheating and criminal conspiracy, among other charges, and arrested eight people. “The Maharashtra government cannot stop CBI from investigating the TRP case registered on the recommendation of the Uttar Pradesh government; it cannot stop CBI from interrogating people in this particular case. However, now CBI cannot take over the Mumbai Police’s FIR in the TRP case without the state government’s approval. Wednesday’s decision seems to have been taken to stop CBI from taking up their TRP case,” a retired CBI official, who asked not to be named, said. “It will be interesting to see how courts react [if there is a legal dispute] in two separate cases on the TRP issue...” the official said.CBI did not officially comment on Maharashtra’s decision. A senior agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said “regular withdrawal of general consent by states for conducting probes in their territory makes the agency’s work difficult”. He, however, said that the state’s decision will not affect ongoing probes. “It’s a settled law that once consent has been given for a probe, it cannot be withdrawn. But from now, for any new probe against any government official — be it Central or state government official — we will need to approach the Maharashtra government. For example, if we have to investigate an officer of the Mumbai Port Trust, we will have to seek the state’s nod. Also, the state government cannot block probes ordered by high courts or the Supreme Court.” Shrihari Aney, a former advocate general of Maharashtra, too, said the move will not affect ongoing cases (such as the one into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput). He added that CBI can seek an appropriate court order if it intends to investigate a case in Maharashtra if the state government denies consent. “I see this [the move] as the result of a turf war and ego clash. Because if it is only about investigation, then it would take a textbook course regardless of the agency. But when it comes to a point where a particular agency will probe and not the other, it is an ego tussle, which is coupled with political motives. Often it is an investigation not comfortable to somebody or an investigation that is prompted by the interest of political parties. When the police lose their substantial independence and become pawns in the larger game of political parties then such a situation arises. This happens on both parts – state as well as Centre,” Aney said.The decision came against the backdrop of a tug of war between the state’s police force and CBI in at least two high-profile cases. Before the TRP case, the Mumbai Police were locked in a jurisdictional tussle with the Centre and CBI over the death of Rajput, who was found hanging at his Mumbai apartment on June 14 in what the police said appeared to be an open-and-shut case of suicide. A political controversy erupted after a Bihar Police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family in Patna alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterpart. The probe was handed over to CBI by the Supreme Court, after it upheld the validity of the Bihar Police’s first information report (FIR) filed on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh.A Maharashtra minister, who requested anonymity, said the increasing interference of the Central government in policing forced the state government to make such a move. “We saw what happened in the case of Sushant Singh Rajput matter...Policing is a state subject. The hijacking of cases to undermine the authority of the state government every time cannot be tolerated,” he said.In late 2018, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh withdrew the general consent to CBI for investigations, alleging that the Centre was misusing the agency to harass opponents. However, the government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, which came into power in Andhra 2019, reversed the decision. Chhattisgarh, ruled by the Congress, withdrew the general consent to CBI in January 2019. And in July 2020, the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan followed suit. CBI comes under the DSPE Act and it requires states to give the agency a general consent to act against central government employees within a state as public order and police are under the purview of state governments, which routinely renew the permission under section 6 of the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-binds-cbi-to-take-its-approval-before-probing-cases-from-state/story-VQ58tTcrzhK6f5ZlR8yR8H.html

But, the Indian Army has a tactical advantage, as they have been operating at higher altitudes and hilly terrains in harsh winters for a long time.”“Although a series of military, diplomatic and ministerial level talks have taken place between the two countries, PLA has refused to disengage at ground level and maintain status-quo at Line-of-Actual Control (LAC). Both nuclear powers cannot afford to have a full-fledged war,” he added .The virtual meet was also attended by national security experts and senior administrative officials of the Punjab Government .Bharat Karnad, national security expert and emeritus professor, centre for policy research, said, “India needs to increase its defence spending as the gap between China and India’s defence budget will touch $500 billion by 2030 as per studies.”Rahul Bhandari, secretary of higher education, water resources, mines and geology, government of Punjab, said, “Currently, there is huge trade imbalance between India and China which can be ascertained from the fact that Chinese products have 2.7% penetration in Indian markets while Indian goods have merely 0.1% penetration in China. 68% of pharmaceutical formulations and 90% of antibiotic medicines in India are currently being sourced from China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/indian-army-more-experienced-at-higher-altitudes-than-pla-lt-gen-hooda/story-rJf7gyYMxYEDh0In6Lke9N.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra leader Eknath Khadse quits: NCP’s gain, but is it BJP’s loss?||As anticipated for several months, Eknath Khadse has finally quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There was suspense whether he would join the Congress or the NCP though it became clear in the past few weeks, as he was in constant touch with top NCP leaders. He did not get desired response from Maharashtra Congress leaders, while NCP chief Sharad Pawar offered him political rehabilitation, it seems. But then is 68-year-old Khadse’s decision to quit the BJP and join the NCP a big deal in state politics? Khadse, who comes from Jalgaon district of north Maharashtra, was one of the prominent leaders of the BJP in the state. He played a major role in making north Maharashtra a stronghold of the BJP. He was also seen as party’s Other Backward Class (OBC) face along with Gopinath Munde. The position he occupied in the past 15 years shows his importance in the party. He was a minister in the first Sena-BJP government in the state and handled finance, irrigation and higher education department in different period. He was the Opposition leader in the state Assembly between 2009 and 2014. He handled significant departments along with the revenue department in Fadnavis government and was considered number two in the state cabinet after the chief minister, till he had to resign in 2016. In his five-year tenure as the Opposition leader in state Assembly between 2009 and 2014, Khadse led the attack of the Opposition BJP-Shiv Sena on the then Congress-NCP government. In the run-up to the state elections in 2014, Khadse was part of the state BJP’s core leadership team that included Devendra Fadnavis, Pankaja Munde, Vinod Tawde and Sudhir Mungantiwar. As the BJP won power in 2014, Khadse was expecting his selection as the chief minister, but the party leadership handpicked Devendra Fadnavis. A fuming Khadse was given revenue and a bouquet of portfolios, but he continued to be bitter about the “injustice meted out to him”. The cold war between him and Fadnavis went on for some time, till Khadse got embroiled in corruption allegations in 2016. He was accused of misusing his position as a revenue minister to help his family in a land deal in Pune. Though he denied any wrongdoing, Khadse was made to resign and a probe was initiated by the Fadnavis government. Khadse could never return to the cabinet. A judicial probe was conducted in the allegations, but the report was not revealed by the Fadnavis government. Khadse insisted that none of the allegations made against him were proved. At the same time, Fadnavis encouraged Girish Mahajan, a BJP minister from Khadse’s Jalgaon district. Over the next couple of years, Khadse was cut to size not just in the party, but also in local politics of north Maharashtra. It was during this time that Khadse started expressing unhappiness with the party openly. To make it worse, he was denied Assembly ticket by the BJP in 2019 elections. Instead, his daughter Rohini was fielded. She lost to an independent candidate. Also Read | ‘BJP should think why its foundation stones are coming off’: Uddhav Thackeray on Khadse’s resignationKhadse blamed “party insiders” for her loss. For the past one year, he was expecting rehabilitation by way of nomination to the state legislative Council from the BJP quota, but the party disappointed him. Since then, he was in touch with NCP and Congress leaders.The recent appointments of other two unhappy leaders in the BJP, Vinod Tawde and Pankaja Munde, as national secretaries of the party, proved to be the last straw on the camel’s back. With the NCP offering him political rehabilitation, Khadse seems to have taken the decision to join the Pawar-led party. So is it big loss for the BJP and a major gain for the NCP?For the NCP, Khadse’s entry will be beneficial. The party doesn’t have strong leaders in north Maharashtra, except Chhagan Bhujbal. Khadse’s influence in Jalgaon and other parts of the region could help the party win Assembly seats. He is a prominent leader of Leva Patil, an OBC community, which has strong presence in north Maharashtra. The party hopes to get the support of the community in coming elections. In Khadse, the party also gets a prominent OBC face along with Bhujbal, Jitendra Awhad and Dhananjay Munde. Above all, the NCP would be expecting Khadse to launch an attack on Fadnavis. A veteran BJP leader coming from OBC background targeting Fadnavis and accusing him of sabotaging his career could be politically troublesome for the latter. As far as the BJP is considered, the party had anticipated that Khadse would quit sooner or later. In the past couple of years it has nurtured Leva Patil leaders such as Jalgaon MP Umesh Patil and district president Suresh Bhole. Besides, it has already encouraged Mahajan, who was a local rival of Khadse. BJP leaders also point out that barring one or two, most party legislators in north Maharashtra are not followers of Khadse. The party is a bit wary of the fallout of Khadse targeting Fadnavis. “Khadse has blamed only Fadnavis and has avoided criticising anybody else in the party. The reaction of BJP leader Mungantiwar who stressed the need for introspection in the party is an indication that a section within the BJP is not happy with what is happening,” opined political analyst Hemant Desai. “It remains to be seen if this section becomes more vocal now and questions sidelining of leaders such as Khadse, Munde and Tawde under Fadnavis’s leadership,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-leader-eknath-khadse-quits-ncp-s-gain-but-is-it-bjp-s-loss/story-HFzIcNQOxAFWrnsyjSYAGM.html
22-10-2020||City||Long wait for Mohali’s poor to get accommodation||Five years ago, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had reacquired 230 acre land from 46 builders to build 22,000 housing units under the economically weaker sections (EWS) housing policy. But due to the authority’s inability to finalise its EWS policy, which had begun two years back, the poor of the district have been left in the lurch.GMADA chief administrator Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said the policy had been framed and sent to the finance department for comments, and after that it will be placed before the cabinet for final approval.As per the proposal made in October last year, in the first stage GMADA will build 5,000 houses in four of its townships on 54-acre land—on 13.49 acres in Aerocity, on 17.48 acres in IT city, on 3.6 acres in ECO-City-1 and on 20.17 acres in Eco–City-11.As many as seven houses will be built with four floors including the ground floor on one acre of land. The house will be sold to the poor at ₹10 lakh per house. Earlier, the houses were to be built by private builders, but considering their non-seriousness, a decision was taken in 2013 that GMADA will build the houses.EWS policy revised thrice in 12 yearsIn a 2008 cabinet meeting, the policy to construct EWS houses was approved, but most builders had shirked from the responsibility. Thereupon, GMADA had taken possession of the land earmarked for EWS houses from private builders. Currently, GMADA has 25 mega projects and more than 100 approved colonies under its ambit.In its 2013 notification, the housing and urban development department had told PUDA and other development authorities that if builders approved by PUDA failed to make houses for the EWS category, they should transfer the land to the government.Again in 2016, it was approved that the land transferred to GMADA by builders may be utilised by the authority for other purposes and the money earned from that shall be used for construction of houses for the poor.Surinder Singh, former SAD councilor of MC Mohali, said that the sad part was that even after 12 years, GMADA was not aware of the pattern on which to construct the houses. The poor are being deprived of their houses, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/long-wait-for-mohali-s-poor-to-get-accommodation/story-Eo5MD3LOuBu1kTmTcnrNQJ.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse out, Maharashtra BJP to see more protests?||The exit of Eknath Khadse, 68, – a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran and a prominent other backward class (OBC) face in Maharashtra politics for four decades – squarely blaming Devendra Fadnavis, who calls the shots in the state BJP, is unlikely to pose any trouble for the former chief minister, but could lead to murmurs of protests from other camps against him. Khadse, who joined the BJP in the 1980s, became the sarpanch of Kothadi village in 1987. He was one of the key leaders in MADHAV (which stoods for ‘M’ali, ‘Dha’ngar and ‘V’anjari communities) formula under which party leader Vasantrao Bhagwat brought many OBC leaders to the party fold. Khadse belongs to the Leva Patil community which falls under OBC and has a sizable population in north Maharashtra. He was elected as an MLA from Muktainagar for six consecutive terms since 1990. Khadse, in a press conference announcing his switch to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Wednesday, said barring Fadnavis, he had no grievance against any party leader from the state or on national level. He said Fadnavis targeted him to the point that he was compelled to take the decision of quitting the party. He alleged that during the BJP rule in the state, Fadnavis tried to finish him politically by lodging false cases such as molestation against him using the government machinery. Minutes after his exit, senior BJP leader and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the party needed to introspect. “It is shocking, unexpected and distressing development. Khadse is an aggressive and magnanimous politician and his discontent could have been resolved through dialogue. I still feel he should not have taken this step,” he said. Mungantiwar’s statement assumes significance as he belongs to the Nitin Gadkari camp within the party, which is upset over being deliberately sidelined. Fadnavis, however, called Khadse’s allegations “half-truth”. “Everybody knows the facts of the criminal case lodged against him. I would not say anything at this juncture. In any such move, there needs to be a villain, Khadse has chosen me. It is true the party suffers damage even when an ordinary worker quits. But it doesn’t stop it from its progress,” he said. Political analyst Hemant Desai said of late, many senior leaders have been sidelined, denied tickets or cut to size. “Pankaja Munde, Vinod Tawde and Chandrashekhar Bawankule are some of them. Khadse’s resignation may prove to be a blot on Fadnavis’s leadership as he has been directly targeted. It remains to be seen what more Khadse has in his armoury against Fadnavis,” he said. Fadnavis has been key decision-maker in the state unit of the party for the past six years. “He has command over the state unit, with the blessings from the central leadership. Minutest of the decisions are not taken without his nod or keeping him in the loop. Khadse’s exit is a big blow for the party, but it would not hurt Fadnavis’s leadership immediately. The actions against Khadse were not taken by Fadnavis alone or without the approval of the national leadership. So Khadse’s attack will hardly have any effect on Fadnavis,” said a senior party leader. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said Fadnavis had in the past given clarifications to all allegations levelled by Khadse on Wednesday. He said the party unit tried its best to retain the senior leader, but could not succeed. The party however chose not to criticise Khadse. “Nobody would say that he did not contribute to the party’s growth in Maharashtra. He was respected within the party. He was also made a minister between 1995 and 1999 and later in 2014, whenever the BJP was in power. However, criticising him will not look good for us. Besides, we will not antagonise the Leva Patil community by targetting him. The Leva Patils have a significant presence in north Maharashtra and they respect him,” said another BJP leader. “We wish him luck.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-out-maharashtra-bjp-to-see-more-protests/story-xCrGexsON2mPiiGu8neHeM.html

No bid was received for a chemist-cum-instruments shop at PU’s dental college in south campus, which was also to be auctioned on Wednesday.The coffee house, which was opened in 1975, had announced its closure last year due to a decrease in footfall and consequent losses. The number of employees, too, had gone down from six to three.The cafeteria was a prominent space for students and academicians to eat, socialise and discuss for several years. After its closure, the PU administration had asked the University Institute of Hotel and Tourism management (UIHTM) to run a cafeteria or bakery in the space, but they had declined the offer and the space remained closed for more than a year.In November last year, a committee that had finalised the conditions for renting out the South India Coffee House had also proposed that the cafe should become a multi-cuisine restaurant with a new menu of at least 20 new food items in addition to the South Indian food items that were served at the iconic cafe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/finally-panjab-university-s-south-india-coffee-house-auctioned-for-1-lakh/story-K3T0UWZHUW5i0TpUy2PAoM.html

22-10-2020||Mumbai||Steep rise in prices of onions, tomatoes, potatoes in Mumbai pinches pockets||The unseasonal rain has led to a sharp rise in prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes, main ingredients in a majority of Indian food items, adding to the strain on household budget of citizens. The prices of onions have risen to ₹80-90 for a kg from ₹60 last week. The rate of tomatoes has risen to ₹80 for a kg from ₹60, while price of potato has increased to ₹50 a kg from ₹40. The retreating monsoon hit parts of western Maharashtra, Marathwada and Konkan last week, wreaking havoc on the standing crops which were waiting for harvesting. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is surveying these areas to assess the damage and provide relief to farmers. Shankar Pingle, director, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), said there is a shortage of essential items. “Vegetables are brought from Solapur, Sangli, Pune, Satara and Nashik, which are hit by unseasonal rain. The crop has been destroyed, so there is an erratic supply of vegetables,” said Pingle. He said it will take at least 20 days for things to stabilise and the rates to come down. Citizens feel the price hike has come at the worst time. “How can any household manage without these three items,” asked Naghma Khan Hashmi, a media professional from Oshiwara. “For the past seven months, we hardly earned anything due to lockdown. This hike is unbearable, especially for the poor,” she said, adding the state government should intervene. Hotels and restaurants also rue the situation.“The proposed hike has increased our overall costs and we can’t pass this on to our consumers. We have just started our eatery and any increase in rates means loss of consumers,” said Raghav Pai, partner, Saffron Kitchen, a takeaway joint at Powai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/steep-rise-in-prices-of-onions-tomatoes-potatoes-in-mumbai-pinches-pockets/story-rtYJ0Stz0QkMppnjqHT5jI.html

22-10-2020||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse quits BJP, blames Devendra Fadnavis; set to join Sharad Pawar-led NCP||Disgruntled senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse on Wednesday quit the party to join the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). In a significant political development on Wednesday afternoon, NCP’s Maharashtra unit chief Jayant Patil announced that Khadse would join the party on Friday. The NCP is likely offer the 68-year-old leader a ministerial position in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. Khadse’s daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse, who is the BJP MP from Raver in Jalgaon, however, will not quit the party. Khadse, considered a prominent leader of Maharashtra BJP, is from Jalgaon in north Maharashtra. An important leader of Leva Patil, a farmer community that has a significant presence in north Maharashtra, Khadse was unhappy with the party since he was made to resign as minister in 2016 due to graft charges. On Wednesday, he alleged he was forced to quit the party and blamed former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “I am resigning from the primary membership of the party due to personal reasons,” Khadse said in his resignation letter sent to state BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Wednesday.Khade said, “I have no grievances against any other leader from the national or state leadership. I am upset with Fadnavis, who made the police take up false cases against me. One such case of outraging the modesty of a woman was registered against me on the orders from Fadnavis who was CM and home minister. Similarly, corruption cases in Bhosri (Pune) land deal were lodged, although nothing came out of it. I urged my party leadership and Fadnavis on various platforms to give me reasons for the punishment, but I never got a reply.”Fadnavis called Khadse’s allegations “half-truths” and said he will speak at an appropriate time. “Everybody knows about the facts of the case lodged against him [Khadse]. I would not say anything at this juncture,” he said. “In any such move, there needs to be a villain. Khadse has chosen me for it. It is true that the party suffers damage even when an ordinary worker quits. But it doesn’t stop the party from its progress,” he added.On his grievances with Fadnavis, Khadse said that he even tried to raise the issue with the Central leadership and told them about deliberate attempts to defame him, but to no avail. “I then got the message that I will not get justice here. I even submitted proof of conspiracy by the party leadership to defeat Rohini Khadse, my daughter, in the Assembly elections last year. No action was taken,” he said.He said he was singled out in the party over graft charges. “There are at least 60% leaders in the party who have faced corruption charges. Some of them were given ministership, post of leader of Opposition, but action was taken only against me. Except the allegations of corruption levelled during our government, I never faced such charges before in my political career of 40 years,” he said.State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said Khadse’s decision was unfortunate, but defended Fadnavis. He said, “Devendraji has already clarified about the action taken by his government in each of the cases against Khadse. What Khadse has been claiming now is his version and should not be taken at face value.” Patil insisted that the party would have resolved the grievances the leader had.Khadse was the revenue minister in the Fadnavis-led BJP government, but was forced to resign in June 2016 after he faced allegations of corruption in a case involving purchase of land by his family members in Pune. He was denied a party ticket in the 2019 Assembly elections. The dissident leader was in touch with top NCP leaders for quite some time. Jayant Patil said Khadse had informed him some time back that he had decided to leave BJP.“Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who has played a significant role in the growth of BJP in Maharashtra in the last around four decades, has decided to leave his party. He had informed me about his decision sometimes back. This has paved the way for his induction in the NCP. Khadse will formally join the party on Friday afternoon,” Jayant Patil said.Khadse wants political rehabilitation and is keen on a ministerial berth. NCP insiders said the party top brass is considering a proposal to induct him as a minister and give him the agriculture portfolio.According to a proposal under consideration, state housing minister Jitendra Awhad could be asked to resign and appointed as state NCP chief.The NCP will have to exchange his portfolio with Sena which has the agriculture department. All this will be possible only if Sena agrees to swap portfolios, said a senior NCP leader. Currently, Jayant Patil is holding the state unit chief position as well as the one of water resources minister in the MVA government. Dada Bhuse from Sena is the state agriculture minister.“NCP leadership believes that Khadse comes from rural Maharashtra and would prove very useful if given a portfolio related to the same,” said a senior NCP leader, requesting anonymity.“His joining will help in strengthening the party in north Maharashtra and among the Other Backward Class (OBC) communities, particularly Leva Patil community,” he added.“His joining the party will make NCP stronger as Khadse has vast experience on many issues. His followers are spread across the state, but a large number of people from Jalgaon and north Maharashtra region follow him,” said Jayant Patil.Patil, however, said there has been no discussion on inducting Khadse into the ministerial council. “Today we are talking about his (Khadse) induction in the NCP… He has not put any such condition. NCP chief Sharad Pawar always awards responsibilities to those having capabilities,” he said.In case, if Sena didn’t agree to give agriculture department then NCP is also considering a reshuffle of the departments it has got as its share as an ally in the MVA government, said NCP insiders.However, the Sena, too, is considering to drop one minister to induct Ravindra Waikar, a Mumbai MLA from Jogeshwari (East) Assembly constituency, considered a close confidante of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, insiders said.With Khadse, a few other BJP leaders may join the ruling party that was facing mass exodus in the run-up to the state Assembly elections last year.Patil said that many other BJP MLAs and leaders, who support Khadse and believe in his leadership, wanted to join the NCP. However, the decision on their induction is yet to be taken. “We don’t want unnecessary elections during the coronavirus pandemic as elected representatives will have to resign from their respective positions and thus decisions about them will be taken at an appropriate time. However, others can join the party soon,” the state NCP chief said.Apart from Khadse and his followers, there are many other senior BJP leaders who are also interested in joining the NCP. The state NCP chief said that he already had discussions with a few of them recently and their names will be declared soon.However, Khadse’s daughter-in-law and Raver MP Raksha Khadse will continue to be with the BJP. She will not be joining the NCP, both Khadse and the state NCP chief, cleared.According to his close aides, Khadse is expected to get a berth in state legislative council from the governor’s quota. The MVA government is yet to take a decision on recommending names to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for appointing 12 positions of member of the legislative council.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray praised Khadse and asked BJP to introspect on why foundation stones are leaving the party when the party’s success is at a peak. “Eknath Khadse is coming into the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi family and we welcome him. Khadseji has a unique identity; he is a warrior and a straight-forward leader. Khadseji was one of the leaders with Gopinathji [Munde], Pramod ji [Mahajan] who planted roots of BJP in Maharashtra. When a person like him, who formed the base of the party, leaves the party, then the BJP should introspect and ask [themselves] while climbing the peaks of success, why the foundation stones are coming off.”“Earlier, we (Shiv Sena) [left the NDA], the Shiromani Akali Dal also left the alliance recently. Now Khadse is also not with the BJP. Hence, the BJP should think about it. I was once a friend of the BJP, it is my friendly advice and duty to alert them,” he said.Political analyst Prakash Bal said that Khadse joining NCP will help the party only to some extent. “It is going to help the NCP in north Maharashtra only to some extent as I have a doubt whether Khadse’s clout has remained as it used to be in the past few years. We will have to wait and watch how much beneficial he is going to be for the NCP,” Bal said.On Monday, Pawar had hinted that Khadse may join the party. Commenting on the reports about Khadse’s entry to the NCP that have been doing rounds for several weeks, he has said Khadse’s capability and work cannot be overlooked, but the political decision has to be taken by him. He also praised the senior BJP leader saying that Khadse has been the most effective leader of Opposition he had seen in over two decades.(With inputs from Swapnil Rawal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-quits-bjp-blames-devendra-fadnavis-set-to-join-sharad-pawar-led-ncp/story-8EZYXs6QI2vvmwnVg9pweI.html

22-10-2020||Mumbai||Actor Kangana Ranaut, sister Rangoli Chandel summoned to join sedition case probe in Mumbai on Oct 26, 27||Actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel have been summoned to record their statements at the Bandra police station on October 26 and 27, respectively, in the case registered against them for sedition and allegedly promoting enmity between different communities. The police had filed a first information report (FIR) last Saturday, a day after the Bandra metropolitan magistrate court issued an order for the same.Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 9, confirmed that summons had been issued to the sisters. “We have issued notice and have asked them to join and cooperate with Bandra police in the investigation,” said Trimukhe.Acting on a complaint lodged by a casting director, Munawarali aka Sahil Sayyed, metropolitan magistrate Jaydeo Y Khule on October 17 issued an order, directing Bandra police to initiate criminal action against the Ranaut and Chandel after observing “prima facie cognisable offence has been committed by the accused”. Sayyed, in his complaint, said Ranaut’s actions “created a bad image of Bollywood in the minds of people and even created a communal divide and rift between people of two communities.” His complaint added that Kangana has been “maliciously bringing religion in all her tweets”. The casting director further alleged that Chandel, who also works as manager of the actor, has also tweeted highly objectionable messages, intended to create a communal rift.Khule, while ordering an FIR, had noted in his order, “On prima facie perusal of complaint and submissions, I found that a cognizable offence has been committed by the accused… Thorough investigation is necessary by the expert, search and seizure is necessary in this case.” The sisters were booked on Saturday under sections 124(A) (sedition - to bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt, or excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the government established by law in India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise), 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, race, place of birth, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295(A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class, by insulting it’s religion or religious beliefs) along with section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).After the case was registered, Ranaut had tweeted, “Who all are fasting on Navratris?...meanwhile another FIR filed against me, Pappu sena in Maharashtra seems to be obsessing over me, don’t miss me so much I will be there soon #Navratri.” Meanwhile, her lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, had said, “The order passed by the learned magistrate shall be legally dealt with on ‘merits’ as per procedure of law. Right of speech and expression should not be construed as promoting communal disharmony. Having personally known Kangana I can firmly say that she is not against any religion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/actor-kangana-ranaut-sister-rangoli-chandel-summoned-to-join-sedition-case-probe-in-mumbai-on-oct-26-27/story-7f19CRBYUFtyJoVI5mHzWO.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports under 10,000 Covid cases for fourth day in a row||Maharashtra, for a fourth straight day, reported under 10,000 new Covid-19 infections as 8,142 fresh cases on Wednesday took the tally to 1,617,658. With the addition of 180 more fatalities, the toll went up to 42,633.Mumbai, too, continued with its decline in new cases by clocking 1,609 new infections, taking the tally to 245,869 and toll to 9,912 with 48 more deaths reported on Wednesday. Of the 180 deaths reported on Wednesday, 91 were from past two days, 37 from past week and remaining 52 were from the period before it, according to the state health department statement. After Mumbai, the highest number of deaths, 21, were from Pune (3 in city, 9 in rural parts and 8 in Pimpri-Chinchwad), followed by 15 in Nagpur and 9 in Sangli. Pune clocked 1,406 new infections, including 442 in city, 734 in rural parts and 230 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Nagpur clocked 447 cases, Nashik 330, while Ahmednagar added 294 new cases. By adding 3,117 new infections, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) retains its top share (38.29%) in the state’s tally. The state’s recovery rate improved to 87.51% after a whopping 23,371 patients were reported to have recovered in 24 hours, taking the tally of recovered patients to 1,415,679. State has 158,852 active patients, highest being in Pune (30,570) followed by Thane (27,677) and Mumbai (20,216). State authorities, who have been projecting a spike in cases over the next few weeks in view of the onset of winter coinciding with the festive season and unlocking rolled out, have instructed to aggressively implement its outreach drive. “The first phase of ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ has helped us in bringing awareness among the people over the pandemic protocol and personal hygiene. We have been getting good results and this has helped us in containing the spread. We have details of almost everyone with comorbid conditions. We have directed the district administration to monitor the vulnerable sections of society, so as to treat them early,” said an official from the state health department. State authorities are wary about the drop in the rate of tests conducted for the detection of the infection. The daily average of the tests in October has dropped to 72,442 from 88,209 tests per day in September. “It is a good sign that even the positivity rate in October has dropped to 15.12%, but it does not mean that the state should decrease tests. We have been insisting on increasing number of tests,” said a member of the state-government appointed task force for the clinical treatment of patients.Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread, said, “If the people take due precautions related to personal hygiene and follow the protocol, the surge may not be as high as we witnessed in September. With almost everything having been opened up, 70% of the population has not been exposed even today. So if we follow the protocol, I think we will continue with the plateau till January and by February onwards they will drop further to the baseline of the curve.”76, 259 tests were conducted in the state in the last 24 hours at a positivity rate of 10.67%. State has 24,47,292 people in home quarantine, while 23,312 are institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-under-10-000-covid-cases-for-fourth-day-in-a-row/story-s2qmNU1KHoQQzBzioAKrXJ.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department makes it mandatory for teachers to attend training on child rights||The Maharashtra education department has made it mandatory for teachers across the state to attend a three-day-long training on child rights and protection in order to create awareness in schools. The online training session is being held between October 20 and 22, and schools have been asked to ensure 100% attendance of teachers. “Ensuring the physical and psychological wellbeing of children is the responsibility of the state government. Teachers have to ensure that the rights of students are protected, and should spread the word in their respective schools,” read a circular issued by the education department last week. On the first day of training, however, teachers reported several glitches. “Many were not able to register despite trying multiple times. Even the video link which was given to teachers did not work,” said Uday Nare, teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri. An official from the education department said, “The training saw good attendance from teachers. Those who missed it can watch the video later.”Teachers have been urging the department to come up with ways to reach out to students who had poor or no internet access. “Right to education is a very important right of students, and when they are not able to join online learning, it is a violation of that right. We hope that the department addresses this issue,” said a teacher from a suburban school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-makes-it-mandatory-for-teachers-to-attend-training-on-child-rights/story-Fg16M7FZvGqb7Pdg0mckuN.html
22-10-2020||Mumbai||55-year-old accused in five theft cases in Mumbai in the 90s acquitted||A sessions court on Wednesday acquitted a 55-year-old man in five cases of theft lodged between 1991 and 1995. The man, who suffers from paralysis, was arrested in March last year after he jumped bail in 1995. As per the prosecution’s case, the accused, Sanjay Bodhe, was booked in five cases of house trespass and theft between 1991 and 1995 by Matunga police station. The prosecution claimed that he was arrested on September 20, 1995, and released on bail in 1995. Since then, he did not return to attend the case hearing. “He has been acquitted from all five cases by the court for want of evidence,” said Bodhe’s lawyer RG Gadgil. In one of the cases, Bodhe, with the help of another accused, entered a wine shop and fled with cash, jewellery, liquor and other valuables on January 16, 1991. He was booked in four similar cases of robbery by Matunga police station. The prosecution had pleaded that a non-bailable warrant was issued against him in 1999 and in January 2005, Bodhe was declared a proclaimed offender. However, he was not traced and his file was stored in the court as dormant until March 2019. With efforts of the police, the case was reopened and Bodhe was traced to Satara. He was arrested in March 2019 and booked in all five cases. He was in prison since his arrest. While seeking bail for him earlier, Gadgil had pleaded that the accused is suffering from paralysis and is seriously ill. His bail plea was, however, rejected by the court which observed that he could abscond again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/55-year-old-accused-in-five-theft-cases-in-mumbai-in-the-90s-acquitted/story-T3pc0yr2y1EHbPkITjmfML.html

The national capital recorded 47 new Covid-19 fatalities taking the total death toll in the city to 6,128.The number of cases of the infection has been on the rise again in the city, with over 3,000 cases being reported each day in the last week, barring Sunday, when comparatively lesser number of tests were conducted.The record in the number of real-time polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR tests, continues a recent trend of increasing share of these tests. RT-PCR tests accounted for 28% of the total 59,064 tests conducted in past 24 hours.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOver the past week, more than 27% of the tests were done using this method up from just about 18% in September when the Delhi government had massively scaled up testing along with the rising cases of the infection. Now, the government has been ramping up the RT PCR tests over the last two weeks.The Delhi high court had earlier questioned the government on why the more accurate RT-PCR tests were not being performed to full capacity. The alternate rapid antigen tests are cheap, easily deployable in clinics and dispensaries, and gives results within 15 minutes. However, the downside is that they can give false negatives, or miss positive cases.Since RT-PCR tests have a higher sensitivity, their increased use by the Delhi government has led to an increase in number of cases and positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive among total tested.An average positivity rate of 6.2% was recorded in the last seven days as compared to 5.5% the week before. During the last seven days, 3,269 new cases were reported each day on average as compared to 2,777 cases the week before.Also Read | Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain bats for plasma therapyHowever, the number of hospital admission have remained almost the same during the last two weeks when the number of cases went up, indicating that more asymptomatic cases were detected using the RT PCR tests. “The sensitivity of an RT-PCR test is much higher than that of a rapid antigen test, so it will pick up more cases. This is the reason any symptomatic person who tests negative on the rapid test must get an RT-PCR for confirmation. So, if you increase the number of RT-PCR tests, the number of cases and positivity rate is likely to go up,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-cases-touch-26-day-high-in-delhi-as-rt-pcr-tests-rise/story-Fisj1KOnYPbshW1zxoGqaO.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||74% seats filled in DU colleges but fewer admissions in reserved categories||Fewer admissions have taken place in undergraduate seats reserved for the economically weaker sections (EWS) and scheduled tribe (ST) categories in Delhi University’s (DU) first two cut-off lists, according to data shared by the varsity. Only 15% of seats reserved for EWS students in DU colleges were filled till Tuesday, while a slightly better 21% enrolment was recorded in the ST category.Around 74% of the available 70,000 seats have already been filled in colleges in the two cut-off lists.As many as 15,698 applicants across all categories completed the admission process in 61 colleges (excluding St Stephen’s and Jesus and Mary) on the last day of admissions for the second list on Wednesday. The number is likely to increase as around over 7,500 students, whose applications were approved by the colleges, can pay fees and confirm admissions till Friday night. Around 35,500 students were admitted under the first cut-off list. This means, around 51,198 out of the 70,000 undergraduate seats available across DU colleges have been filled.According to the reservation policy of India, 50% of the total seats are reserved for other backward classes (OBC) (27%), SCs (15%), and STs (7.5%) in government educational institutions and government jobs. Last year, the Centre had also introduced a 10% EWS quota.According to official data of actual admissions (students paying the fee after approval), of the available 7,000 EWS seats, only 1,055 had been filled till Tuesday. Around 85% seats are still vacant. Similarly, of the available 5,250 seats for ST candidates, 1,103 have been filled. The situation is slightly better in the SC and OBC categories, with around 33% of seats having filled in each segment. Hansraj Suman, chairperson of DU’ SC, ST, and OBC teachers’ association, said a major reason behind this is the very high cut-off for reserved category students. “There is a marginal difference between general and EWS category students. The cut-offs for the SC, ST, and OBC categories are also high. The colleges should fix lower cut-offs for these categories to fill the seats,” he said.Zero admissions had taken place in the ST and EWS categories in several courses in many colleges in the first list. For instance, Lady Shri Ram (LSR) college did not have any EWS admission in 12 out of the available 22 courses and no ST admission in 14 courses, shows data available on the college’s website In Hansraj College, no EWS student enrolled in 12 out of 24 courses offered in the first list and no ST student took admission in at least 10 of these courses.Several colleges witnessed minimal admissions in the EWS and ST categories in the second cut-off list. For instance, Rajdhani college had no EWS admissions in 22 out of the 26 courses till Wednesday evening -- the last date to apply for the second cut-off -- and had only one across 26 courses in the ST category. Rajdhani college principal Rajesh Giri said, “We will take care while setting the third cut-off and will focus on filling the vacant seats in these categories.”Ramjas College had around 1,110 admissions by Wednesday. Of them, 590 were in the reserved categories -- 84 in ST and 19 in EWS. Principal Manoj Khanna said, “We have decent admissions in OBC, SC, and ST categories. In the upcoming cut-offs, we will focus on filling the EWS and remaining reserved seats.”DU’s dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said, “The university will assess the situation after five cut-off lists and in case seats in reserved categories still remain vacant, it will conduct special drives to fill them.”The third cut-off will be released on Saturday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/74-seats-filled-in-du-colleges-but-fewer-admissions-in-st-ews-categories/story-7za4sMNmPlogYOVRSeZ7CM.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||CS assault case: Court orders police to provide Kejriwal, Sisodia copy of witness statement||The Delhi high court on Wednesday set aside a sessions court order, allowing chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia to access the statement of one of the witnesses in the case related to alleged assault on former chief secretary Anshu Prakash in 2018.Justice Suresh Kait said, “It is the prime duty of the investigating agency to do free and fair investigation, and bring all the evidences collected in the notice of court without pick and choose.”It directed the trial court to consider statement of the chief minister’s former advisor, VK Jain, recorded on February 21, 2018 which is part of police’s records in the form of a “case diary’, and place on record at the time of passing the order.“The investigating agency has no power to appreciate the evidence, it rests with the court,” the judge said in his 37-page order.The court’s judgment came on a plea filed by Kejriwal and Sisodia, alleging that the prosecution(police) withheld Jain’s statement recorded on February 21, 2018, as it did not suit the prosecution’s case and helped in falsely implicating the petitioners.Appearing for the CM and his deputy, senior advocates N Hari Haran and Dayan Krishnan told the court that the copy of the statement ought to have been supplied to them as it is a part of the case diary. The senior counsels contended that even the statement of V K Jain dated May 9, 2018 which is part of the charge sheet says, “….in continuation of the statement dated 21.02.2018”, which shows that the police is concealing the facts.Appearing for the prosecution, standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra said the police in its status report had contended that Jain was called to the police station on February 21, 2018 and he was examined on that day, but no statement under section 161 Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was recorded.Jain’s statement under section 161 CrPC was recorded only on February 22, 2018 and May 9, 2018, it had told the high court.It said that there is some typographical error in the recording of the statements on May 9, and the statement was in continuation of February 22 and not February 21 as mentioned in the charge sheet.However, the court did not agree with these contentions, stating that trial court in its order July 24, 2019 had recorded that on perusal of case diary it shows that Jain was examined in the police station on February 21, 2018.The high court further said that while prosecution has completely denied that no statement was recorded on February 21, 2018, the case diary mentions that a statement was recorded on that date.“Thus, the stand of prosecution cannot be accepted which is contrary to their own record,” the high court said.The court also said the opinion of the trial court stating that since oral examination of Jain was recorded on February 21, 2018 as per the case diary, it cannot be provided to the accused, is “perverse”.“The aforementioned opinion, in my view, is perverse because of the reason that the statement dated February 21, 2018 is not oral but a written one and said statement has been mentioned in various other documents and …..”Following this, the court ordered that the statement be considered by the trial court during the framing of charges since it is a part of the case diary. The matter is listed in the lower court where the judge is hearing the arguments on framing of charges.The Delhi police had on February 20, 2018 filed a first information report (FIR) based on former chief secretary Anshu Prakash’s complaint, in which he had alleged that he was called by the Kejriwal’s advisor, VK Jain, for a midnight meeting to discuss release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi.Prakash said that he was manhandled and assaulted in the course of the meeting. Police filed the case after the chief secretary was examined by a team of doctors at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.The legislators and the senior minister of the Delhi government have denied the allegations. The party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has accused Prakash of making false allegations at the behest of the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cs-assault-case-court-orders-police-to-provide-kejriwal-sisodia-copy-of-witness-statement/story-Bi34fRroWm8XVg7YBjw8UL.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain bats for plasma therapy||New Delhi: Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that over 2,000 people have benefitted from plasma therapy in Delhi, a day after reports that Centre was considering to remove it from clinical management protocol for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), “A study done by ICMR and AIIMS did not see any breakthrough maybe. But our trial is underway and it is of course being done with the permission of ICMR. We have seen benefits of the therapy, with over 2,000 people having received convalescent plasma from our bank at ILBS. I have myself benefited from the therapy,” said Jain in an interaction with media. ICMR had conducted a pan-India study to determine the role of plasma therapy, and the Union health ministry had added it as one of the investigational therapies in the national protocol for treating Covid-19 patients.However, Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had said on Tuesday, “We have had discussions at the National Task Force (NTF) and we are discussing further with the Joint Monitoring Committee. This (plasma therapy) may be deleted from the national guidelines.”  The trial conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research across 39 sites for the effectiveness of the therapy in Covid-19 patients, showed that there were no difference in the proportion of patients who progressed to severe disease and those who died between the group that received convalescent plasma and the other who received standard care without plasma.Convalescent plasma therapy is a well-established method used to treat infections and autoimmune diseases. For Covid-19, a blood component called plasma that is rich in virus-fighting antibodies is taken from patients who have recovered and given to those still fighting the infection. AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the removal of the therapy from the protocol would be a “perfunctory act”. “To remove Convalescent Plasma Therapy from Clinical Management Protocol based on a single study (i.e. ICMR Trial) in which even antibody titers of the plasma were not taken into account is a perfunctory act — in a situation where no definitive therapy exists till date,” Chadha tweeted. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The world’s largest observational study on Convalescent Plasma Therapy conducted on 35,322 Covid patients by Mayo Clinic reported favorable outcomes with lower mortality in patients who received the therapy early in the course of disease with higher levels of antibodies,” he tweeted. The study by Mayo clinic shows that the seven-day mortality rate reduced in patients transfused within three days of diagnosis as compared to those who were given the therapy later, especially if the donor had high levels of antibodies.  Reviewing the effectiveness of the therapy, Dr Manish Soneja, additional professor in the department of medicine at AIIMS, said, “The PLACID trial from India shows that the results were pretty similar in the group that received plasma therapy and the group that was given standard care. There were some limitations of the study such as many of the patients who were given the therapy already had high levels of neutralising antibody (that prevents the spread of a particular virus, Sars-CoV-2 in this case) at admission. However, this replicates the real-life situation with the facility for testing for neutralising antibodies not available in most places.” “As for globally, a Chocrane (a library of collated medical evidence) that has looked at 19 studies shows that the therapy is not effective in reducing the all cause mortality. Improvement in clinical symptoms wasn’t really there,” he said. However, after ICMR had released the data from its trial Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) which is coordinating Delhi’s plasma trial said, “The ICMR study actually reconfirms the findings of our small study – it shows that the oxygen requirement went down in the patients who received plasma therapy, the duration for which they remained breathless reduced, and the group that received plasma tested negative for the virus quicker than the control group. What needs to be factored in is that the therapy was administered late, after two days of symptoms in most trial participant; it works best when given early. Also, many of the donors in the study did not have a high titre (concentration) of the neutralising antibodies,” Dr Sarin had said. “For the study, the all-cause mortality at 28-days has been considered, I think a shorter duration has to be chosen because mortality could be because of other complications as well,” he said. A large-scale study of 400 participants is currently underway at Lok Nayak hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in collaboration with ILBS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-health-minister-bats-for-plasma-therapy/story-vjIEA62swK9JVCvq90K0eK.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Covid positive woman goes missing from AIIMS||A 20-year-old woman allegedlry went missing after testing positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at AIIMS on October 18, police said on Wednesday, adding that her husband is also missing after filing a missing person’s complaint a day later. A case has been registered in connection with the incident and teams have been formed to trace the missing couple, they said. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the man filed the police complaint on October 19. He told the police that his wife went missing from the hospital after she was tested positive for Covid-19 and the AIIMS staff asked her to get herself admitted to the dedicated Covid facility. However, during the enquiry, police found the woman had left the hospital and reached her rented home in Zamrudpur in south Delhi, about which the husband knew, said the DCP. “The woman then left for her parental home in Morena in Madhya Pradesh. Despite knowing her whereabouts, her husband approached the police and cooked up the story. But when we found that he was lying, he also fled,” said DCP Thakur. A case has been registered under IPC section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) at the Greater Kailash Police Station. Thakur said that the man worked as a housekeeping staff in a restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-woman-goes-missing-from-aiims/story-rrDTGKdnQxROwkC16egexI.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Caution in the air as Durga Puja begins with symbolic rituals in Delhi||It was an emotional moment for Debashis Saha, chief coordinator of Safdarjung Enclave’s Matri Mandir Durga Puja, when at 6am on Wednesday, the temple priests began chanting verses to install the holy urn (‘kalash sthapana’), marking the beginning of this year’s Durga Puja.For decades, this ritual would be followed by lifting of the cloth covering the imposing idol of Goddess Durga after which worshippers would make a beeline for the next four days to get a glimpse of the deity.Every year, Delhi would see over 600 big or small Durga Puja pandals, which this year has been reduced to around 50 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. None of these pujas are a grand affair like previous years. There are no pandals, cultural performances or fairs. And no idols in majority of the places.“It is really unfortunate that there is no Durga Ma and we have only the kalash puja, which our committee has decided to do every morning till October 25 to keep the festive feeling alive. People’s health is more important. Otherwise, our pandal would always witness a footfall of thousands every day during the puja week,” he said.Instead of an idol, the committee has created a 12-feet artwork of Goddess Durga slaying the ‘Coronasur’ (the Corona devil).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith no mega festivities happening and people asked to view the live streaming of rituals on social media, many committees have decided to distribute whatever donations they have received to people worst hit by the lockdown.In fact, many puja committees did not do anything on Wednesday.Mrinal Kanti Biswas of the Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella body of 38 Durga puja committees in East Delhi, said it is probably for the first time that Durga Puja has become a private affair because only limited people are allowed.The size of the idols has also reduced. “Delhi used to have 16-feet or even 20-feet idols of Durga, but this time the maximum height will be just about five feet. Two metal tanks -- one at Mayur Vihar Phase 1 Kali Bari and the other at Purbasha Kali Bari IP Extension -- have been built for immersion in of idols in east Delhi,” he said.The Kali Bari Durga Puja at Mandir Marg is one of the rare places that has a mini-pandal, an idol and has kept it open for all visitors. But this will be without the usual fanfare such as food and stalls as per Delhi Disaster management authority rules.“Everyone is welcome, but no material offering will be accepted. Bhog will be served to members and those who give donations in packed boxes. Unlike other committees, we have not made it a members-only event. On Wednesday evening, we live streamed Durga Devi’s amantran (invite) ritual, though there were around 6-7 visitors and a group of dhaak players,” said Swapan Ganguly, general secretary of New Delhi Kali Bari.FOCUS ON RESTAURANTS AND MARKETSDelhi revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said teams have been formed in all 11 revenue districts to conduct surprise inspections at major points with chances of large congregations, with focus on temples, restaurants, markets, etc.“More than 100 teams in all revenue districts will monitor if Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is being followed. Venues that have permission to hold functions will be inspected to check if videography from the start to the end of the event, temperature checks and social distancing as per DDMA rules are being done. Each approved event will have a nodal officer from our revenue department deployed on the spot,” Gahlot said.The Delhi government’s excise department on Wednesday directed clubs, hotels, liquor shops and restaurants to ensure strict compliance of standard operating procedures (SOPs). The assistant commissioners (enforcement) has been asked to deploy teams to check compliance of SOPs at bars in hotels, clubs and restaurants, a senior excise official said.Also Read | PM Modi to celebrate Durga Puja with people of West Bengal via video conference on ThursdayThe Delhi Police said it apart from anti-terror and crowd-control measures, they directed their personnel to ensure all guidelines are followed.

As far as Covid-19 measures are concerned, the temple managements will ensure wearing of masks, proper markings, social distancing, signages, and regular announcements. Our staff will educate devotees also. Those found violating the norms will be prosecuted,” said DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Anti-terror apparatus and barricades will be placed at strategic locations. Police vehicles will make announcements, asking people to wear masks, maintain social distancing and wash hands.At crowded markets such as Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Lahori Gate, the police have taken measures in view of rising footfall. “Vehicles are not allowed in the Sadar Bazar market,” said DCP (north), Anto Alphonse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/caution-in-the-air-as-durga-puja-begins-with-symbolic-rituals-in-delhi/story-DjBBPwCA1Z3WZB36P48QbO.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: AQI rises slightly, may plunge to ‘very poor’ by weekend||With a rise in stubble burning in neighbouring states, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated slightly on Wednesday though remaining in the ‘poor’ zone. The Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin recorded the average air quality index (AQI) at 256, as against 223 the previous day.While the air quality is likely to improve marginally on Thursday with a change in wind direction, it is expected to plunge to ‘very poor’ over the weekend, government agencies said.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the share of stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana in PM 2.5 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) rose to 15% on Wednesday, as compared to 8% the previous day. “Air quality may improve by Thursday due to cleaner easterly wind intrusion. However, it is likely to deteriorate on October 23-24 on account of reduced wind speed and impact from stubble burning. Synergised stubble burning fire counts around Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring regions stood at 849. The Safar model estimate of stubble burning share in PM2.5 is 15% and is likely to reduce on Thursday owing to expected change in boundary layer wind direction,” the Safar forecast said.Also Read | Over 100,000 infants in India did not survive a month due to severe air pollution in 2019: ReportFumes from crop stubble burning in the northwest region travel to Delhi every winter, contributing to its pollution.According to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind direction is likely to change to northeasterly on Thursday and hence the impact from stubble burning may reduce. “We are expecting some deterioration in air quality with reduction in wind speed from October 23. The air quality may touch the lower end of very poor zone,” said VK Soni, head of the environment monitoring research centre of IMD.IMD scientists said the average wind speed is likely to remain around 8-10 kmph and may even reduce further over the next 3-4 days. Slow winds and a drop in temperature are not favourable for dispersion of pollutants.The minimum temperature on Wednesday settled at 14.3 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. The maximum temperature was 35.2 degrees C, two notches above normal.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded the lowest minimum temperature for October in more than a decade, dipping to 13.7 degrees C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-aqi-rises-slightly-may-plunge-to-very-poor-by-weekend/story-5Uuy1lIsgHSodxTlqYmKNP.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Housing rights expert group submits report, recommends in-situ rehabilitation of railway slum residents||As uncertainty continues over the fate of nearly 250,000 residents of slum clusters on railway land in Delhi, the Delhi Housing Rights Task Force (DHRT), a group of experts on housing rights, has come out with a comprehensive rehabilitation plan, after consultation with the affected residents, and recommended in-stu rehabilitation to prevent loss of livelihoods.The report has also stressed on the need to survey all affected residents and said no resident should be displaced during the ongoing Coivd-19 pandemic. The DHRFT has submitted the plan to the Delhi government and the Railways, which are working on a plan to remove nearly 48,000 slum dwellings erected on railway land in Delhi. A senior official of the Delhi government’s Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), aware of the development, said, “We have got the report from DHRTF in which they have given their point of view and made a few suggestions. But a final decision has to be taken by the Railways as it is the land owning agency. We have offered our flats. We have already started the maintenance work on these flats.”The Supreme Court, in an order on August 31, had directed the removal of 48,000 slums along railway tracks in the national capital within three months. But in September, the Centre told the apex court that discussions were underway to implement the order and ruled out immediate evictions of residents from these clusters. The court was to hear the matter after four weeks—a date is to be fixed yet.Land rights activists say the Railways has not held any meetings with residents. Shakeel Ahmed, member of DHRFT, said, “We are not aware what the Railways is planning to do. It has not contacted the residents of these clusters so far. We want the government to hear the residents before deciding their fate.”DUSIB, the nodal agency for slum redevelopment, said it has sent a letter to the Railways regarding vacant houses available with the board. Bipin Rai, member, DUSIB, said, “We have written to the Railways saying we can provide housing for 45,000 families by next year. We have some flats vacant that can be provided to displaced residents on payment. But there is no response from the Railways so far.”When contacted, the Northern Railway spokesperson said, “The work is in progress. All stakeholders are being consulted while drawing up of the plan.” When asked about the plan submitted by DHRTF and the Delhi government’s letter, the spokesperson refused comment on both matters.Shivani Chaudhry, executive director, Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN), an organisation that works with housing and land rights of marginalised communities, said, “The DHRTF proposal has been submitted to the Railways and the Delhi government. In-situ rehabilitation must be prioritised. Moving people to remote resettlement sites will only adversely impact their access to livelihood and education, and result in increased distress and human rights violations.”Subodh Bind, a resident of a slum cluster near Old Delhi Railway station, said, “The biggest worry is of losing our livelihood. We currently work at the nearby market. If we are forced to leave this place and shifted to Bawana or Narela, how will we earn a livelihood? Although we live near the tracks, a wall separates our houses from the tracks.”The 11-page DHRTF report states that “a comprehensive survey must be done to see how many households fall in the safety zone (the area within 30 metres of the track), and in how many are outside the safety zone. This survey must have the active participation of all affected residents.”Chaudhry said the government agencies should map vacant land available nearby. “There is a need to work together to map vacant land in the vicinity of affected settlements to determine where alternative housing can be provided. No one should be forced to move against their will, and no relocation should be carried out during the pandemic,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/housing-rights-expert-group-submits-report-recommends-in-situ-rehabilitation-of-railway-slum-residents/story-D5I5i1fxRHd7TgTa3ntrkM.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||JNU allows phased entry for PhD scholars, staff in science schools and special centres||Jawaharlal Nehru University on Wednesday announced that the university would reopen in a phased manner from November 2 for final-year PhD scholars and project staff who require laboratory access, only in science schools and special centres. The decision comes three days after JNU students’ union leaders camped at the north gate of the campus as a part of an indefinite round-the-clock sit-in to demand phased entry of research scholars. A small area inside the campus has been barricaded by the students. “Final-year PhD research scholars, including 9B students, who require to enter the campus (day scholars) for access to laboratories and to submit their PhD thesis on or before December 31, 2020 or before June 30, 2021 and project staff in science schools and centres, are allowed,” registrar Pramod Kumar said. Kumar said the decision was taken since science students need the laboratory. “The library will remain closed and students with humanities background can work on their research at home while accessing the e-resources we have made available for them,” he said.While day scholars can enter the campus from November 2, hostellers will have to wait longer. In the notice, Kumar said a phased reopening for final-year PhD research scholars, including those who had received 9B extension -- only in science schools and centres -- would be allowed from November 16. Student leaders were not completely happy with the move. “This is concerning because research scholars with a non-science background, who are hostellers, would still not be able to access the campus,” Saket Moon, JNUSU vice-president, said. Also Read | 2 former students of JNU set to make electoral debut in Bihar assembly pollsEarlier in the day, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said, “During our meeting with the dean of students and chief security officer over the matter, we made it clear to the officials, particularly DoS, that there should be no discrimination between streams in the re-entry of research scholars and those with submissions of all courses must be immediately allowed to return.” Shivam Chaurasia, president of the JNU unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, said, “We have been giving representations and memorandums and it is only now that the administration has allowed day scholars and hostel-residing final-year science scholars to access their respective laboratories. We want a phased-wise return of each and every student and we are not going to relent on this demand.” The Central library, canteen, and dhabas will remain closed during the two phases of reopening and the Aarogya Setu app has been made mandatory for students and all employees. Students have also been asked to undergo “self-quarantine” for seven days after arrival in Delhi from outstation or before entering the university and submit a self-declaration form as well. Deans and chairpersons have been given three days to submit their plan of action on the matter and constitute a school or central-level monitoring committee to ensure Covid-19 protocols are implemented. They have also been asked to prepare a list of students and staff who need to access libraries and submit it to the administration. A roster of students using the lab will be maintained at all times to ensure social distancing.For over a month now, the JNUSU has been demanding a phased entry for research scholars into the campus, citing the Union home ministry guidelines released in August and September. Both the guidelines said research scholars and postgraduate students of technical and professional courses requiring labs can be allowed to visit the campus-based on an assessment of the situation. Earlier this month, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had ordered a “status quo” on all permitted activities in the capital – meaning higher education institutes would remain out of bounds. While JNU students who had gone back home during the Covid-19 lockdown were not allowed to return due to the increasing number of cases on the campus, those at DU had it easier with the university allowing a phased entry of its research scholars requiring lab work in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jnu-allows-phased-entry-for-phd-scholars-staff-in-science-schools-and-special-centres/story-RajKJKezyqUUALYc3BMr3J.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Released on parole during Covid-19 lockdown, murder convict kills another man||A 42-year-old man, who was sentenced to life in jail for a murder but granted parole in April this year during the government’s bid to decongest jails owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, was rearrested on Tuesday morning for allegedly killing a 25-year-old after a gambling dispute.The incident took place in south Delhi’s Tughlakabad village in the early hours of Tuesday, police said while identifying the suspect as Vishwajeet alias Chacha.Police said Vishwajeet was among the 4000 inmates who were released from various jails (on special parole) as a step to decongest them in the city as the Covid-19 pandemic peaked. Vishwajeet was rearrested on Tuesday along with the knife allegedly used in the crime. A case of murder was registered against him at the Govindpuri police station, with police claiming that the suspect being previously involved in six cases of dacoity and for crimes under the Arms act, apart from having served time in jail for a decade-old murder in Chittaranjan Park. Police officials associated with the probe said that Tuesday’s murder took place around 3am over Rs 70,000 that the victim, Vicky Gupta, won while gambling (playing cards) with his brother Kuldeep Gupta, Vishwajeet, and their friend Raja near a forested area in Tughlakabad village. “Vishwajeet accused Vicky of cheating during the game and demanded the money that he had lost back. An argument ensued and Vishwajeet took out a knife, stabbed Vicky in his chest in a fit of rage and fled,” a senior police officer associated with the case said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Kumar Gyanesh said the murder came to their notice around 5 am on Tuesday, after Kuldeep informed the police about it. “The injured man was rushed to Safdarjung hospital by his brother where he was declared brought dead,” said Gyanesh, adding that a murder case was registered on the statement of prime witness Kuldeep, who is an auto rickshaw driver by profession. As Vishwajeet was absconding, teams from Govindpuri police station conducted raids. “We caught Vishwajeet in the evening from one of his hideouts in Govindpuri. The murder weapon, a knife, was also seized from him,” the officer said.

Like other prisoners who got paroles under similar circumstances, Vishwajeet’s conditional freedom was also being extended,” added the investigator. After coming out of jail, Vishwajeet had opened a roadside eatery near CR Park, police said. On Tuesday, the Delhi high court had said that they were contemplating to end the blanket extension of interim bail and special parole for prisoners who were released during the lockdown to decongest the prison. The high court had observed that only three prisoners from around 12,000 were currently infected with Covid-19 and that their release was only a stop-gap measure at the start of the lockdown. Around 4,000 prisoners from Delhi’s three jails have been released and their parole/bails has been extended multiple times. Prisoners who had “good conduct” in jail or were caught for non-heinous crimes or were not involved in heinous cases such as terror acts, rape with murder and cheating were eligible for release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-out-on-parole-nabbed-for-murder-in-tughlakabad-village/story-bBIisMFQjtfGxLmVW2mNuK.html
22-10-2020||Delhi||Placards, roses at traffic signals on Day 1 of govt campaign against pollution||Dinesh Singh,25, stood at the ITO traffic signal at 8am on Wednesday, with a placard reading, “yudh pradushan ke viruddh” (war against pollution). As vehicles stopped at the red light, Singh signalled them to pull down their window, handed them a rose and urged them to turn-off their vehicle’s ignition while they waited for the light to turn green. Hundreds of environment marshals like Singh were deployed at 100 traffic signals across the national capital on Wednesday -- the first day of Delhi government’s awareness campaign, ‘red light on, gaadi off’ (red light on, ignition off) to reduce levels of vehicular emissions in the national capital. “We are a team of around 15, manning the intersection. Once the red light goes on, we hold up placards reminding drivers to turn off the ignition of their cars and motorcycles. Most of the people stopping here happily complied to our request,” Singh said. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal encouraged people to participate in the campaign and contribute towards bringing the city’s pollution levels down, which tend to spike and reach alarming levels every winter. “The people of Delhi have achieved a great feat. Last year, they helped reduce pollution levels by 25%. Let us all come together again to fight pollution. Please participate in the ‘red light on, gaadi off’ campaign. War against pollution,” Kejriwal tweeted on Tuesday. To encourage more and more people to participate in the campaign, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai also reached the ITO signal to speak to the environment marshals and drivers on the importance of turning the ignition off while waiting at red lights. “Till now Delhi government and various agencies were involved in the war against pollution, today we are reaching out to two crore(20 million) people of Delhi to participate in this fight,” Rai said. He said that the fight against pollution can only be won if the government and the citizens come together in taking all the necessary steps needed to control pollution sources. Also Read | India recorded highest air pollution exposure globally in 2019: ReportGovernment estimates show that if all commuters participate in this campaign across the city, which is a voluntary exercise, then the pollution levels can be reduced by 15-20%. “This campaign will run till November 15. We have invited all the MPs, MLAs, councillors, trade organisations and private employers to join this campaign. We are also in touch with eco clubs and resident welfare associations (RWAs), which can in turn encourage more people to practice this,” he added. Chaitali Sinha, a commuter who had stopped at the Tilak Marg signal, said turning off the ignition of vehicles was a behavioural change, and people should stand with the government in their initiative. “I think Delhiites are not really used to turning ignition off because we live in a climate which is hot and sultry most of the year and it becomes difficult to wait at the signal without the air conditioner. But the winters are the perfect time to do this and one small step can go a long way (in fighting pollution),” Sinha said.  However, there were some who were not convinced about the efficacy of the initiative. “Instead of inconveniencing people, the government should first do their bit in reducing pollution. Garbage is being burnt openly and illegal industries are operating on the outskirts, and most importantly there is still no solution to stubble burning in the other states. Just one person switching off engine (of his vehicle) for a few seconds is not going to yield any benefits,” said Sudharshan Kaul. A Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) official said while ‘idling’, keeping the ignition on while the vehicle is not moving, might not yield immediate results. This is a good practice to follow, which will be beneficial in the long run. Also Read | Staff crunch threatens to derail pollution fight in Delhi“A lot of factors play a role in bringing down the city’s pollution levels, and the most important at this time of the year is weather. We will not be able to see a visible effect of this campaign immediately but vehicular emission is a primary source of pollution in Delhi-NCR and these are the steps that will help in the long run,” the official said, on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/placards-roses-at-traffic-signals-on-day-1-of-govt-campaign-against-pollution/story-7nxh8uCeWaYRLONc4udwNP.html

Residents of the Uruli Devachi area are not allowing the civic body to bring in garbage to the depot, protesting, among other things, the lack of a proper means of disposal at the site. At Ramtekdi, a 200 metric tonne garbage processing plant is lying idle due to technical issues. As a result, garbage is not being lifted from several areas in the city and has been collecting for weeks now. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol held an all-party closed-door meeting on Wednesday evening, after which, one of the attendees at the meeting, requesting anonymity, said that the administration promised to sort out the garbage issue in a day’s time and if needed, take police bandobast to transport the garbage to Uruli Devachi. Republican Party leader Siddharth Dhende who was present at the meeting, said, “Additional municipal commissioner Shantanu Goyal promised that the administration is discussing the matter with the police. If needed, with police protection, garbage would be sent to the garbage depot.”Municipal commissioner VIkram Kumar said, “The administration started a dialogue with residents of Uruli Devachi and we hope the issue gets sorted out soon.

The facility will run on 9 new routes in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad areas. While the official launch of the service will be done on Saturday by the state BJP president Chandrakant Patil, the service will start from Dussehra (October 25). “All our services for public were stopped, except for emergency staff and requirements, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are slowly restarting our facilities and have launched “ATAL” to attract commuters and reduce overlapping bus schedules. In the route rationalisation process and by the inputs taken by our depot managers, staff, drivers and conductors, commuters and NGOs it was found that there are several routes which are overlapping. Feeder buses are needed for short distance, high frequency and less fare. So, we decided to work on the project and came up with 9 new routes in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas, where 233 midi buses will run under the plan,” said PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap. “The buses will run in 5 to maximum 6 km route, and the ticket fare will by Rs 5 and the frequency of these buses will be 5 minutes. We expect more commuters to avail this facility and help in generating more revenue. In future, we are going to take this feeder bus service project for metro services too for those using metro to travel by our buses to their nearby destinations. We will review our project for next three months and upgrade or change as per feedback from passengers and other stakeholders,” said Jagtap. Jagtap was accompanied by Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol and PMPML director Shankar Pawar at the press meet. ‘“This new bus service will be beneficial for common public and they can travel fast within nearby areas. The official inauguration of this service will be done on October 24, Saturday, by BJP state president Chandrakant Patil and it will officially run on Dussehra. I appeal to all Punekars to take advantage of this bus service and travel safely.” said Mohol.

22-10-2020||Delhi||Pollution rising? Warrior moms are here to fight against bad air days||“Come July, and my kids would start wheezing, catch allergies if they are out for too long. Unlike bad water and polluted grounds, the effects of polluted air are not immediately visible. This pandemic has also proven that people who have respiratory issues find it hard to cope with the infection. It’s high time we fight for better breathing rights for our future generations,” says Bhavreen Kandhari, a Delhi-based environmentalist, and mother to twin daughters. She is also a member of Warrior Moms — a pan-India initiative of environmentally conscious mothers who are fighting against air pollution and other environmental issues. There are more than 1,000 women engaging with the team on a pan India scale, with numbers increasing every day. But, why the name Warrior Moms? Kandhari says it’s because they are now operating on a war scale, and explains that “Mothers will go to all ends of the world for the benefit of their children. The name is a reflection of that commitment. I shiver to think as a mother that I’m packing cigarettes instead of lunch boxes in the school bag; the air our child breathes could be equal to smoking up to 20 cigarettes a day! It is a national emergency.” During the lockdown and even in phases of unlock, the pollution levels reduced drastically, thus allowing Delhi-NCR residents to breathe in peace. “This is a chance for us to reflect upon the lifestyle choices we make, and also question the government’s decisions that have made the air unbreathable prior to lockdown,” says Anuja Bali Karthikeyan, a Warrior Mom from Pune. Sherebanu Frosh, a Gurugram-based Warrior Mom who is one of the 50 women at the core of this collective, says, “Coming together and raising voices has always been the only way to make a difference. We felt that if mothers understood the implications of air pollution on their children, they would rise and fight for solutions.” WHO has pointed out that children, especially below five years, are more vulnerable than ever to the harmful effects of air pollution. Gurugram-based Warrior Mom, Dr Sarika Verma, an ENT surgeon by profession, agrees to this, and says, “We have taken up this cause because we feel authorities are not effectively dealing with this menace. The number of cases of children who now need nebulisers to breathe properly, has increased manifold in Delhi and nearby areas. But our fight isn’t limited to air pollution. We will be championing the cause of waste management, oppose indiscriminate tree felling, and demand cleaner fuel for vehicles among other key issues.” Talking about the need for appropriate policies to drive a sustained change, Frosh adds that the group is aiming for social media campaigns and conversations with a wider reach. She adds, “Our mission is to push the change in technologies and policies, which are needed to get to a zero emission and AQI 60, for the sake of our children.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallika Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pollution-rising-warrior-moms-are-here-to-fight-against-bad-air-days/story-hvMsQsMfmKfQqttDjTpgqM.html
22-10-2020||Chandigarh||Paddy procurement: Haryana’s paddy farmers, arhtiyas await payment||The government has failed to make good on its promise of paying all commission agents and farmers within 72 hours of paddy procurement. With the festive and sowing season round the corner, the delay has caused consternation among farmers and agricultural workers. Government agencies have already procured around 30 lakh tonnes or 50% of the 60 lakh tonne target. A farmer, Madan Lal of Indri, Karnal, says, “I sold paddy worth ₹3.5 lakh to the government and am still awaiting payment. I had to borrow money on interest to pay the labourers.” Another aggrieved farmer, Ramesh Kumar of Yamunanagar, says, “I had sold my produce to the government two weeks ago but am yet to be paid. I had opted for direct payment and so I cannot even take money from the arhtiya.” Farmers and arhtiyas have been frequenting the local-level officials of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board to enquire about the delay. “Payment of around ₹2 crore is pending with government agencies but it is not clear when the money will be transferred to our accounts, “ says Sohan Lal, a commission agent from Ladwa grain market of Kurukshetra.₹190 crore payment being processed, say officials Mandi secretaries have taken up the issue with the higher officers. They have been told that the payment was being processed and will reach their accounts in a day or two.“I took up the issue of delayed payments with senior officers and they said payment of around ₹30 crore for our mandi was under process. However, paddy worth ₹400 crore has been procured from this mandi and ₹30 crore is a meagre amount,” said a Kurukshetra mandi secretary, requesting anonymity. Food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department additional chief secretary PK Das said he was on leave and unable to provide the information requested.Officials of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board said one of the key reasons for the delay in payments was glitches between I-Form generation and approval. They say the issue was being sorted out and ₹190 crore will be disbursed among farmers and arhtiyas soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paddy-procurement-haryana-s-paddy-farmers-arhtiyas-await-payment/story-4yn5ai32RzG00QBwyQKTnM.html
22-10-2020||Competitive||JEE 100 percentile scorer Delhi-based boy says: Belief in myself was my biggest motivator||“We all have the capability to perform and achieve what we dream of. The need is to put immense energy to work for it,” says Tushar Sethi, who is one of the five candidates from the Capital to score a 100 percentile and bag the all India 10th rank in Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains. For every achiever, there’s a motivation, and for Sethi, it was his “confidence in his abilities”. The 18-year-old Delhi-boy says, “My belief in myself was my biggest motivator to achieve my goal! Over and above this, the constant motivation and everlasting support from my mentors and my teachers, at my coaching and school, empowered me. To motivate myself, I used to read and follow quotes of great people like Swami Vivekananda, Harivansh Rai Bacchhan and many more.”Students attempting entrance exams during the pandemic have had to face quite a few challenges right from the overwhelming lockdown to travelling safe to the examination centre, and the postponement of exam dates. But Sethi didn’t see these factors as obstacles. “Difficulty comes when one feels there’s an obstacle. I regarded lockdown as an opportunity for betterment. Instead of feeling low about things getting postponed because of the pandemic, I got guided by my teachers and mentors to use the extra time in working more efficiently,” he says. Sethi, a student of Bal Bharati Public School, Rohini took a four-year classroom program from a coaching institute to prepare for his exam, and continued to take online classes during the lockdown. “My coaching institute, Vidyamandir Classes coped with the sudden lockdown smoothly, and classes continued virtually. Initially it was a bit unusual to switch to online classes, but with continued effort everything got normal. My family was there at all times to take care of my health and wellness, and they adjusted to my schedule of online classes.”Come to talk of anxiety on the day of the exam, and Sethi advises that every student must ease out the tension or stress. “Follow your teachers and mentors. Be true to yourself and plan your schedule well. Convert your weaknesses into your strength through practice and persistence. In my opinion all this helps build the confidence that prepares oneself for the D-day. Many a times, I found stress as a push and an opportunity to give a better performance.”At a time when most youngsters from his generation are hooked to grammimg their #OOTD, how did Sethi stay away from the distractions such as social media? “We all have heard of words like focus and dedication, but deploying them in day to day routine, questioning ourself before starting any task by asking if it will aid in my journey or not, and keeping distance from social media are things that play a key role in ones’ preparation and subsequently in one’s success,” says a gleaming Sethi, who is happy with what he has achieved.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/entrance-exam/jee-100-percentile-scorer-delhi-based-boy-says-belief-in-myself-was-my-biggest-motivator/story-lF2WN8Ck6695Vuoik093BK.html

A pledging conference for more funds co-hosted by the UK, US, EU and the UNHCR is scheduled for Thursday. The Foreign Office said that nearly 860,000 Rohingya live in overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, without formal education or work opportunities. Coronavirus has made the situation in the packed and unsanitary camps even more desperate.The funding is intended to provide hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people with food, healthcare, water and sanitation, as well as care and counselling for those traumatised by violence. It will also improve access to education for 50,000 young people, as well as create isolation and treatment centres for people suffering from coronavirus.Raab said: “The people living in Cox’s Bazar face unimaginable hardship and many have been victims of violence. We have imposed sanctions on the perpetrators of this brutality, and this new funding will save lives in the camp and help Bangladesh become more resilient to disasters such as coronavirus.”“Today I urge the world not to turn away from the Rohingya’s suffering and to take the action necessary to allow them to safely return to the homes they fled in terror.”The Foreign Office added that according to UN estimates, $1 billion is needed this year to help Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh but so far, less than half of that has been raised.Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya reportedly left Myanmar in 2017 to escape violence. Since then, the UK has imposed sanctions on two generals in the Myanmar military, as recommended by a UN independent investigation, which found them responsible for atrocities which amount to ethnic cleansing.Thursday’s announcement brings the total UK aid commitment to the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh close to £300 million, including £37.5 million to provide humanitarian assistance in Cox’s Bazar and £10mn in support for Bangladesh to help the country respond to coronavirus and natural disasters such as flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-turn-away-from-rohingya-s-plight-uk-urges-world/story-VUactqCtwrnro9k5riEgDK.html

They stand disadvantaged to determine the floor vote either in the Republican-dominated chamber, even with a few defections.Lacking in numbers, Democrats have sought to characterise Barrett’s nomination as an attempt by President Donald Trump and his congressional allies to change the ideological balance of the court with the aim of striking down health care and abortion and helping him stay in office if the outcome of the November 3 election is disputed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-moves-ahead-with-confirmation-process-of-sc-judge-barrett/story-JiIYc5Pkqrg5BzOnec4fgM.html

A major crisis erupted in the country, with the police in the Sindh province putting up a determined fight against the all-powerful military for “kidnapping” Sindh IGP Mushtaq Mehr, during Awan’s arrest saga. Interior Ministry is being blamed for orchestrating the arrest of Safdar Awan and kidnapping of Mushtaq Mehr as Rangers, which is a paramilitary federal law enforcement organization, operates directly under the authority of the Interior Secretary of Pakistan. The move to force the Sindh IGP to register an FIR against Safdar and PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz may be the brainchild of Izaj Shah, the Interior Minister who also controls the Rangers, sources said. “No political leader in a democratic system could be allowed to target national institutions in the name of freedom of expression,” The News International quoted Shah as saying.While talking to a private news channel, he said action should be taken against PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif for his anti-state narrative.Shah, a former Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) operator, who is often criticised for policies and support for terrorists, may have thought that his move would create a divide between the Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz).Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan government is seemed to be shaken up by the anti-government rally in Karachi where political parties under the banner of joint opposition alliance---Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-- protested against the ‘puppet’ government. Thousands of people participated in the rally in Karachi.Following the rally, Maryam’s husband Safdar Awan was arrested from his hotel room. Safdar has now been released on bail.Almost all police officers in Sindh Police applied for leave in protest against the humiliation meted out to the Sindh IGP Mushtaq Mehr, during the PML-N leader Safdar Awan’s arrest saga.PML-N leader and spokesman for Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz’s and former Sindh Governor Muhammad Zubair said that the IGP Sindh was ‘kidnapped’ by Rangers who forced him to file an FIR for Safdar’s arrest.Brigadier Shah who was appointed as interior minister in 2018 by Prime Minister Imran Khan, remains a highly controversial figure in Pakistan.Former Prime Minister and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto had named Shah in a letter as someone who should be investigated if she was assassinated. After her assassination, the PPP accused Brig Shah of having links with Al Qaeda and Taliban, The News International reported.Shah continued to be Pakistan’s former military dictator Pervez Musharraf’s trusted aide even after he was ousted. Gen Musharraf had nominated Shah as High Commissioner to Australia, but Canberra refused to accept his nomination, forcing the government to withdraw it.

We are in touch with the labourers also for getting them the assistance needed, at the earliest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Somalia has assured that arrangements will be made for these people to visit India soon,” the Commission tweeted in Hindi on Wednesday in reply to a tweet by activist Rajesh Mani. Rajesh Mani of Manav Seva Sansthan said 33 Indian labourers, including 25 workers from Uttar Pradesh, have been held hostage by a company in Somalia for the last eight months. He said the matter came to his knowledge after a labourer from Kushinagar district contacted him.The activist said he took to Twitter to contact the Indian High commission in Kenya to seek help. “I contacted the Indian High Commission in Kenya and the external affairs ministry through Twitter and e-mail. They gave assurance of helping the labourers,” he said.Mani said out of the 33 labourers held hostage, 21 belong to Gorakhpur division. Six of the labourers are from Bihar and one each from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, he said. According to the activist, the labourers had joined the company 10 months ago. In the first two months, the company treated them well, but from the last eight months, the workers were not paid their salaries, he said. “On Tuesday, one Sugreev Kushwaha of Kushinagar contacted me through WhatsApp, and told me that 33 Indian labourers were living in difficult conditions as the company at Mogadishu in Somalia, where they were working, had made them hostage in the factory campus. He said they have not been paid from the last eight months. He also sent me a video clip showing their condition,” Mani said.“When the labourers demanded their salary, the company made them hostage inside the factory campus, took their passports and threatened to shoot them. They have also not been given food, water and medicines since the last 15 days. The labourers have been confined to their rooms and kept hungry and thirsty.

And it didn’t respond to questions about why it allowed the comments to be aired now in the documentary “Francesco,” which premiered Wednesday.In the movie, which was shown at the Rome Film Festival, Francis said gay people have the right to be in a family since they are “children of God.”“You can’t kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this,” the pope said. “What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.”Those comments caused a firestorm, thrilling progressives and alarming conservatives, given official Vatican teaching prohibits any such endorsement of homosexual unions.While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favour of legal protections for civil unions as pope, and no pontiff before him had, either.One of Francis’ top communications advisers, the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, insisted the pope’s comments were old news, saying they were made during a May 2019 interview with Mexican broadcaster Televisa.“There’s nothing new because it’s a part of that interview,” Spadaro told The Associated Press as he exited the premiere. “It seems strange that you don’t remember.”But Televisa didn’t air those comments when it broadcast the interview — nor did the Vatican when it put out its recordings of it. The broadcaster has not commented on the intrigue.The Vatican frequently edits the pope in official transcripts and videos, especially when he speaks on sensitive issues. Yet some version of the footage was apparently available in the Vatican archives, which were opened to filmmaker Evgeny Afineevsky.Televisa has not confirmed that the comments were made during its interview, but the scene of the documentary is identical to the Televisa interview, including the yellow background, a chair in the corner and slightly off-center placement of the chain of Francis’ pectoral cross.The official 2019 Vatican News transcript of that interview, as well as the official Vatican edit, contains no such comment on the need for legal protections for civil unions. The official edit does include his comments on the need for gay people to feel they are part of a family, as he has said previously.Further muddying the waters is the fact that Afineevsky, when pressed by reporters late Wednesday, said the pope made the comments to him directly, through a translator, but declined to say when.When The Associated Press interviewed Afineevsky on Oct. 14, the director was asked if he realized at the time that Francis’ comments were going to grab headlines.Afineevsky dodged the question about the origin of the quote and seemed to not appreciate its significance. But he said that he hoped journalists would take more away from the film.“If journalists will be focusing on this movie only on that, then it will be a pity,” he said. “But I think that’s one of the issues that our world needs to understand, that we’re all equal.”The head of the Vatican communications branch, Paolo Ruffini, refused to speak to reporters who attended an award ceremony Thursday in the Vatican gardens for Afineevsky, and the director himself kept his distance.The Catholic Church teaches that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.” A 2003 document from the Vatican’s doctrine office stated the church’s respect for gay people “cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.”Doing so, the Vatican reasoned, would not only condone “deviant behavior,” but create an equivalence to marriage, which the church holds is an indissoluble union between man and woman.That document was signed by the then-prefect of the office, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and Francis’ predecessor.Afineevsky, who is gay, had expressed surprise after the premiere that the pope’s comments had created such a stir, saying Francis wasn’t trying to change doctrine but was merely expressing his belief gay people should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals.On Thursday, he declined to take any further questions and sought to put attention on the main issues dealt with in the film: climate change, refugees and poverty.“I am so proud that finally ‘Francesco’ is on its way to the road to change hearts and minds,” he said at the prize ceremony in the Vatican gardens. “Finally, I am happy that I can bring voices from the Rohingya refugees, refugees from Syria, the voices of victims of sexual abuse, voices from different points from different corners of the world.”(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

22-10-2020||World||Human rights group says Lebanon probe into Beirut port blast flawed||A leading international human rights group on Thursday said a Lebanon-led probe into the devastating port explosion in Beirut this summer has been marred by political meddling and lack of judicial independence, resulting in failure to yield credible results two months later.Human Rights Watch called for a United Nations-led inquiry into the causes of the blast to determine responsibility. The New York-based watchdog called on international supporters of Lebanon, lead by France, meeting next week to press the Lebanese authorities to accept an independent probe.The massive Aug. 4 blast killed nearly 200 people and injured more than 6,000 when some 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical, detonated at Beirut’s port. It also devastated several neighbourhoods, shattering thousands of residential, historic and other buildings.“Everyone in Beirut has had their life turned upside down by the catastrophic explosion that devastated half the city, and they deserve justice for the disaster inflicted on them,” said Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher at HRW. “The Lebanese authorities’ failings over the past two months have shown that an international investigation is the only avenue for the people of Lebanon to get the answers and the justice that they deserve. “ It is still not known what ignited the chemicals, which were stored at the facility for six years. Local media say that 25 people have been detained and 30 charged in the explosion, mostly port and customs officials.Majzoub said authorities are pretending to carry out a credible investigation — pointing to fundamental weakness and flaws in the process she called “opaque.” The probe began with political wrangling over the naming of the lead investigator, included military threats to jail leakers and raised concerns over whether the panel appointed along sectarian lines could be fully impartial.HRW said the role of foreign investigators was unclear, calling on France and the United States to clarify their mandate and “make public any attempts to obstruct justice.” Earlier this month, the judge investigating the explosion received a report from the FBI about the bureau’s own probe, but no details have emerged from it. The French and British have yet to present their own findings.Majzoub said there was no transparency in sharing evidence or charges, while no senior official was named in the probe. Reports showed government officials at the highest level were informed of the dangerous chemicals in the port.HRW said the focus on administrative port and customs officials raises concerns that politicians suspected of being implicated in the blast may escape accountability. There were also concerns of possible tampering with the crime scene, following the eruption of two fires at the port since the explosion in September.Families of the dead and survivors of the blast called on the UN Security Council for an international investigation, but Lebanese officials rejected such calls as a “waste of time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-rights-group-says-lebanon-probe-into-beirut-port-blast-flawed/story-x6ehJMaxlxCwL7JDQ7PmEO.html

22-10-2020||World||Edward Snowden granted permanent residency in Russia||Fugitive US whistleblower Edward Snowden has been granted permanent residency in Russia, his lawyer said on Thursday.Snowden, the former US intelligence contractor who revealed in 2013 that the US government was spying on its citizens, has been living in exile in Russia since the revelations.The 37-year-old has said he would like to return to the United States.His lawyer Anatoly Kucherena told AFP on Thursday that his residency permit was extended and is now indefinite, a situation made possible by recent changes to Russia’s immigration law. Kucherena said the application was filed in April but the process was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.Snowden is wanted in the United States on espionage charges after he leaked information showing that agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) were collecting telephone records of millions of US citizens. When asked whether Snowden planned to apply for Russian citizenship, Kucherena said: “He will make the decision himself.” Kucherena said it was “natural” that Snowden wanted to return to the United States but will only do so when the case against him is closed.Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump said he would “take a look” at pardoning Snowden but has not made further comment on the matter. A 2015 petition calling on then president Barack Obama to pardon the whistleblower and privacy advocate was rejected by the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/edward-snowden-granted-permanent-residency-in-russia/story-V61l76Q9rbTnJorbkBeP0K.html

He said four vaccines of China are currently in phase three clinical trial stage.Also Read: Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro rejects Chinese vaccine against Covid“Chinese vaccines R&D indeed spoken off highly by various countries,” he said, adding that China is also part of COVAX, the World Health Organisation’ alliance to equitably distribute Covid-19 vaccines around the world. Bolsonaro said the Chinese vaccine has not yet completed testing, which is the case with all potential vaccines for the virus. “My decision is to not purchase such a vaccine.” Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus.It has had nearly 5.3 million confirmed cases - the third-highest tally in the world after the US and India - and is second only to the US in terms of deaths, with nearly 155,000 registered so far, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.Bolsonaro’s decision came as a dampener for China’s push to use its vaccines as a diplomatic tool to enhance its global image with the supply of coronavirus vaccines to especially developing countries. However, Zhao said that China is “committed that once deployed and put into use our vaccines will be for the global public good.” “China will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of the vaccines in developing countries”, he said, adding that China and Brazil have seen sound cooperation in Covid-19 control. “We believe that such cooperation will contribute to our final and absolute victory over the virus in China, Brazil and around the world,” he said.Brazil’s decision on Sinovac followed Bangladesh’s decision to stall the phase-3 trial after the Chinese firm asked the Bangladeshi government to co-finance it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-its-covid-vaccine-after-brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-s-guinea-pig-jibe/story-1O1Ccb0SrQPf6vx609GDJP.html
22-10-2020||World||As UK Covid cases surge, Rishi Sunak extends wage bill support||Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday again extended and expanded schemes to support employees, companies and the self-employed over the next six months, as more areas in England went into the highest alert level following a surge in Covid-19 cases.The support, which since April included the state picking up varying percentages of the wage bill of employees, the income of the self-employed and various incentives to companies, total nearly 200 billion pounds, Sunak told the House of Commons.The new package comes in the context of wrangling between the central government in London and local leaders in Greater Manchester over the financial support for companies that are required to close in areas under the highest alert level 3. London is under level 2.As of Wednesday night, the UK has recorded 26,688 new cases in 24 hours – four times the day-peaks in April and May – besides 191 deaths. South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester are due to join Liverpool and parts of Leicestershire in level 3 alert level this week.Announcing the new package, Sunak told MPs: “I’ve always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs.”“I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government’s stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months”.Opposition leaders accused the Boris Johnson government of being ‘London-centric’ and criticised it for allegedly ignoring north England and announcing the package only when it was clear that London companies would be more adversely affected under the level 2 alert level. Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said: “This is incredible. I don’t for a moment begrudge help for London business but this is the same chancellor who refused to help Greater Manchester as we lived with these restrictions for months and said it was ‘unfair’ to other areas when we asked for help. Don’t ever forget this.”Sean Fielding (Labour), leader of the Oldham council in north England, added: “It stinks. Proves that when people like me say that the government wouldn’t leave London high and dry we’re not just being chippy northerners, it’s true. Our businesses have struggled under the equivalent of tier 2 restrictions, or more, for three months and received nothing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-uk-covid-cases-surge-rishi-sunak-extends-wage-bill-support/story-RCwHbuODuXCto1fY5Uuc1K.html
22-10-2020||World||UK’s foreign policy is adrift, lacks clarity, warn MPs||The UK’s foreign policy is ‘adrift’ and the claim of ‘Global Britain’ lacks clarity, warned a new report by an influential parliament panel.“The UK’s international policy has been adrift,” said the report released on Thursday by the foreign affairs committee of the House of Commons. It said the Brexit-bound country’s foreign policy lacked a clear strategic vision, confidence, and coherent implementation. The report titled ‘A brave new Britain? The future of the UK’s international policy’ has taken inputs from Indian and other diplomats and reflected their worries.Calling on the Boris Johnson government to ‘step-up and do more’ on the global stage, MPs questioned the oft-repeated claim in the pro-Brexit discourse of the country reinventing itself as ‘Global Britain’, alleging that few were clear what it meant.It said: “More than four years after the sound bite was first used to encapsulate the UK’s international role, and almost three years after our Committee first called for more clarity about its meaning and metrics, many of our contributors still told us that they did not know what Global Britain stood for.”Diplomats and experts told the committee that the UK has recently “appeared less ambitious and more absent in its global role”, the report noted, quoting former Indian diplomat Asoke Mukerji telling MPs that “in the political and strategic sphere, there is a perception that the UK is not involved as much as it should be.”The reasons, according to them, include a diminished profile during the UK’s membership of the European Union, distraction by the process of leaving the EU, and a more general de–prioritisation of some regions plus reluctance against assertion in others.Tom Tugendhat, committee chair, said: “In the face of adversity, it is vital we have a clear and consistent strategy to overcome the challenges we face. Without a plan and corresponding budgets to support it the UK cannot coherently respond to such challenges or remain confident in its delivery of Global Britain.” “It leaves the UK feeling its way in the dark and adds to uncertainty at a time of great global instability…Many key global voices feel that this country has a huge part to play as the world changes in coming years. The UK must now move forward in a confident, clear and coherent way, driving events, not simply be pushed around by an increasingly unstable world.”The committee’s report is the second major exercise this year into the UK’s foreign policy before Brexit is completed on December 31. An Integrated Review of foreign policy, defence and international development is also underway, but may not be published in November, as scheduled, due to Covid-19-related developments.India and the Indo-Pacific are expected to be the new area of focus of a post-Brexit Britain, as indicated by foreign secretary Dominic Raab and others, but the committee cautioned the government that such a tilt cannot work without continuing firm links with Europe.The report said: “None of our contributors wanted the UK to stand back or keep quiet. All of them urged the UK to step up, do more, and play a more impactful role in the world. They highlighted the positive contribution that the UK could make to international relations, and the negative implications if it declined.”“But the UK will have the greatest impact abroad if it uses its range of assets and capabilities coherently. It is unlikely that the merger of the Department for International Development and the Foreign & Commonwealth Office will resolve the persistent problem that Britain abroad is less than the sum of its parts,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-foreign-policy-is-adrift-lacks-clarity-warn-mps/story-Ra01Cz36Jkv4eR4GmdFKHJ.html

They said 10 civilians were killed and eight wounded during Wednesday night’s airstrikes.In the meantime, spokesman Hajri accused terrorists of using civilians as human shields and attacking security forces from villagers’ houses.Earlier on Thursday morning, five Taliban terrorists were killed and five terrorists and two soldiers were wounded after government security forces repelled a Taliban attack on a checkpoint in neighbouring Khwaja Ghar district, district chief Mohammad Omar told Xinhua.Fighting rages across Afghanistan as Taliban terrorists have been attempting to take territory and consolidate their position as peace talks between the Afghan government delegation and Taliban representatives were underway in Doha, capital of Qatar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-civilians-killed-in-clashes-airstrikes-in-afghanistan/story-P4NVo9GpOIagwtbBsnpdEN.html
22-10-2020||World||Trump-allied groups pour $30 million into Barrett’s confirmation to Supreme Court||Conservative non-profit groups plan to spend about $30 million by month’s end advocating Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the US Supreme Court, according to people familiar with the activities.The money has financed a barrage of advertising and grass-roots activity --mostly in battleground states -- that’s saturating television screens, social media feeds, Senate offices and roadside stops in the weeks leading to the Nov. 3 election.The goal is to ensure Barrett’s Senate confirmation to the high court, which could happen as soon as Monday, after a committee vote set for Thursday. But with Democrats all but powerless to block a vote, conservative groups have have sought to turn Barrett into an political asset for President Donald Trump, who trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden both nationally and in swing states.The spending by the conservative groups could have the side effect of aiding Trump’s campaign, which has fallen well behind Biden’s in fundraising. The former vice president’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee reported having about $177 million on hand at the beginning of October, nearly three times as much as the incumbent president’s re-election effort.The election has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and Trump’s response, which polls show voters rate poorly. But Republicans have used the nomination fight to fire up conservatives who may be wary of Trump, especially conservative Roman Catholics and evangelicals, by accusing Democrats of bigotry by focusing on the religious beliefs of Barrett, a devout Catholic.The Judicial Crisis Network is spending $10 million on a television and digital ad campaign supporting Barrett, the people said. A spot released last week features Barrett speaking during her confirmation hearing about “some the caricatures floating around” about her religious views. Another from Sept. 29 says “Democrats and liberal extremists” attacked Barrett’s faith.Democratic senators mostly avoided questions about Barrett’s faith during confirmation hearings and instead focused on whether she would strike down Obamacare or the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling. Democrats have used the prospect of those outcomes to rally their strongest supporters before the election.More than 100 paid field staff from the conservative group Heritage Action for America have run phone banks, knocked on doors and sent mail and text messages to people in North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, according to the people. The group expects to spend $3.8 million by Election Day and aims to reach 2.5 million voters.Anti-abortion rights groups, such as Concerned Women for America and the Susan B. Anthony List, have organized events in 10 states that are presidential battlegrounds or have key Senate races. The anti-tax group Club for Growth is spending $5 million on advertising and sending pro-Barrett letters to senators. America First Policies, the non-profit arm of the pro-Trump super political action committee America First Action, is pouring another $5 million into advertising and direct mail backing Barrett.People affiliated with the groups argue the efforts have helped shape public opinion around the nomination, which allows Republican candidates to use it as a weapon against their Democratic opponents.A New York Times/Siena College Research Institute poll conducted last week showed 47% of likely voters said the Senate should vote on Barrett’s nomination before the election, compared to 39% who said a vote should only be held if Trump wins a second term. Almost six in 10 said they opposed increasing the size of the Supreme Court in response to Barrett’s confirmation, an idea supported by some on the left but not embraced by Biden, while just over three in 10 said more justices should be added to the bench.Liberal groups have also spent millions of dollars opposing Barrett’s nomination.Following the death last month of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Demand Justice promised to spend $10 million opposing confirmation of any Trump nominee before the election. It also began a multimillion-dollar ad campaign opposing Barrett’s confirmation in Iowa, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.Those spots assailed Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for pushing the Barrett nomination through the Senate before the election, with the pandemic still raging. The Democratic super-PAC American Bridge also launched an opposition research “hub” containing information on Barrett’s judicial record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-allied-groups-pour-30-million-into-barrett-s-confirmation-to-supreme-court/story-9ihKlOQ1J5r22McRp9ql1L.html
22-10-2020||World||Saudi Arabia-US ties might face reset if Biden wins||Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman enjoyed a near free pass under his personal relationship with US President Donald Trump, but the kingdom’s brazen young leader will have to tread more carefully should Democrats take the White House and reset strategic ties.Riyadh’s human rights record, with the brutal 2018 murder of Washington Post Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and detention of women activists, will be a prime point of friction with a Joe Biden administration, as will the Yemen war.At issue for the Gulf powerhouse, which lobbied hard for Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against foe Iran, is how Biden will address Tehran’s ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies in any talks to revive an international nuclear pact with Iran that Washington quit in 2018.While Riyadh and its Gulf allies prefer a Trump administration that also prioritised lucrative deals over human rights concerns, a Biden win would not upend decades long alliances, five regional sources and diplomats said. Biden may, however, place stronger conditions on US support, they said.“There will be challenges but there are long-term strategic institutional relationships and no one wants to break the camel’s back, though a Biden administration will want compromises,” said one Gulf source. A foreign diplomat in the region echoed the view that Saudi-US ties would not be unduly harmed: “I imagine (Biden) would demand a few high-profile concessions ... something on women’s rights defenders maybe.”In his campaign Biden pledged to reassess ties with Saudi Arabia, an oil exporting giant and major buyer of American arms, demand more accountability over Khashoggi’s killing in Riyadh’s Istanbul consulate and end U.S. support for the Yemen war.“Instead of giving blank checks to dictators and authoritarians around the world, as the Trump Administration has done, Joe Biden will stand up for universal values with friends and foes alike, and stand with the democratic world as we address common challenges,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.De-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has firmly consolidated power, crushing dissent, and detaining rivals to the throne, measures that tainted a reformist image initially lauded abroad as he moved to open up the kingdom.He has denied ordering Khashoggi’s killing, which sparked global outrage and spooked investors, but in 2019 indicated some personal accountability by saying it happened under his watch.Riyadh jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years in the case.The kingdom’s foreign minister, in a webinar this month, said it was also reforming security services so “something like this cannot happen again”.Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud though struck a defiant tone over Western condemnation of the trials of women activists, saying they are charged with “serious crimes”.The detainees are accused of harming Saudi interests. Few charges have been made public but some relate to contacts with foreign journalists, diplomats and rights groups.Trump has objected to punitive measures against Riyadh over human rights. But in April he threatened withholding military support ,boosted after 2019 attacks on Saudi energy facilities, after an oil war between Riyadh and Moscow wreaked havoc on markets, threatening the US oil industry.Prince Faisal stressed that despite “occasional divergences”, the Saudi-US alliance “goes much deeper than just one king or one president.”Riyadh and its Gulf allies strongly disagreed with the Obama administration over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the 2011 “Arab Spring”, warning Washington against abandoning traditional allies and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood.State-backed media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recently focused on emails linked to Hillary Clinton and the Brotherhood , a move one Saudi source said aimed to show Democrats had erred and could do so again.“There is concern that a Biden presidency would at best, mean a reduced US focus on the Middle East, and at worst ... a more hardline approach towards Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries,” said Abdulaziz Sager, chairman of Riyadh-based Gulf Research Center.“There is a desire for clarity among Saudis in terms of what Biden’s concrete foreign policy would be towards Saudi Arabia.”Gulf states are also trying to push through arms deals, with the UAE and Qatar seeking US F-35 fighter jets.The UAE has hedged its bets, reducing its military presence in Yemen, and becoming the first Arab state in a quarter century to normalise ties with Israel, creating a new axis against Iran and Islamists deemed a threat to Gulf dynastic rule.Bahrain followed suit, handing Trump a win in US brokered accords that also garnered bipartisan support.“One of the reasons Gulf States are establishing relations is because they realised a few months ago they might not have the US to rely on as in the past. Israel is a natural partner,” said a source familiar with the process.Saudi columnist Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh, writing in local daily Al Jazirah, said this “created a new reality on the ground that candidate Biden cannot overlook” when dealing with Iran.Trump initially said the United States was “locked and loaded” after the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities, blamed by Riyadh and Western powers on Tehran, but a conventional military response did not materialise. The apparent attempt to avoid a war was watched closely around the Gulf.Saudi Arabia tacitly backed the Israel deals but is unlikely to join soon given its position as custodian of Islam’s holiest sites and architect of a 2002 Arab Peace Initiative that offered Israel ties in return for Palestinian statehood.Riyadh has said only an Israeli-Palestinian deal could deliver lasting peace and stability.“The Saudis will probably not move to recognize Israel before the election in large part because this is a card they can play with a new Biden administration,” said David Rundell, a former chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Riyadh.Gulf rivals are also biding time over a political row that has seen Riyadh and its allies boycott Qatar, two of the Gulf sources said, despite pressure from Trump to end the dispute. If Trump wins, Riyadh would seek to end the row and form a united Gulf Arab front against Iran, one of the sources said. “It may not be as big an issue for Biden, but if he also pushes for it, then we’ll see progress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-us-ties-might-face-reset-if-biden-wins/story-JYNhMMzC47dDWodYsnYwjO.html
22-10-2020||World||India, US set for military pact on satellite data during Pompeo visit||India is closing in on an agreement with the United States that will give it access to satellite data for better accuracy of missiles and drones, government and industry officials said, as it tries to narrow the gap with the powerful Chinese military.The two sides are expected to announce the pact during the visit next week of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper for talks in New Delhi with Indian counterparts Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh.The United States, which antagonised Beijing this week by approving the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, has also been pushing for stronger security ties with India to help balance China’s growing regional influence.US companies have sold India more than $21 billion of weapons since 2007 and Washington has been urging the Indian government to sign agreements allowing for sharing of sensitive information and encrypted communications for better use of the high-end military equipment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet discussed the final draft of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation on Wednesday, an Indian government source said.An accord would provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data, a defence industry source said.It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India, the defence source said.“It is a foundational agreement, which the US has signed with many of its partners for greater interoperability,” the source said.India has traditionally been hesitant about getting drawn into a US-led security alliance and antagonising China. But tensions have risen dramatically with China this summer, erupting into a clash between border troops in the western Himalayas.This week New Delhi agreed to invite Australia into next month’s naval exercises scheduled with the United States and Japan, disregarding concerns it would anger China, which sees such a grouping as directed against it.“In tandem, the moves signal a new level of strategic convergence between the two democracies and a break from India’s ‘non-aligned’ past,” said Jeff Smith, a South Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, about the proposed pact.Already there is robust intelligence sharing between US and India, particularly about Chinese activity in the region, a second government official said.This includes information on PLA deployments on the Indian border and also Chinese maritime activity, including its deep water fishing fleets, which have caused friction between Beijing and other countries.“They are sharing a large amount of data,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-set-for-military-pact-on-satellite-data-during-pompeo-visit/story-PK2DxYltSpk6rtQ06zEqXL.html

Once an effective vaccine is produced, the storage of the vaccine shots is going to be one of the most crucial aspects, experts have said. Pfizer, as reported, has fitted with 350 large freezers.2. Apart from the Michigan facility, the company has another in Belgium. These are the two final assembly centres, the report said.3. Reusable temperature-controlled containers have been designed by the company. Each of this boxes can hold 1,000 to 5,000 doses. The temperature will be minus 70 degrees Celsius.Also Read: AstraZeneca trial volunteer dies in Brazil. What it means for Covid-19 vaccine development4. The company has designed such boxes so that separate refrigeration is not required when the vaccines are shipped by trucks or cargo planes.5. Pfizer has also tied up with cargo flights for delivery — which will take three days depending on the location, the report said.The preparation to lay out a fast and fool-proof delivery plan began when the company started working for the vaccine with Germany’s BioNTech SE in March. The vaccine maker is likely to apply for authorisation in November once it gets global data of 44,000 people who underwent the trials. Apart from the US government, the EU, Japan, the UK have already placed vaccine orders with Pfizer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/350-large-freezers-football-ground-size-land-inside-pfizer-s-vaccine-distribution-campaign/story-tWlVjJvl3Bk3yrWxUaPLlO.html
22-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Final Presidential debate could thrust foreign policy back into campaign||As Joe Biden hopscotched through Iowa and New Hampshire in late 2019, he also name-dropped his way across the globe.China’s Xi Jinping. German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vladimir Putin of Russia.“I’ve met every major world leader for the last 40 years,” the former vice president and eventual Democratic presidential nominee said.Behind the braggadocio was something Biden saw as a chief selling point for his third White House bid: His decades as a leading senator and two-term vice president make him “ready on day one” to restore a world order he believes President Donald Trump has destabilized.Biden’s foreign policy credentials have largely been overshadowed by questions about how he would lead the US through the worst pandemic in a century. But the issue could reemerge Thursday as Trump and Biden take the stage for a final debate, with a topic list including national security.Both campaigns believe their competing approaches — Trump’s “America First” doctrine that he says ended an era of other nations taking advantage of the United States; Biden’s pledge to reinvigorate a network of Western democracies — can sway voters.“The 800-pound gorilla that will be making its presence felt on Jan. 21 is still going to be Covid-19,” said Tony Blinken, Biden’s top foreign policy adviser, describing the pandemic as “the first big national security challenge” that would require Biden to make good on his promise of better coordination among the US and its allies.But, Blinken said, “The world doesn’t stop just because we have this Covid crisis. … We would have to walk and chew a lot of gum at the same time.” Biden blisters Trump on everything from his hard-line immigration policies and dismissing the climate crisis to criticizing NATO allies and “embracing” Putin and North Korea’s authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un.In an ABC News town hall last week, Biden credited Trump for recently cementing diplomatic ties between Israel and two Arab neighbors: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. But, Biden said, the president still has “no coherent plan for foreign policy” beyond “America alone.” Trump counters that “America First” is more than sloganeering. He won a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, curtailed legal immigration, wielded tariff powers and insists he’s staring down Beijing’s Xi on trade — efforts he frames as benefiting American workers.Yet heading into the final debate, Trump’s loudest foreign policy pitch isn’t about his record. It’s casting Biden as corrupt because of his son Hunter’s business associations in Ukraine and China.The president has promoted an unconfirmed New York Post report published last week that cites an email in which an official from Ukrainian gas company Burisma thanked Hunter Biden, who served on the company’s board, for arranging for him to meet Joe Biden during a 2015 visit to Washington.The Biden campaign has rejected Trump’s assertion of wrongdoing and noted that Biden’s schedule did not show a meeting with the Burisma official.Once the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden hails from the bipartisan establishment that shaped US international policy from World War II’s end until Trump’s election.Biden sees the international order established over that span — NATO, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization – as anchoring global stability, with the US leading as the world’s democratic superpower, rivaled only by one-party China.Trump eschews those institutions and their multilateral efforts. He’s withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization, the Paris accords to reduce carbon pollution worldwide and a multinational deal that limited Iran’s nuclear program. He’s pledged to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany, a notable retreat from the post-WWII framework.To Biden, those moves invite Russian aggression in Europe and an unchecked Beijing.Trump undoubtedly has been an international force. His NAFTA overhaul drew bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. The latest Middle East deal is a historic step, though it doesn’t address the region’s biggest unresolved matters: the Syrian civil war, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the land dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Biden has promised immediate changes.He’d recommit to the Paris accords while rejoining WHO and restoring its US financial support. He’s pledged to reverse Trump’s executive actions limiting travel from certain Muslim nations and curtailing the US asylum program for refugees.He’d restore foreign aid programs to other Western Hemisphere nations, especially in Central America, where economic and political instability drive migration patterns to the US Aides said Biden would likely halt troop reductions in Europe, believing those postings are fundamental to the US commitment to NATO and containment of Russian ambitions on the continent.Biden also promises to confront Putin, whom he describes as a “thug,” over interference in US elections via social media and other means. Trump has publicly rejected US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in 2016 and is doing so again in 2020 in ways intended to help Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-final-presidential-debate-could-thrust-foreign-policy-back-into-campaign/story-ttUHKuIO9jGds62ArfIXRP.html
22-10-2020||World||Taiwan says not seeking arms race with China after new US arms sale||Taiwan is not seeking to get involved in an arms race with China but does need a credible combat capability, Defence Minister Yen De-fa said on Thursday, after the United States approved a potential $1.8 billion arms sale to the Chinese claimed island.Beijing has applied increasing pressure om democratically ruled Taiwan to accept China’s sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.The latest US arms package includes sensors, missiles and artillery, and further congressional notifications are expected for drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles, made by Boeing Co, to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.Speaking to reporters, Yen thanked the United States and said the sales were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the “enemy threat and new situation”.“This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,” he added.“This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.”China is likely to condemn the new weapons sale, as it always does, but Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.“We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.”Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernisation a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly “asymmetric warfare” capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Washington, which, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei though it is its strongest global backer, has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so it can become a “porcupine”, hard for China to attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-not-seeking-arms-race-with-china-after-new-us-arms-sale/story-r958HVDJ12HaylXhvPxwNK.html

22-10-2020||World||Snap polls averted after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party defeats motion seeking probe into corruption||The possibility of snap elections in Canada was averted for a third time since late September, as the ruling Liberal Party defeated an opposition motion in parliament that had aimed to establish a special committee of the House of Commons to investigate alleged government corruption.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had taken the firm position that such a motion would constitute a vote of confidence, and a loss would precipitate immediate elections. However, the motion was opposed by 180 MPs - including the Liberal caucus as well as members of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Greens and two Independents - with 146 supporting it, comprising the two largest opposition groupings, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois.It marked the third time the NDP came to the rescue of the Liberal Party, voting along with it on a critical motion. The motion had been moved to create a 15-member special committee that would probe, among other things, the grant of a nearly billion-dollar contract to a charity with close links to PM Trudeau and his family. The project given to WE Charity was later cancelled after a controversy erupted when it was revealed that Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother had been paid appearance fees by the organisation.Pablo Rodriguez, leader of the government in the House, accused the opposition of a gambit that could have led to “paralysing the government in the middle of a pandemic”. Speaking to reporters in Ottawa after the vote, Conservative House leader Gérard Deltell countered, “This is what the issue is all about with this motion, and what we see right now is a prime minister who will do whatever it takes to call an election.”NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, despite voting with the Liberals, levelled the same charge at Trudeau, saying in a statement, “We think the threat to call an election over an opposition motion to set up a committee is ridiculous and out-of-touch with what Canadians are facing. The prime minister always has the power to call an election. It’s clear that he wants an election now to hold onto power, before the pandemic gets worse.”However, Singh’s party came in for criticism from other opposition members for siding with the ruling party for the third time running, as Bloc Québécois House leader Alain Therrien accused the NDP of acting like “the Liberals’ lap dog”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/snap-polls-averted-after-canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-s-party-defeats-motion-seeking-probe-into-corruption/story-HTBpg9CvuO95NAodpfZK6H.html
22-10-2020||World||Thailand cancels emergency decree in bid to calm protests||Thailand’s government on Thursday canceled a state of emergency it had declared for Bangkok last week after the embattled prime minister suggested the gesture to cool massive student-led protests seeking democracy reforms.The revocation of the emergency decree was published in the government gazette, and took effect at noon Thursday.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha went on national television on Wednesday night to appeal to pro-democracy protesters to reduce political tensions and promised to lift the emergency measure.As he was speaking, protesters marched near Government House, his office, to demand he step down. They also asked for the release of their colleagues who were arrested in connection with earlier protests.They said that if their demands were not met, they would return in three days.The protesters are pressing for a more democratic constitution and reforms to the monarchy. The implicit criticism of the royal institution has stirred controversy because it traditionally has been treated as sacrosanct and a pillar of national identity.Wednesday marked the eighth straight day of demonstrations by a movement that was launched in March. It went into a lull as Thailand dealt with a coronavirus outbreak, and slowly revived in July. In the past week especially, protest have spread to other provinces.The demonstrations have continued even though many top protest leaders have been detained and the state of emergency banned public gatherings of more than four people.Prayuth, in the taped speech, pleaded with his countrymen to resolve their political differences through Parliament.“The only way to a lasting solution for all sides that is fair for those on the streets as well as for the many millions who choose not to go on the streets is to discuss and resolve these differences through the parliamentary process,” he said, according to an official English-language text of his remarks.The government on Tuesday approved a request to recall Parliament to deal with the political crisis in a special session from Monday to Wednesday.“While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands,” Prayuth said.He ended his remarks with a plea: “Let us respect the law and parliamentary democracy, and let our views be presented through our representatives in Parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-cancels-emergency-decree-in-bid-to-calm-protests/story-jrg9kHMBa9RIXaNX8MPIrO.html
22-10-2020||World||Pakistan’s parliamentary panel passes bill for review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s conviction||Pakistan’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice passed a government bill on Wednesday evening that seeks to review the conviction of Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been sentenced to death by a military court for alleged involvement in spying.Farogh Naseem, minister for law and justice, told committee members that the bill, titled “the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance”, was introduced in compliance with directives of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Naseem argued that in case the bill was not adopted by parliament, Pakistan was facing possible sanctions for not complying with the ICJ’s verdict.Naseem said his ministry had sought to “preempt a possible Indian move” of filing a contempt petition against Pakistan in the ICJ by promulgating the ordinance, and clarified that neither India nor Jadhav had filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court to seek relief permissible under the ICJ verdict.He said that his ministry had to file a petition for the appointment of a lawyer for Jadhav, which is pending adjudication.Opposition parties criticised what they said was a move towards giving relief to Jadhav, calling it an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) to persons charged with espionage. It is said that the NRO was introduced by former president Pervez Musharraf to give relief to politicians against whom charges had been filed during a spell of military rule in Pakistan.Aliya Kamran of JUI-F Party accused the Imran Khan administration of legislating on behalf of New Delhi. She demanded that the bill should be debated in public before it is passed.In response to the criticism, Naseem argued before the committee that India had been looking for a way to file a contempt plea against Pakistan with the ICJ. In such a scenario, the country could face sanctions if the matter was referred to the United Nations Security Council, the minister said.After further debate, the matter was settled through voting. Eight members voted in favour of the bill, while five opposed it, allowing it to be passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-parliamentary-panel-passes-bill-for-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-conviction/story-JwvXP1LMklXpodVAq1tXxJ.html

He (Obama) said he (Trump) will not be our president. But before that, he said he (Trump) will not run. He didn’t know me. Then I ran. Then he said he will not get the nomination. Then I got the nomination. “Then he said he (Trump) will not be our president. Then I won. I think the only one more unhappy than crooked Hillary that night was Barack Hussein Obama. The only one. Barack Hussein Obama,” Trump said amidst applause from his supporters. “For years, you had a President who apologised for America -- now you have a President who is standing up for America, and standing up for YOU. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and co-workers, and GET OUT AND VOTE. Together, we are going to #MAGA!. “If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m NOT a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before!” he said in tweets. The Republican incumbent exuded confidence that he will get four more years in the White House. “We are going to win four more years in the White House. With your vote we will continue to cut taxes, cut regulations, lower drug prices like never before,” he said. Trump claimed that the media and the big tech are desperately trying to cover up the massive corruption scandal against Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. “I’m not just running against sleepy Joe Biden, I’m running against the corrupt medium. They are corrupt, the corrupt media, the big tech giants and I am running against the Washington swamp. It is time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites by delivering Joe Biden a thundering defeat on November 3,” he said. Trump described this as the most important election in America’s history. “Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbours, get your coworkers, get your boss, rip him out of the seat, and get out and vote,” he said. “They will open the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism, the beheading that took place in France just a few days ago is a horrifying reminder that we have to be vigilant and I sent our regards and our sympathies to France and to their President (Emmanuel) Macron who is a terrific guy. He is working very hard. “I am keeping the terrorist jihadist and violent extremist the hell out of our country if that’s okay with you,” the president added.

22-10-2020||World||Iranian woman arrested for cycling without hijab, accused of ‘insulting’ Islamic veil||Authorities in Iran have arrested a woman for ‘insulting the Islamic Hijab,’ after a video of her cycling without a veil went viral on social media, news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) has reported.“A person who had recently violated norms and insulted the Islamic veil in this region, has been arrested,” Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted Najafabad governor Mojatabai Raei as saying.Raei further said the woman’s ‘motive’ for committing this action is being investigated. He, however, did not disclose her identity. “The residents of this city are holding a protest rally today after the unprecedented violation of norms,” the governor added.The incident took place in the city of Najafabad. In the video, which was shot with a mobile phone, the woman is seen cycling in front of a mosque. She can also be seen repeatedly raising her right hand in the air.IRNA further said the video of the woman, showing her ‘riding her bike without a veil in the main square’ and ‘in front of a big mosque,’ had triggered protests from residents and clerics in Najafabad.Under Iran’s Islamic law, which has been in force there since the 1979 revolution, women must wear a hijab that covers their head and neck and conceals their hair.However, in recent times, Iranian women have challenged this decree by allowing their veils to reveal more hair, especially in the capital Tehran and other major cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-woman-arrested-for-cycling-without-hijab-accused-of-insulting-islamic-veil/story-XjFiNHC2sL5LTdiayqyZJK.html
22-10-2020||World||Barack Obama hits campaign trail, slams US President Donald Trump||With less than two weeks left for the close of polling, Barack Obama hit the campaign trail on Wednesday in support of Democratic White House hopeful Joe Biden, launching with a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump. The former US president slammed Trump for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, his secret bank account in China, his tweeting, and for “making things up”. Obama urged Democrats to vote like never before to “leave no doubt” about the outcome.Obama’s drive-in rally in Philadelphia where he canvassed for his former vice-president was the largest turnout yet for a Biden campaign event.Biden was off the campaign trail on Wednesday to prepare for the final presidential debate with his rival on Thursday, to be held in Nashville, Tennessee. President Trump, too, was out campaigning, visiting North Carolina, a key battleground state, keeping up with his one-rally-a-day routine.Targeting Trump, former president Obama said, “Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country. Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself.” It was a reference to the US president himself contracting Covid-19.“We literally left this White House a pandemic playbook... they probably used it to prop up a wobbly table somewhere,” Obama said.Obama criticised the Trump administration for driving a booming economy into the ground, giving tax breaks to billionaires, trying to gut the affordable health care system in the middle of a pandemic, and leaving America’s standing abroad in tatters. “His TV ratings are down. So, you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show. This is reality,” Obama said. “The rest of us have to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously.”On recent reports of Trump’s bank account in China, Obama said, “He’s got a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible? Can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for re-election? You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that. They would have called me Beijing Barry.”The former president, who remains very popular in the Democratic Party, was on a mission to energise Democrats to vote, especially young Black and Hispanic Americans - who so far don’t appear to be excited about Biden - and those who are likely to stay home on Election Day.“We can’t be complacent. I don’t care about the polls,” Obama said, referring to a slew of opinion polls that have Biden in the lead nationally and in battleground states, as was Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, in 2016. “There were a whole bunch of polls last time. Didn’t work out. Because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home. And got lazy and complacent. Not this time. Not this election.”Urged Democrats to go out and vote, Obama said, “We’ve got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election.”Later in the day, national security officials warned of possible interference in the US election by Russia and Iran in general, after letters were purportedly sent out in the name of a white supremacist group, “Proud Boys”, to some Democrats in Florida and Alaska, threatening them to vote for Trump or face consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-hits-campaign-trail-slams-us-president-donald-trump/story-X1KNPnAoV6hPkyMTqXH2sN.html

The UK Vaccine Taskforce has chosen Oxford Immunotec to supply T cell testing for its assessment of different vaccine candidates.“It is important to be able to assess the different vaccines head-to-head and the T cell response is part of our portfolio of accredited assays that we are employing for cross comparisons,” Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Vaccines Taskforce, said in a statement.Britain has signed supply deals for six different coronavirus vaccine candidates, including those being made by AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech, seen as among the frontrunners in the race for a vaccine.Oxford Immunotec said its technology platform enabled the centralisation of fresh blood samples from different locations to measure the T cell response in a standardised way.It said the platform, known as T-SPOT, was being used to identify the T cells made in response to the pathogen that causes tuberculosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-partners-with-oxford-firm-to-assess-covid-vaccine-t-cell-responses/story-5szobfKs3905JL2ZLSbEYP.html
22-10-2020||World||US proposes not to issue business visas for H-1B speciality occupations||The US State Department in a federal notification Wednesday proposed to make changes to its existing visa regulations under which foreign professionals, which would fall under H-1B, would not be issued temporary visa for business, as has been widely prevalent currently. If finalized, this proposal will eliminate any misconception that the “B-1 in lieu of H policy” provides an alternative avenue for foreign professionals to enter the US to perform skilled labour that allows, and potentially even encourages them and their employers to circumvent the restrictions and requirements relating to the H non-immigrant classification established by the Congress to protect US workers, the State Department said.The move is likely to impact a lot of Indian companies who send their technology professionals on B-1 visas for a short stay to complete the jobs on site in the US. On December 17, 2019, the California Attorney General announced a USD 800,000 settlement against Infosys Limited to resolve allegations that approximately 500 Infosys employees worked in California on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas, the State Department said. “The proposed changes and the resulting transparency would reduce the impact of foreign labour on the US workforce of aliens performing activities in a specialty occupation without the procedural protections attendant to the H-1B classification,” it said. In its federal notification issued on Wednesday, the State Department said US architecture firm seeking protection from rising labour costs in the country might believe it could lay off its US architects and contract for the same professional architectural services will be provided by a foreign architecture firm. If the foreign firm sought H-1B visas for its architects, it would be required to pay the prevailing wage for architects in the area of intended employment in the United States, presumably the same wage the US architects had been paid, and meet the other requirements enacted by the Congress to protect US workers.But under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, the foreign architects could ostensibly seek B-1 visas and travel to the US to fill a temporary need for architecture services, so long as they retained a residence in the foreign country and continued to receive a salary, perhaps significantly lower than what is customary for US architects, dispersed abroad by the foreign firm (or under the auspices of a foreign parent or subsidiary), the State Department added.Under the Department’s guidance, visas could be issued for multiple architects planning temporary work in the United States, in certain situations. However, a foreign employer may succeed in undermining US immigration law and policy by rotating architects between the US and the foreign country to effectively fill the position of one US architect at a significantly lower cost, the notification said.“If the architects who intended to perform skilled labour were “of distinguished merit and ability... seeking to perform (temporary architectural services) of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability, one might argue the current regulatory language suggests this type of labour is a permissible basis for B-1 non-immigrant visa issuance,” the State Department said.This potential outcome is harmful to US workers and contrary to policies of the Trump Administration, it said.The State Department said the application process for a B-1 visa does not include similar procedural requirements to protect US workers like that of H-1B visas.Also, the fees for the B-1 visas are far less than that of H-1B visas. While the Congress required H-1B employers to pay significant fees to fund assistance to the US workforce as well as prevention and detection of fraud related to skilled labour, employers are not required to pay comparable fees to employ skilled workers under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, it said.According to the notification, the State Department estimates that this proposal will affect no more than 6,000 to 8,000 foreign workers per year, specifically aliens intending to provide services in a specialty occupation in the US.As per its estimate, up to 28 per cent of the approximately 8,000 annual B-1 visa issuances under the B-1 in lieu of H policy were to foreign workers who applied for a visa to perform services in a specialty occupation for a small entity in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-proposes-not-to-issue-business-visas-for-h-1b-speciality-occupations/story-JuA4T1HMjEfNUcy2nFDITO.html
22-10-2020||World||Democrats to boycott Senate Judiciary vote on Judge Barrett’s nomination||Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will boycott Thursday’s committee vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination, The Hill reported.According to a joint statement by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Democrats on the committee, the push to confirm Barrett was a “sham process” from the beginning.“This has been a sham process from the beginning...We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway,” read the statement.Meanwhile, The Hill has reported that the Republicans are expected to hold a rare weekend session to pave the way for a final confirmation vote on Barrett’s nomination on Monday despite the boycott by the Democrats.Barrett was nominated as the new justice of the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump on September 26.Barrett is a former law clerk to the late right-wing beacon Justice Antonin Scalia. She has been a federal judge for three years on the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.The seat of the Justice of Supreme Court became vacant with the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg who has been regarded as an iconic champion of women’s rights and a history making jurist passed away at the age of 87.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-to-boycott-senate-judiciary-vote-on-judge-barrett-s-nomination/story-bxNPjB1eOxeVNrO1XnMNZK.html
22-10-2020||World||Kamala Harris slams Trump for being an ‘incompetent’ president||The United States deserves to have a president who understands the dignity of the people and guides the country in a way that Americans can regain their standing and get closer to those ideals they hold, Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Wednesday. In her remarks during a virtual fund raiser, Harris slammed Trump for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic fallout. “We deserve to have a President and to have a leadership in our country that understands the dignity of who we are and respects the dignity of who we are as a people, and guides our country, in a way that we can regain our standing and get closer to those ideals we hold,” Harris said. “We recognize that we have over eight million people in our country who have contracted the virus, again, it didn’t have to be this way, and yet we still have a President who also was the commander-in-chief who should have, as his first priority, to keep the health and well-being of the Americans intact and he is still denying the realities and the seriousness of this virus and the need to wear a mask,” she said. The Senator, who turned 56 a day ago, said “We are in a public health crisis and an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression”. At another fund raiser, she urged her countrymen to go out and vote. “Thirteen days to go. And we cannot let up on this gas pedal. We got to push -- well you know, electric vehicle pedal we need to push, push, push through,” she said. She called herself a “proud daughter of California”, and said “almost everything is at stake.” Harris addressed a campaign rally in Asheville, North Carolina. More than 150 people, many of them women, were sitting spaced out throughout the stadium, waving bright blue pom-poms and shaking noisemakers. She urged people to vote early.“This moment will pass, and years from now our children, our grandchildren...will ask us ‘Where were you in that moment?’ We will tell them about what we did to fight for the soul of this nation,” Harris said.Trump, she alleged, is incapable of being a President who will protect the well-being and health of the American people and “that is why he’s got to go”.Urging people to head to the polls in an election that’s likely to rely on turnout, she blasted Trump for his “failure” to handle the coronavirus pandemic, his refusal to condemn white supremacy, and his disbelief in science and climate change.“We love our country, imperfect though it may be,” she said of why people were here tonight.“And this country that we hold so dear — yes, it has taken a little bit of a beaten because of you know who. But what we know is our democracy and the strength of it will always be a function of our preparedness and willingness to fight for it,” she noted.Some of the loudest approval from the audience came when she criticized Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to make it more challenging for people to vote through a complicated mail-in ballot process and by closing polling locations.She drew loud laughter from some when — as she did during the vice presidential debate — she described Trump’s “weird obsession” with repealing Obama policies.“Do you think he is a racist? Yes,” Harris said of a question she often gets. “I don’t say that lightly, one should never say that lightly. But there is a pattern here. Think back to Charlottesville,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-slams-trump-for-being-an-incompetent-president/story-Rd9Modkzqfnv6iQ1lk5zMN.html

If there is no improvement in SOPs compliance observed, NCOC will have no choice but to revert to strict measures leading to re-closures of services.”Highlighting the “clear resurgence in coronavirus” in the country, the NCOC has asked the chief secretaries to “strictly implement” the SOPs.This statement was issued after Minister for Planning Asad Umar had said that the death rate due to coronavirus has increased by 140 per cent in the last week, Geo News reported.”We are collectively committing a blunder by recklessly ignoring all SOPs and the results have started to show,” Umar said.In a tweet, he said, “Last week daily COVID-19 mortality was 12. This is a 140 per cent increase vs few weeks back. We are collectively committing a blunder by recklessly ignoring all sop’s and the results have started to show. If we do not change our current path we will lose both lives and livelihoods.” (ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-lockdown-in-pakistan-soon-as-authorities-fail-to-implement-covid-19-norms/story-pkDOwE7c2RXWHurXL7auJK.html
22-10-2020||World||US to sell $1 billion worth of advanced air-to-ground missiles to Taiwan||The US government announced approval Wednesday to sell $1 billion worth of advanced air-to-ground missiles to Taiwan as the island shores up its defenses against the threat from China.The State Department said it had agreed to sell 135 of the AGM-84H SLAM-ER missiles, precision-guided, air-launched cruise missiles, and related equipment.Also approved was the sale of six MS-110 reconnaissance pods for air reconnaissance, and 11 M142 mobile light rocket launchers, taking the value of three arms packages to $1.8 billion.The SLAM-ER missiles will help Taiwan “meet current and future threats as it provides all-weather, day and night, precision attack capabilities against both moving and stationary targets” on the ground or ocean surface, a statement said.China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, has stepped up pressure toward the island over the past year, sending attack and surveillance aircraft into its airspace and ships near its waters.Last week Beijing released video of a military exercise simulating an invasion of a Taiwan-like territory featuring missile strikes and amphibious landings.While Taiwan has for decades fallen back on an implicit US security guarantee, Washington has urged it to strengthen its own capabilities to resist an attack.But Washington also wants Taiwan to upgrade its armaments. “Whether there’s an amphibious landing, a missile attack, a grey zone-type operation, they really need to fortify themselves,” President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said last week.“Taiwan needs to start looking at some asymmetric and anti-access area denial strategies... and really fortify itself in a manner that would deter the Chinese from any sort of amphibious invasion or even a grey zone operation against them,” said O’Brien.The sales announced Wednesday did not include the MQ9 Reaper combat drones which Taiwan has reportedly requested.pmh/mjs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-sell-1-billion-worth-of-advanced-air-to-ground-missiles-to-taiwan/story-vFyoPrFWGaX9i0hcZJgmzL.html
22-10-2020||World||Barack Obama rips into Donald Trump’s record in 2020 campaign trail debut||Former President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail on Wednesday, launching a blistering attack on Donald Trump with less than two weeks to go before the Republican president’s Election Day face-off with Democratic nominee Joe Biden.Speaking at a drive-in rally in Philadelphia on behalf of Biden, his former vice president, Obama offered his fiercestcritique yet of his successor, taking aim at Trump’s divisive rhetoric and his track record in the Oval Office.“He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself,” Obama said.Obama, who governed for two terms and remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, blasted Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the president himself had fallen victim to the virus.“Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us,” he said. “He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself.”Obama’s appearance filled a gap left by Biden, who has stayed at home in Delaware since Monday for meetings and preparation ahead of his Thursday debate with Trump in Nashville, Tennessee.The drive-in rally was held in the parking lot of Citizens Bank Park, the baseball stadium in Philadelphia, with the city’s skyline visible in the distance. It was the largest event of its kind that the Biden campaign has staged amid the coronavirus outbreak.The almost 280 vehicles were spread throughout the lot, with big screens placed to allow attendees to see the former president.With a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showing Biden with just a 4-percentage-point edge in Pennsylvania, Obama warned Democrats against complacency.“We’ve got to turn out like never before,” he said. “We cannot leave any doubt in this election.”Four years ago, Obama participated in a rally in Philadelphia with then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the day before the election, only to see Trump narrowly take the state. The Biden campaign considers winning there a top priority.Americans are voting early at a record pace this year, with 42 million ballots cast both via mail and in person ahead of the Nov. 3 election on concerns about the coronavirus and to make sure their votes are counted.The record early vote so far represents about 30% of the total ballots cast in 2016, according to the University of Florida’s U.S. Elections Project.After Obama spoke, Trump held a rally in North Carolina, another battleground state where opinion polls show a tight race.Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, was also in North Carolina to mobilize voters in Asheville and Charlotte.Top ally Even though Wednesday marked Obama’s 2020 campaign debut, his support has been essential for Biden. He has appeared at joint fundraisers with Biden and Harris, and his network of well-connected former aides has been instrumental in helping the campaign outpace Trump in bringing in donations. The Biden campaign is hopeful that Obama will commit to more events before the election.The last days of campaigning are taking place amid a surge in new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations in battleground states, including North Carolina and Pennsylvania but also Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. Pennsylvania has averaged 1,500 new cases a day over the past week, a level it has not seen since April, according to a Reuters analysis. North Carolina is averaging 2,000 new cases a day over the past week, its highest level ever. The virus has claimed the lives of more than 221,000 people in the United States.Polling shows a majority of voters are disappointed in the way Trump has handled the pandemic, which he has repeatedly said would disappear on its own.Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet in their second and final debate on Thursday night, giving the Republican an opportunity to change the trajectory of a race that Biden is leading in national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-rips-into-donald-trump-s-record-in-2020-campaign-trail-debut/story-PvRb2CH6WFxjHMiu9TDfLO.html
22-10-2020||World||Deceased AstraZeneca trial volunteer didn’t receive Covid-19 vaccine||A participant who died during a trial of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil hadn’t received the company’s shot, according to a person familiar with the matter.The person asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.Brazil’s health authority Anvisa said it had been informed on Monday of the study volunteer’s death and had received a partial report from an international committee assessing the trial’s safety. That committee suggested the trial should continue, Anvisa said in a statement.AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, said it can’t comment on individual cases because of confidentiality and clinical trial rules. Oxford has no concerns about the safety of the vaccine trial after an independent and careful review, and Brazil’s regulators have recommended that it continue, university communications head Stephen Rouse said in statement.AstraZeneca’s American depositary receipts fell as much as 3.3% in New York on Wednesday afternoon after word of the person’s death, but trimmed most of those losses in recent trading.US Trial PauseA clinical trial of the vaccine in the US has been on hold for more than a month. Studies were halted globally in September when a UK participant became ill, but have resumed in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India in recent weeks. While temporary pauses in vaccine studies are common, AstraZeneca and Oxford have faced pressure to disclose more information about the UK episode.Interruption of the US trial raised concerns about the prospects of one of the world’s fastest-moving shots and highlighted the hurdles researchers face when developing a vaccine. Another vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, said earlier this month that it would pause its trial to investigate an illness in a study participant.Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines are based on adenoviruses, cold germs that researchers have used in experimental therapies for decades, and the two paused trials have raised questions about the approach.AstraZeneca told analysts in early October that it expected the US study could resume this year and that global approval would be determined by results in tests outside the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deceased-astrazeneca-trial-volunteer-didn-t-receive-covid-19-vaccine/story-7rkZbl540zUZ4p9qlgCuoM.html
22-10-2020||World||AstraZeneca trial volunteer dies in Brazil. What it means for Covid-19 vaccine development||In September first week, pharma company AstraZeneca which is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with Oxford University halted the trial process as two participants who took part in a trial developed adverse impact. Following this, the trial in other countries got stopped, triggering concern over vaccine safety. The trials began after the UK government gave the vaccine a go-ahead. Trials began in India, Brazil as well. The US authorities, however, has not yet resumed trials. Then a volunteer died in Brazil. But the trial is not being stopped.Here’s all you need to know about the latest case:1. Details of vaccine trial participants are confidential information. The details of the illness, if one might develop, are also not disclosed. Brazil’s newspapers reported that the person was a 28-year-old doctor who worked with Covid-19 patients.2. Reports suggest the person was enrolled as a participant for the ongoing trial. But no candidate vaccine shot was administered yet.3. Hence, the trial has not been stopped. “All significant medical events are carefully assessed by trial investigators, an independent safety monitoring committee and the regulatory authorities. These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study,” AstraZeneca said.4. But such a piece of news leads to fear among people. 5. Johnson and Johnson which is producing millions of vaccine shots in the United States has halted their trial as one participant reported unexpected illness.So far, three vaccine trials have been briefly paused in between. Apart from AstraZeneca (resumed elsewhere apart from the US) and Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly’s trial of the antibody treatment was paused after adverse report. Experts, however, feel pausing trials shows the vaccine makers are exercising extreme caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-death-of-volunteer-a-roadblock-for-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-latest-developments/story-JkdPahaSXgB28lLUhqxenM.html
22-10-2020||World||Pope Francis becomes 1st pope to endorse same-sex civil unions||Pope Francis became the first pontiff to endorse same-sex civil unions in comments for a documentary that premiered Wednesday, sparking cheers from gay Catholics and demands for clarification from conservatives, given the Vatican’s official teaching on the issue.The papal thumbs-up came midway through the feature-length documentary “Francesco,” which premiered at the Rome Film Festival. The film, which features fresh interviews with the pope, delves into issues Francis cares about most, including the environment, poverty, migration, racial and income inequality, and the people most affected by discrimination.“Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God,” Francis said in one of his sit-down interviews for the film. “You can’t kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this. What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.”While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favor of civil unions as pope, and no pontiff before him had, either.Also Read | Pope reverts back to mask-less old ways at indoor audienceThe Jesuit priest who has been at the forefront in seeking to build bridges with gays in the church, the Rev. James Martin, praised the pope’s comments as “a major step forward in the church’s support for LGBT people.”“The pope’s speaking positively about civil unions also sends a strong message to places where the church has opposed such laws,” Martin said in a statement.However, the conservative bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, Thomas Tobin, immediately called for clarification. “The pope’s statement clearly contradicts what has been the long-standing teaching of the church about same-sex unions,” Tobin said in a statement. “The church cannot support the acceptance of objectively immoral relationships.”Catholic teaching holds that gays must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.” A 2003 document from the Vatican’s doctrine office stated that the church’s respect for gays “cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.”Doing so, the Vatican reasoned, would not only condone “deviant behavior,” but create an equivalence to marriage, which the church holds is an indissoluble union between man and woman.That document was signed by the then-prefect of the office, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and Francis’ predecessor.Director Evgeny Afineevsky, who is gay, expressed surprise after the premiere Wednesday that the pope’s comments on civil unions had created such a firestorm, saying Francis wasn’t trying to change doctrine but was merely expressing his belief that gays should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals.“The world needs positivity right now, the world needs to care about climate change, care about refugees and migration, borders, walls, family separation,” Afineevsky said, urging attention be paid to the main issues covered by the film.One of the main characters in the documentary is Juan Carlos Cruz, the Chilean survivor of clergy sexual abuse whom Francis initially discredited during a 2018 visit to Chile.Cruz, who is gay, said that during his first meetings with the pope in May 2018 after they patched things up, Francis assured him that God made Cruz gay. Cruz tells his own story in snippets throughout the film, chronicling both Francis’ evolution on understanding sexual abuse as well as to document the pope’s views on gay people.Afineevsky had remarkable access to cardinals, the Vatican television archives and the pope himself. He said he negotiated his way in through persistence, and deliveries of Argentine mate tea and Alfajores cookies that he got to the pope via some well-connected Argentines in Rome.“Listen, when you are in the Vatican, the only way to achieve something is to break the rule and then to say, ‘I’m sorry,’” Afineevsky said in an interview ahead of the premiere.The director worked official and unofficial channels starting in early 2018, and ended up so close to Francis by the end of the project that he showed the pope the movie on his iPad in August. The two recently exchanged Yom Kippur greetings; Afineevsky is a Russian-born, Israeli-raised Jew now based in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, Afineevsky’s 48th birthday, the director said Francis presented him with a birthday cake during a private meeting at the Vatican.But “Francesco” is more than a biopic about the pope.Wim Wenders did that in the 2018 film “Pope Francis: A Man of His Word,” which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. “Francesco,” is more a visual survey of the world’s crises and tragedies, with audio from the pope providing possible ways to solve them.Afineevsky, who was nominated for an Oscar for his 2015 documentary “Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom,” traveled the world to film his pope movie: The settings include Cox’s Bazaar in Bangladesh where Myanmar’s Rohingya sought refuge; the U.S.-Mexico border; and Francis’ native Argentina.“The film tells the story of the pope by reversing the cameras,” said Vatican communications director Paolo Ruffini, who was one of Afineevsky’s closest Vatican-based collaborators on the film.Ruffini said that when Afineevsky first approached him about a documentary, he tried to tamp down his hopes for interviewing the pope. “I told him it wasn’t going to be easy,” he said.But Ruffini gave him some advice: names of people who had been impacted by the pope, even after just a brief meeting. Afineevsky found them: the refugees Francis met with on some of his foreign trips, prisoners he blessed, and some of the gays to whom he has ministered.“I told him that many of those encounters had certainly been filmed by the Vatican cameras, and that there he would find a veritable gold mine of stories that told a story,” Ruffini said. “He would be able to tell story of the pope through the eyes of all and not just his own.”Francis’ outreach to gays dates to his first foreign trip in 2013, when he uttered the now-famous words “Who am I to judge,” when asked during an airborne news conference returning home from Rio de Janiero about a purportedly gay priest.Since then, he has ministered to gays and transsexual prostitutes, and welcomed people in gay partnerships into his inner circle. One of them was his former student, Yayo Grassi, who along with his partner visited Francis at the Vatican’s Washington D.C. embassy during the pope’s 2015 visit to the U.S.The Vatican publicized that encounter, making video and photos of it available, after Francis was ambushed during that same visit by his then-ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who invited the anti-gay marriage activist Kim Davis to meet with the pope.News of the Davis audience made headlines at the time and was viewed by conservatives as a papal stamp of approval for Davis, who was jailed for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Vatican, however, vigorously sought to downplay it, with the Vatican spokesman saying the meeting by no means indicated Francis’ support for her or her position on gay marriage.However, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was fervently opposed to gay marriage when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. Then, he launched what gay activists remember as a “war of God” against Argentina’s move to approve same-sex marriage.The pope’s authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, said at the time of his 2013 election that Bergoglio was politically wise enough to know the church couldn’t win a straight-on fight against gay marriage. Instead, Rubin said, Bergoglio urged his fellow bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead.It wasn’t until Bergoglio’s proposal was shot down by the conservative bishops’ conference that Bergoglio publicly declared his opposition, and the church lost the issue altogether.Francis, in the new documentary, essentially confirms Rubin’s account of what transpired. Of his belief in the need for legislation to protect gays living in civil relationships, he said: “I stood up for that.”Afineevsky declined to say when Francis made the comment, but he began production in 2018 and Italy locked down for the coronavirus in March, suggesting the interview would have occurred in 2018 or more likely 2019.Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an organization of LGBT Catholics, praised Francis’ comments as a “historic” shift for a church that has a record of persecuting gays.“At the same time, we urge Pope Francis to apply the same kind of reasoning to recognize and bless these same unions of love and support within the Catholic Church, too,” he said in a statement.However, more conservative commentators sought to play down Francis’ words and said that while secular civil unions are one thing, a church blessing of them is quite another.In a tweet, conservative U.S. author and commentator Ryan Anderson noted that he and some of his colleagues had gone on record a decade ago saying they would support federal civil unions for any two adults who commit to sharing domestic responsibilities. Such an arrangement, Anderson said, would leave churches the option of refusing to recognize these unions as marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-becomes-1st-pope-to-endorse-same-sex-civil-unions/story-vGkVW3mF3USG6GtwwihO1I.html
22-10-2020||World||Pakistan unlikely to exit FATF’s grey list: Report||Pakistan may remain on the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as it has been unable to comply with six of the 27 points in the global terror financing and money laundering watchdog’s action plan, a media report said on Wednesday.The Paris-based global watchdog is holding its virtual plenary session on October 21-23. It will review Pakistan’s progress on the 27-point action plan.The FATF had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018. “The country will succeed in exiting the FATF’s grey list by June next year,” The Express Tribune reported, quoting diplomatic sources. It said the country has managed to avert being blacklisted. The International Cooperation Review Group of the FATF has acknowledged that Pakistan had complied with 21 points of the action plan, the report said.Also Read | Pakistan readies plan to sabotage J&K telecom blackout with new mobile towersSeeking to wriggle out of the FATF’s grey list, Pakistan in August imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. It won a three-month further extension to complete FATF’s 27-point action plan because of the coronavirus pandemic. The deadline was June this year, but the FATF extended it due to the postponement of its plenary over Covid-19. In February, the FATF gave Pakistan a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against money laundering and terror financing committed with the international community.Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa has ordered an inquiry into the kidnapping of Sindh police chief Mushtaq Mahar by paramilitary Rangers Force to compel him to sign orders that had led to the brief arrest of Muhammad Safdar Awan, the son-in-law of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Safdar was arrested on Monday by Punjab police that forcibly entered his hotel room in Karachi, where he was staying with his wife and PML-N vice-president Maryam Sharif after a massive rally a day earlier, organised by Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). PDM alleged the arrest came after Mahar was abducted and made to register cases against Awan and 200 others including Maryam Nawaz for sloganeering at the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.The probe came after more than 20 senior provincial police officers including Mahar went on leave to protest against the abduction. Mahar later withdrew his leave application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unlikely-to-exit-fatf-s-grey-list-report/story-rtPe2SNQ6Ypr3G1B5xqNDI.html
22-10-2020||World||The US-China conflict over chips is about to get uglier||On a scorching hot day in late August, representatives of Taiwan’s government and industry crowded into the clinical cool of a state-of-the-art semiconductor facility for a symbolic moment in the global tech conflict.They were attending the opening ceremony for a training center built by Dutch company ASML Holding at a cost of about $16 million, small change for an industry used to spending $10 billion or more on a single advanced manufacturing plant.The real value of the site in the southern city of Tainan is strategic: It’s one of just two such facilities outside the Netherlands capable of training semiconductor engineers to fabricate cutting-edge chips on ASML machines. Fellow US ally South Korea hosts the other — and Washington is working hard to ensure China never acquires the same technology.  As the US-China confrontation takes root, the ability to craft chips for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones has become an issue of national security, injecting government into business decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them. Those tensions could kick into overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China’s domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities.Semiconductors made from silicon wafers mounted with billions of microscopic transistors are the basic component of modern digital life and the building blocks of innovation for the future. They are arguably one of the world’s most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year; scale that up to the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it’s worth some $5.2 trillion globally, according to German manufacturers.Politics is roiling that business model, sparking a drive for more autonomy from the US to China, Europe and Japan. “We’re in a new world where governments are more concerned about the security of their digital infrastructure and the resiliency of their supply chains,” said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy with the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association. “The techno-nationalist trends gaining traction in multiple capitals around the world are a challenge to the semiconductor industry.”At once highly globalized and yet concentrated in the hands of a few countries, the industry has choke points that the US under the presidency of Donald Trump has sought to exploit in order to thwart China’s plans to become a world leader in chip production.Washington says Beijing can only achieve that goal through state subvention at the expense of US industry, while furthering Communist Party access to high-tech tools for surveillance and repression. China rejects the allegations, accusing the US of hypocrisy and acting out of political motivation.For both sides, Taiwan, which is responsible for some 70% of chips manufactured to order,  is the new front line.Beijing is increasingly hostile toward Taiwan, a democratically governed island it regards as a renegade province. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s status as the world’s largest contract chipmaker — a trend taking over the industry — the go-to supplier for Apple Inc. and the focus of next-generation chip-making, adds another dimension to China’s enmity, and to its standoff with the US.TSMC has become “turf that all geopolitical players want to secure,” founder Morris Chang said in November.Just a couple of kilometers from the new training center, cranes dot a massive construction site where TSMC is building “fabs” in which it will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world — chips that are no longer available to China’s Huawei Technologies due to US export controls. Huawei used to be TSMC’s second-largest customer, accounting for 14% of sales; those shipments stopped in September.The White House has also imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., having already squashed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., once among Beijing’s biggest hopes to climb the chip ladder. The US is also reaching out to key players at home and abroad to ask them to reconsider their relations with China.  China’s intentions are so alarming to America because chips can be dual-use items with military applications, according to a former official familiar with the US administration’s efforts. “They are the fundamental basis of our qualitative military advantage, from missiles to radars to submarines,” the official said.After decades when the industry was encouraged to go global, Trump is attempting to reel it back home. The CHIPS for America Act introduced to Congress in June aims to set up incentives to support semiconductor manufacturing and research in the US.One executive at a Chinese semiconductor company, asking not to be named due to commercial and political sensitivities, said three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS, which reviews the national security implications of transactions. Germany has also been effectively cut off, making any deals very difficult, the person said.China “firmly opposes the unjustified suppression” of its companies by the US “under the weakest pretext of national security,” and will continue to defend them, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in late September.China — the world’s biggest semiconductor market, accounting for more than 50% of all chips sold — isn’t standing by as its high-tech ambitions are kneecapped. That outsized demand means many major deals need Beijing’s sign-off: Qualcomm gave up its pursuit of NXP Semiconductors in 2018 after failing to win approval from China.China’s five-year plan for the chip industry will lend it the same strategic importance Beijing gave to its atomic bomb program. What’s more, a law passed Oct. 17 may allow China to hit back at the US, with speculation that it could prompt export controls on rare earths used in chip production.Still, the rolling restrictions imposed by Trump haven’t just hit China’s chip capabilities but are upending the entire industry. And there’s scant sign of a climbdown, whoever wins the US election in November.   Citing the need to promote “digital sovereignty,” the European Commission is exploring a 30 billion-euro ($35 billion) drive to raise Europe’s share of the world chip market to 20%, from less than 10% now.  Japan is also looking to bolster its domestic capacity. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan in May and June this year in the hope of convincing TSMC to invest in Japan, a person with knowledge of the visit said. But TSMC announced in May that it was building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and the company declined to receive any foreign visitors seeking to woo it, said another person familiar with the company’s thinking. Both asked not to be named discussing corporate strategy.Meanwhile South Korea, home to Samsung, the No. 1 memory chipmaker, is striving for more self-reliance after Japan imposed export curbs last year on chemicals used in semiconductor manufacture during a flare-up in the countries’ tensions over Japan’s wartime past.While the U.S. remains dominant with giants like Intel Corp and Qualcomm and a virtual monopoly on the software essential to chip design, “there’s no region in the world that can proclaim strategic autonomy in semiconductors,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the Technology and Geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. “Take out any of these players and the value chain falls down.”In January, days before Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sat down for dinner with around 30 CEOs in Silicon Valley. He was the guest of Keith Krach, a 30-year veteran of the tech scene who was appointed undersecretary for economic growth in June 2019.Pompeo had a message for them: China’s Communist Party “is a threat to your companies because they don’t want to compete, they want to put you out of business,” Krach recalled him saying, he told a virtual conference of the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Sept. 29.Trump may have weaponized the semiconductor value chain, but it was the Obama administration that first acted on the threat posed by China, unveiling a semiconductor strategy in January 2017 as one of its last acts. Trump picked up the baton, but the nature of the supply chain means that others are in the US line of sight.Israel — a high-tech R&D hub where Intel is the largest private employer — exported semiconductors worth about $2.1 billion last year, with about half going to China, data compiled by UN Comtrade shows.That closeness to China risks becoming a liability. Zvika Orron, a partner at Israel’s Viola Ventures who leads semiconductor investing, said there’s a hesitancy on the Israeli side to look to China because of worry that Chinese funding could imperil future US deals. Carice Witte, founder of the SIGNAL nonprofit focused on Israel-China ties, said the US is bound to “start asking more questions.”The UK is another pinch point thanks to Arm Ltd., whose instruction set — the basic code that allows chips to communicate with software — underlies everything from smartphones to the world’s fastest supercomputer. Arm currently sells to China, but the company’s takeover by Nvidia Corp puts that business in doubt. If the $40 billion deal wins regulatory approval, Arm would fall under American jurisdiction and become even more subject to US export controls.  While the UK government has yet to show its hand, it allowed the sale of Arm to Softbank of Japan in 2016, so wouldn’t normally be expected to intervene now. But the newly strategic nature of the industry has prompted lawmakers to call for a review of the deal’s implications. Here too there are concerns at being caught between the US and China.Losing a world-class technology company to the US for the Department of Justice to “weaponize” is not a good place to be, according to a person with knowledge of British national security considerations. The risk, they said, is a UK strategic asset becomes “recognized as part of the U.S. arsenal” in its campaign against China.Over the Taiwan Strait on mainland China, the mood at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in late August was gloomy. Chinese executives worried what the Trump administration might do next to hobble Beijing’s progress.“The conflict remains very fluid, which makes it impossible to predict what next moves both sides are going to take,” said Huang Yan, application and sales director at Senodia Technology, a Shanghai-based chip design company that develops sensor chips for smartphones.China is on course to import $300 billion of semiconductors for the third straight year, underscoring its dependence on U.S. technology. That’s something President Xi Jinping is determined to end.Xi has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies from artificial intelligence to wireless networks. A focus of Beijing is to accelerate research into so-called third-generation semiconductors — circuits made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, a fledgling technology where no country dominates.Yet without silicon capabilities it will be difficult for China to build a proper semiconductor industry, said a senior TSMC official. Another person from a company involved in third-generation chip production said designing them is an art, and even poaching a team of designers won’t necessarily guarantee success.The consensus is it won’t be easy for China to catch up, especially at the cutting-edge where TSMC and Samsung are producing chips whose circuits are measured in single-digit nanometers, or billionths of a meter. SMIC would have to double annual research spending in the next two-to-three years just to prevent its technology gap with those companies widening, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum.The tussle raises the prospect of a broader decoupling of the global industry with two distinct supply chains. As with 5G, the question then becomes one of the extent of each system: Does China’s high-tech gravity pull in Southeast Asia and parts of Europe, or is it confined to its immediate neighborhood? How many allies will side with the US?To be sure, the chip industry is still thriving, with the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 30% this year. Geopolitics is now a feature of boardrooms, said the SIA’s Goodrich, but 5G and AI are likely to cause more market upheaval.The direction of travel still worries key players. Shares of Micron Technology Inc., the largest US chipmaker, fell in September after it was forced to halt shipments to Huawei, its biggest customer.Complete decoupling would harm US competitiveness and hurt China, raising the prospect of less money for R&D, slowing innovation, said Goodrich. “A world in which the U.S. and China are independent from one another is a negative outcome for everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-u-s-china-conflict-over-chips-is-about-to-get-uglier/story-VAqyjTLK6wHsq1OLRmHDnJ.html
22-10-2020||World||Relief for Justin Trudeau as Canada avoids snap election||Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government avoided being toppled in a confidence vote Wednesday after a majority of Parliament members voted against a Conservative motion to create a special anti-corruption committeeThe Liberal government had declared the motion to be a matter of confidence. Trudeau’s Liberal party won re-election last year but does not have a majority of seats in Parliament and must rely on at least one opposition party to remain in power. The leftist New Democrat party and Green parties voted with the government to avoid an election.“It was about paralyzing the government in the middle of a pandemic,” Liberal House leader Pablo Rodriguez said of the attempt to create the committee. Rodriguez had said the motion would allow the opposition to pull Cabinet ministers from their work and require them to testify “day after day.”New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh in announcing that his party would vote with the government said the party wants to focus on what Canada needs during the pandemic.The opposition Conservatives, the New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois have argued that the Liberals are avoiding scrutiny of contracts and programs set up to deal with the pandemic. The Liberals temporarily closed Parliament in August, which shut down the work of existing committees probing the We Charity deal.Trudeau has said he should have recused himself from a Cabinet decision to award a contract to We Charity to administer money to students having trouble finding work due to the pandemic. The almost billion-dollar program came under scrutiny after it was revealed that We Charity, an organization Trudeau’s family has worked for, was chosen to administer it. Trudeau’s wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 Canadian (US$221,000) for speaking at a number of We Charity events.The Conservatives have said the committee could explore the We Charity deal.Robert Bothwell, a professor at the University of Toronto, expects an election in the spring, but said it also depends on how the pandemic is going.“Trudeau isn’t that really popular,” Bothwell said. “The bloom is off the rose.”Bothwell said weak opposition keeps him in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/relief-for-justin-trudeau-as-canada-avoids-snap-election/story-9GDxlAakFuthnlMWfQRGOI.html
22-10-2020||World||Court ruling could block thousands of Iowa ballot requests||A split Iowa Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a new Republican-backed law that could bar county elections commissioners from mailing absentee ballots to thousands of people who omitted information on their applications.The 4-3 ruling means that voters who want to cast mail-in ballots in the Nov. 3 election must complete their absentee ballot applications before Saturday’s deadline in order to qualify.Auditors will not be allowed to use the state’s voter registration system to fix any deficient applications, as they have done in prior elections. Voters must do so themselves.Dissenting justices said the ruling will “likely cause thousands of voters to not receive their ballot in time to use it” and others will face increased health risks from voting in person during the pandemic.Those affected would still be able to vote early at the auditor’s office and satellite locations or on Election Day.The ruling marks another legal victory for Republicans and President Trump’s reelection campaign in Iowa, where his race against Democrat Joe Biden and a key Senate contest are expected to be close.Republicans who control the Iowa Legislature passed the law in June after the primary saw record turnout with heavy mail-in voting, which was promoted as a way to keep people from contracting coronavirus at crowded polling places.The law specified that auditors cannot use government databases to fill in blanks on absentee ballot request forms and must contact voters by email, phone and mail to provide the information. Auditors say that task is time-consuming and not always successful.Under Iowa’s voter identification law, those applying for absentee ballots must provide either a driver’s license number or their voter pin number, which few people know. Auditors say some requesters leave that field blank, or make other mistakes or omissions on the forms, which also ask for addresses and birth dates.Critics contend the law adds several days of processing incomplete requests and that thousands of them could be left without absentee ballots.The League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa and Majority Forward, a group supporting Senate Democrats, filed a lawsuit in July claiming the law was an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote that could prevent some people from participating this year.Trump’s campaign and Republican groups intervened, arguing the law was necessary to protect election integrity. A judge in Johnson County sided with them last month, upholding the law.The Supreme Court agreed last week to review the decision. On the same day, the court upheld a directive from Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, that invalidated tens of thousands of absentee ballot applications that had been sent to voters in three counties with their identification information already filled in.In the majority opinion Wednesday, four justices agreed with Republicans that the law was a way to “protect the integrity and security of the absentee ballot system” by requiring requesters to provide information verifying their identities.“We are not persuaded the statute imposes a significant burden on absentee voters. It is not a direct burden on voting itself,” wrote the majority, which included Justices Edward Mansfield, Thomas Waterman, Christopher McDonald and Matthew McDermott.They argued that the rate of absentee ballot requests that have not been fulfilled by county auditors is “extremely low,” about 13,000 statewide as of Friday out of more than 842,000 requests. Most of those unfilled are in Johnson and Woodbury counties, two of the three that had to invalidate pre-filled requests mailed to registered voters.It is of “little significance” that the law was not passed in response to any instances of absentee ballot fraud since its burdens are so minimal, the majority argued.In a dissent joined by two colleagues, Justice Dana Oxley said that thousands more requests for absentee ballots may come before Saturday’s deadline and those missing information will go unfulfilled.She added that absentee voting by mail has become critically important as Iowa for weeks has suffered among the nation’s highest rates of coronavirus infection. Putting a “significant burden” on that option without any documented voter fraud or election integrity concerns is unconstitutional, she argued.As of Wednesday, more than 600,000 people had returned absentee ballots through the mail or in person for the election. Oxley said county auditors have kept up with requests for ballots but could be overwhelmed in coming days.“The majority’s position rests on the calm before the storm,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-ruling-could-block-thousands-of-iowa-ballot-requests/story-xyAAhHHbDhbYSaeLVVHIYJ.html
22-10-2020||World||US says Iran, Russia attempting to interfere in election||US officials warned that Iran and Russia are attempting to interfere with the presidential election, allowing the spread of false information.“We have confirmed that some voter registration information has been obtained by Iran, and separately by Russia,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in a press conference Wednesday evening. “This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to convey misinformation.”“We ask every American to do their part to defend against those who wish us harm,” Ratcliffe said. “Do not allow these efforts to have their intended effect.”Ratcliffe, who was joined by FBI Director Christopher Wray, said Iran aimed to damage President Donald Trump’s re-election effort.“We have already seen Iran sending spoofed emails designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump,” he said.US intelligence agencies have previously said that, as in 2016, Russia sought to interfere to help Trump.In a joint statement, Marco Rubio, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner, the panel’s top Democrat. said, “Our adversaries abroad seek to sow chaos and undermine voters’ belief in our democratic institutions, including the election systems and infrastructure that we rely on to record and properly report expressions of the voters’ will.”Just before Ratcliffe and Wray announced the threat to the Nov. 3 election, the Washington Post reported that Trump is considering firing Wray after the election. Trump has faulted Wray for not providing fuel for the president’s contention that anti-Trump bias drove the FBI’s investigation into whether anyone involved in his 2016 campaign colluded in Russia’s interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-iran-russia-attempting-to-interfere-in-election/story-Vwo1tqGcMIH7cE6lnw6GxK.html
22-10-2020||World||‘Will come after you’: Democratic voters ‘threatened’ to vote for President Trump||Democratic voters in at least four battleground states including Florida and Pennsylvania received threatening emails, falsely purporting to be from the far-right group Proud Boys, that warned “we will come after you” if the recipients didn’t vote for president Donald Trump.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage)The voter-intimidation operation apparently used email addresses obtained from state voter registration lists, which include party affiliation and home addresses and can include email addresses and phone numbers. Those addresses were then used in an apparently widespread targeted spamming operation. The senders claimed they would know which candidate the recipient was voting for in the Nov. 3 election, for which early voting is ongoing.(Read more: US Election 2020: Donald Trump, Joe Biden tied in Texas, poll shows)Federal officials have long warned about the possibility of this type of operation, as such registration lists are not difficult to obtain.(Read more: Trump incapable of taking the job seriously’, says Obama)“These emails are meant to intimidate and undermine American voters’ confidence in our elections,” Christopher Krebs, the top election security official at the Department of Homeland Security, tweeted Tuesday night after reports of the emails first surfaced.He urged voters not to fall for “sensational and unverified claims,” reminding them that ballot secrecy is guaranteed by law in all states. “The last line of defense in election security is you - the American voter.”A spokesperson at FBI headquarters did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.Asked about the emails during an online forum on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said she lacked specific information. “I am aware that they were sent to voters in multiple swing states and we are working closely with the attorney general on these types of things and others,” she said.Bennett Ragan, the campaign manager of Florida statehouse candidate Kayser Enneking, said he got two of the emails and knew about 10 other people in Gainesville who also got them. Bennett said the home address included in the personalized email he received was not current so he figures the data on him was acquired from the 2018 primary election voter roll.The emails were sent by a group — its identity unknown — that put considerable time and effort into identifying vulnerable internet servers in several countries including Estonia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which they hijacked to send the emails, said security researcher John Scott-Railton, who examined dozens. Voters in Arizona and Alaska also received them, he said.The Associated Press obtained the personalized email from two Florida voters in different parts of the state.Scott-Railton, of the Citizen Lab online civil-rights project at the University of Toronto, said the Proud Boys email address that the spammers placed in the email’s sender field was “a flag of convenience.” The true addresses of origin — not readily visible but listed in email headers — were the hijacked servers. The emails reviewed by the AP both appeared to originate from a business in Estonia.And while the operation was not terribly sophisticated, it may still have been backed by a nation-state. There are documented cases in which Russian agents have sent threatening mail, including to US military spouses. Ukraine has also been hit by email hoaxes suspected to be the work of the Kremlin. Intelligence services like to use such techniques because they don’t bear the stamp of government, thus providing deniability.“We’ve definitely seen state actors impersonate political figures and factions in the past. It wouldn’t be unheard of for them to do that in this case,” said John Hultquist, director of threat intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. None of the Russian military hackers indicted by US prosecutors for interfering in the 2016 presidential election on Trump’s behalf have been brought to justice.“To me this is a canary case. And what it shows is that somebody with obvious malicious intent can get messages that leverage voter registration data in front of the eyeballs of a large number of Americans,” said Scott-Railton. The emails clearly penetrated the spam filters of email providers, he said, though some were likely blocked.Microsoft and Google, major email providers with top-notch security researchers and tools, did not immediately comment on how many of the spoofed mails may have been sent and what intelligence they may have about the sender’s identity.“The real question is just how well did this operation cover its tracks,” said Scott-Railton, who worries that the operation might have been a dry run. “Is someone testing a capability that they intend to use on a much larger scale in the future?”He urged the US government and its allies to be as transparent as possible about what they know about the operation as soon as possible to assure the public that it does not endanger election security.In a post on the messaging service Telegram, an account that claims to represent the Seattle Proud Boys said the group had no involvement with the emails, calling them a “false flag operation.” President Trump has been criticized for refusing to condemn the far-right group.Daniel Tokaji, dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School and an expert on voting rights, said he’s afraid we could see more of the type of voter suppression that the intimidation emails attempt — trying to scare people into not voting at all.Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor, said the use of voter roll information could make the emails especially frightening. “It puts so much unfair stress and responsibility on the voters and nobody should have to fear for their safety when deciding who to vote for — but that’s exactly the point of voter suppression.”—-Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., David Klepper in Providence, R.I, and Christina Cassidy in Atlanta contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-come-after-you-democratic-voters-threatened-to-vote-for-president-trump/story-rN1wARicorovu01oYnTPiO.html
22-10-2020||World||China struggles to fill Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ leadership void||As Donald Trump has pulled the United States inward under his “America First” presidency, China has had only halting success at capitalising on a global leadership vacuum, presenting openings for a more internationalist Joe Biden administration if he wins next month’s election.Under Trump, Washington abandoned the Paris climate pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the UN Human Rights Council and UNESCO, and ditched the Iran nuclear deal. It has announced that it will withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) next July and has crippled the World Trade Organization by blocking appointments to its appeals panel.Beijing, which accuses Washington of being “addicted to quitting”, has struck a more globalist posture under President Xi Jinping: Chinese officials head four of the 15 UN agencies, and Beijing has boosted its WHO commitment by $2 billion.As it has sought a seat at the table more befitting its status as the world’s number-two economy, China has also formed its own multilateral institutions, including the Belt and Road Initiative and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).“China has been trying its best to take advantage of the U.S. retreat to advance its own goals,” said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. “Nevertheless, China has had difficulty translating its growing influence into foreign policy success,” he said.While China has all-but-quashed the spread of coronavirus and is a leader in vaccine efforts, its early mishandling of the outbreak that began in Wuhan has triggered a global backlash.Beijing’s clampdown on Hong Kong, its mass detention of Uighur Muslims, its island-building in the South China Sea and sabre-rattling towards Taiwan as well as more aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy, have also eroded sentiment towards China - even as Trump’s policies have undermined U.S. standing.China has struggled to leverage the exasperation of some U.S. allies towards Washington under Trump, with State Councillor Wang Yi, the government’s top diplomat, facing pushback over Hong Kong and other issues during a recent five-country visit to Europe.“Many see the U.S. retreat from global institutions under Trump as ceding fertile ground to China in this area, but what is striking is how much China’s so-called ‘wolf-warrior’ diplomacy has undercut their ability to take advantage,” said Susan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia early in the Trump administration.GLOBAL OPINIONA survey by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center found that unfavourable views towards China in advanced economies including the United States had soared over the past year.In April, an internal Chinese report warned that Beijing faced a rising wave of hostility in the aftermath of the coronavirus, with global anti-China sentiment at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Reuters reported in May, citing people familiar with the matter.If Biden wins, he is expected to maintain a tough stance on China but also to engage with allies and international bodies in a more traditional way. He has said he would keep the United States in the WHO and rejoin the Paris climate accord.“On many issues of global governance, there is still much room for cooperation between the two countries,” such as climate and COVID-19, said Jia Qingguo, a professor at Peking University School of International Studies who has advised China’s government.MIXED SUCCESSDespite its growing economic and military might, China has been a sometimes-awkward multilateral leader, insisting that it is still a developing country and does not want to replace the United States.Its diplomatic ties tend to be transactional, with a policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries and a demand that it gets the same treatment, blasting what it calls Washington’s “long-arm jurisdiction.”Its Belt & Road initiative has been criticised for a lack of transparency, environmental concerns, and the financial sustainability of projects, although the AIIB has been credited with adhering to global standards.China’s success at putting one of its own as head of France-based police coordination agency Interpol ended disastrously when the chief, Meng Hongwei, resigned after going missing in China, where he was sentenced to jail this year for graft.“China’s explicit ambitions to ‘lead the reform of the global governance system’ have not been clearly defined,” said Julian Gewirtz, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “These statements are often swaddled in gauzy platitudes — and that means the rest of the world should judge China by its track record rather than its promises.” (Reporting by Tony Munroe; additional reporting by Gao Liangping; editing by Richard Pullin)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-struggles-to-fill-donald-trump-s-america-first-leadership-void/story-lORWq6lEcqrIv96Pd8B0NI.html

22-10-2020||World||Covid-19 cases spikes have officials looking to shore up hospitals||Hospitals across the United States are starting to buckle from a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, with several states setting records for the number of people hospitalized and leaders scrambling to find extra beds and staff. New highs in cases have been reported in states big and small — from Idaho to Ohio — in recent days.The rise in cases and hospitalizations was alarming to medical experts.“It’s really worrisome,” said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at George Mason University. Around the world, disease trackers have seen a pattern: First, the number of cases rises, then hospitalizations and finally there are increases in deaths. Seeing hospitals struggling is alarming, she said, because it may already be too late to stop a crippling surge.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“By the time we see hospitalizations rise, it means we’re really struggling,” Popescu said.In Kentucky, the governor called the number of daily confirmed cases “grim,” forcing another round of preparations to expand hospital capacity.“We are now going back to our plans about capacity in hospitals, looking — if we have to — at hotel options and the use of state parks,” Gov. Andy Beshear said during a recent briefing. “Ensuring that we have the operational plans to stand up the field hospital, if necessary.”The governor reported 776 people hospitalized, including 202 in intensive care and 96 on ventilators. There were 1,312 new Covid-19 cases statewide Tuesday — the fourth-highest one-day total since the pandemic began.At the other end of the country, Idaho reported its largest coronavirus spike, with new cases increasing by some 47% over the past two weeks. Idaho is currently sixth in the nation for new cases per capita, with a positivity rate of just over 15% — one of the country’s highest.Still, Gov. Brad Little has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate, saying it’s up to individuals to take the necessary steps — wearing masks, social distancing and practicing good hygiene — to stem the surge.“As a health system, we’re all very concerned,” said Dr. Bart Hill, the vice president and chief quality officer of St. Luke’s Health System, the state’s largest. “It’s indicative of anticipating we’re going to see more hospitalizations affecting an older population in the next two, three, four weeks.”“The direction we’re heading is one that looks real problematic,” he said.Since the virus was first detected earlier this year, more than 40 million people around the globe have been infected and more than 1.1 million people have died. In the United States, there have been more than 8 million confirmed cases and more than 220,000 deaths. The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases has reached nearly 60,000 — the highest since July.In some cases, spikes are happening as schools reopen and as Americans grow weary of wearing masks and practicing social distancing.“At this point in the pandemic, everybody’s tired. Everybody’s craving human interaction,” Popescu, the epidemiologist, said. “I worry this is a ripe situation for us to really bubble over what we’ve seen.”Winter is a busy season for hospitals as influenza and other respiratory illnesses ramp up with more people congregating indoors. “I worry a Covid wave that causes a heavy surge on hospitals that are already very busy will further add stress to a system that is exhausted,” Popescu said.Selin Bert, 48, who lives in Portland, Oregon, told The Associated Press that her mother-in-law, who is in her early 70s and lives in Mesquite, Nevada, recently got a severe case of Covid-19 and had to be taken to the ICU in a Las Vegas hospital. She suspects her mother-in-law was infected during a visit from her grandchildren, who traveled from Montana.Her in-laws, Bert said, were religious about social distancing and wearing masks. But she’s not sure the grandkids were such sticklers.“They wear masks when they’re outside, the in-laws. I don’t know about the kids, but I do know that that part of the family isn’t big on the whole mask thing, especially because of where they live,” she said, adding she’s not sure the grandkids have since been tested.“I — we don’t want to even ask because now it’s become a very touchy subject. Because if someone says to you, ‘Hey, you potentially killed your mom, or could have killed your mom,’ it doesn’t really bode well for the family reunion.”Her mother-in-law had symptoms for a few days at home and her health deteriorated so much that she had to be rushed to the hospital after a family member found her on the bathroom floor. She’s now doing better, but remains severely fatigued, Bert said.Coronavirus cases are rising so fast in North Dakota that it’s taking officials up to three days to notify people after they test positive, and as a result the state has fallen way behind on tracing their close contacts who might have been exposed.Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and the North Dakota Department of Health announced late Tuesday that they’re shifting 50 National Guard members who had been working in contact tracing to simply notifying people who test positive. And public health officials will no longer notify close contacts of people who tested positive; instead those individuals will be instructed to self-notify their close contacts and direct them to the department’s website.North Dakota, with its loose regulations, has the country’s worst per-capita spread rate, with 1,224 new cases per day per 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nebraska began imposing new coronavirus restrictions Wednesday, after the number of people hospitalized remained at a record level of 380 for two straight days and the state reported 11 new deaths from the virus.Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his hospital group is working to bring in nurses from other parts of the country to handle the additional cases.Over the past seven days, Nebraska has reported an average of 854 new cases per day, up significantly from two weeks ago when the state was reporting an average 525 cases per day, according to data from Johns Hopkins.The trend led Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts to announce new restrictions that took effect Wednesday. Hospitals now must keep 10% of their beds free for Covid-19 patients, and customers at restaurants and bars must remain seated at tables with no more than eight people.In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt and state health officials launched a new plan to handle a surge in virus hospitalizations that reached a record one-day high of 821. It includes transferring virus patients from facilities in regions where hospitalizations are high to those with more bed capacity.Meanwhile, Wyoming health officials reported the number of people hospitalized with the virus has increased to 73, the highest since March. Health officials say the increase mirrors an increase of newly confirmed Covid-19 cases reported across the state since late September. October has been a record-setting month for cases.Hospitalizations in Ohio have also hit a new high, with 1,154 people hospitalized and 158 on ventilators — the highest number since July.Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday he was caught off-guard by the spike in cases and pleaded again for Ohioans to wear masks and keep themselves socially distanced.And in Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh said public schools will switch to all-remote learning because of a rising number of cases. The city’s seven-day average positive test rate is currently 5.7%, an increase from 4.5% last week. Walsh said students will remain in remote learning until there are two full weeks of falling infection rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-spikes-have-officials-looking-to-shore-up-hospitals/story-xyju67lKQf5nwBYccnMv4H.html

22-10-2020||World||Defeat for Donald Trump would mean some other leaders also lose out||If Donald Trump is forced from the White House in the November election, he won’t be the only loser.Though many governments would likely celebrate the end of the most unconventional and at times chaotic U.S. presidency of modern times, others will have reason to miss it. For the leaders of Turkey, North Korea and Israel, the ledger has been almost entirely positive. Trump’s ejection would confront them with immediate challenges.The scorecard for countries like China is more nuanced. Even so, what the mostly authoritarian winners from Trump’s four years in office have in common is a fear his departure would spell the return of a more conventional U.S. foreign policy.That could see the U.S. mending alliances and promoting the universality of values such as democracy and human rights, or the fight against climate change. “This president embraces all the thugs in the world,” Trump’s opponent Joe Biden said at a recent town hall event, as he sought to highlight the political divide.Kim Jong UnNo relationship with the U.S. changed more under Trump than North Korea’s. What began with mutual threats and insults morphed into a sometimes bizarre love-in as Kim and Trump met three times and exchanged more than two dozen letters, showcasing their “mysteriously wonderful” chemistry.Still, the radically different U.S. approach has also failed to secure North Korea‘s denuclearization. Kim unveiled a huge new intercontinental ballistic missile on Oct. 10 that appears capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads.Biden has said he won’t meet without preconditions, making any rapid lifting of the sanctions that have tipped North Korea’s economy into its worst recession for two decades less likely.Mohammed bin SalmanTrump set the tone for his approach to international relations in Saudi Arabia, choosing Riyadh for his first foreign visit in 2017. He was greeted by a huge image of his own face projected onto the facade of the palatial hotel where his delegation stayed.The Saudi Crown Prince made important gains, above all Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, his country’s mortal rival. Trump also offered personal support and vetoed Congressional sanctions when MBS, as he’s known, was besieged by allegations he’d ordered the 2018 murder of prominent regime critic Jamal Khashoggi.There have been disappointments for Saudi, in particular Trump’s failure to strike back militarily after a 2019 attack on oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia that the U.S. attributed to Iran. Saudi leaders say they’re confident they could navigate a transition to Biden. Still, with Trump gone a more traditional U.S. focus on human rights is likely to return and a door could open to reviving the Iran accord.Recep Tayyip ErdoganIf anyone relies more on Trump than MBS for political protection, it’s Turkey’s president. Trump has stood virtually alone between Turkey and the imposition of Congressional sanctions over Erdogan’s decision to buy Russia’s S-400 air defense missile system, despite being a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally.Their personal bond enabled Erdogan to persuade Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from Kurdish areas of Northern Syria so Turkey could send its own forces to take control of the zone. Trump made that decision without consulting the Pentagon or U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, including the U.K., France and Kurdish fighters that Turkey regards as terrorists.With sanctions ready for enforcement and Biden previously calling on the U.S. to support Turkish opposition parties, Erdogan may have the most to lose from Trump’s departure.Xi JinpingTrump has been more aggressive toward China than any U.S. president in recent memory, slapping tariffs on Chinese goods and moving to restrict its access to key technologies. Yet Chinese officials have said on balance the leadership would prefer Trump to stay.Trump shook the system of post-World War II alliances that China sees as a constraint on its geopolitical ambitions, a considerable benefit. He also undermined America’s international stature by exiting agreements in pursuit of “America First” policies, creating openings for the Chinese president to fill the resulting void of leadership on everything from trade to climate change.Beijing’s concern about Biden is that he would try to create a more coordinated international front in dealing with China, while maintaining the pressure on trade and technology. Even so, China might benefit from a less emotive relationship with Washington if Trump loses, according to Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University. “Do people really want to see China and the U.S enter a cold war?”Vladimir PutinRussia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election produced a formal U.S. investigation and 448-page report. But in some ways, Putin hit the jackpot. In office, Trump has questioned the value of NATO and even the status of countries such as Germany as allies, weakening a transatlantic alliance that Russian and Soviet leaders back to Joseph Stalin have sought to break.There’s every reason to think the trend would continue during a second Trump administration. Yet Russia’s president secured few of the more concrete gains he wanted, from lifted sanctions to progress on arms control. Russian officials see few prospects for a thaw, and less so under a Biden administration.Rather than lament the anti-Russia mood, the Kremlin could try to change it, according to Fiona Hill, the National Security Council’s senior director for European and Russian affairs until 2019. “They could rein in the guys who are going around poisoning people right, left and center,” said Hill, now at the Brookings Institute. “When they’re having meetings with us, they could not poke us in the eye. They could just stop doing all that.”Jair BolsonaroFor Brazil’s president, Trump is a political soul mate. As U.S. opinion polls have turned for Biden, Bolsonaro has grown increasingly concerned for the future of his ties with the White House, according to a senior cabinet member.Since taking office in 2019, Bolsonaro has upended Brazil’s decades-old tradition of an equidistant foreign policy in favor of automatic alignment with the U.S. and its allies. In return, Trump lifted a ban on fresh-beef imports, supported Brazil’s bid to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and signed deals for defense and space-exploration cooperation.Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo has said Brazil would have no problem with a Biden administration, but Bolsonaro’s environmental policies would face strong opposition. Biden has suggested Brazil could face economic consequences if it does not stop Amazon deforestation.Benjamin NetanyahuTrump repeatedly broke with U.S. precedent to boost the Israeli leader’s nationalist agenda, recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the disputed Golan Heights and moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. Plans to annex parts of the Palestinian West Bank have been shelved, but could be revived in a second Trump term.The real payoff came in September, when Trump brokered normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, but there’s been a cost; bipartisan support for Israel in Congress has eroded. Many Israelis fear their country would face greater scrutiny under a Biden administration, while the security establishment worries about a U.S. return to the Iran nuclear deal.Andrzej Duda and Viktor OrbanOutsiders among more liberal European heads of state, the leaders of Poland and Hungary have found solace in Trump. In 2017 he chose Warsaw for a major speech in which he redefined the West in terms of conservative, Christian values -- validating Duda’s right-wing agenda, which Hungary’s Orban shares.The Hungarian prime minister has openly endorsed Trump ahead of the election, saying he does not want to see a return of the “moral imperialism” a Democratic administration would bring to the White House.The two men share Trump’s disdain for political correctness in ways that could cause friction with Biden. President Duda has cast the LGBTQ+ community as “enemies” of Polish families. In September, Biden weighed in on Twitter against Polish regions that had declared themselves “free from LGBT ideology.”In his comment on Trump’s fondness for “thugs,” Biden singled out Hungary and Poland, together with post-Soviet Belarus as he warned against risks to NATO from “the rise of totalitarian regimes around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defeat-for-donald-trump-would-mean-some-other-leaders-also-lose-out/story-tSSxUZkD1bsKjIvrnETleI.html
22-10-2020||World||China’s shaky victory at United Nations elections reveals its great fall | Analysis||There were hardly any celebrations in Beijing this month when President Xi Jinping’s China, often rebuked for human rights violations, made it back to the United Nations human rights council this month. Because tucked behind Beijing’s win, was a huge loss of support that many see as a reflection of China’s track record. Beijing secured only 139 votes for its inclusion in the world body’s 47-member Human Rights Council, the lowest vote among the 15 countries selected. Its tally also reflected a loss of support from 41 UN member states that had supported China in the 2016 election.China had then claimed its 180 votes - up from 167 in 2009 and 167 in 2013 - was evidence of “credit given by the international community to China for its achievement in developing human rights.” This time, the Chinese foreign ministry primarily focused on the fact that it was its fifth stint in the council.The seat on the rights panel, however, hasn’t insulated China. Twenty-three governments did hammer China for its abuses in Xinjiang at the General Assembly’s Third Committee in October 2019. A year later, the figure rose to 40 and the issue broadened to address concerns about Hong Kong and Tibet. In June, 50 UN human rights experts united to seek “decisive measures” to protect fundamental freedoms in China.Closer to the 14 October voting, a cross-regional group of 39 United Nations member countries reprimanded Beijing for violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. “We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and the recent developments in Hong Kong,” German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said in a statement on behalf of the group to the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee.China watchers argue that the Beijing depleting support in the October election is also a reflection of President Xi Jinping’s belligerent diplomacy in the neighbourhood and beyond that has turned Beijing’s potential partners into adversaries and placed them on the same side. In less than 12 months, China has engaged in multiple border clashes with India in East Ladakh, flown military planes over Taiwan, clamped down on Hong Kong, launched trade wars with the United States and Australia, ignited a bitter back-and-forth with Canada and tried to consolidate control over the South China Sea, a major trade route for crude oil for the world.It is in this context that the United States emerged as the bulwark against Beijing, deepening partnerships with countries in Asia and Europe and building alliances such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with India, Australia and Japan.Last week, the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group returned to the South China Sea for the third time this year to demonstrate its commitment to “the lawful use of the seas and maintaining open access to the international commons” and engaged in joint exercises with Australia and Japan beginning Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-shaky-victory-at-united-nations-elections-reveals-its-great-fall-analysis/story-39qv9o7I1UE4frCgNZvJ6M.html
22-10-2020||India||JEE to be held in more regional languages: Pokhriyal||New Delhi Beginning next year, the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) for admission to elite engineering schools will be conducted in several regional languages, in line with the strong focus in the new National Education Policy (NEP) on promoting local languages, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said on Thursday.Nishank made the announcement in a post on the microblogging site Twitter. The minister added that the languages of states that conduct tests for admission to engineering colleges in their local languages will be added.“This decision has far-reaching implications as Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji has pointed out that top-scoring countries in PISA examination use mother tongue as a medium of instruction. The decision of JAB will help students comprehend questions better & score higher,” Nishank said in another tweet.JEE (Main) is now conducted in Hindi, English and Gujarati; several states have raised the issue of expanding the list of languages from time to time. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee recently asked why the examination couldn’t be conducted in Bengali if it could be in Gujarati.In July, the Union cabinet approved the first new education policy in 28 years, emphasising that the mother tongue, local language or the regional language should be the medium of instruction at least till Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jee-to-be-held-in-more-regional-languages-pokhriyal/story-bAE0itgW9Iw8SVALFUZIJI.html
22-10-2020||India||Number of Indian workers in Oman down 11%, shows data||New Delhi The number of Indian workers in Oman dropped by 11.2% this year as a result of the economic downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the country’s “Omanisation” drive to replace expatriates which is expected to pick up pace in the coming months. The Indian community of about 700,000, including more than 567,000 workers, continues to be one the largest expatriate communities in Oman and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that this was also the reason why the number of Indian workers had witnessed a sharp fall in the first six months of 2020. According to figures from Oman’s National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI), the total number of expatriate workers in the country fell by 9.3% in the first half of 2020, when compared to the same period last year. Expatriates now account for about 38% of the total population, a five-year low from the figure of 43.6% recorded in 2015. Most of the expatriates are Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. While, the number of Bangladeshi workers declined by 8.9% in the first half of 2020 to 590,748, the number of Pakistani workers also fell by 8.9% to 192,676.On Wednesday, Oman’s labour minister Mahad bin Said Ba’owain held a meeting with state-run firms to discuss the replacement of expatriates with Omani manpower and a programme to “Omanise” leadership and supervisory posts. The people cited above said the move wouldn’t have much impact on Indian workers as the government sector employs only about 52,000 expatriates. “With indications from several West Asian countries that locals will be given preference for jobs because of the Covid-19-related downturn, the long-term prospects of Indian workers is something that will need greater attention,” one of the people cited above said. In an apparent acknowledgement of these concerns, a senior external affairs ministry official spoke about the need for a “smarter and more sustainable” approach to human resource exchanges with West Asian countries while addressing a seminar last week on the theme “Gulf and West Asia - reimagining business beyond oil”. Sanjay Bhattacharyya, the secretary (consular, passport and visa and overseas Indians affairs), who oversees relations with the Arab world, described human resource exchanges and energy security as the “two biggest items” in India’s bilateral cooperation with West Asia. “With the changing nature of industry and services, the introduction of new technologies and the development of new skills, we can leverage our interaction on the human resources front to one that is smarter and more sustainable,” he said. Mobility agreements of the future can focus on integrating official migration platforms to ensure better flow of information between foreign employers and potential workers or professionals, and this in turn, will “facilitate selection of better and more skilled candidates...and improved job security”, he said. Bhattacharyya noted in his speech that Indians were still the largest expatriate community in West Asia, with some nine million workers and professionals or 30% of the total expatriate workforce, who “remitted $48 billion to India, which helped domestic development”. “With both India and the Arab region engaged in reforms and transformational changes in the economy, the strong political understanding and goodwill between the peoples can take economic engagement to a higher level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-of-indian-workers-in-oman-down-11-shows-data/story-7b0wlf8zktev88oj2Or1CM.html
22-10-2020||India||There is no question of any realignment with Nitish Kumar: Tejashwi||After wrapping up a day of 12 back-to-back election meetings, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD) chief ministerial candidate Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav, 31, spoke to Anirban Guha Roy about the crowds thronging his rallies, his inexperience in governance, the RJD’s Muslim-Yadav constituency, the possibility of a post-poll alliance with CM Nitish Kumar, prohibition, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) factor, and charges that he has sidelined other members of his family, among other issues. Edited excerpts:Your meetings are getting large crowds. Will this translate into votes? People have got fed up with the Nitish Kumar government’s inefficiency, and the huge turnout at my meetings is a reflection of people’s anger against the government. I’m confident people are going to vote for change as they see hope in us to give the state new energy for all-round development, jobs to the youth, and upliftment of the poor. Nitish Kumar is calling you inexperienced and has questioned how you will get money for providing 10 lakh jobs? Our chief minister is a tired man now, and cannot handle the state anymore. If I am inexperienced, why are 20 NDA campaign choppers flying in the air to campaign against me? All of them have now come together to fight a 31-year-old. It means people are listening to me, and lending support to my issues, especially our commitment to provide 10 lakh permanent jobs to the youth by filling 4.5 lakh existing vacancies and also 5.5 lakh new jobs to improve the manpower required in various departments as per the national average. As far as the money for the jobs is concerned, fiscal prudence will help in mobilising funds. Only 60% of the state budget allocation is spent, and rest 40% is unspent. It amounts to Rs 80,000 crore of our state budget of Rs 2 lakh crore. And if the CM is saying there are no funds, he should be held accountable for not doing good fiscal management in all these years.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the RJD did not get a single seat. Do you believe the traditional Muslim-Yadav vote bank will work since the Yadav vote shifted to NDA last time? It’s propaganda that the RJD counts on M-Y equations. We are not a party of M-Y but A to Z, getting votes over the decades from all sections of people. RJD chief Lalu Prasad would not have stayed in power had he got only M-Y votes. In last 2019 elections, the RJD contested 19 parliamentary seats and got around 20% votes . So did it all come from M-Y only? No. In this election, caste will not matter as this has become a people vs government election with a wave for change. In ticket distribution, we have given representation from all sections of people including EBCs , upper castes , minorities, Scheduled Castes and backward classes, as we want to represent all sections of people. Is there a possibility of your party RJD-led Grand Alliance realigning with Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) in a post-poll arrangement in case there is a hung assembly? Obviously not . These are all assumptions -- if A happens, then what will happens; if B happens, what will happen. Your question is what if Nitish Kumar is leaving the BJP? The question of taking him back arises if he leaves the BJP, isn’t it? So, has he left the BJP? No, he is with the BJP. Second, if there is a hung assembly , it will be seen as a mandate against the CM because it will be a reflection of people’s anger against him. So when people vote against him, then why would we take him? There is no question of any realignment with Nitish Kumar in the future. At the same time, I want to emphasise that there will be no hung assembly as people will give a decisive mandate to us. We will come to power with a comfortable majority on November 10, when results come out, and form the government. That is quite visible on the ground, and we can gauge the people’s mood. The LJP is contesting alone, and there is a perception that it will help the RJD . Will there be any post-poll understanding with RJD and LJP? LJP chief Chirag Paswan has said many a time that he is with the BJP as part of the NDA, and not with the JD(U). He has asserted there will no understanding with the RJD. The LJP chief has made the picture clear. I do not need to talk about it. As for what will help, what will not , I never think about it. In the by-election after the Lok Sabha polls last year, the HAM(S), led by former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, and the Vikassheel Insaan Party( VIP) contested alone . Many felt it would damage us. But we benefited ( RJD won two out of five assembly seats in bypolls in October). It will be assessed later on whether the LJP contesting alone with help somebody or damage somebody. The BJP-JD(U) is setting the poll narrative against the RJD by labelling its 15 years rule as Jungle Raj. There is also accusation of law-and-order deteriorating if the RJD comes to power? This is all part of an attempt to create fear psychosis among people, and divert attention of people from the 15-year rule of Nitish Kumar, who failed on all fronts, be it in generating jobs, bringing industries, checking migration, or getting special category status.We have already apologised to people for any mistakes and shortcomings during our rule, and are now exhorting people to give us one chance to serve. The NCRB data shows the state witnessed drastic rise in crime after 2018. It was the RJD that took a lead role in putting pressure on the state government in the Muzaffarpur shelter home sex abuse case. Will your government review the excise policy and prohibition enforced in the state from 2016, after coming to power? My strong belief is that prohibition should be there. But there are anomalies in implementation of prohibition. Due to the slackness of the state government, a black market to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore has emerged, and illegal wealth earned from Bihar is going to different states. This has happened because the implementation of the prohibition law is poor.We will surely look into this aspect. Besides, there is ban on liquor but other addictive items are available. What about them? What have they done to check it? The chief minister was campaigning for countrywide prohibition, but the BJP had opposed the prohibition law even in the state assembly. The RJD’s posters show Tejashwi. Your siblings, elder brother Tej Pratap and elder sister Misa Bharti, and even your mother and former chief minister, Rabri Devi, are not visible much in the campaign. The BJP has taken potshots as to how you have sidelined everybody to showcase yourself? This is all foolish talk. Isn’t RJD chief Lalu Prasad the party president? In the last election, there were big posters of CM Nitish Kumar only. Nobody has been removed or sidelined. In elections, some are at the front and some are behind the curtains. Those who work at the front, they are visible. Everybody is playing their role. Of course, my mother Rabri Devi is diabetic, and we don’t want to give her much exposure for health reasons. People are watching everything. They are not fools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-is-no-question-of-any-realignment-with-nitish-kumar-tejashwi/story-3kLYvstE3FatYWSoXIi2UL.html
22-10-2020||India||‘Too early to say’, AIIMS director on ICMR observation on discontinuing plasma therapy for Covid-19||Even as the Indian Council of Medical Research announced that plasma therapy may soon be discontinued from the Covid-19 national treatment protocol, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi’s Director Dr Randeep Guleria on Thursday said that it’s too early to comment on the government body’s observation and more data needs to be studied.“Plasma isn’t a magic bullet. We’ve to position it properly where it may be useful, rather than saying everyone will benefit from it. What we’re learning from Covid is that, treatment may be useful if the timing is proper,” Dr Guleria told ANI.The AIIMS director said that there was a need to look at more data to decide conclusively.“I think we need to look at more data. In the ICMR study, a large number of patients who were given plasma already had antibodies in their blood. We know that if you already have antibodies then giving antibodies from outside through plasma may not be of that much use. That is why most of the studies now suggest that plasma given early before a person’s own antibiotics have found may be useful,” he said.He observed that in treatment of Covid-19 infection, it is crucial to give the treatment at the right time.“If it’s given too late it may not be of much use and if given too early it may be more harmful,” he said.Recently, ICMR chief announced that Convalescent Plasma Therapy may be removed from the national guideline for the treatment of novel Coronavirus after an ICMR study revealed that it did not help in reducing mortality or slow the progression of Covid-19.Dr Balram Bhargava, Director General of ICMR in a Union health ministry’s briefing said: “We are discussing with the national task force on Covid-19 management and with the joint monitoring group that may be deleted from the national treatment guidelines on Covid.”The investigational therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 positive patient and transmits it into the body of patients critical of the same infection.With exact remedy to eradicate or cure SARCOV2 virus unavailable, ages-old convalescent plasma therapy emerged as a treatment for Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/too-early-to-say-aiims-director-on-icmr-observation-on-discontinuing-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19/story-vy0Ck6Au6miMbxycuwtRBJ.html

22-10-2020||India||Task of China talks is troops’ ‘comprehensive disengagement’, says India||India said on Thursday the immediate task of its diplomatic and military engagements with China is ensuring a “comprehensive disengagement of troops” in all friction areas in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The disengagement and de-escalation process has not moved forward despite several meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs and the senior military commanders of the two sides. The commanders are expected to meet for the eighth round of talks by next week. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing that India and China were continuing their discussions through both diplomatic and military channels to peacefully resolve issues along the LAC. This was in line with the agreement reached by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during a meeting in Moscow on September 10. “The immediate task is to ensure a comprehensive disengagement of troops in all the friction areas,” he said. The last meeting of WMCC was held virtually on September 30, and it was followed by the seventh meeting of the senior military commanders at Chushul on the LAC on October 12. “The two sides have reiterated their desire to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible,” Srivastava said. The military standoff in Ladakh has entered its sixth month and tens of thousands of troops mobilised by both sides are now hunkering down for the harsh winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/task-of-china-talks-is-troops-comprehensive-disengagement-says-india/story-TPMV4gOt0G6e4t9rmYpqCP.html
22-10-2020||India||Top medical body ICMR issues advisory for use of Feluda Covid test||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued an advisory for the use of FELUDA paper strip test, the country’s first indigenously developed test for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) based on the genetic editing tool CRISPR/Cas-9, which is likely to hit the market within a month.According to the ICMR advisory, no further reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based confirmation is required for samples that are confirmed as positives or negatives by it; specimen collection and transfer of sample for the test must be performed using appropriate personal protective equipment; and testing should be carried out under appropriate biosafety (BSL2 level) precautions, following the standard RT-PCR guidelines laid down by the medical body.Feluda uses CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. CRISPR, which is short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a gene-editing technology that can be used to detect a specific snippet of DNA from a sequence.The paper strip test has been developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India for a commercial launch.The advisory also allows existing ICMR-approved government and private laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based testing to be used for this new test. No further approval would be required from ICMR for starting the test in existing laboratories; however, new labs wanting to start the test will need to apply for ICMR approval.“Any prescription for RT-PCR, CRISPR, TRUENAT, CBNAAT may be considered equivalent. All testing data should be essentially entered into the ICMR COVID-19 web portal on a real time basis. Other reporting mechanisms to the state and IDSP should also be ensured as per the laid down protocols of COVID-19 case reporting,” says the advisory from the top medical body.The kit has already been validated by the Department of Atomic Energy’s National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru.The test is named after a fictional detective created by the late Satyajit Ray, although it is also an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Linked Uniform Detection Assay. It has been developed by senior scientists Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty and Dr Souvik Maiti at CSIR-IGIB.Based on tests in over 2,000 patients during the trials at IGIB and on testing in private labs, the test showed 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. This compares favourably to ICMR’s current acceptance criteria of RT-PCR Kit of at least 95% sensitivity and at least 99% specificity. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-medical-body-icmr-issues-advisory-for-use-of-feluda-covid-test/story-xUftyyLYR93tZMMrpTSG5M.html
22-10-2020||India||Just like Swine Flu, Covid-19 may see spike during winter: AIIMS director||Rising air pollution combined with coronavirus infection and lung complications can possibly lead to serious consequences, and therefore, higher mortality, Dr Randeep Guleria, Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Speaking with ANI, Dr Guleria stated that escalation of particulate pollution during the winter may not always be fatal but might have serious consequences, meaning that patients may need ICU or ventilator assistance, leading to higher mortality.Experts broadly have sighted ample examples that identified that the number of all respiratory viruses shoot up during the winter months and have observed that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory virus.“Swine flu also shows a spike during winter months and it is likely that Covid-19 would also do the same. Coming to air pollution, there is data that shows air pollution may also lead to a higher prevalence of Covid-19. This is based on the study being done in the last few months in Italy and China,” Dr Guleria said.The study in Italy found a positive correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and higher deaths due to Covid-19.“If people are inhaling pollutants into the airways, that itself causes airways inflammation and leads to worsening of underlying respiratory conditions. In such a situation, if people get Covid infection, they may have a more severe infection which might lead to higher mortality because of this combination,” he said.While explaining the correlation between rising cases, winter and air pollution, Dr Guleria said, “This is particularly related to two things. Firstly, due to the fall in temperature, viruses can survive for longer periods of time in the environment, unlike summer. Secondly, due to winter people tend to stay indoors, in crowded and poorly-ventilated rooms (to conserve heat) which maximises person-to-person spread of the virus.”With the Air quality Index (AQI) oscillating between ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category, it has already come under notice that coronavirus cases have started spiking in Delhi.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in its latest bulletin (4 pm) on AQI, showed that with 296 and 215 index values in Delhi and Gurugram’s, air quality rests in the poor category whereas in Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Greater Noida it looms into very poor category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-like-swine-flu-covid-19-may-see-spike-during-winter-aiims-director/story-noRUJMgLnUv9kHmwxlbRsK.html
22-10-2020||India||Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh: States promise free Covid-19 vaccine after BJP’s poll promise in Bihar||A poll promise made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar is fast catching up with other state governments. Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh took a cue from the Bihar announcement to offer free vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami said on Thursday that once a vaccine for Covid-19 is developed, all people in Tamil Nadu will be immunised free of cost.“I would like to announce that as soon as the vaccine is developed (and made available to states) all people in Tamil Nadu will be immunised and the government shall bear the cost,” he said in Pudukottai during an official visit. Elections are due in Tamil Nadu next year.Shortly after this, Madhya Pradesh chief minister said that his government will also provide the Covid-19 vaccine to poor people of the state and the cost will be borne by the BJP government.“The day Covid-19 vaccine trial began in the country, the poor people started discussing if they will be able to bear the cost. Today, I want to clarify that every poor person will get free Covid-19 vaccine. We will win this battle,” Chouhan said in a tweet posted in Hindi. जब से देश में #COVID19 वैक्सीन का ट्रायल शुरू हुआ, देश के गरीब वर्ग में एक चर्चा भी शुरू हुई, "क्या हम ये खर्च वहन कर पाएँगे?"आज मैं स्पष्ट कर देना चाहता हूँ, मध्यप्रदेश में हर एक गरीब प्रदेशवासी को मुफ्त वैक्सीन मिलेगी।हम ये जंग जीतेंगे। pic.twitter.com/XcMaGYF70IHowever, there were some criticism of the BJP’s announcement with the party’s estranged ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) questioning of free vaccine is meant only for Bihar. “Free vaccine only in Bihar? It’s ridiculous! Does the whole country not pay taxes or are they not equal citizens of India? It’s the GoI’s duty to vaccinate the entire country. Using this life saving vaccine as a tool for votes is totally unethical,” SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal tweeted using hashtags #VaccineForVotes #COVID19. Free vaccine only in Bihar?

The Congress government in Punjab passed a resolution against the farm laws in the state Assembly earlier this week.The BJP, meanwhile, clarified that vaccine will be provided to all the people in the country at nominal costs. “Your attempt to twist Smt Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement reeks of desperation. All parties issue manifestos. Vaccines will be made available to all Indians at nominal costs. States can make it free.

22-10-2020||India||Serum Institute joins hands with German pharma major to develop Covid-19 treatment||Non-profit scientific research organisation IAVI, vaccine major Serum Institute of India and global science and technology firm Merck KGaA have entered into an agreement to develop monoclonal antibodies to fight Covid-19 and to ensure their prompt and equitable global access.The agreement is “to develop SARS-CoV-2 neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) co-invented by IAVI and Scripps Research as innovative interventions to address the Covid-19 pandemic”, the partners said in a statement on Thursday. The agreement builds on the advanced antibody discovery and optimisation expertise of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and Scripps Research, and on Germany’s Merck KGaA’s and Serum Institute’s significant capabilities in design and scale up of accelerated manufacturing processes for mAb production, it added. If the SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody candidates being advanced through this partnership are shown to be efficacious in clinical trials, either as a single antibody or a potential combination of both candidates, Merck KGaA will lead commercialisation in developed countries, the statement said. Serum Institute will lead global manufacturing as well as commercialisation in low- and middle-low-income countries, including India, it added. “We’re acutely aware of the tremendous potential for monoclonal antibodies to be used in Covid-19 response. By combining the scientific achievements of IAVI and Scripps Research with our partners’ development, manufacturing, and distribution expertise, we are hopeful that this partnership will result in globally accessible antibodies that are available to all who can benefit from them,” IAVI President and CEO Mark Feinberg said.    On the agreement, Merck KGaA vice chair of the executive board and deputy CEO  Belén Garijo said: “Together with IAVI and Serum Institute, we look forward to demonstrating the potential application of these monoclonal antibodies in the management of Covid-19.” We share a common purpose to accelerate this promising science and deliver effective solutions that address global challenges presented by this pandemic, he added.    “I am extremely pleased that we have joined forces with IAVI and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the fight against Covid-19 with the aim of developing monoclonal antibodies for global access,” Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla said. Under IAVI’s agreement with Merck KGaA and Serum Institute, the partners will conduct an accelerated, integrated program of preclinical and clinical research to evaluate the antibodies for treatment of Covid-19. A Phase I clinical trial is expected to start early in 2021, the statement said. Should the mAb candidates being developed be shown to be safe and efficacious, Merck KGaA and Serum Institute will help ensure that the therapy is rapidly and widely available and accessible, it added.   Joining the partners in this development effort are contract research and manufacturing firm Syngene International and bioengineering company ATUM, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-joins-hands-with-german-pharma-major-to-develop-covid-19-treatment/story-tZIoLg52mVqkNlIGvdhceL.html
22-10-2020||India||Assam cabinet announces funding for gaushalas to feed cows||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in Assam on Thursday approved to provide funds to ‘gaushalas’ (cow shelters) in the state to feed cattle. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal. “Gaushalas are usually operated by trusts with public donations. But in some cases that money isn’t enough to feed the cows. Hence, the cabinet decided to do gap-funding of the additional amount needed by them,” parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary told journalists. The oldest ‘gaushala’ of the state - Shree Gauhati Gaushala - was started in 1916. It has over 1,300 cows at present. The cabinet also decided to ask the state election commission to conduct elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) within December 15. “It was decided that till the election process gets over, the ongoing Governor’s rule in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) areas will continue,” Patowary said. Elections to BTC, which was ruled by Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), a partner in the BJP-led ruling coalition, was scheduled in April this year. But the entire Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD), which comprises four districts, was placed under Governor’s rule the same month as polls could not be held due to the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cabinet-announces-funding-to-gaushalas-to-feed-cows/story-FrZHjmil9J76PTFWKHdAzM.html
22-10-2020||India||Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper in India next week for third 2+2 strategic dialogue||The ministry of external affairs on Thursday played down questions about India hosting the strategic 2+2 dialogue with the US just a week ahead of the American elections, saying the timing of the talks was largely in line with those of the two previous meetings. Experts have questioned the rationale of holding the key talks between the foreign and defence ministers of the two sides at a time when the US election could lead to a change of government. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper will be on a two-day visit to India for the dialogue with their counterparts S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh on October 27. Asked about this issue at the weekly news briefing, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “As regards the timing of the meeting, you would know that diplomatic calendars have their logic. You will notice that the earlier two meetings have also been held towards the end of the year.” Also Read: On India-US agenda, a plan to share defence intel from Ladakh to South China SeaThe maiden 2+2 dialogue was held in New Delhi in September 2018 and the second one in Washington in December 2019. The third dialogue will see India and the US consolidating their diplomatic and security ties, including institutionalised intelligence-sharing and efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) is also on the cards to facilitate sharing of classified satellite and sensor data. “The third 2+2 ministerial dialogue will entail a comprehensive discussion on cross-cutting bilateral issues of mutual interest. In addition, both sides will exchange views on salient regional and global issues,” Srivastava said, declining to go into details. The discussions during these dialogues have enabled both sides to take forward their relationship and strengthen the institutional framework for cooperation across all sectors, he said. Pompeo and Esper will also have bilateral meetings with their counterparts, and meet National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mike-pompeo-mark-esper-in-india-next-week-for-third-2-2-strategic-dialogue/story-5uWTyQgz5U5KZEkMDJ7RcO.html

In a series of tweets, Siddaramiah, a former chief minister, “Nalin is the face of the anti-Yediyurappa squad within BJP and he has been given the task to create strong opposition against Yediyurappa within their party. This squad is working tirelessly to lose in by-elections and eventually blame B S Yediyurappa for the loss.”The surprising backhanded support from Siddaramiah to the CM came two days after former Union minister and senior BJP leader Basvraj Patil Yatnal claimed that Yediyurappa’s days as CM were numbered. Yatnal also said that the party high command would replace Yediyurappa with a north Karnataka leader shortly.Siddaramaiah also said, “Kateel lacks spine to control his leaders. He does not have any capability to take action against his own party leaders who are targeting his own party Chief Minister.” The Congress leader also claimed that Kateel is a ‘cave dwelling wild man’ and ‘immature.’Earlier in the day independent legislator H Nagesh who supports the BJP and is currently the excise minister of the state, said that any move to jettison Yediyurappa would “finish not just the BJP government but the saffron party in the state”.Kateel who is also the MP from Dakshina Kannada district on the campaign trail in the Sira assembly segment which goes to bypolls on November 3, again clarified that there was no question of any change in leadership and that Yediyurappa would be the CM for the rest of the term. Refusing to comment further on the issue he said, “K S Eswharappa (Panchayati Raj Minister) and C T Ravi (national general secretary of BJP) have already made the party’s stance clear.”Kateel also hit out at Siddaramiah on Twitter. “I think your (twitter) account must have been hacked, if so please complain to the police. This kind of language doesn’t bring you respect. In case the account has not been hacked, I sympathize at your intolerance,” he wrote.Political analyst Manjunath commenting on Siddaramiah’s remarks said “The Congress leader is trying to just further the real internal divisions which exist between various factions within BJP. It is a fact that a section of BJP wants to oust Yediyurappa from Chief Ministership. Kateel is more of a Hindutva hardliner compared to Yediyurappa and thus the CLP leader’s remarks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-dissidence-in-bjp-bs-yediyurappa-finds-unlikely-supporter-in-siddaramiah/story-nacR3cZNA8zNFIhPEcqeiI.html
22-10-2020||India||Telangana pegs flood damage at Rs 9,400 cr as Central team visits Hyderabad||The Telangana government on Thursday projected an estimated loss of crops, properties and infrastructure to the extent of around Rs 9,400 crore due to recent heavy rains and flash floods in the state. Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar made a presentation to a five-member central team led by Praveen Vasishta, joint secretary in the Union ministry of finance on the extent of damage caused due to floods. A photo exhibition was arranged to depict the damages caused by the floods. The team, including R B Kaul, consultant, Union ministry of finance, K Manoharan, director, agriculture, S K Kushwaha, senior executive from transport and highways department and M Raghuram from Union ministry of water resources, went round several flood-affected areas in Hyderabad to assess the magnitude of the damage. At an interaction with the central team later, the chief secretary said the damage to public infrastructure was enormous. While the loss to crops was estimated at Rs 8,633 crore, loss to roads was estimated to be around Rs 222 crore. In Greater Hyderabad, the loss to the properties and roads is estimated to be around Rs 567 crore, he said. He said the state government had released Rs 550 crore for immediate flood relief measures and requested the central team to recommend liberal assistance from the Centre. Officials of various departments told the central team that there was an excess rainfall during the last 10 days, resulting in flooding of several residential colonies. The damage was more in Hyderabad and the surrounding districts. There were major breaches to three major tanks coupled with flooding in Musi river which inundated all low-lying areas. Earlier, the central team inspected the restoration works at Chandrayangutta, including repairs to road over bridge and removal of debris from nalas. The residents brought to the notice of the team members that flood water had entered their houses up to the first floor. The team noticed that many houses were still reeling under water. The GHMC officials, who accompanied the central team, said the inundation of colonies was mainly due to breaching of the Palle Cheruvu tank. The central team inspected the damages to properties, household articles and vehicles and also severely damaged roads and drains. The team visited Balapur, Hafeez Baba Nagar colonies in the old city, which were inundated due to breach of various tanks nearby. Praveen Vasishtra, the team leader, suggested taking up of permanent measures to avoid breaches of tanks in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-pegs-flood-damage-at-rs-9-400-cr-as-central-team-visits-hyderabad/story-vm4rCmrYHZYHn4lj5Fq56O.html

Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing that Pakistan had addressed only 21 of the 27 items in an action plan given by FATF to curb terror financing and money laundering. His remarks came against the backdrop of the multilateral watchdog’s virtual plenary meeting, which is widely expected to decide by Friday on retaining Pakistan in its “grey list”. Watch | India calls Pakistan ‘safe havens for terror entities’ ahead of FATF test Srivastava said Pakistani forces arrayed along the Line of Control (LoC) had carried out “3,800 unprovoked ceasefire violations” this year as part of efforts to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir. There were also efforts to drop arms and ammunition across the ceasefire line and smuggle weapons and narcotics across the international boundary using drones, he said. Also Read: Pak ISI finds its inspiration in IS tactics, preps to rain drone bombs in J&K“As is well known, Pakistan continues to provide safe havens to terrorist entities and individuals and has also not yet taken any action against several terrorist entities and individuals, including those proscribed by the UN Security Council, such as [JeM chief] MasoodAzhar, Dawood Ibrahim and (Lashkar-e-Taiba operations commander) Zakirur Rahman Lakhvi,” he said. “It is understood that Pakistan has addressed only 21 action items so far out of the total 27 points in FATF’s action plan. Six important action items are yet to be addressed,” he said. Though Srivastava did not give details, people familiar with developments said these six items included action against non-profit organisations and charities used by terror groups such as JeM and LeT to raise funds, and the prosecution of individuals linked to the illegal financial activities of terror groups.Also Read: Imran Khan window dresses Pak record on terror, gets groups to change tacticsSrivastava noted that FATF has well laid out standards and procedures for putting a country in its grey list or list of nations under increased monitoring and its black list or list of “high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action”. After a country is put on a list, it is assigned an action plan to be implemented in a stipulated timeframe. He said those found wanting in implementing their obligations are “held accountable and subjected to appropriate action”. He added the issue of Pakistan’s compliance is being looked into by the virtual FATF plenary meeting that will get over on Friday. In February, FATF had warned Pakistan that all deadlines for implementing the action plan had expired. It is widely expected Pakistan will be retained in the grey list. Srivastava accused Pakistani troops of continuing to engage in unprovoked ceasefire violations, often from civilian areas, to “support the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC”. This, he said, is a clear violation of the 2003 ceasefire understanding between the two sides. “This year, till date, Pakistani forces have carried out 3,800 unprovoked ceasefire violations. There have also been attempts to drop arms and ammunition across the LoC in the garb of civilian activities. We have also witnessed that Pakistan’s aid and abetment to cross-border terrorism [and] smuggling of arms and narcotic substances has spilled over to the international boundary, including through use of drones and quadcopters,” he said. India has maintained that there can be no dialogue with Pakistan till the neighbouring country stops backing cross-border terror.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-continues-to-provide-safe-havens-to-terrorist-entities-says-india/story-hbCPVid1kxbxpRfXZM8VoK.html
22-10-2020||India||Onion prices continue to remain high at Rs 80-120 per kg across states||Onion prices ranged between Rs 80 to Rs 120 per kg in the retail markets in different cities, upsetting the household grocery budgets that are witnessing a constraint due to higher vegetable prices in the past one month.The high price is expected till mid-November when the new onion crop from some parts of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh is expected to arrive in the markets.There is a short supply of onions as crops have been damaged due to excessive rains in October in parts of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.In Lasalgaon, Asia’s biggest onion market, the prices of onions soared to Rs 7,050 per quintal on Thursday from Rs 4,801 per quintal a month ago.Narendra Wadhavane, secretary Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), Lasalga, said there is a tremendous shortage of onions due to the devastation caused by the rains.“We hardly have 4000 quintal of stock in the market currently compared to the normal 12,000 to 15,000 quintals in normal times,” Wadhavane said, adding that one-tenth of the trucks are bringing produce to the market as compared to normal times.On Thursday, onion was being sold at Rs 120 per kilogram in Chandigarh. “There is huge short storage of onions coming from Maharashtra,” said a vegetable trader, Rashwinder Singh, at Chandigarh wholesale fruit and vegetable market.In the industrial town of Ludhiana, onion has gone missing from the daily menu of many families as the prices touched Rs 100 per kilogram with the average price in the past two months being Rs 50.“We are not getting the requisite supply from Nashik. Crop from Rajasthan will take another month to arrive. Till then the prices will remain high,” said Gurkamal Singh, president, Arhtiya Association in Ludhiana district.In Lucknow, the retail price of onion was Rs 80 per kilo, double from the rate a fortnight ago. “A fortnight earlier the mandi onion prices were between Rs 30 and Rs 33,” said Sabir (who goes by the first name), saying as prices have risen there are also not enough buyers.Meera Yadav (54) gives the reason for Sabir not having buyers.“Onion is selling at Rs 80 per kg. Potato is at Rs 60 kg. Tomato at Rs 60 kg and gourd is selling at Rs 40 per kg. For a middle-class family like us which runs on limited income, we have no option but to reduce buying of these vegetables and cut on education to manage the household budget,” he said.Bhopal-based Ankur Tandon, resident of Sarabha Nagar, who works with a private marketing firm, said his entire monthly budget has gone haywire. “We are already managing with difficulty as my wife, who worked as a nursery teacher lost her job during the lockdown and I suffered a salary cut. The rising prices of onions have upset the entire budget,” he said.In Mumbai, a kilogram of onions was being sold for 100 on Thursday. Khushi Gupta, who lives in Lokhandwala, Andheri, said the rise in prices has turned into a double whammy for her.“We are now cutting down on the use of onions as we have already suffered due to lockdown. I don’t have a job for the last seven months and this has only made things worse,” she said.Hemlata Joshi, a housewife from Jeolikote in Uttarakhand’s Nainital, said, “We have almost stopped using onion in our dishes given the sky-high prices. The state government should do something to control the rate of vegetables like potatoes and onion in hilly areas.”Residents, however, believe that vendors are making a huge profit. Sandeep Bhalla, secretary of federation of sector welfare associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said as weekly sector mandis are closed, vendors are taking advantage and are charging higher rates than approved by the local administration. “People have no option but to bring down consumption,” he said.Hotels and restaurants have either stopped giving onions in salad or have increased prices of dishes. Chandar Prakash Khanduri, a dhaba owner in Library Bazaar in Haldwani, said, “We have been left with no option but to increase the prices of the vegetables that have onion as one of the ingredients.”Rajasthan, from where onion supply is likely to start from mid-November, has some good news. President Muhana Mandi in Jaipur, Rahul Tanwar said onions from Sikar and other places would come by mid-November. “The crop is good and it can put a check on the surge of onion prices,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onion-prices-continue-to-remain-high-at-rs-80-120-per-kg-across-states/story-hUlcNuoqri8x2luNTcO3jJ.html
22-10-2020||India||Assam-Mizoram border issue: Trucks resume movement after 4 days||A day after Assam and Mizoram agreed to restore peace and normalcy on the interstate boundary following a clash, movement of trucks carrying essential items has resumed after four days, officials of the two states said on Thursday.Trucks that got stranded on both sides of the border since the clash between the people of the two states on Saturday night have started moving since this morning, though a major student body of Mizoram has launched a blockade on National Highway-306, which links the two neighbouring states.The student body Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) said it has started the blockade at Vairengte in Mizoram’s Kolasib district near the border since Wednesday evening, claiming that people of Lailapur in Assam’s Cachar district have also put up a blockade.MZP president B Vanlaltana said that the agitation was also intended to protect Mizoram’s territory and mount pressure on the Centre and the state governments to resolve the long-standing inter-state border dispute.Vanlaltana said that 11 MZP leaders, including the vice-president Peter Chhangte were arrested in the small hours of Thursday for staging the blockade. The police, however denied this.Kolasib district Superintendent of Police Vanlalfaka Ralte, told PTI that some trucks carrying essential commodities have entered the state under police escort on Thursday morning from neighbouring Cachar district of Assam.Cachar district official spokesperson said, “More than 140 trucks have crossed over to Mizoram since this morning. A few trucks have also reached Lailapur from across the border.” Meanwhile, Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga has instructed officials to ask security forces not to withdraw from the border areas till a final decision is made by the Centre on the matter and normalcy returns to the area.Several people were injured in the clash that occurred between the people of the two states, during which several makeshift huts were torched on Saturday night.A home secretary-level meeting was held on Wednesday on the issue, in which the joint secretary to the ministry of home affairs (in-charge of North East), Satyendra Garg, was also present.Both the states agreed to restore peace and tranquillity along the border areas, provide security and instil a sense of safety among the people there.Garg held meetings with the Mizoram chief secretary and NGOs on Thursday in Aizawl over the border issue. He also called on Chief Minister Zoramthanga, officials said.Mizoram shares a 164.6-km border with Assam. Several dialogues held since 1995 to resolve the boundary problem have yielded little results.Meanwhile, a report from Imphal said that the Kuki Inpi Manipur, the apex body of Kuki tribes of Manipur, urged the Assam government to restore peace and normalcy in its border with Mizoram so that supply of essential commodities is not affected in the area.Kukis belong to a kindred tribe of the Mizos and they live mainly Manipur’s southern district of Churachandpur which shares border with both Mizoram and Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-border-issue-trucks-resume-movement-after-4-days/story-B01isfyA4zHOdiv8MTzo4I.html
22-10-2020||India||Uttarakhand forest dept buys inflatable boat for river patrol along Nepal border||The Uttarakhand forest department has procured an inflatable boat for patrolling Sharda islands in Sharda river along Indo-Nepal border in Champawat district, forest officials said Thursday.The Haldwani forest division for Sharda range will use the boat to patrol the Sharda river in which two big islands are situated.“Forest personnel will conduct effective patrolling to avoid timber smuggling from this area,” said Kundan Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO), Haldwani forest division in the Kumaon region. Sharda river which is known as Mahakali in Nepal, forms a natural international border between India and Nepal in Uttarakhand. In Tanakpur area of Champawat district some small forest areas fall in the midst of the river islands. Forest officials have to use Tanakpur barrage and Nepalese territory to reach such forest islands. Forest officials said usually, forest patrolling staff could reach Sharda island by road only after crossing Bramhadev village of Kanchanpur district of Nepal. Apart from this, forest personnel can reach the island only by crossing the Sharda river. Since the international border has been sealed since March, it has thwarted regular patrolling of these islands and there is apprehension of illegal tree felling and timber smuggling,said an official. Kumar said two small forest islands - forest island 57 and 58 and spread over 830 hectares - are located in the river and had been difficult to patrol. “We have limited sources. Forest patrolling staff were using tyre tubes to reach the Sharda island and crossing the Sharda river. This puts their lives at risk all the time,” he said. There is no outboard motor in the boat and is has to be rowed.The officer also said that they were considering procuring a motor boat but maintenance and safety of the motor boat was a big challenge. “So, we decided to procure an inflatable boat. This boat can be deflated, moved around and stored easily,” said Kumar Mahesh Singh Bisht, ranger, Sharda range, Tanakpur, said, “We are yet to use the raft but it will be very useful as well as comfortable for our staff to conduct round the year patrolling and monitoring of forests along the international border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-forest-dept-buys-inflatable-boat-for-river-patrol-along-nepal-border/story-Br6JIEqHCOYJUmYcJTo2UM.html

22-10-2020||India||On Congress leader’s complaint, Chhattisgarh police file FIR against scribe||The Chhattisgarh police filed an FIR against a local video journalist in Ambikapur district after he reported the plight of some farmers whose paddy crops were ruined in an anti-encroachment drive by the municipal corporation.The journalist, identified as Manish Soni, was booked for allegedly using explicit and derogatory language on Wednesday, said police.The case was registered on the complaint of Congress Mayor of Ambikapur Ajay Tirki.However, Soni, while denying the charges, claimed that the action against him was taken with a malafide intention and the video on the basis of which the FIR was registered was ‘edited’ by some other people. “The police have not done any primary investigation and registered a case against me,” Soni alleged.Notably, last month Soni was booked in another case for allegedly putting up an objectionable post over an encounter between security forces and Maoists. “The accused has made a video which was circulated in social media, in which derogatory language and abuses were hurled. We have registered a case under 294 Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the IT Act and started investigation,” Inspector General of Police ( Surguja ) Ratanlal Dangi told Hindustan Times.The IG further said that if the accused is claiming that the video, which was circulated, was not made by him, he can submit the original video to the police.“If he submits the original video which he made, we will investigate it forensically and the case will be taken back,” the IG added. Soni talking to HT said that he had done a story about an anti-encroachment drive by the municipal corporation for news agencies and was taken up by various channels of the country.“The story was covered by other news channels due to which the municipal corporation went against me. Second, the affected farmers have also lodged a written complaint against the employees of Municipal Corporation in Gandhi Nagar police station, claiming that no notices were served before the anti-encroachment drive. Hence, some people were not happy with my news report and I believe that they have distorted my video and made a meme. On the basis of that distorted video, police have registered a case without any primary investigation,” said Soni.Reacting to the allegations of Soni that he was framed, Mayor Tirki said, “I was not aware that the video was edited or original. The video has abusive content and it was circulated everywhere on social media. If the video was edited, why did Soni not complain that his video was distorted and is being circulated?”Earlier this month, a Bastar-based journalist, Kamal Shukla, was allegedly beaten by the Congress leader in Kanker and journalists across the state protested.Shukla went on hunger strike demanding removal of Superintendent of Police and Collector. Later, the state government removed a station house officer (SHO) for negligence. The state unit of the BJP expressed concerns over the government targeting the journalists of the state. “Congress government and its party leaders are continuously harassing the journalists in the state. In the recent Kamal Shukla incident, we have seen how the Congress leader has beaten a senior journalist. They can never accept criticism and try to pressurise the media in the state. This is the death of democracy,” said senior leader and BJP spokesperson Sachhinand Upsane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-congress-leader-s-complaint-chhattisgarh-police-file-fir-against-scribe/story-VoCe64Vg2vqKVW7striUML.html

The announcement was part of several promises made in its 11-point Sankalp Patra.BJP’s announcement to provide free Covid-19 vaccine in poll-bound Bihar did not quite go well with the opposition. Bhupendra Yadav, the party’s national general secretary and in-charge of Bihar, said the announcement should not be seen as a poll promise and that health is an important aspect of public policy.“If parties are allowed to talk about alleviating hunger and poverty, improving the lot of the farmers and offering jobs, why should they not talk about public health?

22-10-2020||India||Chinese media meant to threaten India, ends up confessing role in northeast||An ambush in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tirap sector that led to the death of an Assam Rifles soldier on Tuesday has put the spotlight back on China’s role to fuel insurgency in the northeast. Tuesday’s attack by the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) came a week after China’s propaganda arm warned the Narendra Modi government against signing a much-speculated trade pact with Taiwan, threatening that Beijing could retaliate by supporting North-East separatists and stop recognising Sikkim as a part of India.Indian security officials said the timing of the attack by the NSCN-I-M, which has had a long history of links with the Chinese state actors, was mostly probably a coincidence but the Chinese state media’s threat had laid bare a truth wrapped in many layers of deniability in the past - links between North-East insurgent groups and Beijing.Although the links between Naga and Manipur insurgents to elements in the Chinese establishment date back to much before the 1971 war, the 1975 Shillong Accord between Government of India and Naga National Council was opposed by leaders such as SS Khaplang and Thuingaleng Muivah, who were then called the China Return Gang. Together, Khaplang and Muivah formed the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) in 1980. They parted ways eight years later in 1988 to set up their own outfits; Muivah formed the NSCN (I-M) faction along with Isak Chishi Swu while Khaplang called his faction NSCN (K).To be sure, the NSCN (I-M), which is currently in talks with the government for resolution of the Naga issue, maintains that it does not have any links to the Chinese government. This claim, however, has been furiously contested by security officials and independent experts.Like Swedish-born northeast expert Bertil Lintner who, in his 2016 book “Great Game East: India, China and the struggle for Asia’s most volatile frontier”, documented how the leadership of first, the NSCN (I-M), and later Manipur’s People’s Liberation Army, were feted by the Chinese leadership for years. NSCN (I-M) co-founder Isak Chishi Swu, who died in 2016, had last made a quiet trip to Beijing as late as 2009.Nearly 15 years earlier, a top leader of insurgent group United Liberation Front of Asom Lohit Deuri had given security agencies graphic details of how unmarked Chinese weapons were transferred from Chinese ships to Bangladeshi dhow on the high seas and brought to India’s north-east, particularly Mizoram via land route during the Indo-Myanmar joint crackdown in the mid-nineties, codenamed Operation Golden Bird. Deuri, who belonged to the Paresh Barua group now called ULFA Independent, surrendered in 2000.Detailed interrogation of subsequent arrests of ULFA leaders also revealed that Chinese actors were behind the supply of 10 truck loads of arms to ULFA, All Tripura Tiger Force and the PLA in Manipur in 2004. The massive quantity of arms , grenades, rockets and ammunition seized from Chittagong Fertilizer jetty in Bangladesh on 1 April 2004 again had been transferred to a dhow from a Chinese ship on the high seas in Bay of Bengal.On 2 August 2010, Anthony Shimray, a senior NSCN (I-M) insurgent who oversaw supply of arms to the outfit, was picked up at Patna airport by Indian security officials. His interrogation led the Thai police to arrest arms dealer Willy Narue on 31 August. Interrogation of these two arms suppliers confirmed that two Chinese arms companies were to be paid $ 1 million for supply of weapons to north-east insurgents via ship from China’s port city of Dalian and then transported to India via land corridor in north Myanmar in October-November 2010.In January 2011, Indian agencies caught Chinese intelligence agent Qing Wang after she dodged local officials to enter Nagaland’s Dimapur without the mandatory restricted area permit and held an unauthorised meeting with Thuingaleng Muivah. She was deported for violating her visa conditions. During her detention, security officials, however, recovered her photographs with I-M leader Muivah, Nepal Maoist leader Prachanda and Kachin insurgent leaders on her laptop. A resident of Beijing, Qing posed as a journalist and left for Dimapur on Brahmaputra Mail from Old Delhi railway station on January 15, 2011 with Naga youth. It was found that she was an agent of the People’s Security Bureau and had visited India on a different passport in August 2010 by landing in Kolkata from Kunming in Yunnan Province of China.People familiar with the north-east insurgency said ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who is on the run in India, lives in Ruili in Yunnan Province across the Myanmar border with China. He isn’t the only one.The Chinese link with north-eastern groups was raised by Indian National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon with State councillor Dai Bingguo at the 15th India-China Special Representative talks in January 2012. Dai totally denied the Chinese involvement and instead accused India of training and funding Tibetan insurgents against China.One of India’s most-senior experts on the north-east insurgency said the Chinese links with insurgent groups often used Pakistani deep state’s links in Bangladesh and the region. “But it is common knowledge that China wants to keep the pot boiling for India in the north-east with calibrated escalation,” added another top north-east expert in the national security system.The Chinese propaganda machine just spelt out the truth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-state-media-s-warning-to-india-on-taiwan-also-packs-in-a-confession/story-P4v2s5J77VhD3M8DBTvaRO.html

The visit comes at a time when India and China are locked in border tensions in the sensitive Ladakh sector.News agency ANI reported that Singh will visit Sikkim on October 23-24 and also inaugurate a number of road projects and strategic bridges built for easy movement of troops and common citizens to border areas.The defence minister is also likely to do “shastra puja” with one of the local units deployed in Sikkim at the forward location near the China border. As per Hindu tradition, the puja is performed annually at the time of Dussehra by warriors.The minister’s upcoming visit seeks to boost the morale of soldiers deployed in forward areas, the officials said.Last year, Singh had performed the shastra puja in France while receiving India’s first Rafale fighter aircraft from there.While the Ladakh sector has been the focus of the current round of border tensions with China, a tense confrontation between Indian and Chinese soldiers took place in north Sikkim in early May, just days after a brawl between rival troops on the northern bank of Pangong Tso.A skirmish at Naku La in Sikkim left four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers injured on May 9.The standoff, currently in its sixth month, has taken India-China ties to a new low, with troops even firing warning shots at friction points in August-September. This was the first instance of shots being fired along the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-likely-to-visit-sikkim-on-friday-will-spend-dussehra-with-troops/story-PnNBB23U2q5Y2n4biJ4EgL.html
22-10-2020||India||Uttarakhand’s Covid-19 case fatality rate higher than national average||At 1.62%, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Uttarakhand is higher than the national average of 1.51%, according to the Centre’s data. Since the pandemic began in mid-March, 960 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Uttarakhand due to the virus and co-morbidities. Dehradun tops the list with more than half the casualties at 550 deaths followed by the three districts of Nainital (137), Haridwar (119) and US Nagar (84) in the plains. Comparatively, the hilly districts have reported less deaths with Chamoli district reporting only a single casualty so far. There are 14 states in the country where the CFR is less than 1 % according to the data released by the Central government on October 21. Some of these states include Jharkhand, Bihar, Assam, Kerala and Telangana.In case of other states including Uttarakhand, the Centre has advised them to aim at bringing down the CFR to below 1%. While the recovery rate at the national level is 88.81%, in Uttarakhand, with 52,632 people having recovered out of 59,106 people who tested positive so far, the recovery rate has reached 89.05%. Out of Uttarakhand’s Covid-19 tally of 59,106, Dehradun district has reported the maximum of 16,434 cases followed by Haridwar (10,680), US Nagar (9,257) and Nainital (6949). The Himalayan state has so far tested over 9.41 lakh samples of which results of over 14,400 are awaited. The state currently has 69 containment zones in seven districts including a maximum of 30 in Dehradun district. Abhishek Tripathi, chief operational officer for Covid-19 in Uttarakhand said there are possibly many reasons for high fatality rate in the state compared to the national level. “With a large number of people having returned to the state, many of them also tested positive and died later. We are also getting many cases from Western Uttar Pradesh region at AIIMS Rishikesh. These are adding up here. Also, we have increased testing. We are conducting 8,000 to 10,000 tests daily. So it is natural that more people will be detected positive and accordingly death rate will also see a little surge. Then many people who have died due to other reasons like accidents, have also tested positive later. And maximum people have died due to comorbidities. But we are reporting all deaths of Covid-19 positive people,” he said. Anoop Nautiyal, from NGO Social Development for Communities Foundation, who has been analysing the Covid-19 data in Uttarakhand, said the state has been doing good with respect to most Covid metrics except for the death rate. “Recovery rate in the state is higher than at the national level, active cases have also reduced in the state, testing has been increased; the only concern that remains is higher death rate than the national average. Apart from efforts by the government, people should also report about complicated cases faster to the health authorities, so that death due to comorbidities is reduced,”, he said Nautiyal said CFR increased primarily from the first week of September and due to such a trend, the overall death rate has also increased in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-s-covid-19-case-fatality-rate-higher-than-national-average/story-7i1AcOldE14CzqrmEFEH9K.html
22-10-2020||India||‘Both nuclear powers India & China cannot afford to have a full-fledged war’:Lt Gen (Retd) Hooda||“The tense situation at Indo-China border in Eastern Ladakh will continue and will not ease-off as Chinese Army (PLA) has adopted to a stubborn stance and is not ready to disengage on-ground,” said Lt Gen (Retd) Deependra Singh Hooda, Former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Northern Command.The veteran army general was speaking during the Virtual Meet on ‘The Future of Indo-China Relations’, organized by Chandigarh University, Gharuan. The Virtual Meet was attended by former Indian Army General, former Indian Navy Chief, National Security Experts, and Senior Administration Officials of Government of Punjab who interacted with the students to apprise them about the on-ground situation between the two Asian powers.Amongst other dignitaries who took part in the Virtual Meet on Indo-China relations included Admiral (Retd) Sunil Lanba, former Indian Navy Chief and Ex-Chairman of Chiefs of Staff Committee, Lt Gen (Retd) Parveen Bakshi, former General Office Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Command, Indian Army, Bharat Karnad, National Security Expert and Emeritus Professor, Centre for Policy Research and Rahul Bhandari (IAS), Secretary Higher Education, Water Resources, Mines & Geology, Government of Punjab.“Although a series of military level, diplomatic level and ministerial level talks have taken place between the two countries over the period of last months, yet the Chinese (PLA) has refused to disengage at ground level and maintain status-quo at Line of Actual Control (LAC). There might be some local incidents at LAC but both nuclear powers India & China cannot afford to have a full-fledged war,” said Lt Gen (Retd) Hooda, while giving details about the current border situation.“Both India and China have deployed huge number of army personnel who have prepared themselves for long term eyeball to eyeball situation, but Indian Army has a tactical advantage over Chinese (PLA), as the Indian Security Forces have operating experience at higher altitudes & hilly terrains in harsh winters,” Gen Hooda further added.“Currently there is huge trade imbalance between India and China which can be ascertained from the fact that Chinese products have 2.7 per cent penetration in Indian markets while Indian goods have merely 0.1 per cent penetration in Chinese markets. India’s 68 per cent of pharmaceutical formulations and 90 per cent of antibiotic medicines are currently coming from China,” said Rahul Bhandari, Secretary, Higher Education, Water Resources, Mines & Geology, Government of Punjab, while talking about the economic front.“Banning of social apps by Indian Government has not greatly impacted the Chinese Economy, as we are currently importing large number of goods like solar components, electronic goods, IT Hardware, Telecom Components, mobile phones, fertilizers and it will take India 5-10 years to be either self-reliant or search for new partners who can meet our technology needs,” Bhandari further added.Replying on the question of the possible threat of cyber attack by China, Admiral (Retd) Sunil Lanba said, “Indian Government is conscious about the fact that China has intruded deep into our technology and communication eco-system through the supply of components by the Chinese firms and that the threat of cyber attack from our hostile neighbor is real. Although the government is taking pre-emptive steps by increasing a nationwide alert and stepped up monitoring by intelligence agencies, but a lot has to be done in terms of hardware & technology installation.” “India should not rely on USA as it has not been a reliable ally which can be ascertained from the cases of Japan and South Korea. We should include South Asian countries like Vietnam, Taiwan as the fourth pillar of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) who understands the ecosystem in Indo-Pacific region,” said Bharat Karnad, National Security Expert and Emeritus Professor, Centre for Policy Research. “India needs to speed-up its defence spending as the gap between China’s Defence Budget and Indian Defence Budget will touch US$ 500 billion by 2030 which create regional imbalance between the two Asian countries,” he further said.

Over 90 lakh free gas connections given under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana,” said PM Modi. “Be it opening bank accounts of 22 crore women under Jan Dhan Yojana, granting governance to women under Mudra Scheme, be it Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, or law against triple talaq, whether it’s free checkup facility during pregnancy for women or nutrition campaign or permanent commission in the Army, constant work is being done to empower the country’s women power,” he added. In the self-reliant India campaign, the strength of women is very big, PM Modi said. Speaking about West Bengal, PM Modi said, it was the land of Bengal itself that worked to make “Swadeshi” a resolution in the freedom movement.“Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee gave the message of the self-reliant farmer and self-reliant life from the land of Bengal itself,” he added. “Durga Puja of Bengal gives a new glow to the perfection of India, gives new colours and gives new ‘Shringar’. It is the influence of Bengal’s awakening consciousness, Bengal’s spirituality and its historicity,” he said. PM Modi further stated, the great personalities from the land of Bengal, as and when required, with weapons and scripture, sacrifice and penance have served ‘Maa Bharati’. “I respectfully salute Ram Krishna Paramhans, Swami Vivekananda, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shri Aurobindo, Baba Loknath, Thakur Anukul Chandra, Maa Anandamayi and various other people like them. Many people might not know that the picture of Goddess Durga as Maa Bharati was also first made in Bengal by Abanindranath Tagore,” said PM Modi. The people of Bengal have such self-power, due to which they progress in every field and get achievements, said PM Modi. “People of Bengal have put the country on the path of progress and I believe they will continue to boost the country’s pride in a similar manner. Durga Puja is complete only when we overcome someone’s suffering or help a poor person,” he added. “The festival of Durga Puja is a festival that reflects the unity and strength of India. It is also a reflection of the traditions and culture that comes from Bengal,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister took part in the commencement of Durga Puja celebrations in Kolkata, West Bengal, via video link. He addressed the people of the state, being telecast in every booth of the state’s 294 constituencies, following social distancing norms.He also spoke in Bengali to wish the people of the State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-working-for-fast-development-of-west-bengal-pm-modi/story-PSSNEYAl5aKw9aQ1HHyHHK.html
22-10-2020||India||PM Modi’s Bengal poll pitch hinges on delivery of development, promise of change||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, while addressing the people of West Bengal on Durga Sasthi, which marks the beginning of Durga Puja, virtually set the tone for BJP’s campaign for the crucial 2021 assembly elections in the state. “The goal of Aatmanirbhar Bharat in the 21st century would be strengthened with the soil of Bengal,” Modi said, while quoting lines from Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore’s poem. The ruling Trinamool Congress is likely to face a tough challenge from the Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming polls. The BJP, which had made impressive gains in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by winning 18 of the 42 seats, has already given a call for a TMC-free Bengal in 2021. The Prime Minister interspersed his praise for the people of Bengal with an inventory of the schemes piloted by the BJP-led centre and how they have helped the state. “Houses have been built for at least three million poor people in Bengal under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Nine lakh poor women have received free gas connections under Ujjwala Yojana. Bank accounts have been opened for at least 40 million poor people in Bengal under Jan Dhan Yojana. Also under Jal Jeevan Mission, pipelines for safe drinking water have been installed in at least five lakh households in Bengal,” he said. The BJP has already decided not to project anyone as its chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming polls. Instead, the party had said that it would highlight the ‘achievements’ of the Modi-government to counter the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state. Also Read: PM Modi invokes Durga to reaffirm commitment to women’s empowermentModi also said that Rs 8,500 crore have been sanctioned for Kolkata’s East - West Metro corridor and roads are being built to boost infrastructure between Nepal, Bangladesh and India. “Our aim is that people of Bengal should face less hardships and their life becomes easier. The BJP led-union government has adopted a rising-east policy and a series of decisions have been taken for the development of eastern India. Bengal has to play an important role in this (reorientation) and become its centre,” he said, adding that efforts are being continuously made so that people of Bengal can avail the benefits of development and the state prospers. Also Read: Calcutta High Court refuses to lift ban on entry of visitors inside puja pandalsThe Prime Minister, in a bid to connect with the masses during the biggest festival of Bengal, started and ended his speech with a few lines in Bangla and took the freedom to frequently use words and Bengali phrases. The BJP’s Bengal unit made elaborate arrangements for the live viewing of PM Modi’s virtual address. TV screens were put up in all the 78,000 election booth areas across the state. BJP karyakartas took part in a Durga Puja organised at Salt Lake, a satellite city of Kolkata. Adding a word of caution, the Prime Minister urged people to follow all safety protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining distance from each other while organising the Durga Puja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-bengal-poll-pitch-hinges-on-delivery-of-development-promise-of-change/story-TvsLpVIKDnx4qvsFmLdF6I.html

He should not have resigned. As far as his allegation against me is concerned, he is speaking half-truth. He could have complained against me to the seniors.

22-10-2020||India||Free food grain for poor brought wheat prices crashing down, say traders||Traders who stocked wheat between April and June, hoping to earn greater profits by selling it later at a lucrative price anticipating a routine shortage in the later half of the year, are now a worried lot. To their utter disappointment, the wheat prices are at its lowest level in the state and also in the country, thanks to the free distribution of food grains— the government’s welfare intervention under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana to help the poor deal with the economic fallout of Covid-19 lockdown-- that is believed to have dramatically crashed the demand for wheat and flour (aata) in the market, say traders and officials.“Our firm purchased around 50,000 quintals of wheat from farmers/agents in April-May at or above the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,925 per quintal, fixed by the government. But today mandi wheat is selling for as low as around Rs 1,500 per quintal,” said Rajiv Sharma, manager of Lahoti Food Products Pvt Ltd in Lucknow’s Kasganj. According to Sharma, (atta) wheat flour and ‘maida’ (all purpose floor) sellers stock wheat in the months of April and May since wheat prices always soar August onwards due to its shortage after farmers sell their produce at the MSP to the government during the wheat procurement season between April and June.“But for the first time this year, wheat prices started dropping after July and reached its lowest level by September-October. Since the wheat prices are low, the price of ‘aata’ and ‘maida’ is also low in the same proportion, causing losses to the company,” Sharma explained. He said the wheat price in October last year was around Rs 2,000 per quintal which was above the MSP of Rs 1,840 per quintal. Also Read: Why Covid-19 pandemic has put the spotlight on contingency fundsRajendra Gupta, a prominent grain merchant in Lucknow, said that traders who had purchased stocks of wheat immediately after the harvesting to sell it later to customers, including flour mills, were in deep trouble this time as the low demand had brought the prices down substantially.Expressing a similar opinion, Pandey Ganj (Lucknow) Galla Vyapar Mandal leader Satish Kumar Tiwari said the market demand for wheat had been heavily curtailed resulting in a sharp price drop since July. “Few flour-mill owners are buying wheat from us since they do not have customers to purchase flour from them,” he said. “Now, most people come to us to get their own wheat grinded instead of buying flour from us,” said Lakhan Jaiswal, one flour-mill owner. Also Read: Coronavirus pandemic: What it takes to get to herd immunityAccording to Sharma, Gupta and Tiwari, the demand for wheat and flour started falling from July when the Central government started distributing free food grain to all ration card holders as a relief measure to mitigate the hardship of Covid-19 lockdown.“Free government distribution of ration alone is responsible for low demand for wheat and flour and hence the low prices,” Gupta said, “The situation will change only from December after the free ration distribution scheme ends in November,” he added.Under the free food grain distribution scheme, covering the state’s more than 80% population, each priority household with a public distribution system (PDS) card gets free five kg wheat/rice per head, per month plus one kg ‘chana’ or Bengal Gram per card per month. The Antyodaya families or the poorest families get a fixed quota of 35 kg food grain per card per month regardless of the number of family members. The free distribution is in addition to the regular food grain they get at a highly subsidized price of Rs 3 per kg for rice and Rs 2 per kg for wheat per head per month under the National Food Security Act.“If a family, for example, has five members, then it is getting 50 kg wheat and rice every month and this is more than enough for most families, obviating the need for them to buy wheat or flour from the market,” Sharma said.Food and civil supplies department additional commissioner (marketing), AK Singh also confirmed that the free distribution of ration did have a bearing on the market demand for wheat and on its price. “The impact of the free food distribution scheme on the demand and price of wheat products is quite palpable,” he said. Sources said a similar situation prevailed in most other states. “In fact, wheat prices are even lower in other states, including Punjab, Haryana, MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra,” they said, quoting Agmarknet data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-food-grain-for-poor-brought-wheat-prices-crashing-down-say-traders/story-BkX3sFxeWEhbMEbUCkto9O.html

The charred remains of the boy were recovered from Rallapusalapalli hillocks near Annaram village, a few kilometres from Mahabubabad town on Thursday morning, after the police arrested the accused – Manda Sagar from the town. Mahabubabad superintendent of police Nandyala Koti Reddy told reporters that Sagar had strangled the boy to death and later set the body ablaze within a couple of hours of kidnapping him. “Preliminary inquiries revealed that Sagar had kidnapped the boy only to make quick money in the form of ransom and enjoy a lavish life,” he said. The SP said the boy, son of a local Telugu television channel reporter, went out to play with his friends at around 5.45 pm on Sunday and did not return home. “The parents who searched frantically for the boy, came to know from his friends that an unidentified man took him on his motorbike. They immediately lodged a complaint with the town police station,” Reddy said. At around 9.45 pm, the boy’s mother received a call from an unknown person stating that he had kidnapped her son and demanded a ransom of Rs 45 lakh to release him. “He told her the entire family was kept under observation and threatened to kill the boy, if they complained to the police,” the SP said. He said special police teams were pressed into service to track the phone call and trace the kidnapper, but it turned out to be an internet call made through a mobile application. “It was difficult to trace the number. So, we took the help of technical experts from Cybercrime police in Hyderabad to identify the caller and his location,” he said. In the meantime, the kidnapper continued to make calls at regular intervals using different mobile applications till Wednesday morning. He even told the parents that their son was suffering from fever and he had given him medicines. Having no other option, the parents mobilised cash by borrowing from friends and relatives besides selling gold. As per the instructions of the kidnapper, the boy’s father went to a designated spot to hand over the money. “He waited for the whole day, but nobody turned up to pick up the cash,” the SP said. Meanwhile, the police who questioned as many as 30 people in and around the boy’s residence, managed to track the number on Thursday morning and identified the kidnapper as Sagar. They quickly arrested him from his residence in the town and questioned him. “During interrogation, Sagar admitted to have kidnapped the boy. The boy did not hesitate to go with him as he stayed close to his residence. However, after taking the boy to the hillocks, Sagar became nervous. Fearing that the boy would disclose his identity, he strangulated the boy to death, before setting fire to the body to destroy evidence,” Reddy said. The SP said the accused was still being questioned whether there were any other accomplices in the kidnap and murder incident. “As of now, Sagar is the only accused in the case. We shall disclose further details once the investigation is completed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/car-mechanic-in-telangana-kidnaps-9-yr-old-boy-for-ransom-then-kills-him/story-jsMcFNRkwdjmZnV3GVRApL.html
22-10-2020||India||Minister reveals why Maharashtra withdrew consent to CBI, it is about TRP scam||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh revealed that the state government suspected a politically motivated move to hand over the TRP scam case to CBI and hence withdrew the general consent given to the central probe agency through an order on Wednesday. Deshmukh added that though the CBI is a professional investigation agency, doubts are being raised over its use for political purposes. Maharashtra government on Wednesday issued an order withdrawing its general consent for CBI to conduct investigations in the state.“Section 6 of the Delhi Special Establishments Act empowers the state, making its consent mandatory for handing over any case to the CBI. By an order issued in 1989, Maharashtra had given general consent allowing the central agency to take over any case. We have withdrawn the same by issuing the order yesterday,” Deshmukh said at a press conference in Mumbai.Deshmukh said the state government suspected the possibility of TRP case’s transfer to the CBI for political reasons.“There is a growing murmur among the common public about the political use of the premier central agency of late. The Honourable Supreme Court too, had in the past termed CBI a ‘caged parrot’. We have seen how a few sensitive cases registered in Maharashtra were handed over to the central agencies. We anticipated a similar attempt in the TRP scam and hence the order has been issued. Mumbai police is investigating the TRP case very efficiently and has made a few arrests too. After the CBI registered an FIR in the TRP scam in Uttar Pradesh, there was a possibility of our probe being handed over to the Central agency,” he said.Also Read: Why Maharashtra withdrew consent to CBI for probes in state, Sena respondsDeshmukh pointed out that a few states like Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim, too, have issued such orders making their consent mandatory before handing over any probe to the CBI.Also Read: Shiv Sena takes potshots at PM Narendra Modi’s address to nation, calls it ‘best in last 7-8 months’In the recent past, the MVA government in Maharashtra and the BJP government at the Centre were involved in a tussle over investigations in sensitive cases.

22-10-2020||India||Kashmir’s apple growers to benefit as Centre extends procurement policy||Apple growers in Kashmir are expected to get a boost after the Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the extension of the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of apples for the current season.Fruit is one of the major items of trade in Kashmir and generates a revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 crore and provides direct or indirect benefits to 2.5 million people in the valley.Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha termed the decision to extend the MIS as a great relief for apple growers and said it will benefit the horticulture sector in J&K and thanked Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and the Union cabinet for extending the scheme.“The move will ensure optimum prices to the apple farmers and give necessary fillip to the economy. The scheme is a great relief for apple growers. It will provide a comprehensive insurance cover against any obstacle thus helping in stabilizing the income of the apple farmers. It will also address all issues related to marketing and transportation, in addition to providing optimum returns to apple growers” the Lt Governor said in a statement.Sinha said the government is committed to take forward the horticulture sector as it will contribute to the improvement of livelihood of apple growers.“Since 12 LMT (lakh metric tonne) of apples can be procured under this scheme, besides ensuring profitability, it will also create rural employment through supplementary services such as packaging, transportation.”The MIS scheme was launched for the first time in September 2019 and was widely appreciated by the apple growers across J&K particularly when they could not sell their produce due to the restrictions in Kashmir Valley following the revocation of Article 370.Officials said the scheme will stabilise the prices of the apple in the market and ensure reduction of distress sales.Under the scheme, apples will be procured by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED) directly from the growers/aggregators at optimum prices at five designated collection centres (Fruit & Vegetable Mandies) in Sopore (Baramulla), Parimpora (Srinagar), Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag. The payment will be directly credited into the bank accounts of the growers through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. “The scheme, among other things, will address all issues including marketing and grading of apples, procurement and storage. The scheme has been launched after taking into consideration the demands of apple growers,” said a senior officer of horticulture department.The Union cabinet has also allowed NAFED to utilize a government guarantee of Rs. 2,500 crore for this operation. The losses, if any, to be incurred in this operation will be shared between the Central Government and UT administration of J&K on 50:50 basis. Necessary infrastructure and facilities have been created at the designated collection centres for smooth operation of the scheme and senior-level functionaries from the horticulture department will be monitoring and supervising the procurement at the mandis.Officials said that representatives from NAFED and the National Horticulture Board will be associated with the procurement and other processes along with staff drawn from the horticulture and agriculture departments.“Market Intervention Scheme for procurement of apples through agency NAFED at 5 procurement centres of Kashmir has been extended this year.

22-10-2020||India||PM Modi invokes Durga to reaffirm commitment to women’s empowerment||Invoking Goddess Durga, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reaffirmed his government’s irrevocable commitment to women’s empowerment.Reaching out to the people of West Bengal during the state’s biggest festival, the prime minister said though it was being celebrated on a limited scale due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the “enthusiasm is still unlimited”.Noting that Goddess Durga was worshipped as a symbol of ‘Shakti’ (strength), Modi said his government was consistently working for the empowerment of women.“From opening Jan Dhan accounts for 22 crore women, giving soft loans to them under the Mudra Yojana, to launching Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao initiative, granting permanent commission to women in the armed forces and extending maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, we have taken a number of steps for their empowerment,” he told a gathering at Durga Puja celebration organised by the BJP.He also said anti-rape laws were made more stringent to include death penalty.“We are alert towards the security of women,” he said.The prime minister’s remark came in the backdrop of a string of incidents of rape and murder of women, including the Hathras incident that shocked the nation and triggered outrage against the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.The prime minister recalled the contributions of reformers from Bengal like Ram Mohun Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, spiritual leaders Ramkrishna Paramhans and Swami Vivekananda, cultural giant Rabindranath Tagore, and revolutionaries like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Khudiram Bose in shaping India’s national identity.Durga Puja, he said, was the epitome of pluralism and reflected the collective strength of India.The BJP had made elaborate arrangements for live viewing of the prime minister’s virtual address from the national capital.The event was televised live at over 78,000 polling booths across the state’s 294 assembly constituencies.Assembly polls are likely in West Bengal around April-May next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-invokes-durga-to-reaffirm-commitment-to-women-s-empowerment/story-JW8Og5QG3EOfSWRBHMYSFK.html

22-10-2020||India||Why Maharashtra withdrew consent to CBI for probes in state, Sena responds||A day after the Maharashtra government withdrew the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, the Shiv Sena on Thursday said the decision was taken in view of the central agency’s “interference in the matters of the state.”Vineet Agrawal, principal secretary (special), home department, confirmed the order that withdraws the contest and makes it mandatory for CBI to seek the state government’s permission before taking up cases within its borders. Maharashtra is the fourth state to issue such an order.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the federal agency has the authority to probe. “In case of a national issue, CBI has authority to investigate. We had to take this decision because of its interference in the matters of the state already being probed by our police,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The MVA government’s decision came a day after the central agency said it would investigate the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) fraud case after registering an FIR on the recommendation of the Uttar Pradesh government.The case is currently being probed by the Mumbai Police which is interrogating three channels including Republic TV. Eight people have been arrested so far on charges including cheating and criminal conspiracy. With the Maharashtra government’s decision in place, the CBI cannot be stopped from investigating the case or questioning people in this particular case but it will have to take the state’s approval to take over the Mumbai Police’s FIR, a retired CBI official told HT. According to a former advocate general of Maharashtra Shrihari Aney, the ongoing probes (such as the one into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput) will not be affected by the move. Also, the CBI can seek an appropriate court order if it intends to investigate a case in Maharashtra if the state government denies consent, he added. The federal agency has not yet commented on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-maharashtra-withdrew-consent-to-cbi-for-probes-in-state-sena-responds/story-xsvplf82MBXWwXOZuPYdyH.html

It said that the prime minister spoke like a “concerned guardian” and the address was on a “spiritual level”. It further added that Modi had a “radiant glow” on his face which would take away all the nation’s problems.“The seven-eight minutes that he spoke about corona was the best address in the last seven-eight months...Modi’s speech was that of a concerned guardian... He came, he spoke. White beard, radiant face. This radiance will remove the darkness of challenges we are facing,” the editorial published on Thursday said.Also Read: Lockdown gone, Covid-19 virus hasn’t, cautions PM ModiThe editorial added that Prime Minister Modi did not speak on unemployment, when everybody expected him to. “Prime Minister said that financial turnover is increasing. But he did not speak on how he would control the demon of unemployment that has gripped the nation after coronavirus outbreak. It was expected that the PM would make a statement on that, but Modi escaped it,” editorial said.It added that Prime Minister Modi did not touch upon the points raise by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “What did Prime Minister Modi give to the nation in his address? What was new in his speech? What did he give for the flood-affected region of Maharashtra? What financial package did he announce? There can be such criticism.

22-10-2020||India||In a stunning con job, man sold shares of ghost firm for Rs 34.12 crore, accused refused bail||The Bombay high court last week refused anticipatory bail to a man from Mumbai who allegedly duped a businessman of crores of rupees by selling him 1,37,000 shares of a non-existent company for Rs 34.12 crore.Justice Sarang Kotwal refused pre-arrest protection to Shishir Agrawal after noticing that the matter was serious and his custodial interrogation was necessary for the purpose of investigation.Agrawal was booked by the economic offences wing of the Mumbai police along with his father Ashokkumar, on the basis of a complaint lodged by Nirmal Kumar Gangwal, alleging that in year 2017, he was introduced to Ashokkumar by one Pawan Jain as a businessman running a firm named Intimate Fashions India Ltd and was later induced to part with crores of rupees under the guise of investment in shares of the public limited company, which had plans to establish a chain of shops across the country by opening 70 outlets.Initially the complainant invested Rs 8.50 crore by purchasing 34,000 shares of the company. In October 2017, the complainant received a share certificate and the shares were transferred to his company, Brescon Advisors Private Ltd. Next month he purchased another 34,500 shares in the non-existent company by paying an additional amount of Rs 8.62 crore.In August 2018, the complainant was offered and purchased 68,500 more shares in the company, thus totalling his investment in the non-existent company to Rs 34.12 crore. The next month, he even received an email declaring that in the annual general meeting of the company, the complainant was appointed a director and he even received ‘dividend’ for the years 2018 and 2019.The complainant started enquiring about the company after Ashokkumar did not respond to his queries. When he started searching for the company, he realised that it did not exist. He found one Intimate Fashions (India) Limited listed with the Registrar of Companies, Chennai, but neither was Ashokkumar it’s chairman nor was the complainant nominated on its board of directors.After persistent demands by the complainant, Ashokkumar repaid an amount of Rs 19.50 crore, leaving Rs 14.62 crore unpaid.Also Read: There must be big reason behind his decision: Sanjay Raut on Eknath Khadse quitting BJPShishir Agrawal conceded before HC that no such company by the name of ‘Intimate Fashions India Ltd.’ was ever in existence. He, however, claimed that it was a money lending transaction and the idea of showing it as an investment was floated by the complainant himself to evade taxes. The defendant also claimed that no misrepresentation was ever made to Gangwal and he being a chartered accountant would not have invested such a huge amount without making appropriate enquiry. Besides, he claimed, the entire transaction was carried out by his father, not by him.Justice Kotwal, however, refused to accept the contentions. The judge noted from a statement of a witness that Agrawal himself, in 2012, got the annual report and balance-sheet of the non-existent company printed from the witness.Also Read: No adverse effect of Oxford University vaccine on 163 Mumbai volunteers during clinical trials, says BMC“Thus the Applicant (Agrawal) has actively participated in creating forged documents. The misappropriation is huge. The Applicant was involved in creating forged documents in respect of the same company whose name was repeatedly used to cheat the informant,” said justice Kotwal, while refusing to grant pre-arrest bail to him.The judge also took note of the fact that Agrawal was part of the memorandum of understanding signed by his father with the complainant for refunding the outstanding amount of Rs. 14.62 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-stunning-con-job-man-sold-shares-of-ghost-firm-for-rs-34-12-crore-accused-refused-bail/story-tgSZt2DNcsIbQbSVZ99h7I.html

22-10-2020||India||12 years of Chandrayaan-1: The mission renewed interest in moon with discovery of water||India’s first mission to the moon, which was also its first scientific space exploration mission, was launched 12 years ago. Chandrayaan-1 successfully reached the lunar orbit 21 days later and has remained there since. Although the satellite continues to move around the moon, due to failure of circuitry it stopped transmitting data in August the following year. The mission is credited with finding water on moon. This renewed the interest of countries in the moon, with the US announcing the Artemis programme, aimed at sending humans to the moon in 2024. The US is the only country to have sent humans on the moon with six of its Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972. No human has been on the moon since. After reaching the orbit, the Chandrayaan-1 dropped an impactor probe from the satellite on November 14, 2008 to check the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere as it went through and the debris where it struck. The impactor crashed, as planned, near the South Pole of the moon at a point that is now called ‘Jawahar Sthal’. Also Read: India’s space telescope completes 5-year mission life, will continue to function: ISRO chiefThe analysis of the data from this probe showed the first sign of water near the surface of the moon. This was re-confirmed using another scientific payload of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sent on the same mission called Moon Mineralogy Mapper. India has since sent another mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-2, a decade after the first one. The Russian space agency could not deliver a lander and rover and it was indigenously designed. India decided to land on the moon during its second mission—it would have been the fourth country to do so after the former Soviet Union, US, and China. India chose to land close to the South Pole, where there was more probability of physically detecting water using the lander and rover. However, during the 15 minutes of controlled decent, the lander-rover crashed just 2.1km above the surface of the moon. India now plans to send another mission to the moon which will comprise of just a lander and a rover and use the existing orbiter to communicate with earth. The mission was to take place next year but is likely to be delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-years-of-chandrayaan-1-the-mission-renewed-interest-in-moon-with-discovery-of-water/story-pA3BQ6SpGP1f1tCUrOudpO.html

The canteens, earlier run by northern railways, were barred from cooking as the authorities wanted to avoid crowds. Even as the canteens continue to serve tea and snacks, officials are left with little option but to bring food from home. They have now been asked to “desist from washing their utensils and lunch boxes” and to “ co-operate in maintaining the desired level of cleanliness and hygiene”, according to the circular. The Indian Parliament has more than 2,000 officials and staff and 1,000 security personnel. An internal report of the canteen committee of Parliament showed that the staff and the security personnel, not the MPs, mostly eat in the canteen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-employees-cannot-wash-utensils-and-lunch-boxes-in-the-complex-anymore/story-VgAJv2SXrKfTnMKz0OP7aJ.html

Air India, on the other hand, was operating only three to four flights in Germany leading to a disparity in the number of flights which contradicts the air bubble agreement, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said earlier. Flights between India & Germany recommence under air bubble arrangement. Lufthansa will operate from Delhi (4 days), Mumbai (3 days) & Bengaluru (3 days). @airindiain will operate 5 weekly flights from Delhi & 2 every week from Bengaluru to Frankfurt.@MoCA_GoINow it has been decided that the German carrier will fly 10 flights — four to and from Delhi, three to and from Mumbai and other three to and from Bengaluru. Out of Air India’s seven flights a week, five will be to and from Delhi and two to and from Bengaluru.Also Read: International flights: India-Germany flights to start from October 26 after brief suspension of air bubbleOwing to the disparity in numbers, India, Germany air bubble — an agreement between two countries to allow their airlines to operate both-way travels — stood suspended. All flights between the two countries were cancelled till October 20.On October 16, Air India announced its resumption of Germany flights beginning from October 26. It also said that the schedule will continue till March 28, 2021.Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said earlier that foreign carriers won’t be allowed if that comes in way of Indian carriers. Reports said Germany was not ready to increase the number of Air India flights as it was apprehensive of importing Covid-19 cases from India.With Lufthansa flying 10 per week and Air India seven, the parity remains but the ministry had said earlier that it was not insisting on total parity.

The announcement was made after a delegation of Sarpanch Sangh from Dantewada visited the chief minister at his residence on Wednesday and handed over a memorandum with the demand to establish industries in the region. “Chief minister approved their demand and said that Shaheed Mahendra Karma Ji (Congress leader from Bastar who was allegedly killed by Maoists in Jiram Valley attack in 2013) always wanted Dantewada and Bastar to have major industries. As per his vision, we would develop the Bastar region. The state government would initiate the establishment of four to five major steel plants in the region,” a press release issued by Chhattisgarh Public Relations Department on Wednesday stated.

22-10-2020||India||ISRO releases draft policy to regulate space communication by private players||In line with its mandate to open up the space sector for private players, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released the draft of a new Spacecom Policy 2020 to govern the commercial use of orbital slots, satellites, and ground stations for communication needs. The policy details how private players can get authorisation for setting up new communication satellites and ground stations. Comments on the draft policy have been sought, with the last date of submission being November 4. The policy will come into effect once the Union cabinet clears it. Allowing private players in the space communication sector will also enable India to keep pace with the growing demand for satellite-based broadcasting, network connectivity, and global mobile personal communication. This will also establish India as a significant player in the global space communication sector, the document states. Also Read: India’s space telescope completes 5-year mission life, will continue to function: ISRO chiefThe policy will allow only Indian entities to seek authorisation for orbital slots for new satellites, services based on existing satellites and setting up new ground stations. However, any company sending a communication satellite in space will also be liable for any damages to other objects in space and the environment. To cover this, companies will have to provide a financial guarantee or insurance cover at the time of seeking authorisation from the department of space and later from Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe). The policy will also protect India’s orbital resources or slots. Getting designated orbital slots is a long-drawn process that needs a lot of technical coordination and negotiations with other satellite operators of multiple countries to ensure interference-free operation of all satellites. The private players will be able to acquire these orbital slots from the department of space PSUs at a cost. However, there is an international time-stipulation for launching a satellite into the designated orbit and continued occupancy is essential. So, to protect the orbital slot, the private companies will have a timeline for operationalising satellites. And, if any company is unable to replace a satellite, the slot will be allocated to another. India has brought in 32 indigenous operational communication satellites since 1980s. In addition, all existing ISRO -operated satellites—such as INSAT and GSAT—will be handed over to the PSUs, like the New Space India Limited, at “no or notional cost” which can then charge as deemed fit for commercialisation. “Although I haven’t gone through the policy yet, it is a step in the right direction. However, what we really need is a comprehensive space policy that will map out how will the government’s announcement of opening up the space sector be actually executed, and the policy and regulatory framework that would be needed. Such a policy will also map out the scientific missions that will be undertaken by ISRO, while leaving the routine missions to the private sector. It should clearly detail the needs of India’s space sector and allow for a fair competition for the private space sector to deliver,” said Rajeswari Rajagopalan, head of Nuclear and Space policy at the Observer Research Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-releases-draft-policy-to-regulate-space-communication-by-private-players/story-hcrB1xAKZDFNQdI0y4GatJ.html
22-10-2020||India||Covid-19: IIT-Kharagpur develops tabletop testing device||Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur have developed a portable tabletop machine that can diagnose coronavirus disease (Covid-19) test within an hour.The device, named ‘Covirap’, has been validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the researchers are in talks with manufacturers to market the product. With a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 98%, it’s almost as accurate as the gold-standard reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.It makes accurate Covid-19 diagnosis cheap, fast and accessible. The cost of the machine will depend on the level of automation needed, but at the laboratory setting, it cost the team Rs 5,000 to manufacture the machine. The cost of each test will be around Rs 500 to Rs 600. Also read: What is the Feluda test that will be commercially available by October 31?“There is no need for a temperature-controlled laboratory for the device or a cold chain for the reagents. The master mix of reagents is available in test tubes that have to be mixed with the RNA sample collected from the patient and run in the machine. After the processing is complete, a simple paper strip dip test has to be done. To ensure accuracy in reading the test, even without trained professionals, the strips have to be put in a small cartridge and a mobile-based system reads it to give results. Multiple tests can be run in a single cycle,” said Dr Suman Chakraborty, professor in the department of mechanical engineering at IIT-Kharagpur. The device uses one human gene as control and two genes from Sars-Cov-2 to detect the infection. Dr Arindam Mondal, a part of the team that developed the machine and assistant professor in the school of biosciences at IIT-Kharagpur, said, “During the testing phase of patient samples, all kits developed by the institute, were transported in an uncontrolled environment for hours to the testing unit that shows high levels of stability of the reagents that are being used for the testing.” “To check the performance of the device, we tested 200 patient samples using both RT-PCR and Covirap. We were pleasantly surprised; the results of both the assays were comparable. In fact, the sensitivity and specificity went up to 99% if RT-PCR results where less than 30 cycles of amplification were needed were considered,” said Dr Mamta Chawla Sarakar, virologist from the ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, where the kit was validated.The researchers not just developed the machine, but the method used is also completely new. The team has applied for an Indian patent for the process. The machine is based on a technology called Reverse Transcription-Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) that uses constant heat to amplify the genetic material of the virus. After the pre-programmed amplification, the method developed by researchers from IIT-Kharagpur uses an additional heating step that improves the accuracy of the test. “This second heating step – and I cannot provide much detail – has been patented by our team. It is not used anywhere in the world. And, it’s not just Covid-19, this machine can be used to test for other infections such as tuberculosis, dengue, and malaria at low cost without much infrastructure. We kept in mind the situation in Kharagpur, from where people have to be rushed to Kolkata for any medical emergency,” said Dr Chakraborty. “While the institute can produce the testing kit up to a certain scale, patent licensing will facilitate commercialisation opportunities for medical technology companies,” said Dr VK Tewari, director, IIT-Kharagpur. “The innovation has made high-quality and accurate Covid-19 test affordable for the public. A test conducted by Covirap costs around Rs 500. The price point can further be reduced through government’s intervention. The machine can be developed at a cost of less than Rs 10,000 with minimal infrastructure requirements. The portable device has made the technology affordable for the public. Besides, the test results can be made available within an hour,” said Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’.He said the device would impact the lives of people living in rural India, as it could be operated on a low-energy supply. Minimally trained rural youths are also equipped to operate the machine, he added.

The shoulder launched four-kilometre range missile with imaging infrared seeker will now be inducted in Indian Army.The Nag trial comes after the DRDO tested the helicopter launched Stand-off Anti-Tank Missile (SANT) with beyond 10 km range from Balasore testing range in Odisha on October 19. Although the missile will ultimately integrated with attack helicopters in future, the test was conducted from ground and was successful.According to senior government officials, the Nag anti-tank missile is now ready for induction at locations such as the East Ladakh sector as it has completed 10 successful user trial with the weapon finding and then hitting the target.The DRDO has been on a missile testing spree for a little over a month with only the 1,000 km range sub-sonic cruise missile Nirbhay, developing a snag during a test earlier this month. The missile is now expected to test fired in the coming months as the technical snag in the booster has been identified and rectified by the missile team.The final trial of Nag anti-tank missile means that the Indian Army will no longer have to import this weapon from either Israel or the US for the range of four kilometres. It was due to unavailability of a credible anti-tank weapon, that India had to buy around 200 pieces of Spike anti-tank missiles from Israel as emergency purchases after the aggression by People’s Liberation Army in Ladakh. The Spike missiles were purchases after the Galwan flare-up on June 15 after which both India and China have deployed troops all along the 1597 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.The need for anti-tank missile was sorely felt after PLA amassed artillery, rockets and tanks in occupied Aksai Chin to deter India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nag-anti-tank-missile-ready-to-be-inducted-sant-missile-tested-fired-from-balasore/story-TXGqJQ1rko16xWuqga2Z5K.html

These new trains are special trains keeping the festival rush in mind as regular passenger train services have been suspended during the lockdown. The Congress has accused the railways of “hiking” the train fares by 25 to 30 per cent. For example, sleeper class travel between Patna and Mumbai costs Rs 670 but special train ticket costs Rs 920.Why have fares gone up?The railways said there has been no unscheduled hike in fares. As per rules, fare for special trains running during peak demand seasons like festival season, summer holiday season is different and higher than regular mail or express time-tabled trains, it has said.Also Read: Railways to run 392 ‘festival special’ trains Is senior citizen concession withdrawn?The railways offers concessions to 53 categories including those for senior citizens, students, sportspersons, medical professional etc. Some of the concessions stand withdrawn due to the Covid-19 pandemic as a move to discourage people from travelling. At present, students and people with some medical conditions are only eligible for concession. But the railways have clarified that it is not withdrawing the other concessions. The decision is under review as normal passenger trains remain suspended.After a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of Covid-19, the railways first started Shramik special trains and a few special passenger train in May. In the following months, more special trains were added to the list. The festival trains, too, come under this category and, hence, the regular fares and concessions remain suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-why-are-festival-train-fares-high-is-senior-citizen-concession-withdrawn/story-ZgnB1WpndJbkEV8OlBOzvL.html

According to senior leaders of the BJP, the prime minister’s message would be live streamed on giant screens in at least 10 puja pandals across the state, including the one at EZCC in Salt Lake which is being organised by the Bengal BJP’s women’s wing for the first time. A senior BJP leader said that Modi’s address on Durga Shasthi (the sixth day of the nine-day festival) would virtually kick start the party’s campaign for the crucial assembly polls in 2021. The BJP has decided not to project anyone as its chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming polls. Instead, the party would highlight the ‘achievements’ of the Modi government to counter the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state. Also Read: Calcutta High Court refuses to lift ban on entry of visitors inside puja pandals A cultural program is also being organized on the sidelines of the puja at EZCC where Babul Supriyo, union environment and forest minister is expected to perform.

22-10-2020||India||West Bengal: Heavy rainfall likely to play spoilsport in Durga Puja celebrations||Widespread and heavy rainfall is likely to impact the ongoing Durga Puja celebrations in West Bengal and neighbouring Odisha. A well-marked low-pressure area has formed over the west-central Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. It is likely to move north-westwards on Thursday. It will move north-eastwards towards West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts across north-west Bay of Bengal off Odisha coast during the next 48 hours.The low-pressure area is likely to intensify into a depression by Thursday, and into a deep depression the following day, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Widespread and heavy rainfall, measuring between 64.5 and 115.5 millimetres (mm) per day, is likely over Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Gangetic West Bengal (115.6-204.4 mm per day) on Thursday. A similar weather condition is likely to occur over north-east India because of the low-pressure. Extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 204.4 mm per day, is also likely over Tripura and Mizoram on Thursday and over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Friday.Fishermen are advised not to venture into west-central Bay of Bengal and along and off AP coast until Thursday, into the North Bay of Bengal and along and off Odisha-West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts until Saturday (October 24) evening. Pollution levels have also increased in north-west India and several towns in the region recorded very poor air quality on Wednesday. Panipat, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Lucknow, Faridabad, Bhiwadi and Baghpat recorded very poor air quality, while Delhi continued to remain in the poor category.The national capital recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 256 on Wednesday. AQI between 202 and 300 and from 301 to 400 are considered in the poor and very poor category, respectively.The wind direction is variable, but it is likely to shift towards the north-east, albeit temporarily, on Thursday.Widespread stubble burning incidents were reported from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh (UP), which are likely to impact the AQI in Delhi-national capital region (NCR).However, the impact would be low because of better mixing height and ventilation, the air quality early warning system of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoeES) said. The ventilation index on Wednesday was approximately 10,000 square (sq) metres (m) per second. The ventilation index is the function of the mixing height and the wind speed. It defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq m per second is considered poor. The mixing height is the height at which the pollutant mixes in the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-warning-for-bengal-during-durga-puja/story-tGZpwWjwRn5EqI4Q2fMf0H.html

22-10-2020||India||Devendra Fadnavis calls Eknath Khadse’s allegations against him ‘half truth’||Former Maharashtra chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis termed Eknath Khadse’s resignation from the party on Wednesday unfortunate and on the latter blaming him for the move, Fadnavis held that he would speak at the right time. Khadse, from Jalgaon district of north Maharashtra, was one of the prominent leaders of the BJP in the state. He has now decided to join the Sharad Pawar led- Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Friday. His daughter-in-law and MP Raksha Khadse will continue working for the BJP and there was no other party MLA or MP joining him, he said.The 68-year-old leader, who was also denied an election ticket in the state assembly elections held last year, said he had nothing against the central or state BJP leadership but Fadnavis. He accused the former chief minister of fabricating false cases against him. “I am upset with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who made the police fabricate false cases against me. One case of outraging the modesty of a woman was registered against me on the orders from Fadnavis who was then CM and home minister. Similarly, corruption cases in Bhosri land deal and cases by anti-corruption bureau were registered against me, though nothing came out of them,” Khadse said in Jalgaon. He added that he sought reasons for the “punishment” from the party leadership and Fadnavis on various platforms but I never got a reply. Also Read| Maharashtra leader Eknath Khadse quits: NCP’s gain, but is it BJP’s loss?Fadnavis, however, responded to the allegations levelled against him by saying Khadse was speaking half-truth and that he would comment on the issue at the “right time.” “It’s unfortunate that he resigned.He shouldn’t have resigned. As far as his allegation against me is concerned, he’s speaking half-truth. He could have complained against me to seniors. At this moment I won’t speak much on it but I’ll speak at the right time,” the former CM was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The apparent cold war between the two leaders began with the party leadership choosing Fadnavis for the chief ministerial post when Khadse was expecting it after the BJP’s win in the 2014 state assembly elections. A fuming Khadse was given revenue and a bouquet of portfolios, but he continued to be bitter about the “injustice meted out to him”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/devendra-fadnavis-calls-eknath-khadse-s-allegations-against-him-half-truth/story-nLFLvSqyw1FJt4nGwn0RkN.html

The court, however, provided some relief to puja organisers by raising the cap on the number of committee members and local residents into a pandal; and allowing the entry of dhakis (drummers) as part of the celebrations. “No further modification is thought appropriate so that the effect of the effect of the order is not diluted or the purpose thereof defeated,” stated the order passed by the division bench of the Calcutta high court on Wednesday. In its order on Monday, the high court banned the entry of visitors inside the Durga Puja pandals to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and mandated putting up barricades outside these enclosures. It also capped on the number of puja committee members who can enter the pandal – 25 for big pujas, and 15 for smaller ones. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The virus refuses to go away. Though the healthcare facilities in the state have been augmented, with the limited resources available, the state can only do so much. In such a situation, it may be judicious to err on the side of prevention that to allow the festivities to go on without any checks and repent later that adequate resources may not be available to provide for the massive cure that may become necessary,” stated the order passed on October 19. Five applications were filed by various puja organisers in and around Kolkata and the Forum for Durgotasab seeking a modification of the court’s order. These review petitions were heard on Wednesday. Making changes in its earlier order, the court said that in big pandals, where the area is more than 300 square metres, not more than 45 persons may enter at a time; and in smaller pandals, not more than 15 persons should be present at the same time. The bigger pandals will need to give the names of 60 people who want to enter the enclosure every day by 8 that morning, while the smaller pandals will have to give a list of 20 names.“Even though we had urged the court to raise the cap on the number of puja committee members entering the pandal every day to 100, we are happy with Wednesday’s modifications. This would allow puja committee members and local residents to enter the pandal in rotation every day. But it is unfortunate that local residents won’t be able to gather inside pandals to perform the Anjali and Sindur Khela. The entry of visitors remains banned,” said Saswata Basu, general secretaryof Forum for Durgotsab, an umbrella organisation of over 350 prominent puja committees in Kolkata, which the review petition. Lawyers said that Sindur Khela can be organised beyond the 10-metre barricaded zone for big pujas and 5-metre no-entry zone for small pujas. Similarly, Anjali can also be performed in the same way from a distance. This year, than 37,000 community pujas are being organised across the state, including more than 2,500 in Kolkata. The list does not include pujas which are held inside housing societies and houses. The festive season begins at a time when Bengal has been witnessing a spike a Covid-19 cases. Bengal reported 4029 new cases on Tuesday, of which 809 new infections were reported in Kokata alone. The positivity rate for West Bengal has jumped from 6.9% to 9.2% in the last one month. “Visitors’ entry inside pandals remains banned. This is an exceptional year because of the pandemic situation. We can celebrate next year. This year we need to stay away from crowd. The High Court has given some orders. Now it is up to the state government, police and club authorities to implement it,” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee, the lawyer who filed the original PIL for petitioner Ajay Kumar De.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-high-court-refuses-to-lift-ban-on-entry-of-visitors-inside-puja-pandals/story-DZEr2svDRd3c6DcH6rt0NO.html
22-10-2020||India||Election Commission seeks response from Kamal Nath over ‘item’ remark||The Election Commission of India (ECI) asked former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday to explain his allegedly sexist description of state minister Imarti Devi as an “item “. The Commission gave Nath 48 hours to explain the remark, failing which action will be taken against him. Nath’s remarks was found to be in violation of the model code of conduct in place in the state because of assembly by-elections due on November 3, the ECI said.“Now, therefore, the Commission gives you an opportunity to explain your stand in making the above said statement within 48 hours of receipt of this notice, failing which the Election Commission of India shall take a decision without further reference to you,” a notice issued by the ECI said.The move came in the wake of the National Commission for Women (NCW) asking the election watchdog to look into the matter and take action. The NCW also sought an explanation from Nath over the alleged derogatory remark.Also Read | ‘His opinion’: Kamal Nath responds to Rahul Gandhi disapproving ‘item’ remark“The NCW has come across several media reports where Shri Kamal Nath, Leader of Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, made offensive and derogatory remarks against a woman minister in a political rally in Dabra,” the Commission said in a statement. “The Commission strongly condemns this irresponsible and disparaging statement made by the leader. The words used in the video are highly defamatory and shows disrespect towards the dignity of a woman.” Addressing a campaign rally on Sunday in Gwalior’s Dabra town, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Imarti Devi in the by-election, Kamal Nath said the Congress candidate was a “simple person” unlike his opponent who was an “item”. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday he disapproved of Nath’s controversial remark.  “Kamal Nath ji is from my party. But one can’t treat women with disrespect. I don’t approve the language used by the senior leader. It is unfortunate,” he said. “Our women are our pride. They should be protected and I don’t appreciate this type of language…,” he added.Nath refused to apologise. “It is Rahul ji’s opinion” was his response when reporters asked about Gandhi’s comments on the escalating row. “Why should I apologise when I did not intend to insult anyone? If anyone felt insulted, I have already expressed regret,” Nath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-seeks-response-from-kamal-nath-over-item-remark/story-1U8MGKeVwjbPANfq6uOlRN.html
22-10-2020||India||Karnataka minister demands expulsion of fellow BJP legislator for remarks against CM||A day after former union minister and current BJP MLA from Vijayapura, Basangouda Patil Yatnal claimed that the party high command would replace Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa shortly; there have been calls for him to be expelled from the party. K S Eshwarappa, minister for rural development and panchayati raj who is also a former BJP state unit chief and deputy CM speaking to reporters in Koppal, said that Yatnal must be “expelled from the party without even being given notice”.Yatnal on Tuesday had accused CM Yediyurappa of focussing only on Shivamogga district which is his powerbase and neglecting other parts of the state. He had also claimed that the high command would replace Yediyurappa with a North Karnataka leader as the Chief Minister of the state shortly. A majority of the 117 BJP MLA’s in the assembly have been elected from Northern Karnataka.Opposition leaders including Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah taunted the CM over Yatnal’s remarks and had said a faction of the BJP was trying to overthrow the CM. The Congress, Siddaramaiah had said was ready to face polls if the government fell due to internal bickering within the BJP.While the CM himself has remained mum on the issue, several of his party leaders including state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel and the political secretary of Yediyurappa, M P Renukacharya have all denied that there would be a change in the leadership. Kateel declared that ‘Yediyurappa would be the CM of the state for the next three years’. Some of the party leaders have accused Yatnal of attacking the CM for not getting a cabinet berth.However, Yatnal after launching a blistering attack on the CM publicly, again defiantly tweeted today saying, “For the welfare of Karnataka and to be a voice of the people I am doing my job with a clear conscience. It is not my nature to fall at somebody’s feet to become a minister.”Eshwarappa attacked Yatnal saying that, “some people are issuing statements just to be in the limelight. I appeal to BJP president Kateel to expel him without giving notice. If he had grievances why did he keep quiet in the legislature party?” The minister also claimed that nobody could destabilise the BJP government in the statePolitical analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy though says that internal party differences and cabinet not being expanded are some of the reasons why the internal BJP fight is coming out into the open. “I don’t believe that action would be taken against Yatnal as he is as senior a leader as Yediyurappa and also hails from the influential Lingayat community. It is unlikely that Yatnal would have made these comments without some backing from Central leaders.”The Karnataka unit of the BJP tweeted quoting state party president Nalin Kumar Kateel, “There is no question of a leadership change. Yediyurappa will remain the CM for the next three years. Action will be taken against those violating party discipline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-minister-demands-expulsion-of-fellow-bjp-legislator-for-remarks-against-cm/story-tWLsD24iSzuZDF8nquZ2aL.html
22-10-2020||India||Physical rallies only if virtual not feasible: Madhya Pradesh HC||Voicing displeasure over the conduct of political parties and candidates at a time the coronavirus disease pandemic is raging, the Gwalior bench of the Madhya Pradesh high court has directed the administrators of nine districts in its jurisdiction to grant permissions for physical public rallies only if virtual meetings are not possible ahead of next month’s assembly bypolls.The court also ordered that first information reports (FIRs) be lodged against Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and state Congress president Kamal Nath for alleged breach of Covid-19 protocols. District magistrates should not permit political parties and candidates from holding physical meetings, irrespective of the size of the crowd, if they can campaign digitally in Gwalior, Guna, Morena, Bhind, Ashok Nagar, Datia, Shivpuri, Sheopur and Vidisha, the bench ruled. The right to health and life of ordinary people is more sacred and precious when set off against the right to campaign of candidates in an election, the court observed. “Thus, the right of candidates to campaign has to yield to the right to health and life of the electorate”, said the court in its interim order, passed on Tuesday but released on Wednesday.Political parties are doing everything they can to draw the common man out of the security and safety of his/her home to become part of a congregation “to achieve their ulterior motive of gaining popularity to obtain votes, and leaving gullible and innocent common man to go home carrying Covid-19 virus with him and transmit the disease to his family members and friends”, read the order.Voting for 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh bypolls will take place on November 3. The high court’s interim order, passed by a bench of justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava, said: “The district magistrates of all nine districts falling within the territorial jurisdiction of this court are restrained from giving permission to any candidate/political party for holding physical congregations of any number of people unless the political party applying for such a congregation is able to satisfy the district magistrate concerned that conduct of a virtual election campaign is not possible and the district magistrate passes a speaking order recording reasons of being satisfied of the inability of candidates/political parties to conduct virtual campaigning.” The court said the district magistrate’s (DM) permission to conduct the physical meeting “shall become effective only after the Election Commission of India (ECI) approves the same in writing”. Even if a physical congregation is permitted by the DM and the ECI, it can take place only after the political party/candidate deposits money with the DM that is sufficient to purchase double the number of masks and sanitisers required for protecting those attending the event. The candidate will have to file an affidavit that “he shall be personally liable to distribute masks and sanitisers to all the members of the congregation before the meeting/congregation starts”, the court added. The interim order was passed on a petition filed by Gwalior-based advocate Ashish Pratap Singh, who complained of violations of Covid-19 safety norms by political party leaders ahead of the bypolls The court appointed three advocates as amicus curiae (friend of the court) to submit their own reports one election meetings. The court had earlier directed district collectors to invoke penal provisions of the Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code not only against the members of the congregation who fail to follow Covid-19 protocols, but also against political and government functionaries responsible for organising such an assembly. On the petitioner pointing out that FIRs had not been lodged against Union minister Tomar and former chief minister Kamal Nath for speaking at and being present in overcrowded rallies despite the court’s previous orders, the bench directed the district administrations to ensure the registration of complaints against both for breach of Covid-19 protocols. After the court’s interim order on October 12, FIRs were lodged against several other political leaders for organising or speaking at such rallies. State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said the party was studying the court order. “Election meetings are held to educate voters. Hence, restrictions on public meetings will limit the opportunities of the political parties to convey their policies and programmes to voters. We will see if we can make a prayer to the court to pass an order in consultation with ECI to make the campaigning a smooth one.” State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said: “We are studying the court’s interim order. Hence, we can’t comment on it right now. However, till now there are no amended guidelines from ECI. We are bound to follow ECI guidelines in respect with elections. We will see if ECI issues any fresh guidelines for elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/physical-rallies-only-if-virtual-not-feasible-madhya-pradesh-hc/story-HXLh0CibnRaCfDBwevUz3I.html
22-10-2020||India||India, US 2+2 meet set for October 27||The third 2+2 ministerial dialogue next week will see India and the US consolidating their diplomatic and security ties, including institutionalised intelligence-sharing and efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will host US defence secretary Mark Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo in New Delhi on October 27 for a rare personal meeting amid the pandemic, during which the signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) is on the cards to facilitate sharing of satellite and sensor data. As the relationship with India has bipartisan backing in the US, the meeting is expected to build on past gains even though it is being held days ahead of the US presidential election on November 3. Announcing the meeting on Wednesday, the external affairs ministry said Pompeo and Esper will be in India during October 26-27 for the dialogue, who agenda includes “all bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest”. The first 2+2 dialogue was held in New Delhi in 2018 and the second in Washington in 2019. Pompeo told the media in Washington that during the upcoming visit, which will also take him to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia, he would focus on working with the four countries “to preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific”. “I’m especially looking forward to doing that with secretary Esper in our 2+2 ministerial dialogue with our Indian friends,” he said. “I’m sure that my meetings will also include discussions on how free nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.” Speaking at the Atlantic Council on Tuesday, Esper didn’t rule out the possibility of the two sides signing an anticipated maritime information-sharing agreement. He added that India will be “the most consequential partner for us...in the Indo-Pacific...in the century”. He also spoke of India facing “Chinese aggression in the Himalayas, specifically along that Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. BECA is considered the fourth and last of the foundational agreements to be signed by India and the US. The two sides have been sharing real time intelligence under the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which was signed in 2018. The two countries signed the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) in 2002 and the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity there is a strong possibility the two sides could finalise a pact for an institutionalised relationship between the Defence Intelligence Agencies of the two sides. This will allow the two sides to share tri-services intelligence, including developments ranging from the South China Sea to the Himalayas. This proposal has been hanging fire for some years without any results. BECA, which is yet to be cleared by the Indian cabinet, will enable India to buy armed unmanned aerial and underwater platforms from the US, which will be loaded with neighbourhood terrain maps for pin-point targeting. The maps will also help in precision flying of US-made platforms acquired by India and enhance the capability of platforms such as Apache attack helicopters and Chinook heavy lift helicopters. A decision to acquire armed drones has been communicated to the US, and the two countries are now going beyond exercises into other domains such as space and undersea. The two sides are also expected to discuss China’s aggression in Ladakh and its muscle flexing in the South China Sea, as well as counter-measures that the Quad needs to put in place to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific for global trade, the people said. The troubled peace process in Afghanistan and terrorism emanating from Pakistan will also be on the agenda as New Delhi fears more violence in Kabul after the anticipated pullout of American forces. Though India participated in the opening of the intra-Afghan talks in Doha, it is concerned about the hold of Pakistan’s security establishment on the Taliban. Esper referred to the first tri-service military exercise, Tiger Triumph, the USS Nimitz’s drills with the Indian Navy and the first defence cyber dialogue in September, and said: “As we expand our collaboration into new domains...these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century.” Separately, a bipartisan group of 14 US senators have expressed “strong support” for India’s decision to include Australia in the Malabar naval exercise with the US and Japan, saying in a letter to India’s ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu that it is an “invaluable” move from an operational perspective. “From an operational perspective, the addition of such a uniquely capable and stalwart partner, like Australia, to this naval exercise is invaluable, providing increased interoperability, strengthening threat assessment abilities and enhancing the maritime roles and missions of the four naval powers,” the letter said. The signatories included John Corny and Mark Warner, the Republican and Democratic co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus, and Republicans Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-2-2-meet-set-for-october-27/story-oehhSqsD6nQFN4n0lC6oTP.html

Mela police administration is also ensuring preparation and planning in case Covid-19 spread is curbed by March 2021 and there is major footfall of pilgrims. The four-month long fair will be manned by the Uttarakhand Police as well as central paramilitary personnel of the Indo Tibetan Border Police, Central Reserve Police Force and Provincial Armed Constabulary among others. The arrival and deployment of the Kumbh Mela security personnel is being planned in five phases which may be changed according to restrictions, e-passes, number of pilgrims approved by the government during Kumbh, mela officials said. According to Inspector General of Kumbh Police Force Sanjay Gunjiyal, elaborate security arrangements are being planned for the mega fair with emphasis on ensuring effective force deployment and utilisation. “Already under the first phase, local cops of the Kumbh force from the state police have arrived and in another three to four phases the rest of the personnel will arrive, as the Kumbh date nears. Coordination, sharing of intelligence input, information, traffic control and also adhering to social distance norms will be priority for the Kumbh mela force,” said IG Kumbh Gunjiyal. For the first time Mela Force Police lines will also get shifted from inner-city Rishi Kul ground to the outer Neeldhara area adjacent to Ganga for Mahakumbh. At this police line Kumbh Police stations will be based and a briefing hall will be set up to ensure the convenience of addressing a large number of mela force personnel at one place itself. “Apart from companies of paramilitary forces, a bomb disposal squad, commando unit and anti-mine team have been sought from the Central government for Kumbh Mela. From terror threat to intelligence information sharing, communication set up requirement and keeping tab through drone surveillance, the Kumbh Mela will be a thoroughly secure one,” said Kumbh force Circle Officer Prakash Chandra Deoli. As part of the buildup for the Kumbh, mela force administration had recently invited Prayagraj Range Kumbh 2019 Deputy Inspector General, Uttar Pradesh KP Singh to seek guidance and for devising strategy and planning for the Haridwar Mahakumbh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-3-months-left-for-it-to-begin-security-personnel-for-kumbh-mela-to-arrive-in-phases/story-Try315OJsoyXDnLNcq5DlL.html
22-10-2020||India||New glands found in the human body... in 2020!||Scientists have identified a previously unknown set of salivary glands in the upper part of the throat, discovering what could be the first set of major glands to be found in the human body in 300 years and paving the way for techniques that could improve the quality of life for people who receive radiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck.The new set of glands are about 1.5 inches on average and lie in the nasopharyngeal region, behind the nose and above the throat. The researchers, from the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, said in their report that sparing these glands in radiotherapy could help reduce the difficulty in salivation and swallowing that patients of head and neck cancer experience after radiation therapy.“The human body contains a pair of previously overlooked and clinically relevant macroscopic salivary gland locations, for which we propose the name tubarial glands. Sparing these glands in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) may provide an opportunity to improve their quality of life,” the researchers wrote in the paper published in the open access journal, Radiotherapy and Oncology. More research is likely needed to confirm that these are indeed a new major set of salivary glands, and if confirmed, it would be the first discovery of new salivary glands in about 300 years, according to a report in Science.The new glands have been labelled as tubarial salivary glands because these are situated over a piece of cartilage called the torus tubarius.The discovery was accidental since the researchers were studying prostate cancer. “People have three sets of large salivary glands, but not there. As far as we knew, the only salivary or mucous glands in the nasopharynx are microscopically small, and up to 1000 are evenly spread out throughout the mucosa. So, imagine our surprise when we found these,” said radiation oncologist Wouter Vogel, who was among the researchers, according to a statement. Head and neck cancers are a leading contributor to India’s cancer burden, with a large majority comprising cancer of the oral cavity, followed by that of the pharynx (part of the throat behind the mouth and nasal cavity), according to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s cancer registry.Radiation oncologists in India agree that this discovery could improve the quality of life after radiotherapy in cancer patients.“One of the major side-effects of radiation therapy is that it damages a part of the salivary gland leading to permanent disability -- a person may experience dry mouth, have difficulty in speech, eating, etc. The focus of advanced radiotherapy techniques such as image-guided or the intensity-modulated ones is largely to save the salivary glands. This extra pair that has been discovered has the potential to mitigate the side effects as during the therapy, lower glands are affected, and this being on the upper side will remain out of the radiation field,” said Dr PK Julka, former head, radiation oncology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS-Delhi).The salivary gland system, known till now, is a three paired major glands and roughly 1,000 minor glands spread throughout the aerodigestive tract (the respiratory tract and the upper part of the digestive tract, including the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat, vocal cords, and part of the oesophagus and windpipe) submucosa (the layer that supports the mucosa membrane).“This discovery needs to be studied further as there is more work that needs to be done to actually establish the discovery of this set of glands,” added Dr Julka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-glands-found-in-the-human-body-in-2020/story-3jq2QEX2sNG7eDZx4T476H.html
22-10-2020||India||Human rights body notice for Meghalaya govt over deaths of 877 infants in 4 months||Seeking detailed reports of the death of 877 newborn infants and 61 pregnant women in the state, the Meghalaya Human Rights Commission (MHRC) on Tuesday issued notices to the health and family welfare and social welfare departments.Hearing a petition filed by social activist Agnes Kharshiῖing, the MHRC directed the Commissioner and Secretary, health services, and additional chief secretary of the social welfare department to respond to the allegations made by the petitioner “…to submit a detailed report on the matter so as to reach the state commission within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice for further necessary orders”.The Commission also expressed concern over the matter which raises serious issues of violation of human rights as Article 21 of the Constitution mandates for the protection of life and personal liberty of every citizen. It also pointed out that the right to life and health is a fundamental right and it is the paramount duty of the state to protect and safeguard such rights of any individual.In her petition, Kharshiῖing, also, the president of the Civil Society of Women’s Organization (CSWO) sought the intervention of the MHRC with regard to the death of 877 newly born infants and 61 pregnant women in the state during the months of April till July, this year due to diseases other than the coronavirus.Elaborating on this, Kharshiῖing told HT over phone that the death of the 877 infants and 61 pregnant women as clarified by the Director of Health Services was due to lack of medical attention, pneumonia, and birth asphyxia and the death of most of the pregnant women happened since they were not admitted to the hospital or health care centre for institutional delivery.She further stated that the state has 12 big hospitals including private ones, 30 Community Health Centres (CHCs), 110 Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and also government-run civil hospitals in each of the 11 district headquarters, and the state suffers from a paucity of ambulances with only 72 ambulances serving the entire state with one or two ambulances for PHCs and CHCs.She alleged, “The right to health is integral to the right to life, and the government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities which in this case the fundamental rights under Article 21 is being violated,” she emphasised. “We need to ensure that such cases are minimised as much as possible. Right to life is applicable to all and newborn infants and pregnant women are no less. They need to be protected at all costs.”Reacting to the notice of the Commission, the state health department has acknowledged receipt of the same. Secretary of the department MN Nampui told HT, “We have duly received it and taken note of the content of the notice. We have written to the health directorate asking for response to the same following which the government will table its report before the Commission. Rest assured an in depth study over the matter will be conducted by the government.”Meanwhile, the Meghalaya State Commission for Women and the Meghalaya State Commission for Protection of Child Rights were also included as opposite party respondents in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-rights-body-notice-for-meghalaya-govt-over-deaths-of-877-infants-in-4-months/story-HloYkRlNiHPc8GFYTdE50J.html
22-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||As some of the regular readers of this column know, my reading has expanded since March to include dense academic papers published in serious journals that make me wish I had paid more attention to science and math during my college years. Late Tuesday/early Wednesday, two papers that dropped on the journal Science’s website piqued my interest. One was titled “Neuropilin-1 is a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection” and another “Neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infectivity”. The two papers are already beginning to make waves in epidemiological circles, and have also been reported by some specialised websites. There is a reason for this: 10 months into the pandemic’s run, there are still many unanswered questions about Covid-19 and the coronavirus that causes it. This isn’t surprising. What is surprising is the pace of scientific research that has helped us answer many other questions about Covid-19 and Sars-CoV-2. Among the important unanswered (or partially unanswered, because we do know some part of the answer) questions are those about the virus’s infectivity, and its ability to do more damage than typical respiratory infections do (which it does by targeting other body organs). And the two papers in Science provide answers to these, which would make them among the most important pieces of research on the coronavirus to be published in recent months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe second paper, published by researchers from Munich’s Technical University, University of Helsinki, and other institutions, finds that neuropilin-1 (NRP1) boosts the infectivity of Sars-CoV-2. Neuropilin 1 is a protein widely present in human cells. Previous studies have shown that the Sars-CoV-2 virus has a furin cleavage site. The S-protein of the virus has a site which can be cleaved by furin (a common human protein; it is an enzyme). Think of furin, then, as a can opener of sorts. The component of the viral protein thus cleaved interacts with ACE2, a cell surface receptor. ACE stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme. And it is this receptor that provides a channel for the viral protein to enter the cell. Clearly, furin is needed for cleavage (or breaking the spike protein), and ACE 2 for facilitating entry into the cell. And the paper found that infection of the virus increased in the presence of NRP1.The first paper, by researchers from the University of Bristol and others, showed that while furin cleaves the S protein into “two associated” proteins, S1 and S2, one of these proteins (S1) binds well with neuropilin 1, facilitating the entry of the virus into cells, and boosting infectivity. Two independent studies then have arrived at the same conclusion. And because NRP1 is found in cells in several parts of the human body, it isn’t surprising that Sars-CoV-2 is able to target several body organs and systems. Interestingly, the second study found (on the basis of pathological analysis) that olfactory nerve cells in the nasal cavity that were infected by Sars-CoV-2 had NRP1 – something that could explain why the loss of a sense of smell is seen in some Covid-19 patients – and that a “SARS-CoV-2 mutant with an altered furin cleavage site did not depend on NRP1 for infectivity”, a finding that shows a strong relationship between the presence of neuropilin 1 and the infectivity of the virus that causes Covid.As the first paper puts it: “NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for Sars-CoV-2 infection and may provide a therapeutic target for COVID-19.”This could simply involve something that blocks NRP1. For instance, the second study found that an antibody that blocked neuropilin reduced Sars-CoV-2 infection by around 40%.

22-10-2020||India||Maharashtra withdraws consent to CBI for probes in state||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday withdrew the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, making it mandatory for the federal agency to seek the state government’s permission before taking up cases within its borders. Vineet Agrawal, principal secretary (special), home department, confirmed an order to this effect was issued. Maharashtra became the fourth state to issue such an order. CBI, which functions under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, will have to approach the Maharashtra government for permission for investigation on a case-by-case basis, another senior bureaucrat, who did not want to be named, said.Maharashtra’s move came a day after CBI decided to probe the alleged manipulation of Television Rating Points (TRP) after registering a first information report (FIR) on the recommendation of the Uttar Pradesh government. Earlier this month, Mumbai Police shone light on the alleged scam. They are probing three channels, including Republic TV. The state police have registered an FIR for cheating and criminal conspiracy, among other charges, and arrested eight people. “The Maharashtra government cannot stop CBI from investigating the TRP case registered on the recommendation of the Uttar Pradesh government; it cannot stop CBI from interrogating people in this particular case. However, now CBI cannot take over the Mumbai Police’s FIR in the TRP case without the state government’s approval. Wednesday’s decision seems to have been taken to stop CBI from taking up their TRP case,” a retired CBI official, who asked not to be named, said.“It will be interesting to see how courts react (if there is a legal dispute) in two separate cases on the TRP issue...,” he added.CBI did not officially comment on Maharashtra’s decision. A senior agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said “regular withdrawal of general consent by states for conducting probes in their territory makes the agency’s work difficult”. He, however, said that the state’s decision will not affect ongoing probes. “It’s a settled law that once consent has been given for a probe, it cannot be withdrawn. But from now, for any new probe against any government official — be it central or state government official — we will need to approach the Maharashtra government. For example, if we have to investigate an officer of the Mumbai Port Trust, we will have to seek the state’s nod. Also, the state government cannot block probes ordered by high courts or the Supreme Court.” Shrihari Aney, a former advocate general of Maharashtra, too, said the move will not affect ongoing cases (such as the one into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput). He added that CBI can seek an appropriate court order if it intends to investigate a case in Maharashtra if the state government denies consent.“I see this (the move) as the result of a turf war and ego clash....when it comes to a point where a particular agency will probe and not the other, it is an ego tussle,” Aney said.The decision came against the backdrop of a tug of war between the state’s police force and CBI in at least two high-profile cases. Before the TRP case, Mumbai Police were locked in a jurisdictional tussle with the Centre and CBI over the death of Rajput, who was found hanging at his Mumbai apartment on June 14 in what the police said appeared to be an open-and-shut case of suicide. A political controversy erupted after a Bihar Police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family in Patna alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterpart. Subsequently, CBI took over the case on Bihar’s request.A Maharashtra minister, who requested anonymity, said the increasing interference of the central government in policing forced the state government to make such a move. “We saw what happened in the case of Sushant Singh Rajput matter...Policing is a state subject. The hijacking of cases to undermine the authority of the state government every time cannot be tolerated,” he said.In late 2018, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh withdrew the general consent to CBI for investigations, alleging that the Centre was misusing the agency to harass opponents. However, the government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, which came into power in Andhra 2019, reversed the decision. Chhattisgarh, ruled by the Congress, withdrew the general consent to CBI in January 2019. And in July 2020, the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan followed suit. CBI comes under the DSPE Act and it requires states to give the agency a general consent to act against central government employees within a state as public order and police are under the purview of state governments, which routinely renew the permission under section 6 of the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-withdraws-consent-to-cbi-for-probes-in-state/story-RK76tQol6tENhStV8IWFQM.html
22-10-2020||India||Odisha Lokayukta serves notice to BJD MLA over allegation that he blew up a flood embankment||An MLA of the Biju Janata Dal and 5 others including government officials have been issued a notice by the Odisha Lokayukta over allegations by an RTI activist that he conspired to damage an irrigation embankment during floods in August this year that led to submergence of thousands of acres of farmland.The office of the Lokayukta served a notice to BJD MLA Pranab Balabantaray and five other officials of works and water resources department including a relative of the MLA for hearing in the matter in December after RTI activist Sarbeswar Beura lodged a complaint. The complaint alleged that on August 28 this year, the irrigation embankment road from NH-5 (Gokarneswar) to Budhalinga Majhipada Road for preventing the waters of Kelua River entering the farmlands, was damaged by dynamites that inundated 4000 hectares of standing paddy crop in 7 gram panchayats of Jajpur district.“Balabantaray with the help of junior engineer Naren Jena and others engaged miscreants to damage this embankment through explosives for suppression of the irregularities and misappropriation of huge amount of money in the construction work. This embankment did not witness any strong current in flow of flood water to cause any damage to the embankment. There was a deep-laid conspiracy to destroy it,” the RTI activist alleged.He further alleged that the embankment was sanctioned in 2016 by the office of the Executive Engineer (Roads and Buildings), Panikoili division at an estimated cost of Rs 21.99 crore.“Junior engineer Naren Jena, uncle of the MLA, who was in charge of supervising and monitoring the construction of the said embankment road, had demanded huge gratification from the contractor which resulted in substandard work. When I filed the RTI application with the office of executive engineer (Roads and buildings) of Panikoili division in Jajpur seeking details of information about the work, the PIO did not provide any information. Apprehending that the corruption in the poor civil work of the embankment would be exposed, it was destroyed during the floods,” alleged Beura.Neither BJD MLA Balabantaray nor the party commented on the allegations though HT sought their comments.Earlier, the opposition BJP too had accused the BJD MLA of blowing off the river embankment in flood-affected Jajpur district with dynamite seeking stringent action against him. BJP state general secretary Lekhasri Samantsinghar had alleged that the 300-feet breach in the embankment of the Kelua River was deliberately created.The water resources department has also lodged an FIR with the local police as its preliminary probe revealed that the breach was an artificial one. “An FIR has been lodged with the Dharmashala police station in connection with creation of the breach in Kelua river embankment using dynamite,” the engineer-in-chief of water resources department Jyotirmaya Rath said.The floods in Odisha in August had left 17 people dead and over 10,000 houses damaged while affecting 1.4 million people in 20 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-lokayukta-serves-notice-to-bjd-mla-over-allegation-that-he-blew-up-a-flood-embankment/story-F86HI8Qb0lVpM44YoJn7iI.html
22-10-2020||India||‘Unwarranted’: Navy responds to obstacle charge in Goa’s ‘development’||Amid complaints by members of the Goa government that need for clearance by the Navy authorities for any construction in the vicinity of the Dabolim airport was an obstacle to the “development” of the state, the Navy has hit back terming such utterances as “entirely unwarranted”, while insisting that it has a clear charter of duties which it has never exceeded.The Navy operates the dual purpose Goa International Airport, which is also a naval base.“There have been statements reported by TV channels and print media regarding clearances required from the Indian Navy for construction in the vicinity of Dabolim Airport. It is reiterated that clearances/restrictions are in accordance with the Ministry of Civil Aviation (Height Restrictions for Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations) Rules, 2015,” the Navy said. “Since the Indian Navy operates the civil airport at Dabolim, cases for NOC in respect of Dabolim Airport are processed by Indian Navy as opposed to purely civil airfields in the country where such clearances are processed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI),” Navy spokesperson K P Ajesh said in a statement.The statement comes after members of the Mormugao Planning and Development Authority, a planning body that is dominated by political leaders that allow for or withhold construction permissions, have been speaking to the media lamenting that the need for clearance by the Navy authorities in the vicinity of the airport was an added obstacle to the “development” of the state.“Unfounded allegations like Indian Navy is ‘restricting development’ in Goa are uncalled for as aviation safety at Dabolim is of paramount concern and will not be compromised. The issue of permits/NOCs is purely driven by international safety standards and has no relation with hindering development in Goa, least of all by the Indian Navy,” the Navy has insisted.“Statements made in the media like the Navy wanting to ‘control Goa’ are entirely unwarranted and the nation’s Armed Forces have a clear charter which is never exceeded. The Indian Navy has been in the forefront to render assistance to the local citizens during times of crisis such as floods, etc,” it added.The Navy pointed out that in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic when flights operations were suspended, it ferried samples collected in Goa to the lab in Pune as the state was yet to set up its own testing lab for Covid-19 samples. Similarly, the Navy also pitched in and helped transport PPE kits for the doctors in the state. Earlier this year, Minister of Panchayati Raj, Mauvin Godinho who is also a member of the Mormugao Planning and Development Authority, had accused the Navy of trying to rule Goa by proxy, for what he said was dictating the nature of constructions around the airport.It later transpired that a close aide of Godinho, who was also a builder, was seeking to regularise two residential complexes that fell within the flight approach path, a move that was steadfastly rejected by the Navy as the buildings didn’t meet the height restrictions that are mandatory around the airport.The Bombay High Court at Goa had in an order directed the Navy to act against buildings that violated the height restrictions and came down heavily on the Mormugao Planning and Development Authority for trying to save the allegedly illegal buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unwarranted-navy-responds-to-obstacle-charge-in-goa-s-development/story-KrHjlkYMzr3SHlPUww5xPN.html

22-10-2020||India||Northeast border row: Mizoram agrees to pull back forces from Assam||Four days after violence along the inter-state border injured several people, Mizoram on Wednesday agreed to pull back its security forces from areas in Assam. The decision was taken at a meeting of senior officials of both states on Wednesday evening with Satyendra Kumar Garg, joint secretary (in charge of northeast), Union ministry of home affairs, at the circuit house in Silchar, Assam. “We will move back the security forces which had come down to Assam side. This should help stranded vehicles to enter Mizoram. There was no discussion on the border dispute in today’s meeting,” Mizoram home secretary Pi Lalbiaksangi told journalists after the meeting. Garg, who reached Silchar to diffuse the tense situation along the border, said that the discussions between both states were very fruitful and Assam and Mizoram have agreed to resolve issues amicably through talks. Assam home secretary Gyanendra Dev Tripathi said that both sides have agreed to restore peace and normalcy along the border areas and efforts are underway to resume movement of trucks stranded at the border. The areas along the border between two states have been tense since Saturday after some residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district of Mizoram set on fire temporary huts made by residents of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam on a stretch of disputed land. Mizoram says the huts were built on ‘no man’s land’ while Assam claims the area as theirs. Following the incident, residents on the Assam side have blocked the highway going to Mizoram and hundreds of goods-laden trucks on way to the neighbouring state are stranded. Earlier on Wednesday, a home secretary-level meeting between both states was held at an army camp close to Lailapur along the inter-state boundary and it was attended by senior police and district officials. As part of confidence building measures, both sides agreed to hold interactions among deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and divisional forest officers of border districts once a month. Mizoram home secretary Lalbiaksangi requested Assam officials to ensure movement of stranded trucks while Tripathi requested the Mizoram side to take action against miscreants who burnt down huts on the Assam side on Saturday and also ensure there is no encroachment of reserve forests. “We are for people to people contact and keeping every mode of communication open so that the camaraderie and bonhomie that exist between people of both neighbouring states prevail,” said Tripathi. Talking to journalists after the meeting, Lalbiaksangi assured that the Mizoram government will provide security to trucks coming from the Assam side. “Our priority is to maintain peace and ensure movement of the stranded trucks. The other issues including the border row can be discussed later,” Assam Police’s Special DGP (Border) Mukesh Agarwal told journalists. Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km long boundary. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972, when it became a union territory. It became a state in 1987. There have been minor skirmishes in the past with Mizoram seeking delineation of the border on the basis of East Bengal Frontier Regulation of 1873.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-border-row-mizoram-agrees-to-pull-back-forces-from-assam/story-1W5QdY0uuC7A2InUTC5RiN.html
22-10-2020||India||Farmers ease ‘rail roko’ protest in Punjab||Farmers’ bodies in Punjab eased their three-week-long “rail roko” agitation by allowing the passage of goods trains in the state on Wednesday, a day after the assembly passed four bills and a resolution to counter the three controversial farm legislations enacted by the Centre last month. “We have decided to allow only goods trains from today (Wednesday) till November 5,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) after meeting of 30 farmers’ organisations in Chandigarh. Chief minister Amarinder Singh welcomed the decision, saying it was in the interest of the state’s economy and its revival. He said the farmers had shown their concern for the people of Punjab. However, farmers, who have been protesting against the Centre’s farm reforms laws since September 24, said passenger trains would not be allowed and their representatives would keep vigil at railway stations. Patiala said the protest outside the premises of state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and the gherao of business establishments of some corporate houses would continue until November 5. “The next course of action will be announced in a meeting fixed for November 4,” he added. Commenting on the four bills passed by the assembly, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said it was a “big achievement” in the farmers’ agitation. “It has happened for the first time that a special session of the assembly was called and the bills were passed under pressure from farmers. It has marked a beginning of big political movement and it could spread to other states also,” he added. Rajewal said farmers’ bodies are prepared for a long haul. The Punjab version of the central legislation is aimed at addressing the concerns of farmers and may be adopted by other non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-ruled states, including a provision to protect the MSPs that government procurement agencies pay for farmers’ produce.Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say the Centre’s farm reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the system of MSPs and that deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.The Centre’s ruling BJP says the fears are unfounded and the three laws will usher in much-needed reforms in the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-ease-rail-roko-protest-in-punjab/story-TZDwhQga7WrkmqUy6TMVJJ.html
22-10-2020||India||Anti-tank missile with 10km range to be tested in 2 months||India is developing a new air-launched missile capable of knocking out enemy tanks from a stand-off distance of more than 10km, and a crucial test of the weapon will be conducted in two months at a time when the country is locked in border tensions with China in the Ladakh theatre, top officials familiar with the developments said on Wednesday. The indigenous missile -- named stand-off anti-tank missile (Sant) -- is expected to be mated to the Indian Air Force’s Russian-origin Mi-35 attack helicopters to arm them with the capability to destroy enemy armour from an improved stand-off range, one of the officials cited above said, asking not to be named. The existing Russian-origin Shturm missile on the Mi-35 can target tanks at a range of 5km. The other weapons on the gunship include rockets of different calibre, 500kg bombs, 12.7mm guns, and a 23mm cannon. Sant -- being developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) -- will be launched from a Mi-35 helicopter gunship for the first time in December, in what is being seen as a developmental milestone. “Preparations are being made for the maiden test-firing of the missile from a Mi-35 gunship. A series of air-launched tests will follow next year after which the missile will be ready for induction,” said a second official on condition of anonymity, adding that the missile will have lock-on after launch and lock-on before launch capability. A lock-on means the target has been detected and the missile will hit it irrespective of any change in the target’s position. The plan is to test the new missile from the attack helicopter eight to 10 times before it is declared operational by the end of 2021, the second official said. “An improved stand-off capability -- from 5km to 10km -- to target tanks will be a good capability enhancement for the Mi-35. If the helicopter can engage enemy armour from a distance of 10km, it is unlikely to take a hit from ground fire,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd). The existing anti-tank missiles developed by DRDO -- the Nag and Helina -- have an effective range of under 5km. While the Nag missile is launched from a modified infantry combat vehicle (called the Nag missile carrier or Namica) and has a range of 4km, the Helina or helicopter-based Nag is for mounting on the Dhruv advanced light helicopter and can strike targets up to 5km away. The Sant missile was successfully tested from a ground launcher on Monday off the coast of Odisha -- the 13th test-firing of a missile by India in less than two months in the midst of the border stand-off with China and deadlocked talks to reduce tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). Neither the defence ministry nor DRDO made any public announcement on the October 19 test. The key tests recently conducted by India include the supersonic missile-assisted release of torpedo (SMART) to target submarines at long ranges, a new version of the nuclear-capable hypersonic Shaurya missile with a range of 750km and the anti-radiation missile launch to take down enemy radars and surveillance systems. India is also developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence. In early September, DRDO carried out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time from a launch facility off the Odisha coast. Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-manoeuvring hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept. India could develop hypersonic cruise missiles powered by air-breathing scramjet engines in about four years. Mach 6 translates into a speed of 7,408 kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-tank-missile-with-10km-range-to-be-tested-in-2-months/story-Lrc3BQKUNxX1tjtRwg8ckJ.html
22-10-2020||India||Central team cautions Bihar on spike in Covid cases during festive season||A three-member Central team has cautioned Bihar of a possible spike in Covid-19 cases with elections and festival season just around the corner. It asked the state to be particularly cautious during the upcoming Chhath festival next month. It was on Tuesday that the state capital Patna reported 392 new infections, the highest single day spike in cases in the last two months. The team held a marathon five-hour discussion with state health officials on Wednesday, and also visited the Patna Medical College Hospital and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH). The state officials made power-point presentations of the total cases, positivity rate, containment measures put in place, testing, isolation of patients and utilisation of institutional beds. It went to the two state-run medical colleges to assess their infrastructure and preparedness to cope with a possible spike in cases. It also enquired about availability of oxygen through centralised pipeline at the two hospitals. The team was likely to visit an adjoining district near Patna on Thursday to assess medical infrastructure there. State health officials were tightlipped about the central team’s observation after visiting the PMCH and the NMCH. Barring Patna, most of the districts had a positivity rate of less than 5% on real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a confirmatory test for Covid-19. Patna’s positivity rate was over 7%, said sources. “Members of the Central team generally do not say anything. They just jot down points on the basis of their inspection, or the presentation the state makes before them. The team lead briefs the principal secretary of the department concerned before leaving, and the officials submit their report to the ministry concerned that later trickles down to us,” said an officer of the health department. Health officials made light of the Central team’s visit, saying it was a “routine visit” to assess the Covid situation ahead of three-phase assembly elections in the state, beginning October 28. “This is the fourth visit of a central team to Bihar since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state in March. Similar teams have gone to other states. Central teams have visited Maharashtra seven times during the same period,” said an officer requesting anonymity. Bihar cadre bureaucrat Atish Chandra, posted as joint secretary in the ministry of agriculture, led the Central team. Dr CS Taklekar from the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, New Delhi, and Dr Dependra Kumar Rai from AIIMS-Patna were the other members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-cautions-bihar-on-spike-in-covid-cases-during-festive-season/story-do5z1yHyyCg6VkSaVQV7sN.html
