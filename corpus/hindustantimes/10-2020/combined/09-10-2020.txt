09-10-2020||News||The lack of mobility hinders the India story||There has been a lot of discussion in the public domain lately about dynasties and nepotism in fields ranging from the film world to politics. Let’s look at nepotism. What is wrong with people going into a family business or following the family tradition into professions such as medicine, acting, or politics?The obvious answer is that this gives the person an unfair advantage because those with similar abilities and who have put in as much effort could have very different outcomes, depending on their background. One could argue that while this is true, those who get an opportunity through family ties still have to perform well. So, from a broader perspective, isn’t there a zero-sum aspect to this? One person getting a favour deprives another person, but the total gains and losses cancel out, don’t they? This is not true. Nepotism imposes not just individual costs but wider social and economic costs. Those with family connections don’t face the same level of competition as outsiders, exactly as domestic companies face much less competition when there are import barriers. Breaking in is much harder for an outsider than it is for an insider as the pool of outsiders is much wider and those who have the talent may never get the opportunity to showcase it. Therefore, there is a loss of potential output or value to society because of the resulting misallocation of talent.That is a direct negative effect. There is comprehensive evidence that family firms are often beset by inefficiency, with bad management affecting the productivity of the entire organisation. There are further indirect negative effects of nepotism on efficiency. If it is known that rewards depend on connections and not on effort and initiative, it would divert people’s efforts away from productive work to networking and lobbying.So, how does nepotism persist? Why aren’t there some corrective forces at work that would chip away at the inefficiencies and let talent blossom? Standard economic logic would imply that market competition would push out bad products and bad performers. After all, talent is a resource and if it is inefficiently deployed, it should be in someone’s interest to exploit a market opportunity — exactly as we would expect land that could be prized real estate not to remain unused. There are two main reasons why this may not happen.First, there are often explicit barriers to competition. This gives incumbent groups monopoly power and enables inefficient practices such as nepotism to flourish. Examples of such entry barriers include economic institutions such as monopolies, syndicates and cartels; social institutions such as the caste system and patriarchy; and policies that prevent the inflow of workers, goods and services from outside, such as anti-immigration laws and protectionism. Here, potential competitors are explicitly excluded and, therefore, insiders get undue advantage because of restricted competition. However, the losses of outsiders and the gains of insiders do not cancel each other out. Because of restricted competition, there is a loss to society from lack of access to the best technologies, products, skills and services.Second, a less open and subtle channel of nepotism has to do with the fact that in certain domains, it is not easy to come up with an objective measure of quality. It is hard for a bad mobile phone to survive in the market or a mediocre sportsperson to survive international competition. The ordinary consumer can separate the good from the bad and the marketplace would tend to weed out the bad. But for many professions, quality or performance is not that visible or cannot be readily and independently verified. In the case of research, for example, evaluation of quality is based on peer-review. By their very nature, these opinions are based on information and judgement that outsiders cannot hold up to scrutiny. Therefore, to the extent the opinions of experts, referrals, reputation, endorsements, and networks are necessary to certify quality in any field, they become a potential breeding ground for nepotism.Of course, nepotism is just one of the symptoms of a much of broader issue — the lack of mobility. In a mobile society, where family background does not determine what occupation someone enters or where one is located — a lot of the kind of conflicts (pro-farmer vs pro-business, pro-worker vs pro-industry) we see around us would be less relevant. Even though average levels of income and educational outcomes have improved following economic liberalisation, mobility remains low overall, whether in occupation or educational attainment.How to facilitate mobility is the real challenge, not the stale debate about redistribution versus growth. Policies that reduce the barriers that the less-advantaged face usually come from the Left, while reforms that facilitate greater competition are advocated by the Right. These are, in fact, complementary as far as mobility is concerned: The greater the competition in product and labour markets, the higher the demand for talent and skills, and policies helping the disadvantaged but meritorious acquire necessary skills and training will push up supply. How to design such policies and whether we will have the political will and the State capacity to implement them, as always, are the main challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-lack-of-mobility-hinders-the-india-story/story-S0bXf5WXgulWMfKfRzUBvJ.html
09-10-2020||News||Boosting India’s mental health care apparatus||Mental health has had its Cinderella moment this year. From being the neglected and stigmatised domain of health care, it has become, in the wake of the socio-economic upheaval caused by Covid-19, the newest woke slogan. Public health experts, media, policymakers, self-styled gurus and social media influencers, among others, have expressed their views on this in the past six months. Everyone has a story and a solution; but little has changed on the ground. Many myths about mental health remain in our collective thinking — those who face mental health problems are weak; seeking help makes one dependent; psychiatric medicines are addictive; and psychotherapy and counselling can alter people’s thinking instantly. In a recent study in Lancet on the Burden of Mental Health in India, it was reported that, in 2017, there were 197.3 million people with mental disorders, comprising 14·3% of the total population. Mental disorders contributed 4·7% to the total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) in India in 2017 as compared to approximately 2·5% in 1990 (one DALY essentially being one lost year of “healthy” life). Various studies have reported that the treatment gap is as high as 95%. Treatment, even when available, is largely focussed on medicines. Access to psychological and social interventions for mental health problems is not available to most people. The more vulnerable — children in institutions and in need of care and protection, the homeless, women who face violence, people living in conflict areas and those facing discrimination due to identity and disability — are the least likely to have access to mental health services. One of the key barriers to access is the lack of mental health human resources. The World Health Organization’s Mental Health Atlas in 2017 documents that India has around a total of 25,000 mental health workers. India spends 1.3% of its health budget on mental health. The current strategies for developing human resource are focussed on training more psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses and psychiatric social workers, whose numbers are woefully inadequate. But if all commissions for women, child care and protection organisations, schools, universities, employee-assistance schemes, neighbourhood clinics and wellness centres were to integrate mental health in the services they provide (as required by the law), the need for mental health human resources would be a few hundred thousand skilled professionals. If access to mental health services for all has to become a reality, we have to rethink the current traditional definition of mental health human resources and revamp the methodology for developing these.In an article to be published in Indian Journal of Social Psychiatry, a case has been made to synchronise the mental health human resource strategy with the development of community mental health services. India needs to work towards a three-tiered mental health workforce comprising associates, practitioners and specialists. The associates would be the primary level workers for mental health interventions at the village or urban cluster-level. They would make up a new cadre of frontline community mental health workers which can be set up by repurposing the present Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) cadre, first-response community development workers or members of women’s self-help groups. More importantly, employment guarantee schemes in both rural and urban areas could include community mental first aid as one of the activities which qualify as work provided by them.The mental health associates would be the first point of contact, and would be able to form empathetic relationships, support people in decision-making and work with an individual or a group of individuals under supervision. They would also work towards increasing awareness and linking people to crisis intervention and secondary and tertiary mental health services.The next level, practitioners, would form the spine of mental health service delivery and would be graduates with specific training in community mental health. Their competencies would include supporting adaptive coping programmes; providing online behavioural and cognitive interventions; supporting care and protection processes in residential and community settings; facilitating informed choices, independence, safety, dignity, privacy and participation in everyday life for those living with mental health problems. These practitioners would also start conversations and galvanise communities around initiatives to challenge stigma and facilitate inclusion.The specialists would include the current mental health professionals, but would also strategically allow post-graduates in psychology and social work to upgrade their skills through an advanced diploma in community mental health. They will provide leadership, training, tertiary services and supervision.We have lived with the legacy of institutional care mechanisms and related limitations of human resource planning for too long. The current pandemic should precipitate a disruptive change. It must be used to not only mitigate the present psycho-social impact, but lay the foundations for a more comprehensive network of mental health services in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/boosting-india-s-mental-health-care-apparatus/story-olc40ZPR4krIxAqKi41jjL.html
09-10-2020||News||Use technology to improve governance||A memorable quote paraphrased from the Arthashastra by Kautilya goes: “It is as difficult to prevent a government servant from corruption as to prevent a fish from drinking water.” This suggests that corruption is not a new phenomenon.The East India Company is known to have struggled to keep corruption in check. In fact, the problem of corruption in the social and political spheres has often come in for strident criticism.This issue has triggered several measures aimed at enhancing integrity in public life – the enactment of the Public Procurement Bill, Lokpal Act incorporating, inter alia, the disclosure of assets by public servants and reforms in higher judicial appointments to name a few. While there are divergent positions in terms of strategies and focus areas, the one point of convergence is the unanimous acceptance that technology and e-governance promotes greater transparency.It has been five years since the adoption of the United Nation (UN)’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) by India and other member states. It can be argued that corruption in public life, directly or indirectly, adversely affects the achievement of all 17 SDGs. A proactive and preventive vigilance regime is critical to the realisation of these SDGs. Governments are expectedly risk-averse in dealing with both public policies and public money while enterprises thrive on risk-taking. This often hobbles the entrepreneurial spirit in the public sector. How do we make governance more effective without inhibiting its objectives? Today, administrative affairs grapple with leakages in public delivery of welfare and development goals on account one critical problem— manual processes that can be very easily manipulated. These are often so complex and laborious that even a well-intentioned public servant is, on occasion, chary of implementing beneficial decisions. Technology can cut through much of these daunting processes.In the recent discourse on procurement methods, transparency of policy, procedure and practices is increasingly being seen as an imperative when utilising public money.However, transparency is not an end in itself. The whole process must be open to public scrutiny. The transparency of procedure as seen in online applications is one of the simple yet effective features of digitisation, as it shifts the onus of submitting correct information and data to the applicant. In an effort to plug leakages in procurement systems, the government launched the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in 2016 for goods and services required by central and state governments, and public sector undertakings. This not only made it simpler to procure goods and services but also significantly impacted cost savings. An assessment by the Centre for Public Impact showed that the savings from the implementation of GeM has been substantial. The price reduction of approximately 56% of goods and services coupled with demand aggregation has led to savings of ₹40,000 crores annually. Given the fact that the public procurement economy in India constitutes about 20% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it is imperative to build on this initiative with a view to onboard as many goods and services as possible. In the next decade, the business of government is going to experience massive disruptions. This comes on the back of technological enhancements that reduce the need for intermediaries and ensure that the sanctity of process remains unimpeachable. One such technology is blockchain. NITI Aayog released a discussion paper earlier this year, in which it identified use-cases where the technology can potentially improve governance ranging from tracing of drugs in the pharmaceutical supply chain to verification of education certificates. The three key principles of blockchain technology are transparency, decentralisation and accountability. One of the most productive areas of intervention for this technology would be in land records. A vast developing country like India, with its diverse land tenure systems, is bound to have major problems in this area. The system is riddled with inefficiencies that reduce trust in the government. Currently the United Nations Development Programme is involved in Proof of Concept (POC) pilots across India. This is to create an immutable history of transactional records that helps in checking authenticity; create a tamper-proof system to avoid forgery; create a distributed ledger so that all stakeholders see the same information and set up a secure encrypted environment, where updates are available in near real time. The NITI Aayog paper notes that, in order to ensure that transactions are not fraudulent, the physical presence of witnesses is mandated at the time of sales deed registry. Deployment of blockchain would potentially eliminate the need of these processes while maintaining the sanctity of the transaction. This has several spin-off benefits. It helps create a tamper-proof audit trail that allows for tracking decision-making and ensures that such decisions are in accordance with anti-corruption principles. It addresses concerns around cyber security that come with any effort towards digitisation. Currently there are interesting pilots being conducted across the world, where deployment of blockchain is being tested for public procurement. From the perspective of Internal Controls and Governance (Vigilance), it is strongly recommended to employ a five-part test while assessing such deviations from process: One, whether the issue being pursued has corruption connotations; two, the general reputation of the employee involved; three, whether better options were available and ignored without valid reasoning; four, whether the situation inhibited the selection of any other option but the one finally chosen; and, five, whether the larger interest of the organisation was safeguarded.However, a significant factor in blockchain’s success will be the ability to develop/reform laws and building robust data protection and maintenance regimes. Until such time, blockchain is not likely to have a significant impact in creating an integrity-first governance ecosystem. The general environment now is in favour of a regime which ensures that companies not only do profitable business but do so in an ethical manner. The United Nations Convention against Corruption ratified by India in 2011 as well as the anti-corruption principles of the the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) cover a wide swathe of vulnerable areas and aspects of business operations including anti-bribery, public procurement and conflict of interest. Going forward, more countries will be obliged to establish laws and mechanisms to ensure clean business operations.India needs to review its existing legal frameworks to address issues around, inter alia, data security, corrupt practices and corporate governance with a view to address anti-corruption objectives. The government made a significant change to the Prevention of Corruption Act in 2018. In the earlier regime, even honest public officials were harassed if a decision provided pecuniary advantage to a person without any public interest. Now the element of intention has been added under the definition of criminal misconduct. Similarly, broadening the definition of “unfair advantage” and the introduction of corporate criminal liability will go a long way in apprehending or deterring those indulging in bribery. While these amendments will help guide the work of internal control agencies, it is important to institutionalise a system where compliance and established processes can be routinely checked and quantified. A metrics-based system for oversight in governmental processes will bring about transparency, build trust with citizens and spur further digital innovation to make any administration more robust. We must also focus on the well-intentioned public servant who finds the processes leading to greater transparency and ensuring value for taxpayers’ money cumbersome and who is, therefore, tempted to short-circuit these. Well-intentioned though she may be, any attempt to overwrite the processes despite even demonstrable honesty of purpose, carries the major risk of opening the system to misuse by dishonest players and will lead to the loss of public trust and decimation of the structure of public procurement. It is only through robust yet streamlined procedures that a bureaucrat can achieve the intended outcome and avoid unintended consequences.

While certain mitigating measures have been put in place, this would be an opportune time to consider a fundamental shift in re-imagining elderly care. The western model of moving older people to specialised care homes is being re-examined as such communities in the United States (US) and Europe have become epicentres of Covid-19-related fatalities. This is despite such facilities having high-grade infrastructure, trained personnel and proper safety protocols. A recent article by Dileep Mavalankar and Jallavi Panchamia of the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, in these pages, focused on India’s old age homes which seem to have staved off the coronavirus so far. But, as rightly pointed out by the authors, more data-based and scientific research needs to be done to study the full impact of Covid-19 in old age homes. The Association of Senior Living India (ASLI), an industry body representing senior care in India, has played a vital role in allowing members to share information, and learn from best practices on how the senior living industry can manage better infection control and Covid-support systems.Of the 110 million elderly population in India, not more than a few thousand stay in senior living/old age homes. Over 99% either stay alone or with their children and most want to remain in their homes. It is important to find ways to empower older people to continue to live safe, secure, healthy and engaged lives in the place they love the most — their home. It is now clear that even after vaccines become available, the challenges the elderly, who are more vulnerable, will face are likely to continue. The current health care system looks at the elderly as “patients” suffering from a particular disease. This disease-centric view in the health care industry often ignores the fact that most older people have multiple co-morbidities, and both they and their family members are unaware of the complex inter-relationships between disease treatments. The increasing trend towards nuclear families, job-related migration, shifting social norms, and an increasing preference among elders to stay independent make their lives more vulnerable. In many ways, the life of an older person is disconnected — disconnected from health care, transportation, home-support systems, emergency systems, and most important, social engagement. Social distancing is something the elderly have experienced for decades now. However, if technology and a greater understanding of their needs are interweaved, they can have the choice of remaining at home. Several neighbourhoods and resident welfare associations have recently demonstrated that there are possibilities where inter-generational teams can take the responsibility for addressing the needs of the elderly in the community. Older people connected with offline and online communities can finally look forward to dealing with a “pandemic” they have faced all along, that of loneliness. Better technologies and sensors facilitate their staying at home and yet have the community at just a click away. The problem lies in the perception that there is something wrong with becoming an older person. Old age is no different from other stages of evolution. But our collective imagination has stopped thinking beyond adulthood and billions of dollars are spent on the “being young” mindset. We need a more productive dialogue among the elderly, their associations, civic bodies, urban designers and health care leaders on how we can have a long-term, partnered, inclusive and holistic care approach for the elderly. Systems for taking care of the elderly have failed across the world. The solutions call for innovation and inclusion. Perhaps India can show the way.

09-10-2020||News||The Babri verdict is a step towards peace||On September 30, after 28 years, a special court in Lucknow acquitted all the 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. It found no credible evidence to support the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)’s charges that the demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992, was a premeditated conspiracy by the accused. It held that it was a spontaneous act, beyond the control of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other leaders present at the site on the day. The controversy started when following permission from the Supreme Court (SC), and under the watch of an observer appointed by it, hundreds of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, to perform a symbolic kar seva, an expression of the religious sentiments of worshippers of Ram at a distance from the structure. The assembly was never declared unlawful by any authority. However, without the knowledge of the kar seva organisers, certain stray groups inveigled themselves into the crowd of kar sevaks, broke the barricades, and moved towards the disputed structure. Defying the orders of the authorities and requests from the kar sevaks, these groups began demolishing the structure. Meanwhile, the kar seva organisers were left stranded on the dais at the Ram Katha Kunj on the orders of the authorities, helpless to prevent the demolition. Speaking of that day, senior BJP leader, LK Advani, stated in an interview that December 6, 1992, was the saddest day of his life.Subsequent to the demolition, two FIRs were filed at the Ram Janmabhoomi police station. These were politically motivated and aimed at maligning the BJP and other leaders present in Ayodhya. In the first FIR, filed against unknown persons, the time of demolition was recorded as 12 pm, while in the second FIR, filed against Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and six others, 10 minutes after the first FIR, the time of demolition was recorded as 10 am. During the subsequent trial, this inconsistency could never be satisfactorily explained by the prosecution or the witnesses. The FIRs started off as being two separate investigations, first by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the crime branch and then by CBI. Subsequently, the cases were transferred from Lalitpur to Rae Bareli to Lucknow, with one of the cases being transferred back to Rae Bareli and then finally being clubbed together by the SC in 2017 to be heard by a special court in Lucknow.At various junctures, proceedings against some of the accused were dropped and then reinstated. During this long, arduous period, multiple appeals were filed, both by the accused and the prosecution.Finally, the SC gave Surendra Kumar Yadav, Special Judge, Ayodhya Prakaran, the task of concluding the trial with categorical directions that he not to be transferred till it was completed. The charge-sheet was initially filed by CBI in 1993 and subsequently a supplementary charge-sheet was filed in 1996. The Congress was in power when the investigation was conducted. The prosecution produced 351 witnesses and 625 pieces of evidence, including photographs, audio and video cassettes and newspaper and magazine reports. Despite this, the sheer lack of primary evidence proved that the prosecution’s case had no solid ground. Under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, secondary evidence can be relied upon only if the lack of primary evidence is explained to the satisfaction of the court. As noted by the special court, no such explanation was forthcoming. On the various charges brought against the accused, including those under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153B (imputations prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (statements conducing public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the special court noted that none could be proved against any of the accused. Primarily, this was attributed to the broken chain of custody of the audio and video cassettes with absence of analysis by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) to confirm their veracity. In the 2,300-page-long verdict, the special court analysed all aspects of the case, including witness testimonies and the evidence produced in great detail and came to the conclusion that none of the charges were sustainable.Even the Liberhan Commission had found no evidence of a conspiracy behind the demolition. The order of the special court has now finally vindicated the BJP’s stand that neither its leaders nor any kar sevaks were involved in the demolition. This should help everyone to move forward towards a harmonious future.

The rates of vegetables such as capsicum, cauliflower, potatoes, green chilli and cucumber have increased by Rs 15 to 50 in the last one week. The price of potato has increased from Rs 25 to Rs 40 per kg, capsicum from Rs 80 to Rs 120, cauliflower from Rs 70 to Rs 100, green chilli from Rs 70 to Rs 100, onion from Rs 30 to Rs 50 per kg.Rakesh Bhatia, a wholesale dealer at the vegetable market, said, “The price hike is due to the scarcity of supply. Vegetables such as capsicum and cauliflower come from Himachal Pradesh, onion and other vegetables from other regions due to which the prices will remain same at least for the next 10 days.” He added that the prices are likely to come down after that. Meanwhile, residents say they are cutting down on vegetable consumption.Ruchi Anand, a housewife, said, “The hike in vegetable prices has totally affected our household budget. I have cut down on the consumption of a few vegetables and prefer buying paneer instead of cauliflower or capsicum.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soaring-veggie-prices-disturb-household-budget-of-ludhiana-residents/story-ICILSr3siWQvG1L3AjBRlM.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Sharp spike in Mumbai’s air pollution, worst AQI since March||With reduced rain activity and an increase in human-induced emission, the city recorded its worst air quality since before the Covid-19 lockdown on Friday while also recording the hottest day this season so far.The pollutant-measuring indicator — air quality index (AQI) — was recorded at 118 (moderate) for PM2.5 pollutant (small pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments). A thin layer of smog was witnessed across the city’s skyline, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). On March 19, it was 130 (moderate), which means this was the first time since March 19 that Mumbai’s AQI breached the ‘moderate’ (101-200) category. On March 17 the AQI was 272 (poor) and on March 18 it was recorded at 172 (moderate).The maximum temperature on Friday was 35 degrees Celsius at the Santacruz weather observatory and 34.6 degrees Celsius at Colaba, both 2.3 degree Celsius above normal.On Friday, the concentration for PM10 (larger coarser particles) was 115 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³), against the safe limit of 100 μg/m³ for 24 hours. PM2.5 levels were 65 μg/m³ against the safe limit of 60 μg/m³ for the 24-hour mark.Researchers said the rise in pollution levels was associated with the retreating southwest monsoon season. “This was expected as when conditions become favourable for monsoon withdrawal, there is a sharp drop in wind speed and rise in temperatures, especially for a coastal city like Mumbai. This allows pollutant particles to get suspended close to the surface and form a layer of haze,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Also read: Covid-19 cases spike again in Kerala, experts say infection may peak by October endFriday’s AQI, however, was an average from nine locations rather than 10 because the AQ monitoring station at Bandra Kurla Complex is under maintenance, said Beig. The highest pollution level was recorded at Navi Mumbai at 186 (moderate) followed by Andheri at 156 (moderate), Malad at 152 (moderate), Chembur at 149 (moderate), Worli at 128 (moderate). The remaining areas recorded ‘satisfactory’ AQI levels.SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. An AQI of 97 (satisfactory) has been predicted for Monday. An AQI of 104 (satisfactory) has been predicted for Saturday. “Pollution levels are likely to be in the moderate category for at least two to three days. However, with a low-pressure weather system over the Bay of Bengal, the possibility of rain even around the Mumbai region could allow a marginal rise in wind speed,” said Beig.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a ‘yellow alert’ for the next five days for Thane and all other districts in south Konkan. However, only light rain has been predicted for the city and suburbs over the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharp-spike-in-mumbai-s-air-pollution-worst-aqi-since-march/story-qhRaFdmIennJrMbSMyoglK.html

A special cell should also be set up to sort out their grievances on priority and they should be informed immediately about any suspicious activity on their bank or online accounts. A 24-hour special help desk must also be set up to assist them at banks and government offices. They should also be given special emergency police numbers.Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliRWAs should play key roleRWAs need to be involved more in drawing up plans to help elderly persons in their areas and ensure their neighbours and acquaintances keep an eye on them to ensure they don’t fall victims to crimes.Madan LallyPolice meetings with seniors a must Police need to be sensitive to the needs of the elderly and help them live with dignity in their twilight age. For this, details of senior citizens in the sectors have to be collected and regular meetings with the police and senior citizens organised. Names of officers and numbers of police stations should also be given to seniors living on their own.SK Khosla, ChandigarhYour safety is your responsibilitySenior citizens should be very careful while handling their finances and understand that the desire to make a quick buck through doubtful schemes and promises has to be controlled. Though many seniors live on their own, they should guard against seeking assistance from strangers in operating bank accounts, especially if it involves cash deposit or digital transaction. Physical exploitation of the elderly by their children or domestic help also should be nipped in the bud. Aged parents must not part with their finances and properties during their lifetime. Drawing up a will is a smart move.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaBanks should helpToll free phone numbers can be provided to assist elderly citizens for online banking transactions as they are not very tech savvy, which is why they fall prey to cyber crimes. RWAs can ask volunteers to help the elderly with electricity bill payment, grocery supplies and medicines. Also neighbours or police should keep an eye on domestic helpers as they tend to exploit elderly who live alone. Vanjula Kaushik, Mohali Easy with the cashMore CCTV cameras should be set up in the city in a concerted effort to stop thefts. Other than that people above 60 should ensure they are not out and about on their own and avoid deserted or poorly lit areas after dark. They should have their keys ready before reaching the main entry door when they come back home from an outing. Pepper sprays should be kept handy too and when out shopping the elderly should make sure their wallets and purses are kept concealed and that they do not take out large wads of cash. Locking doors immediately when getting into the cars should be a priority.Ishita NaraSet up special police cadre Police need to be sensitised and trained in taking care of seniors. Creating a special cadre for dealing with the elderly can pay great dividends. It is also very important for policemen to understand how crimes are committed using technology and how these can be detected and dealt with. The roles of Chandigarh administration and Chandigarh civic society are also very significant. There is a need for establishing “day care homes” for old people in every sector . For this a part of the existing community centres can be used for their entertainment and medical care. The emphasis should be on encouraging their creativity so that they don’t degenerate into a state of dementia. Volunteer groups of young people can be set up in all sectors.Lt Col GS Bedi (retd)Precautions mustThe elderly people should be first taught not to open doors to people they do not know. Chat cameras should be installed at the main gates to enable them to see who is visiting. With this, pictures will be available for incoming/outgoing visitors. Children should stay in regular touch with their old parents.Arun Goyal, Chandigarh More surveysThe administration should conduct surveys with NGOs to find out how many elderly citizens live in the city and get more information on their needs. A new helpline number should be started for their help.

The complex, spread in around 2.2 acres of land, is one of the prime properties of LIT. It was constructed nearly 13 years back at around ₹16 crores. LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said, “The report has not yet been compiled but the LIT has roughly earned ₹50 crores by auctioning 35 properties. The amount will be used for development works.”Speaking of the complex at Rani Jhansi road, the chairman said that the matter would now be discussed with the state government to take the final call on whether to reduce its reserve price even further or sell it in parts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-takers-for-lit-commercial-complex/story-wHhfS1DzsijPnHRerFvnRM.html

They further alleged that the fee of the membership form had also been increased to Rs 1,000, which was earlier free of cost.The matter had come to light when an industrialist went to the UCPMA office to get a membership.JNSSMA president Jaswinder Singh Thukral said, “This way the small manufacturers, who actually require the services of the association, would not be able to become members and the control of the association will ultimately shift to the big manufacturers.”When contacted, UCPMA president DS Chawla, however, said, “The decision to increase the fee was rolled back on October 6 after the association had received a representation from the members who believed that small manufacturers would not be able to pay Rs 11,800. Only Rs 5,000 is charged as the membership fee from new members now and Rs 1,000 for the form. The decision has been taken by all the office bearers and not by an individual.”The official letter of the association stated that the membership fee has been reduced to Rs 5,000 due to COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-row-erupts-over-ucpma-membership-fee/story-grjz7EyoiJ7GAoCC0NJjPN.html

09-10-2020||Noida||UPPCB recommends ₹50,000 fine on RRTS casting yard in Vasundhara for dust pollution||The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) on Friday said that they have recommended a penalty of ₹50,000 against the dusty conditions allegedly found at the Vasundhara casting yard site of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project. The officials said that they have also recommended other measures to be taken up at the site in order to abate air pollution. The casting yard of the RRTS project, being developed by NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) but being developed by a contractor, is located close to residential area on either side. The UPPCB officials said that they visited the site two days ago and found that dust control norms were violated. “During the visit we found that the vehicles were lined up on the road outside the casting yard and leading to emission of dust during the movement. We asked NCRTC to increase the height of the boundary wall from existing six metres to 10 metres, as per the guidelines of the environment ministry guidelines of January, 2018. We recommended a penalty of ₹50000 against contractor and sent our recommendation to the district administration,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. The sites of RRTS project and the Delhi Meerut Expressway are under scanner in order to keep down the levels of dust emissions which could lead to increase in air pollution this approaching winter season. “It is due to the impact of the projects that our monitoring station at Vasundhara and Indirapuram are recording high pollution levels. As regards to the construction sites, having areas 20,000 square metres and above, we have asked them to conduct a self-audit of the sites and also install CCTV cameras that will be monitored by us. The process is to be completed by October 10,” Sharma, said. He said that in case the process is not completed by October 10, the board will initiate action and a daily penalty will be levied based on pollution index. The officials have identified 35 such sites in Ghaziabad.“In extreme cases, the project may also be stopped on the basis of scale of violation,” he added. The board had alread directed to about 70-80 industrial units in Ghaziabad that used wood and coal as fuel, to install CCTV cameras at their premises facing chimneys for monitoring.NCRTC said that they are unaware of the fine. “Our officials had no information about the penalty or any violation that the UPPCB officials have spoken about. On our part, we are taking every precaution to control the air pollution at the site to minimize the impact of construction dust on nearby areas,” a spokesperson from NCRTC, said. “We have water sprinklers and wheels of the vehicles are being washed every time they move out of the casting yards. Anti-smog guns have been deployed to spray nebulised water which helps in settling down the dust particles.” UPPCB officials, however, once again confirmed to HT that they had recommended the penalty. They said that imposing fines for dust emissions require magisterial powers, for which they had sent their recommendation to the executive magistrate of the district administration.The civil construction works over a stretch of about 50km is presently underway for the RRTS project in Ghaziabad. This involves 17km of the priority stretch from Sahibabad to Duhai and another 33km from Duhai to Shatabdipuram in Meerut. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Friday evening said that he has asked the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the NCRTC to repair any service lanes that may have suffered damages due to the ongoing projects of Delhi Meerut Expressway and RRTS project. “I have directed that committees of officials including locals to be formed at the local level to ensure that the works, if any, are completed in time. A review of pollution abatement measures will also be taken up. Otherwise, the issues lead to resentment among farmers and local population. It is our intent that the works for the two projects get complete in time without any hindrance,” Pandey, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/uppcb-recommends-50-000-fine-on-rrts-casting-yard-in-vasundhara-for-dust-pollution/story-MsWkqOIEa0BXgNNHOr7mdK.html

Shaleen Mathur, a resident of Cleo County, received injuries to his neck, chest and back in the incident that took place on Wednesday afternoon, the police said. An FIR in the case was registered on Thursday. Mathur said he usually receives a power bill for about 550 units per month. “Last month we received a bill for 1,177 units. This was surprising as we had relatively less power consumption in September,” he said.Mathur, an electronics engineer, said that he had sent an email to the maintenance department seeking a correction in the inflated bill. “I did not receive any response from the maintenance department of the society. On Wednesday afternoon, I went there to discuss the issue. But the security in-charge, Arvind Kumar, the project in-charge, Salekh Chand, and one Vinod Das called about 20-30 security personnel who thrashed me and ousted me from the office,” he alleged. Mathur also alleged that his clothes were ripped apart during the incident. “Some society residents reached the spot and rescued me,” he said. The maintenance office is on the society campus.According to Mathur, a number of residents had gathered and protested against the incident. He filed a complaint against the maintenance department and security guards at Phase 3 police station.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said a case has been registered against three named persons and 20 to 30 security guards under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. “Police have arrested five security guards involved in the incident. We will also recommend licence cancellation of the security agency,” Chander said.Arvind Kumar, security head at the society, claimed that Mathur had first manhandled the maintenance officials which led to the incident.A spokesperson for ABA Corp, the developer of Cleo County, said that the company has terminated the services of Chand and Arvind. “We have also given instructions to facility management and security agency to identify all the staff members involved in the incident and terminate their services with immediate effect,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Mathur also alleged that a few days ago a maintenance department staffer had visited him to offer a deal. “He had asked me to pay ₹2,000 monthly and he would tamper the power meter and fix the bill. To check this, I asked him to fix it for five days. He had fixed my meter and there was no increase in power units for five days,” he said. Mathur said that this is when he suspected he was getting inflated bills on behalf of other residents due to tampering in their meters.However, Deepak Arora, assistant property manager, Cleo County, denied the allegation. “We have digital meters, which are tamperproof,” he said.The society has 2,600 flats in 22 towers, out of them 1,500 flats are occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/resident-of-high-rise-thrashed-by-security-guards-over-power-bill-five-arrested/story-EGl2BNaxzPtzJpwnhSmMvN.html

On the basis of a complaint given by the family, the police said they have registered an FIR under Indian Penal Code Section 302 (murder) at Sihani Gate police station.The incident took place in C-block of the prime locality of Lohiya Nagar, which also has residences of judicial officers. The incident took place near the house of KC Tyagi, a former MP and Janata Dal (United) leader. The incident took place around 5.30am, when victim Naresh Tyagi was on his way to a nearby park for a morning walk.The victim is the maternal uncle of BJP MLA Ajit Pal Tyagi, who rushed to the spot after receiving information. “I, along with my cousin and father, had gone out for a morning walk. Me and my cousin were talking and were walking some distance behind my father. Suddenly, a two-wheeler passed by, the pillion rider fired shots and my father fell down near the park. The man driving the vehicle told his accomplice to fire shots on the head and finish him off,” the victim’s son, Abhishek Tyagi, alleged in his police complaint. “Upon this, the man fired shots to his head. We watched the incident in shock and raised an alarm. By then, the two men had fled the spot. I took my father to Yashoda Hospital but doctors declared him dead,” he added.

09-10-2020||Noida||App to improve waste handling in Noida||NOIDA: The Noida authority has developed a mobile application that will assist its health department to monitor the door-to-door waste collection work in the city. The move is aimed at ensuring the waste is collected from each household properly and bringing in more transparency in the system, officials said. According to the officials, the application will help keep a tab on the work of the agency engaged in the waste collection in the city. The authority aims to improve the waste handling as it wants to score better in the Swachh Survekshan than this year when Noida was adjudged the 25th cleanest city with a population between one and 10 lakh in the country.“Our motive is to collect waste daily from each house. And the mobile application will enable us to understand the gaps if there is any. The application will help us in improving the system for better results,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority. A private agency hired by the authority collects the waste from at least 165 sectors and 65 villages from across the city. The agency also transports the waste to the landfill site in Sector 145 for remediation. Residents in some areas keep complaining to the authority’s health department that the waste collection needs improvement. “If any resident complains that garbage is not being collected from a particular location, then we can check with the help of application. It means how and when the work was done will be verified via application immediately, and the issue will be resolved,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority. Each person involved in the waste collection will use this application, and it will be monitored from a control room set up in Sector 58, the officials said, adding that once the garbage is picked up from a particular location, the site will turn green from red immediately.“The application will also show the time, when the garbage is picked up from a location or house,” said Mishra.As per official data, Noida produces 900 metric tonne of waste daily. In 2018, the Noida authority started collecting waste from door to door with the help of 250 vehicles and 21 compact machines that crushes the waste to transport it easily.Residential bodies said that residents should be allowed to give feedback through the new app. “The Noida authority should make some changes in the mobile application and modify it so that residents can also download it to give feedback or file a complaint about garbage issue,” said NP Singh, president of Gautam Budh Nagar District Development Residents’ Welfare Association (DDRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/app-to-improve-waste-handling-in-noida/story-W3DtyVTHNqSOEpDsYCfQSI.html

Installation of CCTV cameras at the venue is recommended to keep watch on visitors whether they are adhering to protocols or not,” read the order by UP chief secretary R K Tiwari.The SOPs have also advised that the event venues should also have details of a nearby hospital and that all payments should ideally be “contact less”.“The idols (in case of Durga Puja celebrations) should be small and to be placed in the open. No idols or Tazias should be placed on roads or crossings. Small vehicles and minimum number of persons should be present for the idol immersion event. For this, entire plan should be prepared in advance. If any rally or immersion involves long distance, an ambulance should accompany,” the order read.The orders gave clarity to organisers across the state. Most said that they had, in any case, planned a curtailed event during the festivities. “We will be adhering to the SOPs and ensure that all health protocols are followed. We have planned to hire a farmhouse where only our members will be allowed. The Durga idol is small in size this time and only limited number of people will go for immersion. Food items will be sent to homes of our members and cultural programs will be telecast online. The Durga Puja celebrations will be a low-key affair this time due to the pandemic,” said Abhijit Roy, founder member of Prantic Cultural Society, Indirapuram.The members of the Shri Dharmik Ralila Samiti in Kavi Nagar said that the events will not be held this time due to the pandemic.“We approached artistes for preparing three hours or Ramlila which could be staged at an auditorium but they were not ready. Now, we have planned that we will hold recitation of Ramcharitramanas or Sunderkand for two days before Dussehra. Thereafter, on the day of Dussehra we have planned to prepare 5 to 7 feet effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnad which will be lit in presence of members. So, this time there will be only small symbolic event,” said Lalit Jaiswal, president of the Samiti.For Dussehra and Ramlila events, the chief secretary has limited the number of persons up to 50% of the capacity of the closed venue/hall, subject to maximum of 200 persons. For open spaces, the number of those attending will be defined locally subject to wearing of masks, hand washing facilities, sanitation, thermal scanning and social distancing norms.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said: “We have distributed the SOP guidelines to our officers and different meetings will be held soon at tehsil level with different associations to tell them about the guidelines to be followed. Anyways, the events which are forthcoming will be curtailed to extent as lot of precautions are needed to prevent any spread of infection.” Box: list of guidelines in SOP Site plan for the venue is to be chalked out and prior permission from respective district authorities is needed Mandatory isolation room should be identified at the venue in order to isolate any person having Covid-like symptoms A nearby hospital should be mapped to the venue in order to get healthcare facilities ACs at the venue should be run between 24-30 degrees temperature and humidity levels should be in range of 40-70% with proper ventilation CCTVs may be installed at the venue to monitor adherence to health protocols No events would be allowed in containment zones The idols should be smaller in size and should be placed in open space Immersion activities should have minimum number of people and only small sized vehicle should be used Persons allowed in closed hall should not exceed 50% of the capacity subject to maximum of 200 persons||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-issues-sops-for-upcoming-festivals-season-events-to-be-curtailed/story-KLIDrHtcCVi441PIakLVHO.html

The shopkeepers wrote a letter to the CM Captain Amarinder Singh urging him to direct the MC to roll back the CLU notices otherwise, they would be forced to raise an agitation against the civic body and the government.The shopkeepers rued that the CLU charges do not apply to shops that were established decades back and are supposed to be collected before the establishment of shops.Happy Banzer, president of the Ghumar Mandi malls and shopkeepers’ welfare society, said,” Most of the shops had been established even before the CLU norms came into existence. The MC is harassing the shopkeepers and, we will not let them claim the CLU charges. We have written to the CM seeking his intervention.”Earlier, the shopkeepers and Gurpreet Gogi, area councillor-cum-chairman of Punjab State Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC), had conducted a meeting with mayor Balkar Sandhu in mid of September and had opposed the move. The shopkeepers had also staged a protest in the market on Wednesday and, Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal had decided to move the court against the civic body in this regard. As per MC officials, around 2,300 notices have been served to shopkeepers across the city. Many have already submitted the fee.MC joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh said that the notices had been served after discussing the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu and senior officials. The shopkeepers have also been given an option to pay the charges in instalments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-shopkeepers-urge-cm-to-intervene-over-serving-of-clu-notices-by-mc/story-iQtJ2DFZHNPwAv1Edm4jqM.html

They said that the recommendations of the committee are anti-contractual workers, farmers, small traders, and labourers, and, favour corporate houses.As per the teachers, the members of the committee proposed that there was a need to reduce the number of posts in all government departments and said that there might even be a need to cut down the salaries of the employees.President Hardev Singh said, “During these tough times of Covid-19 pandemic, employees need protection but instead of getting any relief, they are living in fear. The recommendations, which include a change in the pay pattern of the state government employees on the lines of the Central government pay pattern, pay cuts, increase in the development tax, among many others, will not be tolerated at all.”To support the DTF, members of ‘5178’ and ‘6060’ unions also joined the march.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-post-covid-revival-strategy-ludhiana-dtf-protests-against-committee-for-proposing-reduction-in-posts-salaries/story-aQlOvheqD0XHNwxd87KhxM.html

However, the final decision has been left on state governments, to decide when to reopen these. With no confirmation about the dates, school students, as well as their parents, have been undergoing a lot of stress. On World Mental Health Day, October 10, we speak to students to know about their state of mind, and ask experts how can they stay calm. Ojasv Goyal, a Delhi-based class 12 student, says, “Though I’ve been taking online classes that are conducted regularly, but I feel tire at the end of day my parents observe me 24X7. And they keep on pin pointing me to sit straight, pay attention to what the teacher is saying, and all other stuff. I can understand their concern but it’s too much sometimes. I miss that freedom I had in school. My teachers are way more cooler that my parents! It’s really stressful to match their expectations, take tuitions and classes online, and be at peace. I couldn’t even clear competitive exams with flying colours, and feel stressed about my future!” Some are trying to participate in other activities to distract themselves. “I’m in class 12, and wanted to enjoy the last year of my school to its fullest. Everyone says school life is the best, but I’ve missed the most crucial year of this phase of my student life due to the pandemic. There is so much uncertainty right now, and I’m clueless about my future and career prospects. I’ve been talking to a lot of consultants, but there is no one who could give me a satisfactory answer. In such a scenario, stress is bound to takeover, and I’m also trying to distract myself but it hardly works,” says Mridula Sharma, another Delhi-based school student. Experts feel that among the many reasons, constant scrutiny by parents, teachers and inquisitive relatives as well as comparisons is one of the causes that leads to stress among youngsters. “Critics have time and again pointed out that our education system tends to judge widely different students on single line parameters, which is unfair. Some students tend to experience episodes of stress, anxiety and sleeplessness and even nervous breakdowns. This condition is compounded by constant scrutiny, and comparisons with peers,” says Prakriti Poddar, a mental health expert , adding, “It’s also important for parents to not impose the burden of unreasonable expectations on their children. This stress response raises our heart rate and breathing and increases muscle tension, among other things. It’s important, therefore, to learn healthy ways to respond to this elevated stress. Several decades back, Dr Herbert Benson, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School advocated a phenomenon called a relaxation response to counter the stress response in the body. Breathing exercises, mindfulness and meditation are a few techniques that can help invoke a relaxation response from the students dealing with stress.” According to psychologist Dr Roma Kumar, school and college students need to acknowledge and process their feelings of emotional distress and express them. She says, “Use whatever technology you have available to virtually meet up with your extended family and friends, but at the same time put a limit on how long you will spend on social media every day. Use your psychological defence like humour, which will protect you from emotional overload and will enhance your well-being. Practice good sleep hygiene. You can schedule relaxing activities such as doing puzzles, eating your favourite food, spending time with nature, listening music, exercise, playing with your pet, dancing and any activity that will distribute your physical and mental energy toward self-care and things that are under your control. When you shift your energies from exasperation to rationalisation, it will help you maintain your connection with what’s happening, positivity, and will also reduce the emotional burden.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/world-mental-health-day-students-share-need-to-de-stress-experts-suggest-ways/story-iwp3Gbn2h7FRSm7sx3rFaN.html

It directed the chief secretary, two divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to provide all details to the CBI. The court further directed the CBI to file status report every eight weeks.On September 23, the division bench had reserved its order for a CBI probe.During the course of the hearing, advocate Sharma said that given the structural problems and political interference crippling the anti corruption bureau, both of which are reflected in its conduct of the last six years of investigation, its time to bring in an independent agency like CBI for investigation.He also brought to the notice of the court CAG of 2014 towards encroachment of 20 lakh kanal state land at an estimated loss of Rs 25,000 crore to the state exchequer by criminal and wrongful implementation of the Roshni Act. He emphasised that given its nature and quantum, Roshni scam is unprecedented in the history of J&K. He further submitted that only the HC should monitor the CBI investigation and bring the culprits to book as nothing has been achieved since 2013.“Accordingly, the court ordered a CBI probe. It also held all Roshni allotments as void ab initio, and declared the Roshni Act as unconstitutional,” Sharma told HT.The HC has also made the chief secretary accountable for uninterrupted investigations. “Investigation have also been ordered against officers in whose time period the encroachments happened. DCs and divisional commissioners will be held guilty of contempt in case they do not cooperate in the probe,” he added.Earlier, the anti-corruption bureau of Jammu (vigilance) was investigating the matter and had registered 17 FIRs so far. “Given the manner in which the bureau was handling the case, the court deemed it appropriate to divest it off the investigation and hand it over to the CBI,” he said. The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, popularly known as the Roshni Act, was implemented in 2001 by the then chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Ghulam Nabi Azad. It was aimed at “conferring 20.55 lakh kanal of state land to the occupants”.The Act sought to generate resources for hydroelectric power projects and to confer proprietary rights to occupants of state-owned land subject to payment of land cost fixed by the government.However, the Act was later found to be an attempt to change the demography of the entire region and the then J&K governor Satya Pal Malik scrapped it in November 2018. The Act was repealed as “it failed to realise the desired objectives and there were also reports of misuse of some its provisions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-high-court-orders-cbi-probe-in-rs-25-000-cr-roshni-land-scam/story-SgPeBAXVCf1JrLSBQjwB5K.html

09-10-2020||City||Himachal BJP slams Congress over anti-farm bill stance||Hitting out at the Congress against its anti-agricultural bill chorus, BJP state president and Shimla MP Suresh Kashyap on Friday said the former was trying to mislead the farmers and public for gaining political leverage.Addressing a press conference at the BJP’s state headquarters here, Kashyap said the Congress is only protesting for middlemen and is lying that MSP will be eliminated, APMC mandis will be removed and farmers will become weak due to negotiation issues with the corporates and will not be able to decide the price. The two agricultural laws passed by the central government will double the income of farmers by 2022 and both these laws will prove to be very important for them, he said. Congress had itself mentioned these laws in its election manifesto and now is retreating from the same promises, the BJP state chief said.Kashyap said with these laws, farmers dream of one nation one market is being fulfilled. The bill will provide opportunities and arrangements for farmers to sell their produce uninterrupted in most of the notified mandis, within and outside the state.It is clear that the MSP and mandi system has not been abolished. Now, the farmer can earn more profit by selling his crop wherever he wants, the way Congress is talking about Ambani and Adani is concocted, with this law, farmers will have access to state-of-the-art agricultural technology, equipment and improved compost seeds,” he added.This bill guarantees payment to the farmer in three days, while such a law could never find its way during the Congress rule or was implemented, he said.“Congress is only lying about agricultural laws for its political interests. It is a lie that the MSP and mandi system will be ended. Congress is saying that farmers will become weak in contractual agriculture agreement and fixing prices. Today, the farmer knows which law is in his hands and what kind of politics the Congress is doing,” Kashyap held.He said Congress is also making baseless statements and allegations against the state and central governments over Covid-19 management when everyone knows an exceptional job is being done in dealing with the pandemic.Kashyap also described October 3 as historic, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Atal Tunnel. He said the total length of this channel is 9.02km and is made of state-of-the-art equipment, has CCTV cameras, fire hydrant, telephone facility at every 200 metres and an emergency exit after every 500 metres. He said earlier people of the tribal areas had to be taken to the hospital by helicopter in case of serious illness, but that too depended on the weather, but the tunnel will solve this problem.He said Congress is also politicising the Atal Tunnel whereas the maximum credit for its construction goes to the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-bjp-slams-congress-over-anti-farm-bill-stance/story-Sd9IObAJjWsL7judZCNTxH.html

He attacked the Congress government over the death of a priest in the western state’s Karauli and rising crimes against women in the state.Rathore, the former Union minister and BJP MP from Jaipur, asserted that citizens in Rajasthan are not safe. “Nobody is safe in Rajasthan today - neither women nor children, not even priests. A government which stays at a five-star hotel for months can protect only itself, it can’t protect the public. Rajasthan is getting a bad name,” he said, according to news agency ANI.“As per the data of the National Crime Records Bureau, Rajasthan stands at the first position as far as crimes against women are concerned. I urge Rahul Gandhi, who indulges in political tourism to BJP-ruled states, to pay attention to Rajasthan,” the BJP leader said while speaking in reference to the priest’s murder in Karauli.Babulal Vaishnav was set on fire on Wednesday by five people who wanted to encroach lands which were part of the temple. The 50-year-old temple priest died in a Jaipur hospital on Thursday evening. The police have arrested two people in connection with the case.The Ashok Gehlot-led government was also criticised by another BJP leader Vasundhara Raje, who said that women, children and Dalits are not safe in Rajasthan. “The Congress government of the state should now wake from slumber and should get the family justice by getting strict punishment to the culprits,” the former chief minister said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/pay-attention-to-rajasthan-rajyavardhan-singh-rathore-slams-rahul-gandhi-over-priest-s-murder/story-Af97hIvKLqNegPxSU1lQbN.html

I have received a positive feedback. There is no problem getting gate passes at the mandis now and everything is going on smoothly,” he said.Goel’s protest had attracted sharp criticism from chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who had said that it was wrong on the MLAs part to blame the ACS and that the officers work as per government directions. However, Goel said, “For the CM, we both (Das and Goel) are part of the government and this is his point of view. It think an official, who is signing and monitoring such work, has to be held accountable if something goes wrong.”A day before the protest, Goel had chaired a meeting of the committee on public undertakings with senior officials and four MLAs in Ambala, to monitor paddy procurement in the state. Goel is the chairperson of this committee.On Friday, divisional commissioner Dipti Umashankar and deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma inspected the New Grain Market in Ambala Cantonment and grain markets in Barara and Saha of the district to take stock of paddy purchase and lifting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-not-stage-protest-as-paddy-procurement-has-improved-ambala-bjp-mla/story-gxirAUWAUzdGGWAYwwqKJI.html
09-10-2020||Election:||‘From chappal to chapatti roller’: Bihar polls and surprising party symbols||Don’t be surprised if you find images of chappal (slippers), chapatti roller, pestle and mortar on the electronic voting machines (EVMs) during the three-phase Assembly elections in Bihar on October 28, November 3 and November 7. These are among 199 symbols the Election Commission of India (ECI) has added to its list of free symbols or common symbols since June 2018. Voters in Bihar will see some of them for the first time on the EVMs during the polls this time. The Aam Janta Party Rashtriya, a registered unrecognised political party, has been allotted ‘chappals’ as its symbol. Similarly, the Aam Adhikar Morcha, another unrecognised political party, has been allotted ‘chapatti roller’ as its symbol. Also read: AAP to not contest Bihar polls, cites flood, Covid-19 situationOther such parties, like the Hindu Samaj Party, has been allotted ‘pestle and mortar’ while the symbol of ‘baby walker’ has gone to the Rashtriya Jan Vikas Party and ‘balloon’ to the Hindustan Sampoorna Azad Party.Similarly, ‘binoculars’ is the symbol for the Republican Party of India (Rashtriya); ‘bat’ has been allotted to the Rashtriya Jan Jan Party; ‘road roller’ to the Bharatiya Lok Nayak Party; ‘carrom board’ to the Loktantrik Jan Swaraj Party; ‘trumpet’ to Bharatiya Sablog Pary, among others. ‘Hand cart’, allotted to the Mazdoor Ekta Party, is from the list of new symbols added in 2019, said a poll officials requesting anonymity. The Election Commission has offered ‘biscuit’ as the election symbol to the Shiv Sena, which has ‘bow and arrow’ as its symbol for Maharashtra. The party will contest 50 assembly seats in Bihar. This has been done to avoid confusion among voters because Janata Dal (United) has ‘arrow’ as its election symbol in Bihar. Former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav’s Jan Adhikar Party Loktantrik has been issued ‘scissors’ as its party symbol this time. Earlier, it had ‘hockey stick and ball’ in 2015 assembly polls. All registered parties contesting elections need to choose a symbol from a list of available symbols offered by the EC. The total number of parties registered with the ECI was 2,598, with eight national parties, 52 state parties and 2,538 unrecognised parties. While 162 symbols were added to the list of free symbols on June 20, 2018, another 37 were added during the last revision on March 9, 2019. A recognised party enjoys privileges like a reserved party symbol, free broadcast time on state-run television and radio, a consultation in setting of election dates and giving input in setting electoral rules and regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/from-chappal-to-chapatti-roller-bihar-polls-and-surprising-party-symbols/story-UMeLFN2neZAMlmKzHeRfDM.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai cops take first step in probe against Arnab Goswami’s Republic TV||The Mumbai Police has summoned the chief financial officer (CFO) of Republic TV, Shiva Sundaram, the founder, chairman and managing director of Madison World, Sam Balsara, and the CEO of IPG Mediabrands, Shashi Sinha, to record their statements in connection with the TRP-fixing racket they claim to have busted. “They have been called to record their statement under section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code,” said joint commissioner of police (Crime), Milind Bharambe. Calls and text messages to Shiva Sundaram of Republic TV remained unanswered. Sinha and Balsara, both top media planners and buyers, have likely been called as experts. “Mumbai Police has called me to be present at their office. I have no idea regarding what they have called me or what they will ask me. So, I cannot say anything as of now. I will go and meet them tomorrow,” said Sinha. Sam Balsara said: “I am a client of BARC. Mumbai police has requested my help to aid the investigation which I am happy to do.”Also Read: Will sue police chief, says Arnab Goswami on probe naming Republic TV in TRP fraudBARC stands for Broadcast Audience Research Council. On Thursday, Mumbai Police said it arrested a former executive for Hansa Research, contracted by BARC to run its audience measurement service by installing barometers in households across the city. They also arrested three others, including two owners of small local channels. In a press conference on Thursday, Mumbai Police named Republic TV, which denied the charges and said it would sue the police. Republic also showed on its channel a copy of the FIR that names not it but India Today TV. Republic TV said it was being targeted for its pursuit of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. The four arrested , Vishal Bhandari, Bompalli Rao Mistry alias Sanjiv Rao, 44, and owners of Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema channels Shirish Shetty and Narayan Sharma were produced before the court on Friday, and remanded to police custody till October 13. Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh said there was no evidence against India Today. “Hansa Research Private Limited conducted an internal inquiry of arrested accused Vishal Bhandari, after they received a complaint stating that he was paying several households to tune into certain channels. India Today’s name came during their internal enquiry based on which an FIR was filed at Kandivali police station on October 6. We took Bhandari’s custody and have recorded the statements of witnesses and we have not found any evidence to substantiate the claim that India Today was involved in manipulating TRPs,” said Singh. TRPs or television rating points are a reflection of how many people watch a channel and is used by media buyers and planners to decide which channels they will advertise in. Bhandari has named only three channels Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Republic Bharat TV till now, said a crime branch officer who asked not to be named. According to Hansa Research , approximately 30,000 barometers are installed across India to monitor various channels and programmes based on which BARC awards ratings to channels. Of the 30,000, 2,000 barometers are installed in Mumbai . Nitin Deokar, deputy general manager of Hansa Research Private Limited who filed the complaint at Kandivali police station, said in it that Bhandari was working as a relationship manager with the firm from November 2019 to May 2020. These relationship managers were tasked with overseeing a certain number of households with barometers. Deokar in his complaint stated that during an internal inquiry they found that Bhandari used to pay households to watch India Today. “But during inquiry, we did not find any evidence. And when we visited the residence of Tajal Solanki in Kandivali area where a barometer was installed, we found that India Today was not subscribed at all. During the inquiry, Solanki and a senior citizen in her residence told us that they were asked to watch Republic TV,” added the crime branch officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-cops-take-first-step-in-probe-against-arnab-goswami-s-republic-tv/story-4XBcsgIvsPsCYEXWPlbnnJ.html
09-10-2020||City||BJP takes out tractor rallies in Haryana to support farm bills||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday took out tractor rallies in various parts of Haryana, including Sonepat’s Gohana, Bhiwani and Hisar’s Hansi, to support the Centre’s farm legislations that have triggered widespread protests across the country.Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar led the tractor rally at Gohana, Hisar MP Brijendra Singh at Hansi and Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh at Bhiwani.Dhankar said the Congress and its entire top brass is misleading farmers. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had clarified that the farmers’ produce will be procured at the minimum support price (MSP) and the mandi system is not going to end. Our leaders are exposing the Congress’s lies by visiting villages to apprise farmers about these laws,” he said.He added that the government has streamlined the process of procuring farmers’ goods on the MSP at mandis. “The Congress is telling lies that we are aiming to scrap the mandi system. Why did Rahul Gandhi not bring his brother-in-law Robert Vadra during his tractor rally in Haryana. Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who claims to be farmers’ well wisher had sold farmers’ land at minimal rates to Vadra. During Hooda’s regime, farmers had been struggling to get fertilisers,” Dhankar said.Agriculture minister JP Dalal said his party has geared up for the November 3 Baroda bypoll and people have made up their mind to elect the saffron party candidate. “The farmers are very happy that they got two options to sell their produce. Shouldn’t farmers have the right to get better options to sell their crop. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi is speaking China’s language,” he said.Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh said the Union government has shown its intent by announcing the minimum support price of 23 Rabi crops. “After the implementation of these laws, the lives of farmers will change. These laws will be beneficial in increasing their income,” he added.Police detained a few people for showing black flags to BJP leaders during the rally at Hisar’s Hansi. Farmers claiming that these laws are ‘death warrants’ have been protesting at Bhuman Shah chowk in Sirsa. They are seeking resignation of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and jails and power minister Ranjit Singh from the Manohar Lal Khattar government. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders and supporters violated the Covid-19 guidelines by gathering large number of people during their tractor rallies in Gohana, Hansi and Bhiwani. The administration remained mute spectators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-takes-out-tractor-rallies-in-haryana-to-support-farm-bills/story-gpI0qmfu8S7D8coIO8NlPJ.html

The eighth accused Milind Teltumbde, secretary of Maharashtra State Committee of the CPI (Maoist), is said to be on the run.NIA has said it has reliable oral, documentary and material evidence that establishes the role of Navlakha, Anand Teltumbde, Hany Babu and others in the conspiracy to spread the activities of Maoists. The charge sheet against the eight activists runs into 10,000 pages.After filing the charge sheet, special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty said, “A supplementary charge sheet has been submitted against eight accused. The registry will scrutinise it first and later further process will take place.”NIA took over the probe from Maharashtra Police in January.

NIA has alleged Teltumbde was the convenor of the programme and his call data records show he was in touch with the other arrested accused present at the event.The agency also claimed that Navlakha, along with other activists, is accused of having links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad gathering.Navlakha was first arrested by the Pune Police on August 28, 2018, but the Delhi high court had quashed his arrest on October 1, 2018. The prosecution had alleged that till August 2018 he was a member of CPI (Maoist).While arresting Navlakha, Pune Police cited several letters recovered from the computer of one of the accused exchanged between them. It was alleged that Navlakha and some of the other activists (who have also been arrested in the case), had direct access to and communicated with central committee members and senior leaders of CPI (Maoist). Pune Police also alleged that Navlakha was part of the conspiracy and they were probing to check if there was a larger conspiracy of seizing political power via an armed revolution by mobilising the masses.Navlakha surrendered before NIA on April 14 as no court granted him protection from the arrest.After the arrest of Teltumbde and Navlakha, NIA made its first formal arrest—an associate professor in the Department of English with Delhi University—on July 28.The agency claimed that Hany Babu had links with Communist Party of India (Maoist) and was one of the key conspirators. The prosecution also pointed out that there were letters exchanged between the accused which were recovered by Pune Police. The investigating agency found mention of his name and role in those letters. The agency also claimed that Babu was actively involved in raising funds to help Maoists, for their release from prison.Two months later, the agency arrested three members of Kabir Kala munch—Jyoti Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor. Gorkhe and Gaichor were arrested on September 7 while Jagtap was arrested a day later. The agency, in a statement released after their arrest, claimed, “The three were propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology and were co-conspirators with other arrested accused. It has also a matter of record that the arrested accused persons were in contact with absconding accused Milind Teltumbde about the urban network of CPI (Maoist). Also it is established that during their (Kabir Kala Manch members) visits to the jungle, they underwent weapons and explosive training and awareness programmes on various topics related to Maoist movement.”The latest arrest by the agency was that of Father Stan Swamy. Father Swamy, an 83-year-old activist suffering from Parkinsons was arrested from his residence in Ranchi. The officials claimed that “he is a member of CPI (Maoist) and is actively involved in its activities. He also received funds through an associate for furtherance of the CPI (Maoist) activities. He is the convenor of Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist). The documents related to communications for furthering the activities of CPI (Maoist) and propaganda material of the CPI (Maoist) and literature were seized from his possession.”On January 1, 2018, riots broke out in various parts of Pune district on the occasion of the 200th commemoration day of the Bhima-Koregaon battle in which the East India Company defeated the Peshawar with the help of Dalit soldiers. One person was killed in these riots.According to the FIR registered at the Vishraumbaug police station on January 8, members of Kabir Kala Manch had allegedly made provocative speeches, sung and performed skits that led to violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018.The police had filed two charge sheets in the case and arrested nine accused—Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Rona Wilson, Sudhir Dhawale, Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Sudha Bharadwaj, Shoma Sen and Vernon Gonsalves.

09-10-2020||Chandigarh||Life comes full circle for women’s cricket selector Renu Margrate||For former India cricket all-rounder Renu Margrate, 45, life has come full circle. From a humble background in Amritsar, Margrate toiled hard to make ends meet and earn an India debut in 1995. Now, six months after she applied for the post of national selector, Margrate has been installed as one of the five-member panel for three years and would be paid Rs 25 lakh per annum as salary. The panel will be headed by former spinner Neetu David. An office superintendent with Indian Railways, Margrate, who played five Tests and 23 ODIs for India, replaced Shashi Gupta as selector from North Zone recently. “I’m grateful to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appointed committee for choosing me for this job. It’s amazing to be back to the sport after a decade in a different role. Our first job will be to make squads for the Women’s T20 Challenge to be held in the United Arab Emirates. The tournament will provide a perfect platform to India domestic cricketers as Australians, Kiwis and English players will be busy in the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL),” said Margrate, who has played domestic cricket for Punjab and Indian Railways. ‘CRICKET HAS GIVEN ME EVERYTHING’ Going down the memory lane, Margrate remembers how her parents and brothers encouraged her to pursue cricket while they stayed in a small rented house near the Putli Ghar area in Amritsar. While her mother was a domestic help, her father would sell his paintings to earn a livelihood. “Those were difficult times. Yet they backed me and even sent me to a Jalandhar college so that I could pursue cricket passionately. We did not have money to buy spiked shoes. When I made my debut in 1995, they were elated. Sadly, they are no more but God has been kind,” said Margrate, who was a middle-order bat and a medium-pace bowler. “After I got a job with Railways and played for India, things started looking up. Cricket has given me everything. I could improve my lifestyle and give back to my family. We shifted to a better house though in the same locality. I want to do my duty of being a selector with dignity and honesty like I conducted my career,” says Margrate, who scored a match-winning 75 and also scalped six wickets during a match against Karnataka in the Rani Jhansi tournament in 1994. She smacked former India captain Shanta Rangaswamy in the match that helped her make her India ODI and Test debut against New Zealand in 1995. ‘WOMEN’S CRICKET HAS TRANSFORMED’ “Women’s cricket has changed a lot. We never had money or specialised camps or designated trainers. We put up in dormitories and travelled in buses and trains. Since BCCI took over, the face of women’s cricket changed in India. And the 2017 World Cup took the sport to another level. Now India cricketers have endorsements and BCCI gives central contracts,” she said. “The Covid pandemic halted the game a bit but with IPL-13 taking place in the UAE, the smiles are back again. Hopefully, women matches will also have thrilling finishes. And we can find more Shafali Varmas from the tournament,” said Margrate, who last played for India in the 2000 World Cup. The other selectors are Arati Vaidya, Mithu Mukherjee, V Kalpana and Neetu David as chief selector. ‘NEED GOOD FAST BOWLERS’ Margrate felt the need to have quality quick bowlers. “Jhulan (Goswami) doesn’t play T20s, then there is Shikha Pandey. Other than them, we don’t have many options. Once domestic cricket resumes, the selection panel would focus on scouting and grooming good fast bowlers,” said Margrate. The BCCI contracted players along with other domestic cricketers have been asked to take their yo-yo tests to be eligible for the Women’s T20 Challenge selection. It will have three teams and will be played from November 4 to 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/life-comes-full-circle-for-women-s-cricket-selector-renu-margrate/story-WiNvC8xtUwnKDOa40ZgFbI.html
09-10-2020||Pune||Pune’s real estate sector showing signs of recovery, says report||Hit by the Covid-19 lockdown, Pune’s real estate market is showings signs of recovery during the unlock period, according to a report by Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm. As per the report, 4,918 housing units were sold between the three months of July and September. This was 60 per cent more as compared to 2,235 units sold during April to June quarter. In the pre-Covid-19 quarter (January to March), the number of housing units sold were 7,813. As far as new launches are concerned, city has seen 6,721 projects being launched during July to September, compared to 785 in April to May and 12,650 between January and March. According to Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director (research), Knight Frank India, Maharashtra’s government’s stimulus and strong demand has led to increase in the sale. “Strong demand stimulus like the one by the Maharashtra government and historic low home loan interest rates have been the key reason for the current uptick residential sales. These measures have compelled end-users, those looking for good deals for their property, to make their purchase decision. Developers also took the opportunity to make a strategic offer, especially on their unsold inventory, to support the sales velocity,” said Sinha. The state government in its efforts to revive demand in real estate sector reduced stamp duty from five per cent to two per cent. The concession will be applicable temporarily from September 1 till December 31. Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director, Knight Frank India, said, “There has been a meaningful improvement in sales and launches in Q3 2020. Developers have been focusing on liquidating inventory and homebuyers inclined to purchase ready assets has translated into reduced unsold inventory levels in this quarter. For markets such as Mumbai and Pune, the additional push by the state government in the form of reduced stamp duty has helped in demand generation and revenue creation for the state government.” According to the report, property prices in Pune have seen dip by around five per cent. In terms of rental values, there has been no change in Pune. According to Suhas Merchant, president of Credai-Pune Metro, customers are preferring projects nearing completion rather than under-construction sites while purchasing flats. “Buildings reaching their completion stage with good infrastructure are fetching good demand and western side of the city which have big flats are also in demand. We expect the demand to pick up in the near future,” said Merchant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-real-estate-sector-showing-signs-of-recovery-says-report/story-kvYzGi5HZsxmn5B3buBbEO.html

Once complete, Pune will be the fourth city after Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai where an underground Metro rail crosses the river. The tunneling work below the Mutha river section, according to officials, will begin very soon. According to Maha-Metro director Atul Gadgil, the rail level below the surface at Mutha river is 28 metres which is the lowest point of the metro route. “The tunnel will be six metres below the lowest point of the river. After that there is a seven-metre ridge of the tunnel,” said Gadgil. Pune metro has an underground stretch measuring 5.019 km in its PCMC to Swargate corridor. There are five underground stations. Among these five metro stations, there are three stations where Maha-Metro is erecting multi-modal hubs and other transport models would be connected to each other. Besides Pune, the Kolkata metro crosses the Hooghly river where the tunnel has been dug 33 metres below the river bed. In Mumbai, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) completed one of the twin tunnels passing under the city’s Mithi river. The two tunnels, one of which is complete, are almost 12.5m below Mithi river. Chennai has an operational line under water with the proposed Metro line passing through 20 metres deep under the depths of the Adyar river and Chepet lake while travelling between Madhavaram and Sholinganallur. In Pune, the Tunnel Boring Machine is 150-200 metres away from the river bed at Shivajinagar. The city, as per plan, has three metro corridors being developed by Maha-Metro, the state government company. It will cover total a distance of 31 kilometers (a 16-km stretch from Pimpri to Swargate and another from Vanaz to Ramwadi at an estimated cost of Rs 11,420 crore). The Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) is building another route between Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar, which will be of 23 kilometers at an estimated cost of Rs 7,947 crore. All the three lines are expected to be operational by 2022. Maha-Metro public relations officer Hemant Sonawane, said, “There would be no difference between regular underground metro tunnel and tunnel below the riverbed. Commuters would not realise that they are crossing the river when they travel from this section. The tunnel boring machine has already reached the Civil Court station and completed the 1.6 Km tunnel work for underground metro. There would be no special technique to cross the river. The same machine would do the tunneling work below the river.”Underground metro stations/ Rail level below the surfaceShivajinagar/16 metreCivil Court/28 metreBudhwar peth-25 metreMandai- 20 metreSwaragate- 22 metre||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/work-on-metro-tunnel-under-mutha-river-to-begin-maha-metro-official/story-2MO1eDsSnZUFJ20R2CMsxL.html

Wadhawan is lodged in Taloja jail in connection with Yes bank fraud case. The court, while refusing home food for him, said he is not consuming prescribed diet food provided by jail authorities. Wadhawan’s lawyers had approached the court earlier this week for providing home food to him claiming he is suffering from several ailments and has lost 25 kilograms in last two months. “Since 2018 he is a heart patient and had undergone angioplasty in Switzerland. He is also suffering from lung infection and had spent several days in the ICU. He has also suffered weight loss,” his lawyers contended. The plea was opposed by the prosecution claiming, the blood sugar level is fluctuating as applicant/accused is not consuming diet provided by the prison authorities. The prosecution pointed out that as per directions of High Court and recommendation of the Diet Committee of Government of Maharashtra, nutritious, healthy and nourishing food is provided to the inmates. Also read: ED arrests CFO, internal auditor of Cox and Kings in Yes Bank fraud case The court, after hearing both the side noted that, “I have gone through the medical report of applicant/accused issued by Chief Medical Officer, Taloja Jail. As per the report applicant/accused has a history of hypertension and had undergone angioplasty. His blood glucose level was checked and there is fluctuation in blood sugar level. The report further states that said fluctuation is because of not consuming the necessary diet provided by the prison authority.” The court, while rejecting his plea for home food, also noted that, “required diet is available in jail and was very well provided to the applicant/accused. However, he is not consuming said diet which is causing the fluctuations. As such, necessary and proper food and medication is available to the applicant/accused in Taloja Jail.” Dheeraj Wadhawan was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with Yes bank fraud case. The ED had initiated proceedings against the Wadhawans based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7 in connection with alleged suspicious loans granted by Yes Bank and alleged quid pro quo between Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and the Wadhawans. The agency had arrested Kapoor on March 8 for money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-case-pmla-court-refuses-home-food-for-dheeraj-wadhawan/story-QIboEThHUBuYFe16z79zBL.html
09-10-2020||Pune||No ban on price rise: Onions at ₹50-₹60 per kg in Pune||Onion prices are hovering between Rs50 to Rs60 per kg in Pune city despite the government’s decision to ban the export of onions.The Union government on September 14, 2020, banned the export of all varieties of onions, anticipating a supply crunch. After the decision, the prices of onions dipped in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee from Rs3,000 to Rs2,200 per quintal.Now again the prices have shot up in wholesale APMC markets as well as in retail markets.Jaydutta Holkar, director, Lasalgaon APMC and Mumbai’s Vashi market, said, “Due to less arrival of stock in the market the prices have shot up. In Lasalgaon APMC the onion prices are between Rs3,500 and Rs4,500 per quintal.”“The rates depend on the quality of the onion, but it is true that the prices are soaring. It is most likely that the prices would remain high for the next few weeks as the farmers have less stock of onion with them and the new arrival has been delayed due to rains,” he said.A farmer Rupesh Sawant from Malegaon, Nashik district, said, “As most of the onion crop has been damaged, farmers sold out maximum stock during the lockdown period. We have less stock now. I have 50 to 60 quintals of onions with me which is of good quality but I will wait for next one or two weeks to sell it off.”“I got on an average Rs12 to Rs15 per kg for the onion sold earlier. Three days before (October 6) I sold ten quintal onions and for Rs28 per kg. The production cost per kg is Rs10-Rs 12,” he saidAnother farmer Satish Pawar from Nashik district said, “It is always the case that when small farmers have produced the crop the prices are low. When traders or big farmers are involved the prices shoot up.”“Now the price of onion is around Rs3,500 per quintal but I do not have stock,” he said.Sawant said, “The onion seed has also become costly. Last year it was Rs1,500 per kg but now it is Rs4,500 per kg. The prices of seed shoot up by three times. It is the wrong policy of the government to bring a ban on onion export.”“Even if the government did not want to give any subsidy for crops, don’t give it but now don’t bring any cap or interfere in agricultural commodities,” he said.Vilas Bhujbal, president, trade union, APMC, Pune, said, “The prices of onions have shot up in the wholesale market and will remain high for the next few weeks. Either the price will be stable or increase.”“As the average price of onion in the wholesale market is Rs35 per kg and so in the retail market it is from Rs50 to Rs60 per kg,” he said.Shelar Bhajiwale from Sahakarnagar area said, “The onion prices are increasing. Good quality onions are sold between Rs50 and Rs60 per kg. Average and damaged onions are at Rs40 to 50 per kg in the retail market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-ban-on-price-rise-onions-at-50-60-per-kg-in-pune/story-2O1YMCUec3Nb6GmroDm9LL.html

As many as 21 of them have been established in hostels of the city’s colleges.Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, Shahid Choudhary said that reading culture has always been essential to life in Srinagar which has of late suffered. “The book reading culture is diminishing here. When books and libraries would be readily available, people will obviously access them.”He said they have set up 21 libraries in various hostels of professional and degree colleges and are setting up one in each panchayat and some wards of Srinagar. “In colleges, there is limited scope for libraries but if they are in hostels, the students will read at leisure.”Also Read: Srinagar: Medical college suspends 7 nurses after protest over new duty rosterIn each library, there will be roughly 2000-plus books besides two computers with internet facilities.The list of these books was compiled by students after which they were acquired by the administration. “There is an involvement of students at each level. The libraries are planned and managed by them and we will be augmenting their resources annually,” he said. “We thought that a positive engagement of students and youth is necessary and what better way than this.”Choudhary said around 150 libraries will be established in schools of peripheral areas in the coming months. “In Panchayats, the books will be varied... These libraries will be managed by the panchayat people.”“Brilliant idea… should have books on all subjects. People can donate books as well and there should be a browsing centre in all. Photocopying facility as in National libraries,” tweeted Parvaiz Kaul, a prominent doctor.“Very welcome step sir. This must not be limited to Srinagar city only but we must have at least one public library in every Panchayat in rural areas as well. And people should be motivated to donate books to these libraries,” said Bilal Khanday, a netizen.Satish Dua, a retired army officer, suggested using the reach of the army for such an initiative. “When I was Corps Commander, we had established 66 Chinar Nau-Jawan Clubs, with great response. Among other facilities they have a library too, some big some small. You may consider partnering with them and use their reach in remote areas. Your choice of books will be more relevant,” he wrote in response to Choudhary’s tweet about the initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/srinagar-to-get-200-libraries-in-schools-and-panchayats-over-the-next-two-months/story-klx0vIRE0T4rigq9IEG7JI.html

09-10-2020||Patna||Bihar’s socialist icon Ram Vilas Paswan dies||Veteran leader, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) patron and union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, who breathed his last at a Delhi hospital on Thursday, leaves behind a big void in the national politics. His son and MP Chirag Paswan gave the news through his tweet. Bihar politics has been known to revolve around the big three, Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, since the 1990s and despite often remaining in opposing camps, their personal equation was never affected.Having remained in active politics for five decades, he was one of the tallest Dalit leaders in the Indian politics. He had founded the LJP in 2000 and made it an important cog in Bihar politics by dint of his hard work. He was known to have an uncanny knack of reading people’s mood and political wind. He got elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly for the first time in 1969 as a member of the Samyukta Socialist Party and never looked back thereafter, though he did not have any political legacy behind him. However, he leaves behind a legacy that would be hard to match. He was very active in the JP’s students’ movement as a student of Patna University and was also arrested. His hard work paid off and in 1977 he became MP for the first time at just 31 years of age from Hajipur on a Janata Party ticket. Since then, he became synonymous with Hajipur. He represented Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency eight times till 2019. In 1989 he outdid his own record by increasing his winning margin to over five-lakh. He became the union minister for the first time the same year. In 2019, he decided not to contest and went to the Rajya Sabha from the NDA. He was the RS member even from 2010-2014. He had the distinction of working with six Prime Ministers, which speaks volumes of his ability to adjust and adapt. Perhaps, it was his ability to plan deftly that resulted in his decision to pass on the baton of the LJP to his son Chirag Paswan in 2019 and stay away from the rigours of electoral politics, which he was quite adept at. He was also committed to his family and was not unfazed when some people asked him about projecting them in politics. He often said that his brothers stood by him when he was a struggler and it was his duty to help them come up. It was his stature and ability to get along with all that has left leaders of all hues sad, with condolences pouring in from everywhere, cutting across the party lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-s-socialist-icon-ram-vilas-paswan-dies/story-QgB5MixWTrVmN1wpjEL6FO.html
09-10-2020||Election:||Bihar assembly election: Tejashwi stabbed me in the back, Shah offered a balm, says VIP’s Mukesh Sahni||Mukesh Sahni-led Vikassheel Insaan Party, or VIP, has quit the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in Bihar to contest 11 seats from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s quota in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Sahni spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about the elections and why he chose to return to the NDA. Edited excerpts:In March 2019, you made a speech against the BJP. You were later given three Lok Sabha seats to contest as part of the Mahagathbandhan. What has changed since?In 2014, when I returned to Bihar from Mumbai, where I had gone to work as an 18-year-old, I came back for [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi. I worked closely with Amit Shah, who was the party president and campaigned hard for the BJP because I had faith in Modi. I ran a social organisation then and campaigned for the NDA in the 2014 and 2015 Bihar polls. But then I had concerns about my community, Nishads, not being given the benefit of reservation. So I quit.In 2018, I formed a political party and joined the NDA. A political party’s work is to contest elections and since I could not join the NDA, I went with the Mahagathbandhan. Even though I was not completely happy... I went with the flow. I was assured by [RJD leader] Tejashwi Yadav that we will be given 25 seats to contest and the deputy chief minister’s post. At the last minute, he announced at a press conference the VIP will get only two seats. It was there that I took a call that I am going to walk out of the Mahagathbandhan. Tejashwi stabbed me in the back and Shah offered me balm. So, I went back to the NDA.The only reason you walked out was Tejashwi Yadav not keeping his word...Tejashwi has inherited the party. His father Lalu Prasad was a big leader, but he [Tejashwi Yadav] lacks experience and discipline. And despite their Lok Sabha performance, we stayed with them and helped them, even when old allies such as the RLSP [Rashtriya Lok Samta Party] and the HAM [Hindustani Awam Morcha] left them.Our party has a vote bank of about 14 to 15% among the most backward communities. But he had different ideas. After reneging on his promise of 25 seats and deputy chief minister‘s post, he thought we will branch out on our own and benefit the RJD, since we will cut into the vote share of the NDA.Also read: JMM to go solo in Bihar polls, accuses RJD of ‘political betrayal’Has there been any discussion with the BJP on the possibility of a ministerial post? Have you resolved the outstanding issues with the party?For the past seven decades, there has been no reservation for the Nishads. I still say whatever can be done within the ambit of the Constitution for the community should be done. However, the government has taken some steps. Modi has announced special schemes for the fishing communities. There is a focus on fox nut farming. This gives me hope that work is being done to improve the economic condition of the community.There is no deal or pre-conditions with the BJP. I have worked closely with Amit Shah during the 2015 election. He supports me in my work. I am thankful to the PM, BJP president JP Nadda and [Union] home minister [Shah] who took me back and offered me 11 seats as against the 2 that the Mahagathbandhan offered.... we are capable of winning all 11 [seats].Is VIP a replacement for the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in the NDA?I am not a replacement for the LJP. But I feel Chirag [Paswan of LJP] should have shown a little bit of patience. He should have complied with the rules of an alliance. After all the LJP is not such a big party that it is challenging its own ally. He does not have candidates to field. He has made his move with the eye on the 2025 election, but it is important to work on the ground and not make grand statements.You mentioned that you left Bihar to work in Mumbai. Employment will be a big issue in Bihar...Everyone has to struggle whether they are the rich or poor. And this problem of employment is not limited to Bihar. It is a countrywide problem. But we have to look at the work chief minister Nitish Kumar has done in the last 15 years. He has steered the state through difficult times. He has experience and vision which the RJD or Tejashwi do not have. Now is not the time for R&D [experiment] in Bihar. There are many senior leaders in the RJD but what is needed is experience and vision. Tejashwi is young but he does not meet people. He does not work with people on the ground. He does not hit the streets. He banks on the Yadav vote bank because he thinks it is his entitlement to get their votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-tejashwi-stabbed-me-in-back-shah-offered-a-balm-says-vip-s-mukesh-saini/story-m7P6rUZdNzfHNtg0tkyMDP.html

Pusa bio-decomposer initiative as a solution to stubble burning will benefit Haryana and Punjab more, and Delhi’s benefit is that it will get rid of the smoke from farm fires that make the city a gas chamber every year. We want cooperation of other states and not confrontation on the issue of pollution,” he said.Rai said the Delhi government has been taking action against dust, biomass burning, stubble and vehicular pollution.But air pollution in Delhi hit severe levels only when stubble burning is at its peak. The city becomes a gas chamber then, the minister asserted.“We are the only government which is serious about it (pollution level). We are working on a mission mode. Many states in India have been battling severe air pollution, but they don’t seem very active despite it being a major challenge, especially in the times of coronavirus,” Rai had told PTI in an interview on Thursday.The crop residue burning has not stopped despite the Supreme Court issuing strict directions in this regard, Rai said.“The issue concerns Punjab and Haryana, but Delhi is working more on it. Stubble burning is minimal in Delhi, still we are taking steps to deal with it. We are working with Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa… took an initiative. We want to take the lead and set an example for other states,” he said.“What we are working on will benefit Punjab and Haryana more. Delhi’s benefit is that it will get rid of smoke from farm fires,” he added.Stubble burning has started in Haryana and Punjab, which contributes significantly to the rise in pollution levels in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/want-cooperation-not-confrontation-from-other-states-over-air-pollution-gopal-rai/story-KB5qJR0pBH3kD2RBJrM6eN.html
09-10-2020||Pune||Students protest against fee hike at Fergusson College in Pune||Student unions staged a protest outside the Fergusson College (FC) premises on Thursday against the fee hike announced by the college administration for its various courses. The college, which is an autonomous body, has increased the fees for this academic year for the courses of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science by 100-200 per cent. Most of the students come from humble economic backgrounds and have faced financial difficulties due to Covid-19 pandemic and hence, have opposed the fee hike. “I am currently enrolled in the final year for Bachelor of Science course at Fergusson College and when we started the admission process online, we were shocked to see the increased fees. Last year, the fees for us was around Rs 2,000 which has now increased to Rs 6,000. Most of the students here in college are from rural areas of the state and we cannot afford such high fees. Specially during the pandemic, we are already suffering a lot and this financial burden is not acceptable,” said a student Sujit Kate. For the Bachelor of Arts course, the earlier fees which was Rs 2,470 for second year has been hiked to Rs 6,070 for reservation category which is almost a 145 per cent increase from the last academic year. For the science stream, last year the fees was Rs 3,550 which has increased to Rs 7,050, a 98 per cent increase. Sandhya Sonawane, Pune division head of Rashtravadi Congress students’ union, said, “Today we held a protest at the Fergusson College against the fee hike and we submitted a letter of our demands to the principal. Though the college is autonomous, but they don’t have any financial autonomy, so this fee hike should be cancelled immediately. The principal has assured us to take up the issue with the board of directors and if the issue is not resolved within 15 days, then we will start a hunger strike outside the college.” Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said, “We have received the letter from the students on Thursday regarding the fee hike and soon, we will be conduct a meeting to discuss it. A committee has been formed and accordingly, further decisions will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/students-protest-against-fee-hike-at-fergusson-college-in-pune/story-muJyjve34snytBnCAbV6MP.html
09-10-2020||Lucknow||BSP chief Mayawati asks Dalits to unite, win power||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Friday hit out at the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and called them casteist, feudal and narrow-minded while asking the Dalits to unite under her party’s banner to win power at the Centre and in the states.Speaking at a press conference after paying tribute to BSP founder Kanshi Ram on his 14th death anniversary, Mayawati accused the two parties of conspiring against the BSP to stop it from coming to power. She accused the Congress leaders of calling the BSP BJP’s B-team to misguide the Dalits. Mayawati said the BJP used similar tactics when the Congress was in power at the Centre. She asked the Dalits to understand the BJP and Congress’s “game plan” of dividing the community for political gains.Also Read: BSP revives 2007 Dalit-Brahmin formula, hopes to unseat Yogi in 2022 pollsMayawati, a four-time Uttar Pradesh chief minister, said their attitude towards the Dalits and the BSP was the same. She accused Congress and BJP leaders of indulging in all types of political drama over incidents of atrocities against Dalits to serve their vested interests. She referred to the alleged rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras and said both parties betrayed her community. “The Congress or BJP governments did nothing for the welfare and security of the Dalit community. Rather, the scheduled caste people were exploited and harassed under the BJP and Congress governments,” she said.Mayawati promised the BSP will work for the welfare of the weaker sections of all the communities. She asked Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram’s followers to strengthen the BSP for the Dalit empowerment and to reject the Dalit outfits launched with the Congress and BJP’s support to damage BSP’s electoral prospects.Mayawati said rival political parties like Congress and the BJP have launched a campaign to defame the BSP over fund collection from its supporters. She insisted her party collects funds from its supporters to run the organisation and to contest elections. Mayawati said the BSP did not take donations from big capitalists and rich businessmen like rival parties did. “If the BSP starts taking donations from capitalists and businessmen, then it will have to follow their directions and when in power, it will have to frame policies for their benefit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bsp-chief-mayawati-asks-dalits-to-unite-win-power/story-gb9uggZAyklW5XwNO9Ye8J.html
09-10-2020||Pune||Couple in Pune arrested for abandoning baby, declaring it dead||A couple was arrested by the Pune police on Thursday for abandoning their 3-month-old child at a church and informing their family that the child had died.The two people - parents of a 5-year-old child - are well educated who were bailed out on the same day by the court, according to the police.“The man is an engineer and the wife is a housewife. They have been married for seven years, but they had differences and were separated for a while. Last year, they came back together and the wife got pregnant around the same time and delivered a baby in August. But he had doubts and gave her the option of either leaving him or abandoning the child. She chose to abandon the baby,” said senior police inspector Rajendra Sahane of Khadki police station.A passer-by had found the baby near a church in Khadki on Tuesday early morning and handed it over to the police. The woman and her husband had differences among them and the husband had doubts about the biological father of child, according to the police. Their differences led them to decide that the child should be abandoned in order to save their marriage.“I saw the baby’s uncle’s social media post as he was an acquaintance. Another friend’s wife saw the child and brought it to my notice and in turn to the police. The sweating had drenched the baby’s clothes completely and it was shivering. Only a small part of the zip covering it’s body was open. At night itself, I had called the acquaintance and told him that the baby he mentioned in his social media post has been found. He was shocked and said that it was his sister’s baby and that a funeral was held for him,” said Litesh Tinku Das (28), a resident of Mula road and a social worker.The baby is now in custody of the police and is being treated at the Sassoon General Hospital. The police are looking for a legal recourse for the baby. The couple may also face charges for forging the baby’s death certificate.A case under Section 317 (exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years, by parent or person having care of it) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Khadki police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/couple-in-pune-arrested-for-abandoning-baby-declaring-it-dead/story-60RvFO2j52Gz9Qg0Yt537O.html

These solar repellers have motion sensor system which creates a high pitch sound when activated, startling wild animals enough to send them back towards the forest. During night time, the repeller instrument also throws a sharp light towards approaching wild animals, affecting their vision. Neeraj Sharma, divisional forest officer (DFO), Haridwar, said initial results of the repellers are encouraging. “These repellers are also being installed at other wild animal intrusion prone stretches in the district. Of the proposed 18, we have already set up 10 repellers on the points commonly used by wild animals to move towards residential areas,” he said. Also read: Elephant kills 55-year-old woman in Uttarakhand’s Nainital“The initial phase of installation is being done from Matri Sadan ashram till Bishanpur Kundi and further, it will be carried on till Laksar,” said Dinesh Naudiyal, Ranger Haridwar forest division. Gurukul Kangri University assistant professor environmental science Dr Gagan Matta pointed out that a cost-effective solar repeller instrument is based on the traditional methods of creating sound and light to shoo animals away. Farmers have welcomed the decision.“We want these repeller instruments installed at more places as wild animals, elephants in particular, ravage our agricultural crops of sugarcane every season,” said Jagjeetpur village farmer Ballam Saini, A delegation of affected farmers of Pathri area had also submitted a memorandum to the forest officials demanding construction of a safety wall as well as installation of repellers. Wild animals have regularly moved towards human habitation in Haridwar district. In July, an elephant entered a residential area just 1.5 km from Har-Ki-Pauri in Haridwar and created ruckus, damaging boundary walls and vehicles parked outside the houses. Earlier in April, an elephant was spotted at Har-Ki-Pauri. There are 2,026 elephants in the state, according to the elephant census released by the state forest department in June this year. In 2012, there were 1,559 elephants while in 2017 there were 1,839 elephants in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-forest-department-uses-solar-repeller-technique-to-check-movement-of-wild-animals/story-wBevyz1A9CmSq1ngdHCR5M.html

Rishan Doley, 30, and Shekhar Bordoloi, 26, started from Majuli, the world’s largest river island, on September 30 and ended their 8-day-long trip at Umananda, the world’s smallest inhabited river island near Guwahati, on October 7. “Our aim was to show the tremendous potential for rafting and water sports in Assam in the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. Using a non-motorised bamboo raft when the river was flooded added to the thrill,” said Bordoloi, an engineer. Also Read: Wildlife-friendly roads pay off, 18 species using special underpasses in PenchThe two friends who connected during a mountaineering trip few years ago planned the expedition a year ago, but it took the Covid-19-enforced lockdown, which prevented them from going out on trips, to make it a reality. They built a 25 ft long and 17 ft wide raft with 170 bamboo shoots in a week. They named the raft Shibuk, a word used by the Mising tribe to describe the loud sound made by the Brahmaputra waters when it enters holes in the earth. The expedition was flagged off from Kartik Chapori by Padmashri Jadav Payeng, known as Forest Man for planting a forest on his own. To document the trip, Nayan Bordoloi joined the duo as a videographer. Rafting on the Brahmaputra is not easy even during winter, when the river’s water level goes down and the current slows. During the eight days, the friends had a tough time staying on the mainstream as the river meanders. They also experienced harsh winds and whirlpools. “Our most memorable experience happened on the fourth day when the raft got stuck in a sandbar in the evening as we were crossing Kaziranga National Park. As elephants and water buffaloes paced on the banks, we used all our strength to move it and continue rafting,” recalled Doley, who runs his own adventure tour company. The friends carried enough provisions for the trip, a small LPG cylinder and stove to cook meals and a mini-generator to charge their phones and other devices. At night, they halted on the banks of the river and set sail in the morning. Both Doley and Bordoloi hope to embark on more such adventures and promote water sports among tourists as well as provide employment to locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-assam-men-cover-400km-of-flooded-brahmaputra-on-bamboo-raft/story-uscPkhmS7myOmHAqIgOuZM.html

The seven charge-sheeted accused are—academic and activist Dr Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Hany Babu Musaliyarveetil Tharayil, three members of Kabir Kala Manch (Jyoti Raghoba Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor), and Father Stan Swamy. The eighth accused Milind Teltumbde, secretary of Maharashtra State Committee of the CPI (Maoist), is said to be on the run.After filing the charge sheet, special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty said, “A supplementary charge sheet has been submitted against eight accused. The registry will scrutinise it first and later further process will take place.” Also Read: ‘Fake evidence planted’: Jharkhand activist Stan Swamy claims before arrestNIA took over the probe from Maharashtra Police in January. Four months later, the agency arrested Teltumbde and Navlakha. they had to surrender before the agency as the Supreme Court refused to grant them any further protection and relief from arrest. NIA, after the arrest, claimed that Teltumbde delivered a “provocative presentation” and speeches on December 31, 2017, during an event at Shaniwarwada in Pune, which led to the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in January 2018, statewide agitation and loss of life. NIA has alleged Teltumbde was the convenor of the programme and his call data records show he was in touch with the other arrested accused present at the event. The agency also claimed that Navlakha, along with other activists, is accused of having links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad gathering. Navlakha was first arrested by the Pune Police on August 28, 2018, but the Delhi high court had quashed his arrest on October 1, 2018. The prosecution had alleged that till August 2018 he was a member of CPI (Maoist). While arresting Navlakha, Pune Police cited several letters recovered from the computer of one of the accused exchanged between them. It was alleged that Navlakha and some of the other activists (who have also been arrested in the case), had direct access to and communicated with central committee members and senior leaders of CPI (Maoist). Pune Police also alleged that Navlakha was part of the conspiracy and they were probing to check if there was a larger conspiracy of seizing political power via an armed revolution by mobilising the masses. Navlakha surrendered before NIA on April 14 as no court granted him protection from the arrest.

Two months later, the agency arrested three members of Kabir Kala munch—Jyoti Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor. Gorkhe and Gaichor were arrested on September 7 while Jagtap was arrested a day later. The agency, in a statement released after their arrest, claimed, “The three were propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology and were co-conspirators with other arrested accused. It has also a matter of record that the arrested accused persons were in contact with absconding accused Milind Teltumbde about the urban network of CPI (Maoist). Also it is established that during their (Kabir Kala Manch members) visits to the jungle, they underwent weapons and explosive training and awareness programmes on various topics related to Maoist movement.” The latest arrest by the agency was that of Father Stan Swamy. Father Swamy, an 83-year-old activist suffering from Parkinsons was arrested from his residence in Ranchi. The officials claimed that “he is a member of CPI (Maoist) and is actively involved in its activities. He also received funds through an associate for furtherance of the CPI (Maoist) activities.

09-10-2020||Pune||Unemployment one of the reasons behind rise in crime: Pune CP Gupta||Unemployment arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic could be one of the reasons behind the rise in crime, but there is not enough data to come to a conclusion. Prima facie we feel that unemployment is the reason behind the slight rise in crime in the city recently, said Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta while addressing mediapersons on the sidelines of a media briefing on Wednesday on the arrest of four assailants in the murder of a Pune builder.“Mobile phone thefts, chain snatching and other small thefts have witnessed a gradual rise in the city and we will increase preventive action and ensure all the criminals are dealt with strictly. We have information that as many as 260 criminals have been released on parole in the last 45 days and we will ensure extensive usage of organised crime acts like Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca) to break the back of the gangs,” he said.Over the last ten days, four murder cases were lodged in the city. A man was murdered near Navale bridge and his decomposed body dumped in a sack was traced. A person was murdered in Krushnanagar area in Kondhwa while he was drinking alcohol and the mob set fire to the house and destroyed the furniture. Similarly, Yuva Sena office-bearer Deepak Maratkar was hacked to death on Thursday. A notorious goon was found murdered under mysterious circumstances in Kharadi, three days ago. Gupta said that wider use of surveillance technology will ensure that the crime rate is kept under check and orders have been issued to all crime units for a complete crackdown on the criminals. Gupta faces multifold challenges ranging from street violations, vehicle thefts and property and cybercrimes ever since he took over from outgoing CP K Venkatesham. The 51-year-old, a 1992-batch IPS officer, is an IIT graduate who hails from Uttar Pradesh was posted as principal secretary (special), home department, Mumbai, before his Pune posting.As many as 800 incidents of violence took place till September 2019 while 818 cases of the same incidents have been recorded till date this year.

It posted the matter for further hearing on November 7.Yadav had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.On December 23, 2017, he was convicted in three other fodder scam cases in quick succession. Since then, he has been in jail.Of these three cases, he secured bail in one of them last year on the ground that he had served half of the 3.5-year imprisonment awarded to him.The high court granted bail to Yadav on Friday in the instant aforesaid case, which relates to the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 33.13 crore from Chaibasa treasury against the annual allotment of Rs 7.10 lakh for the year 1992-93.Of the four cases in which he has so far been convicted and sentenced to different terms of imprisonment, he has now secured bail in three of them.But in the fourth and last case, the RJD chief is facing 14 years in prison – seven under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections and another seven under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. The trial court had expressly said both sentences would run consecutively.Yadav’s lawyers hope that the high court will strike down this decision, and let the two sentences run simultaneously. If that happens, half of that seven-year sentence would be completed by November 10.Yadav’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar said, “The high court, in matters of other convicts in the same case, suspended the sentence and considered a maximum (of0 seven-year imprisonment for reckoning the half sentence for bail purposes. In such a situation, he is completing half custody on November 10.”“We are expecting his release from jail after November 10. We will file another bail application in that month only,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/fodder-scam-case-jharkhand-hc-grants-bail-to-lalu-yadav/story-WcazU61P9CoWOrg8poHE0M.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Veteran writer protests for 20 hours after jeweller refuses to speak in Marathi||Veteran Marathi writer Shobha Deshpande protested outside a jewellery shop in Colaba, Mumbai, for about 20 hours after the jeweller refused to speak to her in Marathi and allegedly drove her out of his shop. Following this, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers rushed to the shop, assaulted the jeweller and forced him to apologise. Deshpande, 80, sat on a dharma on Thursday afternoon in protest against the jeweller. She alleged that at the jewellery store, she was abruptly told that they will not speak in Marathi and will not even sell their wares to her. They allegedly also showed her the door after she insisted on seeing their shop registration certificate, she alleged. The jeweller was talking in Hindi. I asked him to speak in Marathi. While he refused to do so, he also added that he was not interested in selling his jewellery to me. Then I asked him for his registration certificate. Again, he refused so I called the police who took his side, forcing me to sit in protest,” said Deshpande. Soon, MNS workers turned up in large numbers and allegedly even slapped the shop owner. “We will deal with his arrogance in our own style. We will not allow this shop to open till they start talking to customers in Marathi,” said MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande. He added that Deshpande was over 80, and suffered from multiple health issues but the owner did not bother about her condition before misbehaving with her. The jeweller, Shankarlal Jain, did apologise to Deshpande but MNS workers took him to the Colaba Police station. “I was born in Mumbai and respect the Marathi language. I am sorry for this mistake and will not repeat it,” said Jain. Deshpande then withdraw her protest. “I am appalled at this attitude where they openly insult Marathi which is the state language. They conduct their business for decades in Mumbai and refuse to learn Marathi,”she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-veteran-writer-protests-for-20-hours-after-jeweller-refuses-to-speak-in-marathi/story-A332BTbjZrTbpBknLGnVPN.html

He added they included 12 secret agents, five covert operatives and eight police informers.Also read: Maoists kill five of their own members in ChhattisgarhThe statement did not specify when the killings were carried out. But the police in Telangana’s Bhadradri Kothagudem district bordering Chhattisgarh said they received intelligence inputs that the Maoists killed 16 villagers after holding a “people’s court” in the last week of September. The Maoists also kidnapped a few other villages and took them into forests and might have killed them later, a police officer said.Vikalp said one of the secret agents working for the police turned out to be Maoist leader Vijja. “Our inquiries revealed that Vijja had been acting as a police agent for the last two years and entrusted with the responsibility of harming the central committee of the Maoist party. He had provided crucial information about the party meetings to the police four times. Though huge police forces were deployed, we could escape with the help of people, alertness and support from the local groups.”Maoists were earlier reported to have shot dead Modium Vijja alias Bhadru, 39, for killing innocent villagers. Vijjalu carried a cash reward of Rs 8 lakh on his head.Vikalp said Bastar’s police inspector general P Sundar Raj and superintendent Kamala Lochan Kashyap and other top officers managed the covert operation Samadhan Yojana aimed at eliminating the Maoists by 2022. He added police opened bank accounts for the slain agents, covert operatives, and informers.Vikalp alleged they were involved in atrocities against tribals, including rapes, murders, and looting. “They released dogs on people and detained innocent people in camps to pressurise them to surrender.”Raj said the killings show the frustration of Maoists and that fear of becoming extinct was haunting them. “They have lost the public support due to their own misdeeds and their leadership is now totally clueless and directionless.” Raj said anti-Maoist sentiment was building up in the tribal areas and their movement is nearing an end.(With inputs from Ritesh Mishra, Raipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maoists-claim-to-have-killed-25-tribals-in-chattisgarh-s-bijapur-in-last-week-of-september/story-SWmAT68RNUe3B3M4QaCkmL.html
09-10-2020||Lifestyle||Sindur khela fervour to be missed this year? No way, say Delhi-NCR women||With the ways of living, the ways of celebrating our festivals have also changed due to the pandemic. So as Durga Puja approaches, the thought of not being able to revel in the age-old tradition of sindur khela makes one wonder how will the festival be this year! Durga Puja pandals aren’t planning to organise sindur khela in groups. But, where there’s a festival, there’s a way. And women in Delhi-NCR have already set plans to celebrate this tradition from the comfort of their homes. The relevance of celebrating sindur khela varies from one community to another. Shampa Sircar Das, a Delhi-based artist, says, “This tradition has its origins in the Durga Pujas that were organised by the zamindars, to usher bonhomie among homemakers. The red vermillion colour symbolises the strength of womanhood or shakti that a woman has and uses to shield her family and the society while facing different challenges.” Talking about her plans of indulging in festive celebrations, Das says, “This year the pandemic has left us with no choice since a majority of puja celebration committees have decided to perform only Ghot Puja (worshipping an urn symbolising the goddess), and a few of them will perform puja with small idols without any usual lavish celebrations. The joy and preparation of wearing a red and white saree and taking along in a thali, flowers, sweets and sindur will become online this year! The final goodbye to Ma Durga on Dashami and the ritual of applying sindur on the Goddess’s feet and forehead which is followed by the sheer joy of playing vermilion or sindur with each other will all be done a virtually.” Some denizens have even invited their friends to celebrate sindur khela in a closed complex. “I’ll be inviting some close friends of mine and in the garden of my house we will celebrate this ritual with all the fervour. I’ve also planned what all foods will be served and my music playlist is also ready. I don’t want to ruin the spirit of this annual affair due to the pandemic! When Ma is coming all the way for us, we must keep the spirit high,” says Sanghamitra Mallick, a Gurugram-based content writer. “Durga puja in Covid-19 might be dull, but not for me. I’m on my shopping spree! Dhunuchi dance and bhog is planned with my girls on Asthami and Mughlai dinner with family on Navami and sindur khela, all at my house. We would be wearing the new sarees to celebrate the rituals. Pandals are fun but let’s dance and celebrate for our soul this time,” says Alaknanda Kathak, a Noida-based dancer.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/sindur-khela-fervour-to-be-missed-this-year-no-way-say-delhi-ncr-women/story-30lMwdqaoM6tFRrc6G5UPJ.html

The court has also asked the state to involve all stakeholders, including essential service providers, and frame a broader policy on staggered work timings so that the issue of overcrowding on platforms and local trains during peak hours is addressed. The state has also been asked to inform the court of the measures it proposes to take in the event of a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases that have been predicted in December and January. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of public interest litigations filed on behalf of the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa and various lawyer groups, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was not averse to increasing the frequency of local trains on both the Central and Western Railways. The petitions have sought inclusion of lawyers in the list of essential service providers so that they can travel by local trains and attend court as and when their cases came up for hearing in the high court as well as the subordinate courts in the MMR region. While making submissions, Kumbhakoni submitted that the state had been asking the railway authorities to increase services based on demand. “We have slowly started opening sectors one by one as figures of Covid positive case are going down. The reason why we are doing it in a phased manner is the capacity of the health sector to treat patients...Whenever there is a decline (in the number of cases), we open up one sector that results in a small increase in Covid cases, but it doesn’t cross the threshold. That is how we have opened up restaurants. We are trying to take a judicious approach,” submitted Kumbakoni. “There is no return ticket for corona. We have to live with it. If we allow the public to enter local trains, we expect them to behave properly,” said Kumbhakoni. It was pointed out that the problem of overcrowding in trains was seen only during peak hours: 8 – 10 am and 4 - 7 pm. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for railways, suggested that a staggered work timing regime could ensure that huge crowds don’t reach the platform at the same time. Appearing for the Bar Council, senior counsel Dr Milind Sathe submitted that the council was amenable to staggered work timings and members could be asked to travel by locals only when they had cases. Other petitioners represented by advocate Abhay Anturkar, Shyam Dewani and other advocates concurred with his suggestions. After the submissions, the bench observed, “Survival should be foremost thing in our mind. Device a mechanism to ensure that all people do not come to the platform at same time.” The court then said that it was extending the facility of e-pass for advocates appearing in subordinate courts in the MMR region on an experimental basis for five days and would review it thereafter. It also asked the state and the lawyer associations to come up with responses to its suggestions and placed the matter for hearing on October 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/frame-policy-on-staggered-work-timings-to-avoid-train-crowding-hc-tells-maharashtra-railways/story-E9zpKiTypv9IcybH3oxAxL.html

09-10-2020||Education||MP government report: 90% schools without water tap, 40% without power||Over 90% of government primary and middle schools in Madhya Pradesh do not have drinking water taps and four out of every ten schools are without electricity and a hand wash facility, according to unified district information system for education (UDISE) plus report. The report provides data of 99,987 schools as on July 18, 2020 and shows that many schools in the Central Indian state lack basic amenities for students such as drinking water facility. As many as 90,912 schools are without taps and 99,776 schools have unprotected wells. About 82.86% of all such schools don’t have other safe water source, as per the report. However, the report shows that progress has been made in providing toilet facilities in schools even though 1,208 schools are without toilets. In 3,654 schools, there are no functional toilets for boys and none for girls in 2,760 schools, the report said. The report also pointed out that half of these schools, don’t have a separate room for principal, 1,582 schools are existing without a building and 13,759 schools have no boundary walls. Schools in Chhattisgarh to remain closed due to Covid-19 pandemicThe infrastructural gaps also exist in the eight aspirational districts in the state identified by the National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog. They include Barwani, Chhatarpur, Damoh, Khandwa, Rajgarh, Vidisha, Singrauli and Guna, according to a letter written to collectors of these districts by commissioner, Rajya Shiksha Kendra, Lokesh Kumar Jatav. Jatav, in the letter, said, “Infrastructural gaps vis-à-vis toilets (boys/girls) and drinking water, as reflected in U-DISE 2019-20, is a matter of concern as it suggests carelessness and indifferent attitude towards the work. Please get the data updated by identifying the schools with infrastructural gaps and take action against assistant and junior engineers concerned, identified for carelessness and indifferent attitude.” Recently, minister of state for school education Inder Singh Parmar had said that the schools with less resource will be developed in a modern away and a number of schools will be upgraded under the CM-rise-schools scheme across the state. The school education department has listed 10,000 schools across the state to be equipped with modern facilities and technology under the scheme and for putting in place required resources to “develop capability and efficiency of modern 21st century in students”, according to a department document. Despite the claim, the state government reduced the budget of school education department by Rs 1,266 crore in this financial year citing Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read: One dead, six injured in clash over naming of village square in MPEducationist, Anil Sadgopal, said the report didn’t surprise him.“The figures on infrastructural gaps in the UDISE plus report are not surprising. The fact remains that education doesn’t exist on the priority list of the governments, whether it’s at the Centre or in states.” Sadgopal blamed apathy in administration towards education for the continuing problems. “Kothari Commission report, as back as in 1966, talked of the concept of a common school system inter alia to strengthen the primary education in the country but nothing concrete took place to implement the Commission’s recommendations in the past six decades or so. When influential people’s children don’t study in government schools, why would these people be worried about the condition of the government schools?,” he asked Also Read: Madhya Pradesh: ‘Quarantined’ cop arrested with two others for illegal transportation of liquorJoint director (retired), school education department, KK Pandey, agreed with Sadgopal. “The government schools are now being run by local bodies, which have no dearth of funds for non-educational projects. The gaps have something to do with the priority of the state government and the local bodies. The department has worked on certain schools like schools of excellence which have good faculty and infrastructure but most of the schools are in shambles,” Pandey said. Madhya Pradesh teachers’ association’s Ashutosh Pandey said, “When admission in the nearest private schools under Right to Education (RTE) is possible, why should one choose a government school which has no facility? The government doesn’t want to strengthen the infrastructure in the schools. Want of facilities means fewer students in government schools and gives the government a pretext to privatise the school education.” Social activist Rolly Shivhare said, “We see similar reports every year but nothing happens afterwards on the part of the government. Since education is no priority in the government’s agenda, there is no planning and no budget for education. And thus, the children of weaker section, who prefer such schools don’t get quality education.” Rajya Shiksha Kendra commissioner Lokesh Kumar Jatav said the government was trying to pool in funds from various sources including local area development funds of the public representatives to strengthen the infrastructure in schools. “We are working on two fronts simultaneously. While we are strengthening the infrastructure we are working on quality of education too. We have taken several measures in this regard like ‘Hamara ghar hamara vidyalaya’ during the pandemic situation,” Jatav added. UDISE was initiated by the education ministry in 2012-13 to create national school management information systems for elementary education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/mp-government-report-90-schools-without-water-tap-40-without-power/story-8MchgExtSgVmYE8gnFY05I.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Crime branch arrests fake IPS officer after 1200km long car chase||Mumbai police crime branch officials have arrested a 38-year-old Rajasthan man who posed as an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and allegedly kidnapped a Surat businessman from a renowned hotel in Marine Drive and extorted Rs 16 lakh under the pretext of settling a complaint registered against the businessman in directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI), said officials.The police chased the accused by road for hundreds of kilometers from Gujarat to Bangalore for over 24-hours, before he could be arrested. The accused would extort money from big businessmen posing as a senior IPS officer and would splurge the ill-gotten money on his lavish lifestyle, the probe has revealed.The arrested impersonator cum extortionist has been identified as one Shiv Shankar Sharma, 38 year old resident of Byavar in Rajasthan’s Ajmer district. Sharma has been arrested on the complaint of Surat resident Mohammed Ehtesham Aslam Naviwala, who is into garment export business.According to the officials in the crime branch, a few weeks ago, Naviwala received a call from Sharma, who posed as a senior IPS officer and informed him about registration of a complaint against him at the DRI for some customs and export-norms related violations. Sharma offered to solve the matter by mediating and called Naviwala to a four star hotel in Marine Drive.At the hotel room, Sharma offered to settle the matter for payment of a hefty sum. This led to a heated argument between Naviwala and Sharma and his associates. “They (then) assaulted Naviwala, abused him and confined him to the room. They later threatened and kidnapped him on gunpoint and later drove him to Gujarat to collect the ransom. He was harassed and was released only after he managed to pay Rs 16 lakh cash to the accused,” said a crime branch officer requesting anonymity.After the incident, Naviwala first approached Gujarat police and then Mumbai police. After preliminary inquiry with the Marine Drive hotel, the Marine Drive police registered a case last week. As the case was serious in nature, the senior officials pressed officials of Mumbai crime branch’s anti-extortion cell (AEC) to look into the matter. Also Read: Mumbai Police accuse Republic TV in ‘TRP scam’AEC officials used technological surveillance and information received from reliable sources to trace Sharma’s location in Gujarat, said the official. An AEC team then went to Gujarat, but Sharma kept on changing his locations, the officer added.“We chased him from Gujarat to Bengaluru for over 24-hours by road and eventually nabbed him in Bengaluru on Tuesday. He was brought to Mumbai and was placed under arrest,” the officer added.During interrogation it was revealed that Sharma had learnt through an associate that there was an existing complaint against Naviwala in DRI and therefore, he hatched a conspiracy to extort money from the businessman, another crime branch officer said.Investigators also learnt that Sharma has a notorious past. He was arrested last year for impersonating as an IPS officer and duping an eatery owner of several lakhs of rupees in Madhya Pradesh. Sharma also reportedly cheated a female police officer from Gujarat police by promising to marry her and then scooting off after taking a big amount of money from her.Also Read: Kanjur draws black kites, may threaten aircraft safety while landing: BNHS tells Bombay HC“The accused spend the unlawfully obtained money in his expansive and lavish lifestyle.

Presently he is in police custody.

09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Truck crashes into factory building on MB Road; driver, helper dead||An allegedly speeding truck loaded with iron bars broke a road divider and crashed into a furniture factory at Mehrauli-Badarpur (MB) Road, killing its driver and helper on the spot in the early hours of Friday, police said.A goods carrier tempo was also damaged as the truck hit it before crashing into the factory building. Since the tempo driver or helper was not found at the mishap spot, it was not immediately known whether they were also injured and admitted to a hospital or had fled after the mishap, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena said that iron bars were loaded on the truck at a factory in Okhla Industrial Area. Around 4 am, the truck left for Palwal in Haryana where the iron bars had to be unloaded in a godown. Around 4.30 am, the truck was coming from Ma Anandmayee Marg when the mishap took place.“The truck first broke the road divider, hit the tempo moving on the opposite road, and then crashed into furniture factory building after breaking the boundary wall. The distance between the boundary wall and the factory building is nearly 10 feet,” said Sanjeev Kumar, who was present at the mishap spot while the police and fire department were carrying out a rescue operation.Police said the impact of the crash was such that the entire cabin of the truck was reduced into a mangled heap. The bodies of the driver, Arif Ali, and the helper, Mumtaz Ali Badre, were stuck between the damaged truck and iron bars. The rescue teams took nearly an hour to remove the bodies from the mishap site.“Prime facie, it appears that the truck driver lost control of the vehicle and it led to the mishap. The mechanical experts would examine the vehicle to know if there was any mechanical fault or the truck’s brakes failed,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.Ali and Badre belonged to a village in Hapur in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-truck-crashes-into-factory-building-on-mb-road-driver-helper-dead/story-yGGS2vnWGjfGpUxnBriraM.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Ramlila tradition to pause due to Covid-19? Actors, organisers in despair||Ramlila signifies the victory of good over evil, but is the pandemic really allowing anyone to win over the evil virus? Actors, who have been a regular at Ramlilas in Delhi-NCR, are looking for an answer ahead of Navratri, that is, the time when characters from Ramayana spring to life on various stages set-up across the region, to showcase the dramatic representation of the epic on Rama life. Delhi witnesses hundreds of Ramlilas every year, but this year due to the pandemic, the decision on permissions to allow organisation of these, is still awaited. Some actors are sure that this year they won’t get a chance to perform on the stage, and the thought of parting with the tradition that they have kept intact for decades, is making their heart sink. “I’ve been performing in Ramlilas since I was a child. This tradition runs in our family. My 7-year-old son would dress up as a young Ram, or be a part of Hanuman’s vanar sena,” says Yash Gupta, a member of Shri Ram Janaki Adarsh Kala Manch, which participates in many Ramlilas across the Capital. “The day I would hear that I have to play any part in Ramlila, I would start fasting and give up consumption of non-vegetarian food and alcohol. After wrapping up the festival, I would take my fellow actors to take a dip in the Ganga, to repent for any mistakes we might have committed during our character portrayal. But, sadly, this year we don’t think Ramlilas will be allowed, and hence none of the rest will happen either,” rues Gupta, adding, “But I’m still fasting, like I have been for three decades whenever I’ve played some or the other part in the Ramlila, since my childhood.” In Delhi, where preparations for Ramlilas usually begin months in advance, it’s an eerie silence this time of the year and adding woes to that is the air of uncertainty. “We used to prepare months in advance. It has been a tradition for us to organise Ramlila; humare liye ye shraddha ki baat hai,” says Amritraj Sharma, one who has been essaying the role of Ravana for almost 15 years, in Ramlilas across the city. Since most of the local organisers have either cancelled or are indecisive, Sharma adds, “We were planning to shoot it online, but the budget has been a big constraint this year. Abhi bhi plan hai ki 10-15 minute ki enactment karke we can at least play last year’s Ramlila on a LED screen for say a handful of people simply because we don’t want to break the annual tradition!” Some organisers are opting for a low-scale mythological drama whereas some other committees have suggested staging of the spectacle in an open air set-up, with a cap on the visitors amid Covid-19. The experience, however, won’t be the same, opines Arjun Kumar, secretary, Luv Kush Ramlila Committee, which organises one of the biggest Ramlilas in Old Delhi. He says, “There is definitely disappointment this year. We had hired actors and recorded new songs, but then decided to not organise Ramlila this year because the entire experience of Ramlila is with an audience, and that won’t be in full strength. From food vendors to dancers hundreds of people are associated with our Ramlila each year, so it is a sad news for everyone.” Agreeing that a staggered audience and ample sanitisation measures can’t make it a fulfilling experience, Abhishek Sharma, who has previously portrayed the character of Ram on stage, says, “We are willing to have the Ramlila even with an audience of 500 people, with 6 feet distance between two seats. The focus could be on digital transmission of the Ramlila on TV, with only main actors on stage. Safety measures like sanitisers will also be taken care of. But acha hoga agar hum kar payein, bhale hi chhote scale pe.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallika Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ramlila-tradition-to-pause-due-to-covid-19-actors-organisers-in-despair/story-ilqjoT1zBRpe2f035FFfGK.html

Police said that seven persons were accused, of which five, including two minors, were arrested on Wednesday. The woman’s uncle had alleged that despite being aware of the incident, then SHO of Dhanora police station had not investigated the matter. “Media reports revealed then Dhanora SHO Ramesh Sori had received information about the incident through local sources 15 to 20 days after it took place and he had asked the woman’s family about it. But Sori neither informed his seniors nor took further legal action,” the statement released by Chhhattisgarh government stated. Also Read: UP top court dismisses plea alleging Hathras family illegally heldSori, now posted in Kondagaon Police Lines, was suspended with immediate effect and an enquiry was ordered against him, it said. The woman’s body was exhumed on Wednesday and an autopsy was conducted, it said. A case has been registered under Indian Penal Code sections 365 (kidnapping), 376-D (gang-rape), 306 (abetment of suicide), 506 (criminal intimidation), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 34 (common intention), it added. As per the statement of her family members, on July 19, the girl had attended a wedding with them in the nearby Kanagaon village. The same night, around 11pm, two boys from Kanagaon allegedly dragged her to a nearby forest, where she was sexually assaulted by five others. The next morning, the woman returned home without informing anyone and hanged herself. Her uncle later told reporters that after her death, two boys from the locality told him that she was sexually assaulted by some men in Kanagaon. Just two days after that, Dhanora station house officer (SHO) called him to the police station and asked why he had not reported the matter to police, he claimed. He alleged that the SHO had also assured him he would lodge a case, but took no further action. However, Inspector General Sunderaaj said that after her death, a police team had gone to the village and asked her family members to report the matter. “Recently, her father also attempted to kill himself by consuming poison, but he was saved after receiving timely medical treatment. The exact reason behind his suicide attempt is not known,” Sundarraj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kondagaon-gangrape-sho-suspended-for-not-taking-action/story-8HMGyXvtcAaXBQx4DOM60L.html

These cases, found between June 3 to October 6, were not marked as high risk contacts of a positive case-- which is a common source of Infection, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The case count in Mumbai so far is 222,784, of which 26,383 are active. A senior civic officer from BMC said such cases are not from among the high risk contacts moved to institutional quarantine facilities. They may be low risk contacts who were not identified. At 1,140, most of the 9,420 instances are in K/West ward (Andheri West), followed by G/North ward (Dharavi and Dadar) with 1,040, and T ward in Mulund with 757 cases.Also read: India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 6.9 million mark; active cases further fall below 900,000Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force, said, “This clearly indicates instances of localised transmission in slums, but it is not a cause for concern. The sero survey results have clearly documented that people in Mumbai’s slums who have no contact and were directly screened showed exposure.” Presently, BMC quarantines an average of 13 high risk contacts for every positive case in slums. So far, BMC has institutionally quarantined 125,091 high risk contacts of Covid patients in slums. This is as per data since June 3, updated till October 6. Moreover, so far 31.1 lakh people from slums and chawls, and 10.5 lakh people from non-slums have been quarantined. Last week, results of round two of BMC’s sero survey showed 45% of the people from slums in three wards of the city -- R/North (Dahisar, Borivli), M/West (Chembur), F/North (Dadar, Matunga, Wadala) -- had exposure to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

But this time we have jointly decided that they will not organise the Ramlila for the safety of the people, even though permission has been granted,” Ajay Bhatt, a representative of the Garhwal Ramlila Mandal told ANI. “Earlier it was decided that we would live stream the event on Facebook or Youtube, but due to direct contact while dressing up and makeup, we have decided not to do the same,” Bhatt further said.According to Raghav Rawat, a Ramlila artist, it was more important to stay safe and continue social distancing. “The enthusiasm of artists has dipped now due to the pandemic. Even if we want to host it this year, it is more important that we stay safe. Even one of the artists here who has been associated with this event since his childhood has decided not to host the Ramlila this time,” Rawat said.This year, Navratri will be observed from October 17 to October 25.

09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi should prepare for 15,000 daily Covid-19 cases during winter: Report||Delhi is likely to report around 15,000 Covid-19 cases daily in winter because of the prevalence of respiratory illnesses during this season that worsen symptoms of the disease, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned. More patients with severe symptoms from other states are also expected to come to the national capital for treatment during this period, it has said. At its peak, the seven-day Covid-19 case average was 4119, on September 19. “Winter months that make respiratory illnesses severer...Patients may come from outside Delhi in large numbers… Patients coming from distant areas are likely to be more serious. In addition, with festival-related gatherings, there could be a sudden rise in cases. Therefore, it is recommended that Delhi should prepare for a daily surge of approximately 15,000 positive cases and make arrangements for inpatient admissions of patients with moderate and severe disease roughly amounting to 20% of this surge,” the NCDC said in a document related to the revised Covid-19 strategy for Delhi.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 6.9 million mark; active cases further fall below 900,000The document has been drafted on the basis of the recommendations of an expert group led by Dr V K Paul of Niti Aayog to help formulate a revised strategy for Covid-19 management in Delhi. It has recommended that the Delhi government should engage with community leaders, organisers, etc, to ensure festivals like Durga Puja, Dussehra and Chhath are low key with little or no gathering. The document said containment zones should be limited to places such as resettlement colonies and slums, and contact-tracing activities have to be rationalised and districts should follow leads provided by their own surveillance instead of just chasing targets when it comes to testing. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is relying on these recommendations for fresh Covid-19 management strategy for the Capital. On September 18, lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal asked DDMA to draft a fresh strategy as Delhi witnessed too many ups and downs in the Covid-19 graph since June 26 when a plan was last drafted, said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified. The DDMA is chaired by Baijal and its vice-chairperson is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Dr Paul leads separate advisory committees for both the central government and DDMA. The DDMA is scheduled to draft its strategy and submit it to the L-G by Tuesday next when the next meeting of the authority is scheduled, the senior official said. The official said these recommendations have been submitted to the offices of the L-G, chief minister and chief secretary Vijay Dev and discussed with district magistrates earlier this week. Senior officials in the L-G office did not comment. A Delhi government spokesperson refused to comment on the issue.

Home isolation is observed in densely populated colonies as well. With the number of cases in thousands, the strict monitoring of movement restriction of all cases under home isolation, especially in densely populated areas, is challenging and maybe one of the reasons for the spread of infection.”It has recommended that the guidelines for the selection of cases to be put under home isolation need to be strictly followed and all symptomatic positive cases reported from densely populated areas should be isolated only in Covid care centres to ensure optimal utilisation of these facilities. It added that each home isolation case should be better monitored. On contact tracing, the document suggested the government’s policy can be further “rationalised”. “The contact tracing could be restricted to forward contact tracing only -- immediate family contacts, neighbourhood contacts and close workplace contacts, should be traced and tested as per ICMR guidelines on a priority basis.” It said the government’s current policy on testing was insufficient when it comes to containment zones, and recommended district-wise scaling up of tests and tests based on surveillance findings instead of chasing targets. “Criteria for scaling up of testing should be based on positivity in each district (preferably ward) vis-à-vis the total number of samples tested,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-should-prepare-for-15-000-daily-covid-19-cases-during-winter-report/story-660FGzMDOPNiMybXnAiz6H.html

In an order issued on Wednesday, Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua stated that pending repatriation, illegal immigrants can’t be confined in prisons and deprived of basic human rights and dignity. The court was acting on several petitions on the manner in which detention centres are to be operated in Assam to house illegal immigrants awaiting deportation or adjudication of their claims as Indian citizens. Also read: Gauhati HC notice for Centre, Assam over nod to OIL to drill for oil, gas in national parkAt present, there are six detention centres inside jails in Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Tezpur, Silchar, Jorhat and Dibrugarh in Assam. The state government had informed the assembly in August this year that there are 425 detainees in these centres. A separate detention centre with a capacity to house over 3,000 is being built in Goalpara district. Citing an earlier Supreme Court order, the court held that state governments should set up sufficient number of detention centres outside jail premises and ensure that these places have adequate electricity, water, hygiene and security. “It is noted that even the model manual for detention centres provides that the detention centres be set up outside jail premises. If suitable accommodations are not available, the state government may look for hiring of private buildings for the purpose,” the order read. The court held that a communication by Centre to Assam government in 2018 allowing earmarking of a specific area inside jail premises to house illegal immigrants does not hold water as the move was allowed only as a temporary measure and not for long duration. “It is discernible that more than 10 years have gone by, since a part of the jail premises in Goalpara, Kokrajhar and Silchar had been declared to be detention centres. Certainly a period of over 10 years cannot be understood to be a temporary arrangement. Even in the respect of Jorhat, Dibrugarh and Tezpur, a period of 5 years is almost over which also cannot be strictly said to be a temporary arrangement,” the court held. “Considering the said aspect, it cannot be accepted that the respondents can still rely upon the communication dated 7/9/2018 to project the case that it would be permissible to declare a part of the jail premises to be detention centres,” it added. The court directed the state government to submit an action taken report within October 16, the next date of hearing, on the steps that have been taken to set up detention centres outside jail premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/detention-centres-for-illegal-immigrants-should-be-outside-jails-says-gauhati-high-court/story-E2x47sU3aTEqzFyepBnraM.html

09-10-2020||Environment||Kanjur draws black kites, may threaten aircraft safety while landing: BNHS tells Bombay HC||The expansion of the Kanjurmarg landfill and dumping of municipal solid waste has been attracting thousands of black kites and cattle egrets over the dumpsite posing an air safety threat to flights landing at the Mumbai airport.This is among numerous submissions made in a report by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), a wildlife research body, to the Bombay high court (HC) based on the latter’s directions to evaluate the impact of solid waste management at the landfill on birds and the surrounding ecosystem.According to the report, which HT has reviewed, BNHS also told HC that leachate (liquid by-product when waste gets decomposed) collection ponds close to mangroves within the landfill could spill over during heavy rainfall leading to creek water contamination. Another major submission highlighted that the entire 141-hectare landfill was originally saltpan land thus establishing that it was protected under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) laws contrary to submissions by the then state chief secretary before the Supreme Court (SC) in 2003 that the plot was free of CRZ. BNHS also found mangroves had regenerated within the landfill, and these had not yet been identified or declared as a reserved forest.Also Read: Maharashtra officially declares 328.9 hectare reserved forest at Aarey Colony in MumbaiThe Kanjur landfill, where scientific waste disposal is undertaken, is adjacent to the 1,690 ha Thane creek flamingo sanctuary but has been left out of the proposed eco-sensitive zone (buffer area). Until earlier this year, the sanctuary was spread across 68.5 ha but the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expanded the size of the landfill by acquiring an additional 52.5 ha. This was challenged by Vanashakti before the HC alleging a violation of CRZ norms and safety of the flamingo sanctuary. But the HC allowed the expansion on December 5, 2019, saying BMC had acquired all necessary clearances. Subsequently, the matter was challenged by Vanashakti before the SC. However, the SC in February ultimately directed the HC to close the issue within three months and allowed BMC to commence dumping waste across the entire landfill.On February 26, the HC directed BNHS and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to undertake field visits and submit reports evaluating the impact of waste dumping at the landfill on birds, mangroves, and mudflats. BNHS conducted two site visits – on March 6 and October 1 - along with BMC officials and the local contractor.“During our site visits we observed large concentrations of black kites and cattle egrets roosting on mangroves, the pylons of the transmission lines, and even within the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). The impact of this very large population of kites on smaller birds, lizards, etc within SGNP and on flight safety needs to be studied in greater detail. This is particularly important since the landfill is adjacent to the funnel of flight landing path, and the kites soar and fly in and around the landfill site and their roosting sites along the pylons along the Vashi creek bridge,” said the report.Debi Goenka, an honorary secretary, BNHS, said, “We have done a number of bird strike projects in the past and have a lot of expertise in this area. As mentioned in the report, thousands of birds are roosting there due to food abundantly available with 5,000 tons of garbage lying there at any given time. These birds are flying through the landing cone for aircraft, which is very dangerous when flights are landing. Secondly, these birds are also roosting in SGNP affecting numbers and species diversity of other birds.”BNHS identified the presence of 48 bird species (31 migratory and 17 resident) between October 2018 and February with maximum flamingos (approximately 4,300) in February. “Contaminants from the leachate are known to cause adverse impacts on the condition of birds. However, we have stated in our report that a detailed study is required, including assessment of blood and tissue samples, to determine the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in birds,” said Goenka.The report said that the landfill site was originally salt pan land, and was acquired by BMC for the solid waste management on the basis that it was not within the CRZ. “The data provided by the BMC states that the landfill comprises 141.77 ha land including 65.96 ha non-CRZ area, 52.45 ha CRZ area, and 23.36 ha mangroves (CRZ1A),” it said.The mangroves within the site have been notified as forests and handed over to the forest department as per HC orders. “We were informed that the extent of mangroves within the landfill had increased by approximately 8 to 9 ha along the northeast portion. These additional mangrove areas have not been notified as reserved forests,” the report said.The petitioner said the height of the garbage dump was taller than the Deonar dump. “The fact that an intertidal CRZ1 wetland is being abused, polluted and degraded is something which no authority in the state is willing to take cognisance of,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.According to BMC, the city currently generates 5.400 tons of solid waste apart from biomedical waste (approximately 24 tonnes). Of this, 60% of the waste is sent to Kanjur while the remaining is sent to Deonar. “We will study recommendations by BNHS. Since the matter is sub-judice, I cannot comment on it but we will be submitting our response before the HC if we are asked,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/kanjur-draws-black-kites-may-threaten-aircraft-safety-while-landing-bnhs-tells-bombay-hc/story-4LlblCZzo8yiGo0110n9CK.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Wind speed picks up, AQI improves to ‘moderate’||Delhi’s air quality improved marginally to be in the ‘moderate’ category on Friday morning. The air quality index (AQI) at 8 am was 199, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Air quality enters ‘poor zone’ in 201-300 mark. Delhi’s average AQI was in the poor zone for the past two days; it was 208 on Thursday.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, had on Thursday forecast that the air quality may improve slightly to moderate on Friday because of the wind speed picking up slightly in the morning hours. Also, SAFAR has predicted that the wind direction may shift from north-westerlies (bringing fumes from stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab) to south-easterly around October 11 when further improvement in air quality is expected.Also read: ‘War room’ to keep an eye on air quality launched in DelhiAccording to scientists at the India Meteorological Department, even though the average wind speed is 15-16 kmph during the day, the north-westerly winds bringing in fumes from crop stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab in the northwest region is contributing pollutants in the atmosphere. However, the winds are mostly calm from evening to morning hence, the dispersion is not much. A drop in the night temperature also allows pollutants to settle in the atmosphere. On Thursday, the minimum temperature settled at 19.1 degrees C, two notches below normal while maximum settled at 35.6 degrees C, two notches above normal. “The air quality may improve slightly on October 11-12 because of thunderous developments likely in the region. The wind direction will also change to south-easterly during this time. However, this pattern will again change from October 15, with a return of northwesterlies and a dip in both the night and day temperatures,” said an IMD scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wind-speed-picks-up-aqi-improves-to-moderate/story-UmViM0qr49oYRAI8ASFRnJ.html

09-10-2020||Lucknow||God chose this job for me, says man who cremated over 700 Covid victims||A sanitation worker by profession, 35-year old Munna works at the Baikunth Dham electric crematorium in Lucknow and has conducted the last rites of over 700 Covid victims during the last six months.When most workers were scared of handling bodies of Covid victims, he was the first one to come forward for the last rites of the infected bodies, said Dilip Dey, zonal officer, Lucknow municipal corporation (LMC).“Since April, he has cremated over 700 Covid victims. Munna and his team have also not taken a single day’s leave in this period. The Baikunth Dham electric crematorium receives 12 to 17 bodies every day, even from outside Lucknow. Each cremation takes around 45 minutes. So, the staff works till 8pm,” he said.“We trained Munna and two other staff members on how to handle Covid bodies and use PPE kits. We also advised them to remain polite and humane towards everyone coming with Covid victims’ bodies,” added Dey.Munna said, “It’s a job, which God has chosen for me and I am not ashamed of it. I am cremating those who died from Covid at a time, when people are maintaining distance from each other.”“I am a high school pass-out, so I understand the difference between bacteria and virus. Despite the risks involved, I decided to conduct the last rites of Covid victims because my family members always told me that it is the only way to make a contribution to society,” he said.He added that he is prepared to go the extra mile to respect the sentiments of the bereaved families, often running a grave risk to his own health.“As per Hindu rituals, every family member wants to see the face of the deceased family member. But in case of a Covid death, opening of the cover is not allowed. But I usually take the risk of showing the face of the victim to family members when the body is pushed into the incinerator. But I take full precautions as I too have a family back home.”Munna said he felt sad when people didn’t recognize his contribution to the fight against Covid.“They think a sanitation worker is destined to do this. Sometimes, people even abuse us when we ask them to wait for their turn for cremation. But we never lose our temper as we are trained to handle their anger.”Also Read: Odisha to provide financial assistance to kin of deceased Covid warriors from CM’s relief fund“I put on my first PPE kit at 6am, when the first body is brought here and change it twice till 8pm.

Usually, I keep having water to hydrate myself as we cremate 12 to 17 bodies every day,” he added.Munna said his wife lives with his father, mother, brother and sister in Jankipuram. “I don’t want my family members to get infected, so I stay at the crematorium ground 24x7.

Tweeting about it, Tejasvi Surya, national president of BJP Yuva Morcha and a MP from Bengaluru South Lok Sabha constituency, said late on Thursday, “Mamata’s police officers at Jarasanko Police Station have manhandled three Members of Parliament who had gone to file an FIR. MPs @NisithPramanik, @JyotirmayBJP and I will move breach of privilege motion against these errant and arrogant officials.” Also read: BJP workers clash with police during march to state secretariat; pistol seized“We waited for more than 2 hours, well into midnight, for police to register FIR upon our complaint. They instead manhandled 3 Members of Parliament. We will file a motion for breach of privilege & teach Mamata’s police a lesson in constitutional propriety,” Surya tweeted on Friday morning. Hundreds of workers of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) were stopped by the police on Thursday afternoon, when they were proceeding towards the state secretariat, violating prohibitory orders in place. The ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (March to Nabanna), led by top BJP leaders, including Surya, was organised in protest against issues ranging from alleged lack of employment opportunities in Bengal to law and order problems. A clash ensued and police had to use water cannons and resort to lathi charge. A statement issued by state chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay late on Thursday said, “A political party had asked for permission for Nabanna Abhijan. The state government gave them a written reply that this would go against the Supreme Court’s judgement on protests in public places, would be in violation of the NDMA Act and also that the area under Nabanna has Sec 144. The Police showed restraint despite violent provocations. We have recovered firearms. Several policemen have been injured.” Meanwhile the BJP’s Bengal unit will take out a silent procession in Kolkata on Friday afternoon as a mark of protest against alleged police high-handedness during its rally on Thursday. The party has alleged that 1,500 people, including several leaders, were injured. “The silent march would be led by Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. It would start around 4.30 pm from the state BJP headquarters in central Kolkata,” said a senior party leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-nabanna-march-3-party-mps-likely-to-move-breach-of-privilege-motion-against-3-bengal-cops/story-unf6swnSuqkZ3vUqcmmS8L.html

09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Two suspected criminals held after gunfight; second such operation on same day||Nearly 19 hours after four men wanted in several crimes were arrested by Delhi Police’s special cell team after 50 bullets were exchanged in Rohini, a similar gunfight in south Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar led to the arrest of two men with criminal history late Thursday night. Both of them suffered gunshot injuries in their legs and were admitted to a hospital for treatment, police said. One of the arrested persons, identified as Karamvir alias Kala, was allegedly involved in several murder cases and there was a reward of Rs one lakh on his arrest, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah. On Thursday evening, the police received information about the movement of two suspected criminals in Ambedkar Nagar area. Police then zeroed in on the Devli crossing bus stop. Accordingly, a trap was laid and an exchange of fire took place when the two men were asked to surrender, they said. “During the gunfight, Karamvir alias Kala,30, from Delhi’s Kanjhawala suffered two bullet injuries in his legs. He is a dreaded criminal carrying a reward of Rs one lakh and involved in multiple murders. His associate Vikas,21, from Haryana’s Bahadurgarh, also suffered a gunshot injury in his leg. They were arrested and moved to Safdarjung hospital,” said DCP Kushwah. According to Kushwah, a total of 11 rounds were fired. The two suspects fired five rounds and the police fired the remaining in retaliation and self-defence. Two sophisticated pistols and the car in which the two men were travelling have been seized, the DCP added. Thursday night’s encounter was the fourth such operation wherein bullets were exchanged between the police and suspects, ending with the arrest of the suspects. Around 3.30 am on Thursday, four persons wanted for murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Delhi and Haryana were caught after a shootout in Rohini. The four suspects allegedly fired 21 rounds while 28 bullets were fired by the raiding team. All four suspects suffered bullets in their legs. Five days ago, the special cell had arrested two alleged gangsters after a shootout. Both men were shot in their legs. On September 28, police had arrested another alleged criminal in Delhi after an exchange of fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-two-suspected-criminals-held-after-gunfight-second-such-operation-on-same-day/story-YNcSNQsjaRAuBvJeyIAhVL.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi may witness surge of 15k Covid-19 cases per day in winters: Centre||A report prepared by the National Control for Disease Control (NCDC) has cautioned that the national Capital needs to gear up to tackle the surge of 15,000 Covid-19 cases per day in upcoming winters and festivals.The report has highlighted three reasons to worry that may cause excessive pressure on healthcare services. (i) winter months that make respiratory illnesses severer; (ii) patients may come from outside Delhi in large numbers; (iii) patients coming from distant areas are likely to be more serious. In addition, with festival-related gatherings, there could be a sudden rise in cases.The report has been drafted by the NCDC under the supervision of Dr VK Paul, Chairman of NITI Aayog Member (Health).The report has recommended that the Delhi government should get prepared for a daily surge of about 15,000 positive coronavirus cases and make arrangements for inpatient admissions of patients with moderate and severe disease roughly amounting to 20 percent of this surge.“The guidelines for relative proportion for ICU, non-ICU beds, Covid care isolation beds should be according to the guidelines provided in the 3rd report of Empowered Group I,” the report has said.The report has talked about the prevention of infection among health care workers.“Till date about 2324 of healthcare workers have been affected due to Covid19 in Delhi of which 23 percent are doctors, 34 percent are nurses, 15 percent are paramedics, 18 percent are group D staff and 10 percent others. A total of 75 deaths are reported in healthcare workers of which 14 are of doctors which may be under reported. The increasing mortality in HCW and doctors is detrimental to maintaining the morale of these Covid warriors. Hence all efforts should be undertaken to prevent the Health Care-associated infection in all the hospitals, labs and field workers engaged in an active survey in the containment zone.”The report has highlighted to implement non-pharmaceutical measures and Covid appropriate behavior like focus on masks, physical distancing and hygiene. Launch a massive campaign for 100 per cent compliance with masks. This would be the single most important measure to prevent the spread of virus going forward. A two-fold strategy, persuasion and enforcement - should be followed, it said.The NCDC in its ‘Revised Strategy for control of Covid-19 version 3.0’ has noted that contact tracing strategy needs to be more rationalized.According to the report, Delhi has reported a total of 5,401 deaths till date. It has mentioned that the average daily mortality reported ranges between 30 to 40 from 15 September onwards. The higher mortality in the co-morbid (66.6 per cent) and elderly is inevitable and reported all over states and globally.The NCDC has pointed out that Delhi needs to reduce mortality to the extent possible should be one of the key objectives of managing the pandemic as the overall Covid-19 case fatality rate in Delhi is 1.9 per cent which is higher than the national average of 1.5 per cent.The report has recommended to take measures to minimize gatherings during coming festivals.“Large gatherings are super-spreading events. These must be avoided. Coming festivals (Chhat, Puja, Dussehra, Deepavali, Id, Xmas, New year) pose a huge challenge in pandemic control. It has been seen that Onam in Kerala and Ganesh Chaturthi in Maharashtra escalated the pandemic seriously. This must not be allowed to happen in Delhi. Our emerging gains in reduction in cases will be reversed because of these festivities and the rush in markets/localities. Such a setback that is potentially avoidable will dent the image of the capital and the country,” it said adding that the next 3 months are crucial in our battle with coronavirus.The NCDC report has recommended that the Delhi government to make awareness among people to develop a consensus to have these festivals with little / no gatherings.The NCDC’s report has also recommended conducting a sero-survey which can be tentatively planned during the 1st week of November.The NCDC has opined the Delhi government to focus on vulnerable populations that are elderly, co-morbid patients and recommended a periodic review of the triage facilities and training need assessment for medical staff to triage the patients as per the severity of illness and risk assessment for selection of facility.

Later, a friend told me that this train ferries hundreds of cancer patients to Bikaner for subsidised treatment. I was moved and was already aware of the malpractices used to increase farm yield. So, I decided to educate farmers on the benefits of organic farming,” he said.Riding on his bicycle since April last year, Prajapati was recently on a trip to Ambala where he met a sugarcane researcher in the city and some progressive farmers in Panjokhara to discuss ideas on organic soap manufacturing. He was also felicitated by an NGO in Ambala Cantonment.Prajapati said he meets researchers, scientists and experts on organic farming during his trip to a particular region and then takes these new techniques to the farmers in various villages.“I listen to the issues of farmers and then discuss those with experts to find a solution. My mission was halted for a few months due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown but now things are getting back on track,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-s-bicycle-man-on-mission-to-spread-word-on-organic-farming/story-O8OCZTRK8XSwPPAAMGkPgM.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police accuse Republic TV in ‘TRP scam’||The Mumbai Police said on Thursday that they unearthed a “major racket” of gaming television rating points, or TRPs, by at least three channels, including Republic TV, and arrested four people, contending that the manipulated audience numbers were crucial because they directly translated into advertising revenue.The action provoked an instant denial from Republic TV, which claimed it was being targeted for its coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput case, and added that it would sue the police.“We found some channels were paying former Hansa research group employees -- contracted by BARC to carry out the research. They, in turn, were paying certain households to keep certain channels like Republic switched on to show higher TRPs,” Mumbai’s police commissioner Param Bir Singh said, adding that apart from Republic, Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema were also found to be gaming the system.BARC stands for Broadcast Audience Research Council.The revelations by the commissioner at a press conference set off a storm, with an angry denial from Republic’s managing director and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and triumphalist tweets by anchors working at the channel’s rivals.According to the latest TRP ratings, Republic is the most watched English language news channel. The police said Hansa and BARC complained after they spotted “unusual trends” in viewership.Following this, the police arrested Sanjiv Rao, found ₹20 lakh in his bank account and ₹8.5 lakh from his locker, which they contended was being paid to some households to keep certain channels on.“In some cases, people who did not understand English were keeping English channels like Republic on through the day,” Singh added. Some channels paid households as much as ₹500 a day, the police said.Republic responded in its statement that it would “file a criminal defamation case against Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh”.It added: “There is not a single BARC report which mentions Republic TV. The people of India know the truth. Mr. Param Bir Singh’s investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case is under cloud and this is a desperate measure because of the Republic TV’s reportage on Palghar, the Sushant Singh Rajput case or any other case. This kind of targeting only strengthens the resolve of everyone at Republic TV to push for the truth even harder. Param Bir Singh stands completely exposed today. Since BARC has not mentioned Republic in any single complaint, he should issue an official apology and get ready to face us in court.”In a monologue on both Republic TV and Hindi channel Republic Bharat, an emotionally charged Goswami called the investigation a witch hunt, naming both Param Bir Singh and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, among other political leaders.The press conference and Republic’s reactions also set off a chain of political reactions.“Free press is a defining feature of our democracy and a cherished ideal of the Constitution. Trampling on media freedom will not be tolerated by people of India. Targeting of the media by #Congress and its allies is against all principles of democracy and is unacceptable,” Union minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted.“BJP knows very well that a blow on one of the four pillars of India’s democracy is enough to push the rest into a tumble. The blatant & shameless attack on press freedom is to achieve this objective. Citizens, be aware be alert, we have a duty towards our democracy,” the Congress party said in a tweet.It also attached a video that showed Javadekar stressing the need for media to self-regulate effectively.Shiv Sena MLC Manisha Kayande said it was shocking and surprising to see that some news channels were stooping to such levels just to increase their TRPs. “Police should reach the root of this and find out the mastermind. This episode has tarnished the image of the Institution of journalism, which is considered the fourth pillar of democracy,” she said.State home minister Anil Deshmukh said action will be taken against the channels and their heads as per law.“The investigation in the case is underway and action against the chiefs of the channels will be taken as per law. Police have asked for more clarification on a few things from the channels. There is no question of budging before any pressure. Investigation is underway and more details are expected to come out in the fake TRP case. It is a case of very serious violation for the sake of advertisement and revenue and action needs to be taken. We are not acting out of vengeance though a few channels have been constantly taking an anti-Maharashtra stand,” he told Marathi channel ABP Majha.BJP’s Keshav Upadhye said the police should investigate the matter, but not act with bias and hound people unnecessarily. “There are several other extremely important issues, like the rising crime against women in Maharashtra, which need to be urgently addressed,” he said.Those arrested are Vishal Bhandari, 20, a former employee of Hansa Research Private Limited, a contractor of BARC, and his current employer, Bompalli Rao Mistry alias Konda Palli alias Sanjiv Rao, 45.Bhandari in his statement to police said it was an old modus operandi to pay households where the meters used to record viewership were installed to keep certain channels on, helping fraudulently enhance ratings.TRPs are the basis on which media planners decide which channels to advertise in; Singh said in the conference that the “money earned through ads by the channels using fake TRPs will be treated as proceeds of the crime”.During interrogation Bhandari also revealed the name of Republic TV, police said.Singh said further investigation revealed names of Shirish Shetty, owner of Fakt Marathi channel, and Narayan Sharma, owner of Box Cinema. Both were arrested on Thursday.According to Hansa Research, approximately 30,000 BARC meters are installed in various parts of India to monitor various programmes and channels, and based on the statistical metrics, ratings are awarded to channels. Advertisers pay the channels at the rates fixed on the basis of the ratings.“This is with reference to the media reports regarding TRP ratings being manipulated. Hansa Research and BARC conducted an investigation into the matter over the last few weeks, the conclusion of which resulted in Hansa Research filing an FIR against an ex-employee who was engaged in some wrongdoing. We will continue to cooperate with BARC and with the authorities as and when called upon to do so,” said Praveen Nijhara, CEO, Hansa Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-accuse-republic-tv-in-trp-scam/story-o9QWFLMcdccLxWfNcejeuJ.html
09-10-2020||City||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, mental health helpline launched by Mumbai civic body gets 16K calls||The mental health helpline number, launched in April by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has received 16,703 calls from the city from April to September, with anxiety over socio-economic issues topping the list. Backed by Aditya Birla Education Trust, the toll-free helpline M-Power —1800-120-820050 – has been receiving almost 100 calls a day in the past six months. Currently, it receives around 35 calls per day from Mumbai. Most of these calls are regarding anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, adjustment issues and relationship issues, among others. Mental health experts said the lockdown has left thousands of people jobless, women being pressured to get married, couples with adjustment issues after staying with their spouses 24x7, additional pressure at work and students concerned about their future. Ahead of World Mental Health Day on October 10, Dilshad Khurana, head counsellor of the helpline told HT, “We get most calls from those in the age group of 26 to 40. Their main concern is job loss and adjustment issues with families and spouses in the lockdown.” Almost 70% callers are men and 30% women. The helpline gets the highest number of calls between 3pm and 8pm. Unlike earlier, the concern about the Covid-19 infection has decreased among people. “Till May, we used to get a large number of panicking callers who were scared of the virus. If their neighbour or relative got infected, they would get worried. People used to believe false forwards on social media. Now, as people are more informed, we have stopped getting such callers,” she said. In April, the helpline received 11,932, which dropped to 1,879 calls in May, 971 in June, 671 in July and 600 in August. In September, the number rose a little to 650. “When the helpline was launched, we were receiving calls from people seeking ration or beds. Many of the calls weren’t related to mental health, so the number was higher initially,” she added. “People are tired of staying at home. Also, the negative and fake news circulated on social media worsens the mental health. Many young people are taking out their anger through bad behaviour at home, which further increases the tension at home,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, a city-based psychiatrist. In recent times, the helpline has started getting more calls regarding domestic violence. “We provide initial distress counselling before referring them to police,” said Khurana. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday laid emphasis on the need to invest more towards mental health. “Spending 2% of the national health budgets on mental health is not enough. International sponsors also need to do more. Mental health still receives less than 1% of international aid earmarked for health,” read a recent study conducted by WHO across 130 countries, including India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-19-pandemic-health-helpline-launched-by-mumbai-civic-body-gets-16k-calls/story-aCKOcTATb1TUbYchgeMqHP.html
09-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administrator asks education secretary to discuss physical school attendance with parents||In Thursday’s war room meeting, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the education secretary, Sarpreet Singh Gill, to hold talks with parents over physical attendance of students in schools.This comes after the Union ministry of home affairs as per Unlock 5.0 gave a go ahead for schools to open for academic consultations for students of classes below 9.Currently, the consultations are being held for students of Class 9 and above with the mandatory consent form from parents. While the government schools have 1,500 to 2,000 students attending, the numbers are not as encouraging in private schools. Attendance is not compulsory and online teaching is still on.Director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We had instructed the principals of government schools to hold online parent-teacher meets to discuss the idea with the parents. They have also been asked to provide data regarding attendance since September 21, which is being collated.”The final decision to partially open schools from October 15 for the rest of the classes will be taken by the Chandigarh administration after determining how many parents agree to the arrangement and after monitoring the Covid situation in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administrator-asks-education-secretary-to-discuss-physical-school-attendance-with-parents/story-mVQofve4PASvK2xYleFQkI.html

09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt won’t paste posters outside Covid-19 patients’ houses||The Delhi administration on Thursday decided to stop putting up posters at the houses of people who are under home isolation after contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with officials saying they recognised the unnecessary stigma associated with the pathogen, and were confident the doing away with the measure would encourage more people to get tested.District officials have been asked to remove posters from outside the residences of Covid-19 patients currently under home isolation – 12,890 individuals, according to Thursday’s health bulletin. Monitoring of each home isolation patient, however, will continue as usual, a government official said.The decision was given the final go-ahead in Tuesday’s meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. Chief secretary Vijay Dev on Wednesday communicated the directions to all district magistrates and chief surveillance officials in 11 revenue districts, a second government official said.“At this point, people are quite aware of Covid-19. We have intensified our awareness drives. The decision to do away with posters is aimed at reducing hesitation among people. It happens because there is a stigma attached to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Dev told HT. “This move should improve the efficiency of the government’s strategy to fight Covid-19 and break the chain of transmission sooner. The monitoring of each home isolation patient would continue but there will be no posters,” he added.On the government’s decision, Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot said: “There is a stigma with the coronavirus disease and posters outside the house amplifies that. By doing away with this, we aim at increased testing. We want more people to get themselves tested without thinking of stigmas.”The posters that are put up outside the houses of people under home isolation mention the house number of the patient, the date on which the individual tested positive, and the date when the home isolation is supposed to end. The posters carry a disclosure that there is a Covid-19 patient in the house. In effect, they allowed people in the vicinity to ensure their own safety and encouraged them to monitor whether the patient was violating isolation rules.But there have also been reports that it has led to social stigma in some neighbourhoods.“The home isolation facility is a great initiative in Covid-19 management. But people in my neighbourhood did discriminate against me and I was left out of resident welfare meetings, people would avoid having conversations, etc. That is unscientific. Doing away with the posters can help several patients from that – at least in a symbolic way,” said a patient who recovered from Covid-19 on July 28 at his residence in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar. On September 30, the Delhi high court sought the Delhi government’s response on a petition filed by an advocate that sought the practice of pasting such posters be done away with by citing the right to protect a person’s privacy.“The government has come across cases in which people hesitated to get tested for Covid-19 fearing stigmatisation. And later the symptoms turned severe. Some of such patients were hospitalised. This is why this step was necessary,” said a second senior government official who asked not to be named.Delhi on Thursday recorded 2,726 new Covid-19 cases, taking cumulative infections in the city to 300,833 so far. The total number of fatalities linked to the viral illness in the city is 5,653. About 53,322 tests were conducted in the previous 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 5.11%, according to data by the Delhi government. Experts welcomed the decision.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “It is a welcome move. Such posters were leading to widespread discrimination of Covid-19 patients. It is the responsibility of the state to protect individuals from such discrimination. Cases can be monitored as efficiently without such posters. Among people in home isolation, awareness about Covid-19 should come from within. Awareness drives and community engagement on part of the government can play a major role.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-won-t-paste-posters-outside-patients-houses/story-KZpcd3U8id0ZrEq2xmfCTI.html
09-10-2020||City||Veteran Marathi actor Avinash Kharshikar passes away at 68||Veteran Marathi actor Avinash Kharshikar passed away on Thursday morning after suffering a massive heart attack around 10.30am in Thane. He was 68 years old. The actor, who has done more than 500 plays and several films, was known for his striking personality and comic roles in a career that spanned over four decades. Kharshikar suffered a fatal heart attack at his home in Ghodbunder, Thane after which he was taken to Bethany Hospital where he died during treatment. His daughter Apurva Shinde confirmed the news about his death. The family performed his last rites at Jawahar Baug Crematorium. “My father had undergone a leg surgery two years ago. Since January this year, he suffered from liver issues, for which he was admitted to hospital for almost a month, and had recovered. On Thursday, while having tea with my mother, he started perspiring. My mother checked his oxygen levels and then called our family doctor who suggested we take him to the hospital,” Shinde told Hindustan Times.At the hospital, the doctors informed Kharshikar’s family that he had suffered a heart attack and has succumbed. His last rites were performed in the presence of close family and friends at Jawahar Baugh Crematorium in Thane. A former resident of Dadar, Kharshikar had started his career in Marathi films in 1978, with a role in the movie ‘Bandiwan Mi Ya Sansari’. He later went on to earn roles in other films like ‘Aai Thor Tujhe Upkar’, ‘Lapwa Chapavi’ and ‘Maficha Sakshida’.The actor also made a name for himself on the Marathi stage, with roles in plays like ‘Saujanyachi Aishi Taishi’, ‘Apradh Mich Kela’, ‘Vasuchi Sasu’. He had also acted in the television serial ‘Damini’. Recalling a recent conversation Kharshikar had with his family, Milind Shinde, his son-in-law said that he wanted to drive through the new Atal tunnel to Leh-Ladhak next year. “Two days ago, he came to meet us and had fun with his grandchildren. His health was fine, and he discussed with us his plans to drive through the tunnel next year. His death came as a shock,” said Milind. Uday Sabnis, actor and dubbing artist, said that Kharshikar played an important role in documenting Marathi plays. “Kharshikar was instrumental in documenting old and well-known Marathi plays. Because of him, we can watch these plays on television. I worked with him on Damini a few years ago, and despite being younger to him, I played the role of his father. He had an attractive personality and was known for his comic timing,” said Sabnis. Marathi film director, Viju Mane said, “We were constantly in contact for over two years, and used to talk once a week. He was a great actor who had acted in more than 500 plays. I have seen him since my childhood, and working with him was a dream come true. On Monday, we had a long chat over serials and movies. We were going to shoot an advertisement in the next week. He has few future work plans like making a web series with new actors from Thane. His documentation of old plays was also underway but was paused due to the pandemic. He had planned to restart the work next month,” said Mane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/veteran-marathi-actor-avinash-kharshikar-passes-away-at-68/story-CDS3YW1Dqi3O47cM2F7f3L.html
09-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to approach Centre to expedite upgrade of GMSH to college||In a bid to speed up the process of upgrading the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 to a medical college, the UT administration will take up the matter with the central government.The administration had, in January this year, announced its intent to create a medical college at GMSH. A proposal in this regard had been prepared and sent to the Centre as well as the Medical Council of India. The pandemic, however, led to delays.On Thursday, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, in the war room meeting, said the proposal for the city’s second medical college, which had already been sent, needed to be expedited. UT adviser Manoj Parida added that he would take up the matter with the Medical Council of India at the earliest.The new medical college is proposed to have two branches—one at GMSH-16 and another at Sarangpur. The exact site for a campus in Sarangpur is yet to be demarcated, but the UT health department has requested around 15 acre land for the purpose.With land obtained free of cost from the administration, total cost of the project will be limited to constructions costs. Medical and health facilities at GMSH will be utilised for the college. Additional infrastructure in the existing compound may also be created on spare land. Rest of the infrastructure required for running the college such as office spaces will come up at Sarangpur.The upgraded GMSH-16 will offer at least 50 MBBS seats, and an additional 50 after the projects takes off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-to-approach-centre-to-expedite-upgrade-of-gmsh-to-college/story-AsJMS87GowZ4xej4wn38pJ.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra nears 1.5 million Covid cases||Maharashtra on Thursday inched closer to 1.5 million Covid-19 cases after reporting 13,395 new infections, taking the count to 1,493,884. The plateauing trend of cases over the past few weeks has also led to a further fall in active cases to 241,986, accounting for 16.19% of the state’s total.The state is likely to breach the 1.5 million cases marks eight days after crossing the 1.4 million mark on October 1. The state will also complete over 500,000 cases in 28 days after crossing 1 million infections on September 11.On Thursday, the toll climbed up to 39,430 after 358 casualties were reported, of which, 187 were reported in the past 48 hours, another 55 were from the past week, while the remaining 116 were from the period before that, health officials said.The state has continued to record comparatively fewer fresh infections, as in the past eight days. Between October 1 and October 8, 110,592 cases were recorded. The number was 150,920 in the corresponding period last month (September), indicating the situation is getting a little better than the previous month, following a fall in the infection rate.However, officials said the state is still testing less than its full capacity. “The situation is improving, but we are also not testing enough. Our average per day testing is somewhere around 80,000-90,000 tests a day, which is not even 60% of the target set by the state. Unless and until we do not utilise full testing capacity and even then, if the rate of infection remains unchanged, it is difficult to say that the situation will not reverse in the coming future,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Last month, the state government had set a target to increase daily Covid testing to 1.5 lakh a day from the current average, but there has been no progress on that front.In the last eight days (since October 1), 619,026 tests were conducted and its per day average comes to only 77,378 tests, which is almost half the state’s target.“One of the problems behind less testing the officials pointed out is contact tracing. Despite the state’s directives on aggressive tracing, the authorities have yet to increase contact tracing. The spread can be reduced only if we could trace maximum people behind one patient,” said another official, wishing not to be named.On Thursday, the state conducted 80,043 tests. Total tests conducted till date are 7,404,231. The positivity rate recorded was 20.18%.Mumbai continues to report the highest number of cases across the state as it recorded 2,823 cases. It also recorded its second-highest single day spike on Thursday, pushing its tally to 222,784. Of them, active cases are 26,383. The city also recorded 48 deaths.The scenario in Mumbai has changed from September, when daily cases in the city kept going up. On Wednesday, the city recorded its highest single-day spike of 2,848 cases.Pune city continues to contribute second-highest infections, in terms of daily caseload, as it recorded 808 cases, taking its tally to 162,904, while Pune district became the third-highest contributor with 636 cases, pushing its count to 67,902. The combined total of Pune comes to 1,444 cases.Despite a decline in cases, Covid-19 casualties are not reducing. Maharashtra still has the highest number of casualties across the country.On Thursday, the state’s CFR was recorded at 2.64%, making it second after Punjab. The CFR of Punjab was 3.07% (with 3,712 deaths) till Wednesday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.The number of recovered patients also reached 1,196,441 as 15,575 patients recovered in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate was recorded at 81.13%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-nears-1-5-million-covid-cases/story-UESBm3WLN6pCUyRktuwv1O.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra officially declares 328.9 hectare reserved forest at Aarey Colony in Mumbai||The Maharashtra government on Thursday issued approval for the preliminary notification and declaration of reserved forest across 328.9 hectares (ha) at Aarey Colony, Goregaon, the state environment and forest ministries both said.This means 25.5% of the entire green lung (1,287ha) has been declared as reserved forest and would be later handed over to the forest department’s control as a part of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SNGP). The area declared forest is also three times the size of what was excluded (165ha) from Aarey within the protected buffer zone of SGNP in December 2016.Forest minister Sanjay Rathod approved the final proposal on Thursday, jointly developed by the state’s dairy and forest department, demarcating 288.43 ha (under the dairy department) and 40.46 ha (under the forest department) as reserved forest. “As directed by the chief minister and environment minister, an overall area declared as reserved forest under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927 stands at 328.9 ha, including the 40.46 ha originally proposed for a zoo,” said Rathod adding, “Now, the process will commence to declare this entire are under section 20 of the IFA. Subsequently, the entire area will become part of SGNP.”The gazette notification will be published over the next two to three days, said Rathod.According to the preliminary notification, a forest settlement officer, Konkan, would survey the area assessing rights of local residents, nature and scope of the land. This will be followed by suggestions and objections pertaining to land rights, and appeals can be made before the Mumbai suburban collector.Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister said, “Our intention is to ensure all tribal (adivasi) people’s rights within Aarey are protected. Over the next nine months, the administrative procedure to assess suggestions and objections will be undertaken before the final notification under section 20 of the IFA is published. Meanwhile, we have ensured that the entire area covered under dense tree cover is notified as reserved forest. There are additional areas such as open grasslands that would continue to maintain its status as no-development zones. Additionally, all roads, built-up structures, cowsheds, and proposed infrastructure projects within Aarey have been left out of the area demarcated as forest.”Since November 2014, Aarey Colony has been a bone of contention ever since proposals for infrastructure projects were proposed by the state. Citizens and environmentalists had been at loggerheads with the Maharashtra government opposing the construction of a Metro car shed, while demanding overall protection of Aarey as a forest, claiming it was one of the last green lungs in Mumbai and home to a large biodiversity of flora and fauna. Recurrent petitions before courts were rejected until chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on September 2 instructed concerned state bodies to declare a large section of Aarey as a forest.HT had on September 26 reported details from an unsigned draft of the final proposal (which was approved on Thursday) along with a map of the proposed green zone. The reserved forest area encompasses 107 land parcels from Aarey (111.3 ha), Goregaon (71.6 ha), Maroshi (146 ha including area allotted originally for) villages under Andheri and Borivali talukas in Mumbai suburbs. Forest secretary Milind Mhaiskar had said a 90-ha area earlier slotted for an encroachment rehabilitation project (ERP) was included in the reserved forest plan as it had rich biodiversity and it was not feasible to shift people there. “The ERP will still be constructed in Aarey but along the periphery away from the present site,” he said. Once the land is handed over to SGNP, the national park’s total area will increase to 106.5 sq km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-officially-declares-328-9-hectare-reserved-forest-at-aarey-colony-in-mumbai/story-WfzJDKJliRQPQEOkoDQ2DJ.html

According to police, Nepalese citizens enter India without any proof and don’t register with the police. Therefore, for their verification, police have to write to the Nepal government through the Union home ministry, which is a tedious process. Besides, Indian police cannot go to Nepal directly to arrest the accused in case they flee back by crossing the border.ALSO READ: Nepalese help, accomplices steal cash, jewellery from Ludhiana housePolice commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said domestic help from Nepal should not be hired without a strong reference. He advised that employers retain their workers’ Citizenship Card issued by the Nepal Government and also click their photographs as soon as they join a new job. Stating that most of the crimes by domestic helps were executed within the first 10 days of joining, the police chief cautioned residents against keeping valuables at home and recommended use of bank lockers for safe keeping.“Hiring helps through reputed agencies ensures that their background checks have been conducted. Also, get their police verification done as soon as possible. There have been multiple instances where the house owners did not even have a photograph of their servants. Submit a duly filled form with a recent photograph for police verification,” he said.The top cop also advised installation of CCTV cameras and other security gadgets, especially in places where domestic helps worked alone for long hours. “Also, try and ensure that the workers are not aware of such electronic monitoring. Besides, people should avoid displaying money and other valuables in front of maids,” he added.The police chief added that with the cooperation of the employers and neighbours, such crimes can be better prevented. On February 12, 2020, an attempt by a domestic help and his three accomplices to sedate a Model Town Extension family and rob them was foiled by alert neighbours. The year before also saw at least nine such thefts and robberies by domestic helps between May and November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nepalese-helps-get-away-easily-verification-paramount-ludhiana-police/story-2ubPYDONKig1OSfTSTjMXM.html
09-10-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University Teachers’ Association elections: 80% polling recorded on Day 1||As many as 400 faculty members cast their votes on the first day of polling to elect the new Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) team.In view of the pandemic, polling is taking place in a staggered manner over two days.On Thursday, 505 teachers of over 70 teaching departments were scheduled to vote at two venues in four time slots. Returning officer Vijay Nagpal said 400 teachers voted, making it a turnout of around 80%. As many as 122 teachers of three institutes — chemical engineering, engineering and technology, and hotel and tourism management — are to vote at the English department auditorium from 9am to 1pm on Friday.Those who missed out on Thursday can also cast their vote on Friday, with the returning officer’s permission. Last year, the elections had witnessed 95% turnout.The counting of votes will be conducted at 1:30pm on Friday, which will be followed by the declaration of results. An annual general body meeting of PUTA will take place at 3:30pm.The elections were earlier scheduled on September 25 and 26, but were postponed after several teachers raised concerns over polling being held during a pandemic. The new dates were finalised after taking Chandigarh deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar’s permission.During the polling on Thursday, a controversy had erupted over one vote, after it was reported that a ballot paper was taken out of the polling station. The issue was later “resolved amicably”, said the returning officer.Otherwise, polling went off smoothly, with booths being sanitised at regular intervals.The incumbent president, Rajesh Gill, said: “We are happy that finally the elections are being conducted. We have tried our best to stand by our democratic system. Teachers in good numbers cast their votes on the first day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-teachers-association-elections-80-polling-recorded-on-day-1/story-INK3FIe0qHcttZ435nMUNK.html

Boxer, bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, have very strong jaws, and a powerful bite, ideal for hanging on to large prey.The girl immediately made a call to her father, Gurbir Singh, who arrived at the spot and informed police. Meanwhile, the girl was rushed to a private hospital by other family members.After receiving information, a police control room van reached the spot, and the victim’s father demanded registration of a case against the dog owner.“The victim’s statement has been recorded. We have booked the dog owner under Section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said inspector Rajnish Choudhary, station house officer, Phase 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pet-dog-bites-off-9-yr-old-girl-s-ear-lobe-in-mohali-s-phase-9-market/story-WUogKMRNUwa0cboKfoBPBN.html
09-10-2020||Chandigarh||Nepalese help, accomplices steal cash, jewellery from Ludhiana house||Hired two months ago, a Nepalese domestic help, along with his two accomplices, stole cash and gold jewellery after sedating an elderly couple in their 70s in the city’s posh Gurdev Nagar locality on Wednesday night. The accused, Khem Bahadur, also sedated the security guard of the house and another 11-year-old domestic help before fleeing with the booty. He and his two accomplices were captured in the CCTV camera installed outside the house.The couple’s son, Sandeep Ghai, an industrialist who runs a hosiery factory, was away at his relatives’ house in Model Town with his wife and children when the theft was executed.While Ghai has yet to provide exact details of what was stolen from the house, sources in the police said around Rs 24 lakh and 500gm of gold jewellery were missing.According to investigators, the family had not got Bahadur verified through the police before employing him.MIDNIGHT THEFTGhai came to know about the incident around 2am when he returned home with his wife and kids. He told the police that he had employed Bahadur through the reference of a worker at his factory around two months ago. On Wednesday, while leaving for his relatives’ house in Model Town for dinner, he instructed his domestic helps – Bahadur and 11-year-old Munish Kumar, and the security guard not to allow anyone’s entry in the house.On his return, he was shocked to find the security guard lying unconscious. As he entered the house, he found Munish collapsed on the floor with a head injury inflicted by a blunt weapon. He frantically rushed to his parents’ room and found them also unconscious and the house completely ransacked. Ghai alerted the police and rushed the four people to a private hospital, where they are stated to be stable.Police and a forensic team arrived at the scene soon after for clues. As per preliminary investigation, the accused may have served the elderly couple, the guard and the child eatables laced with sedatives. However, police are waiting to record the victims’ statements to ascertain what happened exactly. “The factory worker who referred Bahadur quit his job soon after due to the Covid-19 outbreak. We have not ruled out his involvement in the crime,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Harpal Singh.Multiple teams had been despatched to arrest the three accused, he added.The Division Number 5 police have lodged an FIR against the three accused.REWARD ANNOUNCED FOR INFOPolice commissioner Rakesh Agrawal has announced cash reward for information on the accused. The police chief assured that the identity of the informer will be concealed.Investigators said the CCTV footage showed Bahadur and his two accomplices entering the house around 10.30pm and leaving around 12.30am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nepalese-help-accomplices-steal-cash-jewellery-from-ludhiana-house/story-QTjHHyLTLmXOEvbVkYcAxN.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Limit red zones to localities with dense population, suggests panel on Delhi’s Covid strategy||Containment zones should be limited to places such as resettlement colonies and slums, contact-tracing activities have to be rationalised and districts should follow leads provided by their own surveillance instead of just chasing targets when it comes to testing. These are some of the recommendations drafted by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), with an expert group led by Dr V K Paul of Niti Aayog, to help formulate a revised strategy for Covid-19 management in Delhi.The document related to the revised Covid-19 strategy for Delhi, which HT has seen, says home isolation cases in high-density areas could have led to transmissions and warns that Delhi may witness around 15,000 cases per day in the winter months because of respiratory illnesses adding to Covid-19 symptoms and the likelihood of more patients with severe symptoms coming from other states. The strategy document recommended that the Delhi government should engage with community leaders, organisers, etc., to ensure festivals – Durga Puja, Dussehra and Chhath – are low key with little or no gathering.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is relying on these recommendations for chalking out a fresh Covid-19 management strategy for the Capital. On September 18, lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal had asked DDMA to draft a fresh strategy as Delhi had witnessed too many ups and downs in the Covid-19 graph since June 26 – when the plan was last drafted, said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.At its peak, the seven-day Covid-19 case average was 4119, on September 19The DDMA is chaired by Baijal and its vice-chairperson is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Dr Paul leads separate advisory committees for both the central government and DDMA.Also Read | India’s first Covid-19 wave finally recedesThe DDMA is scheduled to draft its strategy and submit it to the L-G by Tuesday (Oct 13) when the next meeting of the authority is scheduled, the senior official said. The official said these recommendations have been submitted to the offices of the L-G, chief minister and chief secretary Vijay Dev – and discussed with district magistrates earlier this week.Senior officials in the L-G office did not comment.A Delhi government spokesperson refused to comment on the issue.The document said, “Cases are being reported from all areas of all the districts and hence existing containment zone strategy needs to be revised.”It said, “The formation of new containment zones could be restricted only for highly dense localities such as resettlement colonies and JJ clusters /slums areas...For planned colonies, big apartments, RWA (resident welfare association)-governed localities, the strategy of micro containment zones or home isolation may be continued.”“Proportion of active case under home isolation is to the extent of 50-60 %, which constitutes the major proportion of active cases in Delhi. Home isolation is observed in densely populated colonies as well. With the number of cases in thousands, the strict monitoring of movement restriction of all cases under home isolation, especially in densely populated areas, is challenging and may be one of the reasons for the spread of infection,” the document noted.It said, “It is recommended that the guidelines for selection of cases to be put on home isolation need to be strictly followed and all symptomatic positive cases reported from densely populated areas should be isolated only in covid care centres (CCC) to ensure optimal utilisation of these facilities.”It said that each home isolation case should be better monitored.Also Read | Covid-19: The good and bad newsOn contact tracing, the document suggested the government’s policy can be further “rationalised”. It said, “The contact tracing could be restricted to forward contact tracing only -- immediate family contacts, neighbourhood contacts and close workplace contacts, should be traced and tested as per ICMR guidelines on a priority basis.”It said the government’s current policy on testing was insufficient when it comes to containment zones, and recommended district-wise scaling up of tests and tests based on surveillance findings instead of chasing targets. “Criteria for scaling up of testing should be based on positivity in each district (preferably ward) vis-à-vis the total number of samples tested,” it said.It noted, “Testing should not be target-driven, rather it should be guided by the surveillance in containment zones, number of positive and their symptomatic contacts identified and number of symptomatic persons identified at screening sites. Increase in the number of tests should be reflected in increased case finding. Merely increasing the number of tests to reduce the positivity rate would not be appropriate.”“Winter months that make respiratory illnesses severer...Patients may come from outside Delhi in large numbers… Patients coming from distant areas are likely to be more serious. In addition, with festival-related gatherings, there could be a sudden rise in cases. Therefore, it is recommended that Delhi should prepare for a daily surge of approximately 15,000 positive cases and make arrangements for inpatient admissions of patients with moderate and severe disease roughly amounting to 20% of this surge.”Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said: “As the economy opens up more with time, high-population density areas remain at high risk as far as transmission is concerned. In other areas, they can isolate cases and improve monitoring, without creating containment zones. So, the containment zone strategy that the government is currently discussing sounds reasonable.”“Also, the government should consider localised isolation facilities near slums and high population areas so that patients can be isolated without being taken to a place far away from residence. As far as the predictions regarding the surge of cases in the winters are concerned, there is not much concrete study on that so far,” he said.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “First of all, the government should scale up RT-PCR tests. With their awareness campaigns, they should help bring change in behaviour and encourage people to get tested on their own. As far as containment policies are concerned, Delhi can do away with the concept of containment, even in high-population areas, at this juncture. Positive cases should be isolated in facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/limit-red-zones-to-localities-with-dense-population-suggests-panel-on-delhi-s-covid-strategy/story-OO3ocpfyimJVgR2dSfiBBK.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Coding is the need of the hour, says Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||Around 12,000 government school students in the capital are set to benefit from the HT Codeathon initiative because of collaborative efforts with the Delhi government, says deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio. The government has encouraged coding programmes for female students and to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), the scale of engagement is wider this time, said Sisodia, who spoke to Hindustan Times on the importance of coding, encouraging more students to learn coding, and HT Codeathon’s role in today’s digital economy. Excerpts:Until a decade or two ago, coding wasn’t as popular in the country as it is today. What has changed since then and why are more educators or education policies focusing on it?It is the need of the hour. Children studying in schools now will become professionals in 10-15 years. If they don’t have knowledge about coding, their foundation will be weak. [Apple co-founder] Steve Jobs had called computer science a liberal art, so it’s not just about programming. Coding helps students think, visualise, and express themselves or talk about societal issues.So as a government, it is our responsibility that if there is a need, we should motivate people and bring them together. We wanted to teach kids about new-age technology. But when we came to power in 2015, classrooms were damaged and infrastructure needed work. Since then, we have been at work, and have improved infrastructure and done extensive teacher training programmes, results in government schools have touched 98%, and motivation is high among stakeholders. So we thought now is the time to work on the future.The new National Education Policy (NEP) calls for introducing coding for classes 6 and above. What kind of curriculum or learning should we envision under it?The curriculum has to be embedded along with other subjects. Rote learning won’t work here. Students from government schools, who previously engaged in coding initiatives in our schools, wrote codes and developed animated videos on themes like the importance of educating girls and the Covid-19 crisis. Today, if they were put in a curriculum-based framework, they won’t be able to think. In coding and programming, visualising and thinking is equally important. Children must be given the space to think as it will lead to more successful outcomes. We can’t have a rigid syllabus for it. So, learning should focus on embedding coding with languages or subjects like history and mathematics.In a country like India, where there is widespread economic disparity, how can we ensure that all students get to learn how to code, even those without access to devices on their own?Teaching coding to students who have used computers and smartphones from a young age is relatively easier than teaching someone who may not even know how to switch on computers, or has not heard of coding before. It is a challenge to introduce these children to coding, and we have accepted it and been successful in our earlier initiatives as well. The lack of devices is a challenge but the government does not have the revenue to provide gadgets due to the Covid-19 lockdown. We are functioning at less than 50% of the revenue collection. We have to make sure that before giving phones to students, our teachers, health workers and other staff are paid. However, the budget crunch is only temporary. In five years, the Delhi government has invested in education with an open heart. Eventually, we hope to get more money to spend on education beyond infrastructure and teachers’ salaries.There is an existing perception that coding is tough or not for everyone. What can be done to dispel that notion?The young girls who showed their work today [at a Codeathon event on Thursday] decoded everything. Students from poor backgrounds whose parents are rickshaw drivers, maids, and laundry workers, are now learning coding. There is a chance that the generations before them did not even learn how to switch on computers. But now these students have demonstrated that it is not impossible to learn coding. We have around 1,500-2,000 teachers who have B.Tech degrees, and coding is their domain. This will help create a zeal among students about coding.HT Codeathon is a mobile-friendly initiative, and the learning can happen online on mobile phones. How much of an advantage will it be in government schools?It is a big initiative and is free for government school students. Besides, Codeathon focuses on both learning and competitiveness, which will create a zeal among students to compete and learn better. Students without any knowledge of software or engineering will learn coding, and that will lay the foundation for a new India. You’ve travelled to several countries and studied their education models. With respect to coding and technology, what is something that we need to emulate here?Modern technology is a part of their education and not just taught as a subject. It is introduced in the early stages of education. Technology should be embedded in the learning environment. They should be able to learn coding in a creative manner. Once, while on a visit to a school in a foreign country, I saw a group of students working on a play on tax reform laws that were going on in the country at that time. This shows embedded learning. The students weren’t taught about the reforms through rote learning in classes...The way we adopted liberal arts, we have to adopt coding. Through this bigger experiment with HT Codeathon, involving thousands of students, a greater atmosphere of learning coding will be developed in government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coding-is-the-need-of-the-hour-sisodia/story-idZ4KtQ0Jgcc7rjAwM1kNM.html

The police said the complainant, who is a former station house officer (SHO) of Sadar police station, complained on June 25 that last year, when he was posted in the city, a woman had filed a case of dispute against a third party and the police had conducted a fair investigation in that case. In the FIR, the police officer, said, “But since then, the woman started blackmailing me and asked me repeatedly to pay money. She and her aides asked me to pay ₹1 crore last year and when I refused to pay the amount, she filed a false case against me in Jind.” The police said the complainant alleged that some aides of the accused woman had filed similar fake complaints against several people with the intention of extortion. Dinesh Kumar, station house officer, (SHO), Sadar police station, said, “A complaint was received and after conducting investigation, an FIR has been registered. Some audio recordings have been submitted by the complainant and we are verifying the allegations. Apart from a woman, two more people have been named in the FIR. No arrests have been made so far.” A case was registered against the accused persons under Section 384 (punishment for extortion) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Sadar police station on Wednesday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-booked-for-blackmailing-police-officer/story-apxaBYDg4nEWDG1fusguSK.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||‘War room’ to keep an eye on air quality launched in Delhi||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday inaugurated a centralised “war room” at the state secretariat to monitor to air pollution levels and coordinate efforts by different agencies to control a spike in bad air, a chronic problem that plagues the Capital and its surrounding areas every winter.A 10-member team of experts under senior scientists Dr Mohan George and Dr B L Chawla will lead the efforts to monitor real-time data of pollutants, the condition of pollution hot spots, stubble burning images and efficacy measures aimed at checking bad air, the government said.The war room is one of the seven measures of the Delhi government’s action plan to fight air pollution, announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this week. Other measures include steps to control dust pollution, a mobile application to register complaints and hot spot-based pollution-control strategies. Rai said the control room will work towards ensuring stricter enforcement of guidelines to check dust pollution at construction and demolition sites, ready-mix concrete plants, and garbage burning. The team will keep an eye on the mechanised sweeping of roads and sprinkling of water to prevent dust pollution.Also Read | Despite strong winds, why is Delhi’s air quality on the slide?“This fight will not be possible without the support of every agency and, therefore, we have set up and launched a centralised war room today in the Delhi secretariat. The war room is fully equipped with technology to monitor real-time pollution data,” Rai said on Thursday. “Three large LCD screens are present across the room. Real-time pollution data, which includes air quality and data of PM 2.5 and PM 10, sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, ozone, and wind speed will be displayed will be shared in one of the screens. Through another screen, we will monitor the situation in the 13 hot spots. Through a third screen, we will monitor NASA and ISRO pictures of stubble burning in neighbouring states,” Rai said.“We will monitor complaints filed by people through the Green Delhi app which the CM will launch in the coming days. We will monitor complaints and implement strict action. On the other hand, we will monitor road sweeping and water sprinkling work done by the municipal corporations through GPS,” he said. The minister said daily reports on the number of complaints received and grievances redressed will be sent to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.High levels of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem but gets aggravated in winters due to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local emission sources.The 13 pollution hot pots in Delhi are Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, R K Puram and Jahangirpuri.Also Read | India to see pre-Covid air traffic numbers by January 1: Minister Hardeep PuriSmoke emanating from the burning of stubble by farmers in Delhi’s neighbouring states, but mostly in Punjab and Haryana, contribute to Delhi’s air pollution -- almost 44% according to the Delhi government -- every winter.To tackle stubble burning, the Delhi government has tied up with IARI Pusa scientists to spray a “bio-decomposer” solution in paddy fields in the national capital, starting October 11. The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and can prevent stubble burning. The AAP government says other states can follow Delhi and use the solution to tackle the problem of stubble burning.The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Thursday and is likely to deteriorate further due to unfavourable meteorological conditions and spike in farm fires, the met office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/war-room-to-keep-an-eye-on-air-quality-launched-in-delhi/story-kK7a0XXkJgsTRhCPEIRkOJ.html
09-10-2020||Gurugram||Epca directs strict ban diesel gensets from Oct 15, pollution at construction sites to be monitored||The chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed Environmental Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), which is tasked with control and prevention of air pollution in Delhi-NCR, has issued a “most urgent” directive to the chief secretary, Haryana, as well as the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, on Thursday evening after a meeting. The directive calls for an immediate and strict ban on use of diesel generators in Gurugram and Faridabad districts starting October 15, when the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) kicks into action.“In 2019, the state of Haryana had informed EPCA that they will put in all required measures by the winter 2020, so that electricity from the grid can be supplied without disruptions... which would obviate the need for diesel generators,” an EPCA spokesperson on Thursday said. “Over the last two years, exceptions have been made for Haryana and other NCR states over diesel genset ban. But this year, in view of the public health hazard posed by Covid-19, we cannot relax any pollution control rules,” he added. In addition to this, the order (authored by Epca chairman Bhure Lal) states that the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) will be required to enforce air pollution norms at all large-scale construction sites under its jurisdiction, while also seeking undertakings from proprietors ensuring compliance with Grap norms and Epca directives on dust management, before October 15. Similar undertakings will also be taken from Red and Orange category industries in Gurugram and Faridabad ensuring use of only “authorised fuels”, i.e. piped natural gas (PNG), instead o traditional diesel, coal or husk, which emit large quantities of particulate matter. Moreover, HSPCB has also been asked to ensure round the clock surveillance of “hot spot areas” to ensure that any violations — such as dumping of solid waste and construction debris, biomass burning, and use of illegal fuels — are penalised. Epca’s order (dated October 8, a copy of which Hindustan Times has seen) also asks the HSPCB to “ensure long-term solutions for solid waste dumping.”HSPCB officials said they have already chalked out some measures for mitigation of not only waste dumping, but overall reduction of air pollution in four districts of Haryana. “In November 2019, we had prepared a comprehensive action plan for Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Panipat, which come under the National Clean Air Program. That plan has been reviewed by Epca, and has now been integrated with Grap as they have many overlapping provisions and goals. Even Bahadurgarh will now come under the purview of this plan,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, who is one of the recipients of Thursday’s EPCA order.HSPCB officials said that they are currently in the process of taking stock of the measures introduced under the integration of the Grap with its own ‘Comprehensive Action Plan for Clean Air for Cities of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Panipat in Haryana’. These measures have been assigned to various departments at the district level. “We have definitely made progress in the matter, despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 lockdown. Research studies have been commissioned, new air quality monitors and PM sesors have been installed in Gurugram, and mobility plans are being revamped. Industries have also been brought to comply with emission norms weeks ahead of the winter season. We have sought individual reports from concerned officials at a district level, which will be further submitted to Epca,” said an HSPCB official Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (Gururgam), HSPCB, said, “Once we have assessed the progress of the action plan, we can comment on what work remains to be done. It will take about a week’s time. Teams have already been created for surveillance of several hospots in Gurugram and Manesar which have been identified with Epca’s help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/epca-directs-strict-ban-diesel-gensets-from-oct-15-pollution-at-construction-sites-to-be-monitored/story-EkCL6aGzVNtso3xJbmqv7N.html

This pushed the case tally to 18,942. Of these, as many as 17,555 patients have been discharged – a recovery rate of 92.6%, leaving 594 active cases. A total of 790 people have succumbed to the disease so far.The latest fatalities include two males, aged 73 and 64, residents of Basant Enclave and Janta Nagar, respectively.Since the first case was reported on March 24, cases have steadily multiplied, hitting the 18,000 mark within 191 days on October 1 – 13 days after Ludhiana recorded the single-day highest spike of 464 cases on September 17. September had recorded a massive surge of 7,522 cases within 30 days, against the 6,783 cases reported in August – a spike of nearly 11%. September also accounts for 42% of all Covid-19 deaths so far. On the other hand, October has recorded 984 cases in the first eight days, with the steepest daily spike in the month being 161 on the fifth – significantly below the sharpest surge of 464 cases seen on September 17. “Things are getting back under control, but residents need to remain cautious, mainly in view of the upcoming Navrataras and festival season,” said deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, adding that stepping out of the house should be avoided as far as possible, especially by senior citizens and those suffering from other ailments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-records-two-covid-deaths-for-the-first-time-in-68-days/story-oROo3qerg0ahiWpfablJuI.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Despite strong winds, why is Delhi’s air quality on the slide?||Despite the average wind speed of 15-16 kmph, air quality in Delhi continued to be poor on Thursday for the second consecutive day. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, Delhi registered an AQI value of 208, which places it in the ‘poor’ zone. Experts said though faster winds play a major role in the dispersion of pollutants, it is not helping in case of Delhi since the wind speed is not consistent throughout the day. As well as the direction of wind is not helpful since it is blowing from the northwest bringing in particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 -- one of the primary pollutants in Delhi’s air) from Haryana and Punjab where farm fires are raging, they said. According to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed reduces between evening and early morning hours. They also said that currently the northwesterly winds are bringing in fumes from crop stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab, which according to the Delhi government is one of the major contributors of particulate matter to Delhi’s air. “These pollutants are not being able to disperse as much just with the day wind, as the winds turn calm from evening to early morning hours. The duration for which the wind speed is good is very short. Besides, with a dip in mercury, the ventilation index (the ability of the atmosphere to dilute and disperse the pollutants over a region) has also become slightly low,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.On Wednesday, Delhi’s air plunged into the ‘poor’ zone for the first time since June 28. Government agencies have warned that the air quality in Delhi may deteriorate further over the next two days though remaining in the ‘poor’ zone. According to CPCB, prolonged exposure to poor air may lead to breathing discomfort to most people.As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, PM 2.5 being the lead pollutant is characteristic of winter. “The forecast for AQI is in the higher end of moderate to the poor category on Friday. However, it is predicted to improve thereafter to be back in the moderate category. A gradual increase in stubble burning fires was observed on Wednesday around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions. The boundary layer wind direction and speed are favourable for the transport of pollutants towards Delhi at present, but a shift in the wind direction is likely from October 11, which is likely to help improve air quality,” the Safar bulletin stated.As per Safar, the fire count in the northwest region on October 7 was 399.IMD’s Srivastava also said that wind speed in the region is likely to improve by Sunday. “The air quality may improve slightly on October 11-12 because of probable thunderous developments in the region. The wind direction will also change to southeasterly during this time. However, this pattern will change from October 15, with a return of northwesterlies and a dip in both night and day temperatures,” said Srivastava.On Thursday, the minimum temperature settled at 19.1 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal while the maximum settled at 35.6 degrees, two notches above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-strong-winds-why-is-delhi-s-air-quality-on-the-slide/story-u61UIy9Vd2mSlnZZLXuu2M.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Shut down thermal power plants around Delhi, demands AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday alleged rampant violation of environmental norms by thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and demanded that they should be immediately shut down. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj accused the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of being silent over alleged violation of pollution norms by these power plants. “AAP wants to know why CPCB is silent over the rampant violation of pollution norms by thermal power plants in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Despite the Supreme Court order and Central government’s direction, 13 coal-based thermal power plants in these states have not yet adopted anti-pollution technology,” Bhardwaj said.Referring to the Badarpur Thermal Plant in Delhi, which was shut down in 2018, Bharadwaj said, “When the Delhi government can shut down these power plants then why can’t the other states do the same.”To be sure how polluting a thermal plant could be, the Badarpur BTPS contributed nearly 11% of Delhi’s ultra-fine respirable particles or PM 2.5. To add to it, 26% of the city’s PM 2.5 levels comprised coal and flyash which were emitted from the plant, according to a study by IIT Kanpur.As per the Centre’s Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), when the air quality is in the severe zone (ambient PM2.5 or PM10 concentration value is more than 250 µg/m3 or 430µg/m3 respectively), coal-fired power plants and brick kilns must be shut down.According to experts, thermal power plants are a major source of nitrous and sulphur oxides which causes coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest. It also causes smog. “Moreover, the National Green Tribunal had ordered that the coal which is being used in these thermal power plants should be taken in covered transport but these states do not even follow this order. The NTPC, a central government agency, has challenged this order in the Supreme Court,” said Bharadwaj.Bharadwaj also said that over 2,300 brick kilns, another major source of air pollution in Delhi-NCR, were yet to shift to cleaner fuels.The AAP spokesperson said the brick kilns continue to operate and pollute air because of the “corruption of the state pollution control boards”. “The CPCB is neglecting all these issues. In the coming days, questions will be raised against Delhi and everyone will talk about dust pollution and vehicular pollution. But all these issues are already there; only the toxic air of the stubble burning is absent. When that toxic air comes here, the situation in Delhi will worsen,” he said.The CPCB did not respond to queries for a comment on the AAP’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shut-down-thermal-power-plants-around-delhi-demands-aap/story-aNhZtiZaiI0cIHUzjyoYGO.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||BJP anti-farmer, Centre never got produce at MSP from Delhi farmers in 5 yrs: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Central government has not once purchased produce at the minimum support price (MSP) from farmers in Delhi in the past five years.In the truncated session, Parliament had approved three farm bills, leading to protests by farmer bodies and opposition parties. The primary points of contention are the absence of any mention of MSP (the government-decided floor) and the freedom given to private players and others to operate in areas beyond the physical boundaries of agricultural produce market committees (APMCs).Addressing a press conference, AAP leader and national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said because of the BJP government’s “stepmotherly” treatment towards Delhi farmers, they have been forced to sell their produce to private players at rates lower than the MSP.“The BJP at the Centre is against farmers. The BJP has used the slogan, ‘Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan’, as a mere political tool to gain votes, and adopted the policy of ‘Mar Jawaan Mar Kisaan’ in reality. Over the past few weeks, farm bills are being discussed in the country. They were passed in Parliament secretly by keeping constitutional values at stake and were implemented across the nation. While the opposition says the BJP wants to abolish the MSP and mandis and harm the farmers, the Centre says it would not abolish mandis and MSP,” he said. Displaying documents, Chadha alleged that after 2015, the central government has not once purchased produce from Delhi farmers, let alone at the MSP rates. “The farmers of Delhi were left to be exploited by private players. The year 2015 was the last time that the Centre purchased wheat produce from Delhi farmers. It has been 5.5 years, and the Narendra Modi government has not purchased produce even worth a single rupee. The MSP of one quintal of wheat this year is ₹1,925. But because the central government is not purchasing wheat, Delhi farmers are forced to sell it at ₹1,700, which means that farmers are suffering a loss of ₹225 per quintal,” Chadha said. He further said over the past few years, Delhi government officials, mandi presidents, and ministers of the Delhi government have consistently written to the Centre, urging them to purchase produce from Delhi. “They have written that it is the responsibility of the government to purchase the crop produce at MSP from our farmers. But Centre has given no response. As many as 10 letters were written by the Delhi government to the Centre between March 2018 and May 2020 but to no avail,” Chadha said. Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “Kejriwal and his party have no moral right to make such baseless allegations about the Centre. The Kejriwal government has failed to give proper rights to the farmers. It is even misleading people by projecting that the liquid solution prepared by the Pusa Research Institute to turn stubble into manure is an achievement of the Delhi government. In reality, the institute is under the Centre and such activities should have begun in the month of August itself. So, the AAP should be the last party to talk of farmer welfare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-anti-farmer-centre-never-got-produce-at-msp-from-delhi-farmers-in-5-years-aap/story-mqbaAaf4MQx1Yhu64IwQpL.html
09-10-2020||Mumbai||Despite rise in Covid-19 cases, 32% beds in Mumbai are vacant, claims civic corporation||The city recorded more than 2,800 cases on Thursday for the second consecutive day. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been able to maintain bed vacancy at around 32%. Officials attribute this to a high rate of patients discharged after treatment at Covid facilities. On Thursday, the city saw its second-highest single-day spike, with 2,823 new cases of Covid-19 and 48 deaths. Mumbai’s Covid-19 tally stands at 2,22,784, with 26, 383 active cases; and the death toll is 9,296. The discharge rate is 83.79% and the fatality rate is 4.17%. Dharavi recorded only eight new cases on Thursday, bringing its tally to 3,300. Of these, 2,820 have been discharged. According to BMC, there are 15,047 beds in dedicated Covid-19 health facilities in the city, of which 11,102 are in government hospitals and 3,945 are in private hospitals. In government hospitals, 4,198 beds are available while 650 beds are vacant in private hospitals. There are also 2,018 beds in intensive care units (ICU), of which 1,039 are in government hospitals and 979 are in private hospitals. There are 123 ICU beds available in government hospitals and 111 in private facilities. In case of oxygen (O2) beds, 6,592 of the total 9,115 in government hospitals are available. In private hospitals, 440 of the total 2,523 O2 beds are vacant. Of 1,131 beds with ventilators in the city, 714 are in government hospitals (70 are vacant) and 417 in private hospitals (31 are vacant). Bed vacancy has remained at around 32% despite spikes in the Covid caseload. This has been possible partly because of the high rate of patients discharged. Altogether, 1,86,675 patients have been discharged in Mumbai. According to BMC, September saw over 50,409 discharged patients in the city, which is the highest recorded in a month so far. The previous highest was in July, when 42,283 patients were discharged. The city recorded 16,791 discharges until May 31. In June and August, 27,186 and 29,362 discharges were recorded respectively.“We have four major Covid-19 jumbo centres at Worli, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Goregaon and Dahisar. These four jumbo centres have played a crucial role in ensuring our capacity or availability of beds remains high, which also results in government hospitals having more vacancies compared to private hospitals,” said a BMC official.Previously, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told HT, “We have enough beds to even handle around 4,000 patients daily. This is because we do not require beds for all the patients. Only symptomatic patients require a bed and asymptomatic patients are quarantined or opt for home isolation.” As of October 6, of the total 23,976 active cases in the city, 60% were asymptomatic while 34% were symptomatic and 6% were in critical condition.Another BMC official said there has been no instance of beds not being available for a Covid patient. “Bed availability becomes an issue only when the patient wants a bed in the hospital of his or her choice, rather than by the availability. In the last four months we have allotted more than 80,000 beds with help of our ward war rooms,” said the official.According to BMC, its Covid war rooms, set up in each ward, allotted beds to 82,973 patients between June 10 and September 30.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant said, “The overall picture is 32% beds vacant, but there needs to be an improvement in the vacancy ratio maintained for ICU beds and ventilators. We are witnessing mild cases of late, but there is no guarantee with this virus. It will be wise to augment the number of ICU beds and ventilators.”Google Maps to show containment zones In a bid to make it easier for Mumbaiites to locate Covid-19 containment areas, the civic body collaborated with Google to showcase these zones on its maps from Thursday. There are 651 containment zones in Mumbai as on Wednesday and the civic body said information about them and other similar data will be updated on Google Map on a regular basis in the future.

09-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi government partners with HT to train students in coding||Students participating in India’s biggest coding Olympiad will fill the gap in technology-related education in Delhi government schools, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said at the launch of the Hindustan Times Codeathon on Thursday. The Delhi government has partnered with Hindustan Times to train 12,000 students from its schools in coding. “Modern technology-related education is what is missing from our system. With this programme, we will train our students as professionals of tomorrow. Our government was working on computer labs when we were approached by She Codes to train girl children in coding. Once the foundation was laid, then came the partnership with Hindustan Times to challenge our students in coding,” said Sisodia at Veer Savarkar Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Kalkaji on Thursday. The launch was also attended by Udit Prakash Rai, Delhi’s director of education, Rajeev Beotra, senior executive director of Hindustan Times, and Rupinder Kaur, founder-president of the She Codes training programme. “Now that there is excitement about coding in our schools, I received a call from an Indian-origin technocrat from the United States to work with our teacher and students and mentor them in coding. Everything fit in place at the right time,” Sisodia said. The HT Codeathon will provide students from classes 6 through 9 from across India a virtual platform to learn coding in languages such as HTML, CSS and Python. The students will be scored when they complete the tutorials and quizzes, and the top 100 performers will participate in a finale in December. At the event, the animations made by six students from class 6 who had learnt some coding under the She Codes programme, launched in January this year, were presented. The animations, which were conceptualised and designed completely by the students revolved around topics like good touch and bad touch, the need for conservation, educating the girl child, and awareness about Covid-19. Speaking about the short videos, Sisodia said, “We have seen in these videos how coding promotes thinking, and creatively presenting messages. There was a video where the girl child says she is helpless, and all I could think was that now she is not helpless — she is a coder”. Rai emphasised how the Codeathon would lay the groundwork for making teaching coding a continuous part of educating children. “This was a small dream for our education department, and a big step for our students. I am a student of a government school from Uttar Pradesh and saw a computer for the first time when I went to study engineering. Today children in our schools are learning how to code. This will promote a coding culture in our schools. This process should not end in the next two or three months, it should be continuous,” said Udit Prakash Rai, director, education. Senior executive director of Hindustan Times, Rajeev Beotra said, “The students will have to just register and start learning through an interactive platform that will have many videos, tests and tools. The programme will train children in classes 6 and 7 in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and those in classes 8 and 9 in Python as well. Every student will have a personalised dashboard that will track the progress of the students. This dashboard will be accessible to the parents and teachers as well to know how the students are performing. And, there will be a leaderboard with the rank of the student.” Over 22,000 students have already registered for the Hindustan Times Codeathon, which will provide training, mentorship from technical experts, and opportunities to win laptops or smartwatches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-partners-with-ht-to-train-students-in-coding/story-kuNknypUjXJReEnovs7XON.html
09-10-2020||Delhi||Gang poses as CBI, police officers and robs people of ATM cards, money||The Delhi Police Thursday claimed to have busted a gang of robbers that used to target people after offering them a car ride while posing as officers from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the police. Police said one man has been arrested and he alone was involved in at least eight cases of robbery, extortion and cheating in Delhi.Police identified the arrested man as Mukesh (single name), a resident of Trilokpuri, who earlier used to work as an auto-rickshaw driver.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bhisham Singh said on June 30, a complainant reported that around 5.30pm that day, he and his friend had taken a lift from three occupants of Swift car to go from Maharani Bagh bus stand on the Ring Road to Burari. “About a kilometre into the journey, they introduced themselves as CBI officers and said they were carrying weapons and a wireless set. The men took the complainant and his friend’s ATM cards and dropped them near Kashmere Gate ISBT. Thereafter, they withdrew ₹1.70 lakh from their accounts,” Singh said. The DCP said in July, a similar case was reported by a resident of Shaheen Bagh, who said he got into a car to go from South Extension to Ashram Chowk. “He said the men in the car claimed to be crime branch officers of the Delhi Police and took his ATM cards. Later, they dropped him and withdrew money from his account,” he said, without specifying the amount withdrawn. The officer said during the investigation, police received information on Wednesday that the kingpin of the gang, Mukesh, who has been evading arrest in several cases of robbery, kidnapping, theft and cheating, will be visiting his home in Trilokpuri. “On this, our team laid a trap and arrested Mukesh from his home. He has admitted his involvement in the two recent cases. He disclosed that he is the leader of the gang and that he, along with his two accomplices, both resident of Trilokpuri, carried out the robberies,” the DCP said. Police said they will arrest his two accomplices soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gang-poses-as-cbi-police-officers-and-robs-people-of-atm-cards-money-one-held/story-sC7bv5FqciHFmkvCG30T7O.html

09-10-2020||Delhi||To end chaos at vehicle dealer outlets, Delhi govt to soon home-deliver HSRPs||The Delhi government will soon start home delivering high-security registration plates (HSRP) and fuel stickers for vehicles registered in the national capital, senior transport officials said Thursday. The move comes after the city administration was flooded with complaints from vehicle owners who had failed to get the high-security number plates despite having paid for them and made the mandatory visit to the vehicle dealer outlets to collect them. On September 23, the Delhi government had issued a public notice asking vehicle owners to get their HSRP and colour-coded fuel stickers at the earliest in order to avoid being penalised for want of both. While the notice did not mention when the crackdown against defaulters would begin, it created a lot of panic among vehicle owners. Car dealers were soon flooded with applications for these new plates. The result was that there were at least 8,000 pending applications for HSRPs (as on Tuesday), creating a huge backlog and triggering chaos at dealer outlets.HSRPs are hologram plates made with a laser-branded permanent identification number, which cannot be copied. The colour-coded stickers are meant to identify vehicles based on their fuel type. The stickers also include details such as the registration number, the registering authority, a laser-branded PIN, and the engine and chassis number of the vehicle.A senior transport official said there are around 3.2 million vehicles in Delhi — both commercial and private — which are supposed to have these high-security registration plates. These include around 1.1 million four-wheelers and 1.9 million two-wheelers, while the rest are auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, buses, trucks, and others. The rule applies largely to vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, as vehicles registered after that date are mandatorily equipped with HSRPs and fuel stickers.Stepping in to sort out the problems, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said they would soon start home delivering HSRPs and fuel stickers in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “The existing system was resulting in overcrowding at dealer outlets. Home delivery of HSRPs, once introduced, will be a comfortable option for many -- for some extra payment. Vehicle owners will get the high-security number plates without having to step out of homes, although it may take a day or two longer than it would have if they collected them directly from dealers,” he said. The fee for availing of the home delivery option is yet to be decided, officials said.A senior official of Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited, the manufacturer of HSRPs, said the final modalities of the home delivery system would be complete by Tuesday. “We are hoping to formally launch the home delivery service by the end of October. The process will be seamless as the portal for availing of home delivery will be the same as the one for booking HSRP -- bookmyhsrp.com. The user will be given the option to choose home delivery or self pick-up,” said the official from Rosmerta, on condition of anonymity.The company also said it will solely operate the home delivery service for which it is now expanding its call centres and also roping in companies that provide riders. “Until now, our call centre was manned by just 20 people. Now, we are increasing the staff strength to over 100. For home delivery, we are creating a pool from our own staff as well as roping in two companies that provide riders,” the official said. On Tuesday, Gahlot had chaired a meeting to resolve the problems being faced by vehicle owners in getting these new number plates. Gahlot had directed officials to ensure that motor vehicle owners are not penalised for failing to have upgraded to HSRPs and colour-coded fuel stickers until further orders.The minister also had directed that no new application should be entertained until the backlog is cleared and the existing crisis is resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-end-chaos-at-vehicle-dealer-outlets-delhi-govt-to-soon-home-deliver-hsrps/story-ejdmNzITXa8YdQ9EozZBqO.html
09-10-2020||City||Dengue rears its ugly head in Ludhiana as Covid takes back seat||The Ludhiana health department has been hit by a double whammy: dengue and Covid-19. Though the medical teams have managed to bring the raging coronavirus under control, dengue has reared its ugly head and already infected 451 people. Since July, 416 people have been diagnosed with the vector-borne disease in the city, while 12 cases were reported in Koom Kalan, 10 in Pakhowal, four in Payal, three in Sahnewal, two in Sudhar and one each in Samrala, Manupur, Malaud and Khanna.Majority of the local cases have surfaced in Haibowal, Haibowal Khurd, Mundian, Civil Line, Guru Arjan Dev Nagar and surrounding areas near Samrala Chowk, Sector 32 on Chandigarh Road, Urban Estate in Dugri and Basti Jodhewal area. The first case of dengue was registered in July, while August saw none. The spread of the disease gained momentum in September, the health department said. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh said the city has been divided into two parts and 18 anti-larvae teams have been constituted to contain the dengue transmission. “While nine teams will check larvae in Ludhiana- A, as many teams will destroy the insects in Ludhiana- B,” he added. He said besides destroying the dengue larvae, the staffers were also putting up posters to spread awareness among residents.In majority of the places, dengue larvae were found in plastic cups, tyres and stagnant water in coolers. City industrialist dies of suspected dengueAngad Singh Ahuja, 33, who was suffering from suspected dengue, died of multiple organ failure at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) on Thursday. His family said he was earlier undergoing treatment at a private hospital where he had tested positive for dengue. Later, he was shifted to DMCH where he succumbed, one of his relatives said. Angad was at the forefront of FICO’s Young Leaders’ Forum and was the managing director of Big Ben Group, one of the largest manufacturers of saddles and pedals in the country. The health department said they could not confirm it to be a case of dengue death till the arrival of report.Angad is survived by wife and two daughters, aged eight and three. He was son-in-law of CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja. Mystery shrouds three similar deathsIn September, 19-year-old Thakur Gangeshwar Singh had died of suspected dengue at SPS Hospital. He had also tested positive for Covid-19. Similarly, two teenagers from Khanna and Sarabha Nagar had also died of multiple organ failure last month. It is being alleged that the duo were suffering from dengue. Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that NS1 antigen test and MAC Elisa test are mandatory to ascertain if any patient is suffering from dengue. “Dengue death will be confirmed after receiving the test reports,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dengue-rears-its-ugly-head-in-ludhiana-as-covid-takes-back-seat/story-QMdUIGzrqiGFVLTvIngseM.html

The trader’s body cites forthcoming Navratri and Diwali festivals as reason for relaxation. Shops are presently allowed to remain open till 7 pm. The trader’s association state that relaxation in timings will allow office goers to shop after their work schedule. Shop owners said that these customers shop after 7 pm. The authorities have allowed restaurants and bars in the city to keep dine-in services open till 10 pm. “The 7 pm deadline has affected our business. We normally see customers between 6 pm and 10 pm during weekdays. Hence, we have demanded that shops should be allowed to remain open till 9 pm. We have already suffered due to the lockdown, and Navratri and Diwali festivals are our main seasons of business,” said Tushar Jawalkar, owner of men’s clothing shop at Laxmi road. Another shop owner Prem Jauhari said, “It is injustice to shop owners and traders in the state, when hotels and restaurants are allowed to remain open till 10 pm. We follow all the rules and regulations as per Covid safety protocols, then why is this compulsion to shut down at 7 pm? State government should understand our problem and allow us to keep shops open till 9 pm or 10 pm.” Fatechand Ranka, president of FTAP, said, “We have entered the auspicious Adhik month when women purchase gold and silver jewellery items. The Navratri festival will begin from October 17 followed by Diwali. The coming months are important for shop owners and traders in terms of business. As we are following the virus prevention measures announced by the authorities, we have requested the state government to extend our shop timings from 7 pm to 9 pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-traders-seek-relaxation-in-shop-timings-ahead-of-festive-season/story-6j85fs6I5O3n3eitXS3uTP.html
09-10-2020||Chandigarh||With steady decline, active Covid cases in Ludhiana drop to less than half in two weeks||After recording a swift surge of 7,522 cases in September, Ludhiana is now registering a steady decline in the number of active cases, as per figures shared by the district health department.From the 1,509 active cases among the 16,783 cases confirmed as of September 23, the number has dropped to 618 among 18,853 infections on October 7 – a decrease of 59%.The number of active cases now is also the lowest since August 1, when there were again 618 infected patients in the district. Currently, 35 patients are admitted at government facilities, also lowest since August 1. As many as 349 patients are observing home isolation and another 125 are admitted in private hospitals of the district. With this the positivity rate has also reduced to 2.2% as compared to September 17 that saw a record 464 fresh cases, causing the positivity rate to shoot up to 8.7%. In more good news, so far in October, the daily fatalities have been below 10 with the exception of October 3 and 4 when 10 deaths each were reported. In all remaining days, the deaths were in a single digit with three deaths being reported on October 1 and four on October 6. This comes as a respite from what it was a fortnight back, when as many as 19 deaths were reported on September 15 – said to be the peak of the first wave of coronavirus in district. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma cautioned that while it was a respite that cases were coming down, there was no room for complacency. “I appeal to residents to stay indoors as far as possible, as this would not only keep them safe but also help lower the spread of infection in the community,” he said. VIRUS CLAIMS SIX MORE LIVES, 114 TEST POSITIVEThe figure of fresh Covid-19 cases remained low for the second consecutive day on Wednesday as the district reported 114 cases.However, the virus claimed the lives of six Ludhiana residents, pushing the death toll to 788. On Tuesday, the district had recorded 85 cases, the lowest in 65 days since the 78 cases on August 2.The district’s patient tally now stands at 18,853, of which 17,444 patients have recovered, leaving 618 active cases. A total of 3.02 lakh samples have been tested till now. The six deceased on Wednesday include five males and one female. The woman, aged 40, was a resident of Chak Sarwan Nath village. The male deceased include an 84-year-old from Ghumar Mandi, a 60-year-old from Miller Ganj, a 57-year-old from Kot Mangal Singh, a 48-year-old from Talwandi Kalan and a 45-year-old from Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-steady-decline-active-covid-cases-in-ludhiana-drop-to-less-than-half-in-two-weeks/story-eL0GMr5tmCGynEh2xUGKAM.html
09-10-2020||City||Pandemic, farmer stirs delay arrival of shipments, leave Ludhiana industrialists on the edge||The Covid-19 pandemic, along with farmer agitations and tensions at the Indo-China border, has escalated the troubles of industrialists who are ruing the delay of shipments arriving from ports. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president, and Pankaj Sharma, general secretary of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU), jointly said that movement of container trains from Ludhiana to ports and back have been seriously hampered due to the ongoing agitation by the farmers over the agri bills. “It has already been five days and the current situation is brewing into a disaster for exports. Shipments have been delayed and exporters are fearing cancellation of orders. Plus, the sudden increase of ocean freight and other expenses are adding to losses and mental agony of industrialists,” they said. CICU has now written a request letter to the PMO, ministry of commerce, ministry of MSMEs and ministry of finance requesting their immediate intervention and highlighting the hardships being faced by exporters. The major commodities contributing to imports into Ludhiana are metal scraps and waste paper for 20 feet and 40 feet containers, respectively. Orders of metal scraps from Dubai dried up due to ban on export by the supplier country amid the onset of Covid.The import of waste paper also saw a steep fall due to the same reason. Consequently, exports are either in waiting or are forced to rely on the empty containers from Delhi or Mundra ports at an additional cost of Rs, 20,000 and Rs 30,000 respectively per container. Sarvjit Singh, co-convener of CICU’s export promotion committee, said that during the Covid lockdown, period shipping lines had withdrawn vessels fearing less cargo, which had resulted in congestion at major transit ports like Salalah, Colombo and Singapore. He added that even the empty containers from Delhi and Mudra ports were not arriving due to ongoing agitation by the farmers. He said that the industry was facing a huge deficit of containers due to imbalance in import and exports at Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industrialists-rue-delay-in-arrival-of-shipments/story-MvBs9HoJrJYjuCTrB7YFyL.html

Trump has since repeatedly promised to hasten their approval, widen access and provide them to Americans for free.“We have engaged in a number of contracts for procurement of these monoclonal antibodies already,” said Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. The government is acquiring doses through its Strategic National Stockpile as they are manufactured, he said.Mango spoke during a briefing on the latest developments of Operation Warp Speed, the White House-led effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of coronavirus vaccines and treatments.Early data from Lilly’s single antibody and Regeneron’s antibody cocktail suggest both are effective in keeping people infected with the new coronavirus out of the hospital.“The interest in the monoclonal antibodies is quite high,” said Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA. Woodcock, who is serving as a part of Operation Warp Speed, has recused herself from taking part in the approval decisions related to coronavirus therapeutics.Biggest ChallengeHealth-care experts and industry executives have said that manufacturing poses the most significant challenge in getting antibody treatments to all who may need it. The process is costly and demand is likely to outstrip supply.Lilly said earlier this week it would have 100,000 doses of the single-antibody product its developing with Canadian biotech AbCellera Biologics Inc. available in October, and as many as 1 million doses available by year-end.The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical giant is also studying a cocktail of two antibodies, and expects to approach regulators for authorization in November and seek full approval in the second quarter of 2021. Supplies of the cocktail, which adds in a second antibody that Lilly licensed from Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., are much more limited, with only about 50,000 doses available this year.Regeneron said Wednesday it has enough doses for about 50,000 patients and expects to have enough doses available for 300,000 patients in the next few months. Warp Speed officials said the distribution plan will be similar to remdesivir, with the federal government allocating to states with the highest need.The greatest challenge ahead, Woodcock said, will be coordinating sites where patients can receive the antibody treatments, which must be administered intravenously by health-care professionals, unlike vaccines, which can be given from the more convenient confines of a pharmacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-1-million-doses-of-covid-antibody-before-2021/story-I03A7Nt6WpkirB8ji4UbYI.html

09-10-2020||World||Fearing Biden tax hikes, wealthy Americans rush to change estate plans||Wealthy Americans are scrambling to change their estate plans before year-end, worried that Democrat Joe Biden will win the U.S. presidential election and raise taxes, say financial advisers to the moneyed set.The biggest concern is that the White House and Congress could get swept up in a “Blue Wave” of Democratic wins that give Biden the power to propose and pass a sweeping set of tax reforms.Wealthy people are especially nervous that an exemption allowing individuals to leave up to $11.58 million to heirs, free of estate or gift taxes, could be cut before it expires in 2025.Democrats want to raise estate taxes to the “historical norm,” according to the party’s platform. That could mean slashing the exemption to $5.49 million, the figure in place before Republican President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tax bill that included benefits for corporations and wealthy Americans in 2017, advisers said.It is unclear how the election will go or what, if any, tax reform will pass. Tax code changes can also be complex and time consuming. But as Biden has climbed in the polls, rich people are rushing to set up trusts and revise existing ones before year-end to avoid 2021 tax consequences, advisers said.“The $11.58 million question is, ‘What is going to happen to the gift and estate tax exclusion?’“ said Toni Ann Kruse, a New York estates lawyer who counsels ultra-high net worth people. “We don’t know who will win the election or control the House or Senate - and all of those factors will play into what could happen.”Biden would also “return the estate tax to 2009 levels” to fund paid family and medical leave, according to his website. His plan also includes raising taxes on long-term capital gains, which is the profit earned by selling assets whose values have appreciated. Taxpayers with income above $1 million would pay a 39.6% income tax on the profit, instead of the current tiered approach that maxes out at 20% for individuals with $441,450 or more income.In a statement, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates reiterated the candidate’s intent to change tax law in ways that benefit less affluent people.“Joe Biden is running to rebuild the backbone of this nation - the American middle class - by ensuring that our economy rewards work and not just wealth,” he said.The uptick in requests for estate changes intensified in June when Biden pulled ahead of Trump in polling, advisers said. Several firms said they have been overwhelmed by requests since then, and expect business to pick up more toward the end of the year.Tax-related workflow is triple the norm at Miller Samuel Inc, a New York-based real estate appraisal firm, said Chief Executive Jonathan Miller.“We are flooded with requests for gift and estate tax appraisals right now,” he said.New York estate and tax planning lawyer Philip Michaels has added around 15 high net worth clients during the last several months who are revising estate plans.Rockefeller Capital Management, a financial advisory firm in New York, is holding virtual events for customers while working with legal and tax advisers to sort through nuances of possible legislation, said Joe Roberts, Senior Wealth Strategist.Clients are worried about a “quick turn and drastic departure” from the status quo, Roberts said.At the same time, some customers are worried about making decisions too early. That is because trusts created to use lifetime exemptions are not easily unwound.“It’s a lot of money to give away,” Indianapolis estate planning lawyer John Olivieri said of some of his clients. “People are struggling with, ‘Do I really want to give this away?’“||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-biden-tax-hikes-wealthy-americans-rush-to-change-estate-plans/story-4Juew09BKXQ8xeWh6BWY5M.html
09-10-2020||World||White House increases fiscal-stimulus offer to $1.8 trillion||The White House plans to offer a $1.8 trillion stimulus proposal in talks Friday between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as a top Republican expressed skepticism any deal could get through Congress before the election.After walking away from talks with Democrats earlier this week, President Donald Trump has reversed course and is now looking for a deal with the election three weeks away and polls showing him trailing Democrat Joe Biden.“The president has approved a revised package. He would like to do a deal,” Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday on Fox Business. “It will be relatively broad based but I can’t go through details.”Three people familiar with the matter said the White House is increasing its proposal to $1.8 trillion from the roughly $1.6 trillion Mnuchin previously brought into negotiations. Pelosi is proposing the $2.2 trillion package the House has already approved.Stocks jumped after Kudlow’s remarks, with the S&P 500 Index up 1% as of 12:25 p.m. They had tumbled on Tuesday, when Trump pulled his team from stimulus negotiations.McConnell SkepticalKudlow spoke a short time after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there’s probably not enough time before the election to bridge the “vast” differences on a new virus relief package.“I believe that we do need another rescue package, but the proximity to the elections and the differences of opinion about what is needed are pretty vast,” McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky.Even if there is an agreement, it would take time to write legislative text, call lawmakers back to Washington and hold a debate and vote in Congress.And even then, Republicans may be as big an obstacle to Trump as Pelosi.McConnell has said that there are members of his GOP majority who think the government has already provided enough stimulus. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has also said his caucus members are skeptical of a large package. “We’d have to see what’s in it, but I think it’s difficult,” he said last month.In his remarks Friday, McConnell specifically highlighted the “narrowly targeted” GOP package of about a half-trillion dollars that Democrats blocked as insufficient last month.Pelosi AwaitsPelosi said she and Mnuchin will be exchanging responses to questions each side had in their earlier conversations when they talk again on Friday.“Part of it is about money, part is about policy,” she said on MSNBC. “We’ll see what they have to offer today.”Pelosi sent a letter to House Democrats Friday morning criticizing Trump for not taking the pandemic seriously enough.“The Administration does not share this priority of crushing the virus. The President does not have the capacity, leadership or plan for testing, tracing, and isolation that is needed,” Pelosi wrote. “Instead, Trump’s delay, denial, distortion of reality and disdain for science has exacted a deadly and preventable human toll.”The two sides are are divided on the issues of how much money to provide state and local governments, language restricting Trump’s ability to divert anti-virus health care spending and the level and length of supplemental unemployment benefits. Dozens of smaller issues such as funding for election security and the Postal Service also remain.The negotiations are proceeding against a frenzied backdrop, with the president recuperating from Covid-19 and the final stretch of the election campaign under way. Pelosi and Trump publicly questioned each other’s ability to perform their jobs on Thursday.The House speaker said Thursday there could be no action on a stand-alone bill to aid airlines or any other sector of the economy without an agreement with the White House and Republicans on a broader stimulus package.Pelosi said airline aid could move through Congress before a comprehensive deal is voted on -- but that would have to be advanced in the “context” of a broader bill. “I have made the case to my colleagues that this is a special case,” Pelosi said on Bloomberg TV.“There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill,” she said. Pelosi has also said this week she is pressing for language that would limit Trump’s ability to divert virus testing and treatment funds to other projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-increases-fiscal-stimulus-offer-to-1-8-trillion/story-OKFqLgqkAXNlbnH8GUEpPI.html
09-10-2020||World||Dems move bill seeking removal of Trump’s powers on medical grounds||President Donald Trump plans to return to the campaign trail with a flurry of online and in-person events, including a rally in Florida on Saturday, even as Congressional Democrats introduced a bill providing for the removal of the president’s powers on medical grounds, starting with the next term.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a legislation on Friday to set up the ‘Commission on Presidential Capacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of Office’ under US Constitution’s 25th amendment, which allows for the transfer of presidential powers to the vice-president in case of president’s death, removal, resignation or incapacitation. “This is not about President Donald Trump — he will face the judgment of the voters,” Pelosi said at a press conference at the Capitol.Trump hit back in a tweet, saying Pelosi is the one that needed to be put under observation.The president will start his return to campaigning with a “radio rally” on Friday on syndicated radio-host Rush Limbaugh’s show and then do his first on-camera interview since catching Covid-19 with Fox News, during which he will undergo a “medical evaluation” by the show’s medical contributor.Sean Conley, Trump’s physician, has cleared him for “safe return to public engagements” on Saturday, the 10th day after the president was diagnosed for Covid-19, saying Trump has “responded extremely well to treatment”. But the doctor has admitted before to projecting an “upbeat” picture of the president’s health.Citing the update from the doctor, Trump’s campaign asked the Commission on Presidential Debates to revert to in-person format for the second debate that is scheduled for October 15, which the body had declared would be held virtually. Trump had rejected the change on Thursday, demanding a delay in-person debates.Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger, had agreed to a virtual debate and also to a delayed in-person second debate. But has rejected Trump campaign’s demand for two delayed in-person debates, second of which was proposed for October 29, just four days short of November 3, Election Day.Trump, who is trailing Biden in opinion polls by a widening margin. Hampered by illness, he needs the debates to try and shore up his race. Biden has been accommodating, but made it clear he won’t be pushed around.President Trump has not been seen in public since his return to the White House on Monday, but he has shot and released video messages about his health, downplaying the severity of the epidemic while claiming he may be immune to the virus. He has also done phone interviews with Fox News anchors.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dems-move-bill-seeking-removal-of-trump-s-powers-on-medical-grounds/story-OwY6jwmtkzgu4V71QagbAL.html
09-10-2020||World||Cellphones in hand, ‘Army for Trump’ readies poll watching operation||Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes leading up to November’s election, part of an effort to find evidence to back up President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.Across key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin, Republican poll watchers will be searching for irregularities, especially with regard to mail-in ballots whose use is surging amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to more than 20 officials involved in the effort. They declined to say how many volunteers have signed up so far; the campaign earlier this year said its goal was to recruit 50,000 monitors nationwide.The mission, the officials said, is to capture photos and videos Republicans can use to support so-far unfounded claims that mail voting is riddled with chicanery, and to help their case if legal disputes erupt over the results of the Nov. 3 contest between Republican incumbent Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.The campaign is already posting material of activity it claims is suspicious, including video of a Trump campaign observer being turned away from an early voting site in Philadelphia last month. The city says monitors are welcome in polling stations on Election Day but are not permitted in early voting facilities.Some voting-rights activists are concerned such encounters could escalate in a tense year that has seen armed militias face off against protestors in the nation’s streets.Poll watching by partisan observers is a normal feature in US elections that dates back to the 18th century and is subject to various state laws and local rules.Still, this year’s operation by the Trump campaign is highly unusual, voting rights advocates say, both in its focus on early voting and in its emphasis on finding evidence to support baseless assertions by the president and his supporters that Democrats plan to flood the system with phony mail ballots to steal the election.In a recruitment video posted on Twitter in September seeking volunteers for this “Army for Trump,” the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., made the unfounded claim that Democrats plan to “add millions of fraudulent ballots” to rig the results. Trump repeatedly has refused to commit to accepting the outcome of November’s election. During the Sept. 29 presidential debate, he exhorted his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully.”Mail ballot requests are tilting heavily to Democrats in battleground states, which likely means Biden will be in the lead before in-person voting begins on Election Day.In Florida, where Republicans have historically relied on mail ballots, nearly 2.5 million Democrats have requested them, compared with about 1.7 million Republicans. In Pennsylvania, more than 1.5 million Democrats have requested a mail-in ballot, nearly triple the requests from Republicans.Republicans said they plan to monitor every step of mail voting, including setting up cameras to show people dropping off multiple ballots at drop boxes. Some states permit third-parties to drop off ballots, but the practice is banned in others, including Pennsylvania.Pat Dion, head of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania’s Bucks County, a politically divided suburb near Philadelphia, predicted the process could get messy.“There’s going to be lots of watchers, lots of cameras and lots of attorneys all across the country. It’s going to be chaotic,” said Dion, who said he nevertheless supports the effort.Democrats and voting-rights advocates say Trump is trying to suppress the vote, not protect it.“It’s an attempt to scare eligible Americans into thinking they are in danger if they go to vote,” said Myrna Perez, voting rights and elections director for the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan voting rights group.Democrats say Trump’s team is also laying the groundwork for a challenge to mail ballots in the event he loses, possibly throwing the election to Congress or the courts to decide the outcome.Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said in a statement that “President Trump’s volunteer poll watchers will be trained to ensure all rules are applied equally. And if fouls are called, the Trump Campaign will go to court to enforce the laws.”‘Make our Republican presence known’This is the first presidential election in nearly four decades that the Republican National Committee has been free to sponsor such “ballot security” operations without permission from a federal court. A 1982 consent decree restricted these activities after the party sent teams of gun-toting men to minority neighborhoods during a New Jersey election wearing uniforms saying “Ballot Security Task Force.”That consent decree expired in 2018 and a federal judge declined Democratic attempts to renew it.In Wisconsin, a state Trump won by less than a percentage point in 2016, volunteers will be posted in critically important counties around Milwaukee, Republican state party chairman Andrew Hitt told Reuters.Pennsylvania, too, is shaping up to be a hotbed of activity. Trump won it by just over 44,000 votes in 2016. He has almost no path to securing a second term if he doesn’t win its 20 Electoral College votes again in November. In Montgomery County, a formerly Republican bastion outside Philadelphia that is now reliably Democratic, the Republican Party is holding several virtual training sessions over the next two weeks for some 50 volunteers to monitor 11 proposed ballot drop boxes there, according to an email sent by the party to supporters and seen by Reuters. “It is critical that we make our Republican presence known, so voters know they cannot get away with fraud,” the email reads.On the western side of the state near Pittsburgh, Trump supporter Bob Howard has volunteered to watch election offices where voters will be dropping off absentee ballots.“We...need to make sure that all the rules are being followed, so people can trust the results,” the 70-year-old retiree said.Democrats, meanwhile, are launching their own voter-protection efforts. But theirs is a more traditional approach that includes registered poll watchers and an army of attorneys.In Pennsylvania, Biden’s campaign said it has launched the biggest such Democratic program there in history, with more than a thousand lawyers and volunteers. It would not provide details on whether its monitors will be deployed at drop boxes and other early voting locations alongside their Republican rivals.Lawsuits multiplying Election experts said the explosion of mail balloting is testing voting laws designed around in-person balloting. There is no rule book for monitors that try to enter early polling sites or challenge voters trying to drop off their ballots, said Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin & Marshall college in Pennsylvania.“It all comes down to county election officials, and what they agree can happen. All of this seems headed to a major court battle,” Madonna said.Confrontations have already emerged in Philadelphia, home to about 20% of Pennsylvania’s registered Democrats. Election administrators there defended their decision to turn away the Trump campaign operative who filmed himself attempting to enter an early voting site on Sept. 29.“To be clear: the satellite offices are not polling places and the Pennsylvania Election Code does not create a right for campaign representatives to ‘watch’ at these locations,” Andrew Richman, chief of staff to the city solicitor, said in a statement.The Trump campaign quickly filed a lawsuit seeking access for poll observers in early voting sites. That suit is pending.     In Northampton County in northeastern Pennsylvania, meanwhile, the Republican Party tried to get sheriff’s officers assigned to drop boxes to request identification from voters dropping off ballots, according to Frank DeVito, a Republican member of the Board of Elections.Pennsylvania law does not require voters to show an ID to vote. The Democratic-controlled board of elections denied that request.Undeterred, DeVito said volunteers will be watching those boxes closely.“We are telling them to take a folding chair, take video, take photos,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cellphones-in-hand-army-for-trump-readies-poll-watching-operation/story-Gk2Zyw8J6zl3M8EYPvTEcM.html
09-10-2020||World||Twitter imposes restrictions, more warning labels ahead of US election||Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the US election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more labels and restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.Twitter said in a blog post that, from next week, users will get a prompt pointing them to credible information before they can retweet content that has been labelled as misleading.It said it would add more warnings and restrictions on tweets with misleading information labels from US political figures like candidates and campaigns, as well as US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers or that get “significant engagement.”Twitter, which recently told Reuters that it was testing how to make its labelling more obvious and direct, said people will have to tap through warnings to see these tweets. Users can also only ‘quote tweet’ this content, as likes, retweets and replies will be turned off.Twitter says it has labelled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by President Trump.Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the November vote.Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud. On Thursday, Facebook Inc said it would ban calls for poll watching using “militarized language.”Twitter also announced temporary steps to slow people’s amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing ‘retweet’ will be directed first to the “quote tweet” button to encourage people to add their own commentary.It will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing ‘liked by’ recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.Twitter also said it would label tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-imposes-restrictions-more-warning-labels-ahead-of-us-election/story-glchR3xtm0JGygWWYGiroM.html
09-10-2020||World||Europe records 100,000 daily coronavirus cases for first time||Europe surpassed 100,000 daily reported COVID-19 cases for the first time on Thursday, after countries such as Russia and United Kingdom saw no respite in the mounting number of infections every day in the past five days.Cases throughout Europe have been steadily rising over the past week even as new infections in worst-affected countries such as India and Brazil have shown signs of slowing down. The epicentre of the outbreak in the European region has moved to the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and France which have reported at least over 10,000 cases each in the last three days.Russia reported its highest daily coronavirus cases ever since the last record in May on Friday, prompting Moscow authorities to mull closing bars and nightclubs.The United Kingdom recorded more than 17,000 cases on Thursday with the country’s Health Minister Matt Hancock warning that the United Kingdom was at a “perilous moment”. Many parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have introduced tougher restrictions on social interaction to try to curb the growing spread of the disease.Britain has been reeling under a double whammy of coronavirus cases skyrocketing and an alarming case-to-fatality rate of 7%, among the highest in the world. More than six of every 10,000 people have died due to the virus in the country.The country’s fatality rate is in stark contrast to the United States at 2.8%, even though the United States has recorded more than four times the total number of deaths due to the virus compared to Britain.Europe currently has recorded over 16% of total global coronavirus cases and nearly 22% of deaths worldwide due to the virus. On Thursday, when daily reported cases breached the 100,000 mark, Eastern Europe was the worst affected region with over 33,600 daily reported cases. Among the 10 countries in the region, including Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic, eight posted record increases in cases in the past week.In Northern Europe, Britain was the sole country with a mammoth caseload. New infections in the country have risen more than 2.5 times since the beginning of October showing no signs of slowing down.Italy, in the southern region of Europe, recorded over 4,000 cases for the first time since April when the country was slammed by virus. The daily number of cases in the country has been consistently rising for three months.The country has the second-highest death toll in the continent, with 36,083 dying since the outbreak erupted in February.Spain’s government invoked a state of emergency on Friday to impose a partial lockdown on Madrid. With 850 COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people, the Madrid area has Europe’s highest infection rate.In Western Europe, France recorded new daily COVID-19 infections above the record 18,000 threshold for two days in a row on Thursday, with hospitals moving to an emergency mode and its biggest cities closing down establishments to curtail further spread of the virus.Belgium too enforced stricter controls on gatherings after new infections surged in the country. New coronavirus cases rose more than 2.6 times since the beginning of October. COVID-19 has already claimed over 10,000 lives in the country, which has a population of 11 million people.In Europe, daily cases averaged around 78,000 cases for since the beginning of October, compared with an average of 47,500 cases in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-records-100-000-daily-coronavirus-cases-for-first-time/story-uiRseaduqgzx6VtoDmZovK.html
09-10-2020||World||UK to continue picking up wage bill of shut companies: Sunak||Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday announced another extension and expansion of the job support scheme that was due to be wound down later this month, benefiting companies and millions of employees, after a surge in Covid-19 cases prompted new curbs across the UK. The treasury department has already borrowed billions of pounds to fund the scheme, along with others aimed at companies and the self-employed. The state will pay two-thirds of the wages of employees of companies forced to close due to the curbs up to maximum of £2,100 a month.As several unions and industry bodies welcomed the move, Sunak said: “Throughout the crisis the driving force of our economic policy has not changed. I have always said that we will do whatever is necessary to protect jobs and livelihoods as the situation evolves.”“The expansion of the Job Support Scheme will provide a safety net for businesses across the UK who are required to temporarily close their doors, giving them the right support at the right time.”As of Friday evening, 17,540 new Covid-19 cases were recorded across the UK, thrice the daily peak in April and May; there were 77 deaths in the last 24 hours, as hospitals reported rising admissions.In addition to scheme’s expansion, Sunak increased the cash grants to businesses in England shut in local lockdowns to support with fixed costs. These grants will be linked to rateable values, with up to £3,000 per month payable every two weeks, compared to up to £1,500 every three weeks that was available previously. “This could benefit hundreds of thousands of businesses, including restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, bowling alleys and many more”, officials said. The new package is considered more generous than the earlier one implemented since April.The announcement came soon after new official figures showed Britain’s economic recovery from the Covid recession was already slowing before the launch of new restrictions in the autumn. GDP rose by 2.1% in August, falling short of forecasts of a growth rate of 4.4%, despite a boom in consumer spending at hotels, pubs and restaurants fuelled by Sunak’s popular Eat Out to Help Out scheme in August.Caroline Fairbairn of the Confederation of British Industry said: “The steep rise in infections in some areas means new restrictions to curb numbers feel unavoidable. The chancellor’s more generous job support for those under strict restrictions should cushion the blow for the most affected and keep more people in work.”“But many firms, including pubs and restaurants, will still be hugely disappointed if they have to close their doors again after doing so much to keep customers and staff safe.”Frances O’Grady of the Trade Union Congress added: “This scheme will protect jobs in businesses forced to close by local restrictions, but ministers still need to do more to stop the devastation of mass unemployment”.“Firms which aren’t required to close but will still be hit by stricter local restrictions need a more generous short-time working scheme, and there needs to be extra help for self-employed people in local lockdown areas too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-continue-picking-up-wage-bill-of-shut-companies-sunak/story-mabawDoX9C6Jm0uQ28sUqM.html

09-10-2020||World||Daily English Covid cases double in a week as UK struggles with resurgent virus||The average daily number of Covid-19 cases in England has doubled in a week, a survey showed on Friday, as scientists warned that action was needed to avert a calamitous and unnecessary spike in deaths.New cases of Covid-19 in England were around 17,200 per day in the latest week to Oct. 1, compared to 8,400 per day in the previous week, an infection survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, while another population survey said daily infections could be as many as 45,000.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to tackle a second wave of Covid-19 with local measures in an effort to avoid another national lockdown. But the surveys, which feed into government decision-making, paint a bleak picture, and government scientists warned the epidemic was still growing despite a dip in the reproduction number. “We are back to choices faced in the March ... Don’t act slower than the speed of the epidemic,” Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust and member the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said in a tweet.The ONS said an estimated 224,400 people in England had Covid-19 in the latest week, or 1 in 240 people, a 92% increase in infections compared to the previous week.The ONS looks to estimate infection numbers in the community beyond those who have been tested, giving an estimate of prevalence that is unaffected by testing capacity. Another population study, run by Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori, showed that 1 in 170 people in England had the virus between Sept. 18 and Oct. 5, with 45,000 new infections each day. “Our robust findings paint a concerning picture of the growing epidemic across England,” said Paul Elliott, of Imperial’s School of Public Health.“While certain areas are worse affected, if left unabated then infection trends will follow nation-wide and could lead to high levels of unnecessary death and illness from the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-english-covid-cases-double-in-a-week-as-uk-struggles-with-resurgent-virus/story-mI4RurOAlHlAyOWc9S4JiN.html

09-10-2020||World||Pakistan bans TikTok over indecent, immoral content||Pakistan announced on Friday that it has banned TikTok after the country’s telecom regulator received complaints against immoral, indecent, obscene and vulgar content hosted on the Chinese-owned video sharing app.The Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) said a number of complaints from different segments of the society were lodged against the app. PTA earlier issued a final notice to TikTok and gave it “considerable time to respond and comply with” instructions for development of an effective mechanism for proactive moderation of “unlawful online content”.The move was met with surprise and criticism on social media. HU Khan, a TikToker, commented, “TikTok was the only way the poor had a voice in the social media revolution that until this platform had largely passed them by. Make no mistake this isn’t a ban on TikTok. It’s a classist ban on the poor & labour working class so they don’t find a collective conscience.”Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari, daughter of former prime minister Benzir Bhutto tweeted: “Was both surprised & in awe of how much #tiktok picked up in the remotest of places across #Pakistan. Not only could people earn but freely criticise gov policies, rising prices, hypocrisy etc - banning tiktok to protect facade of Khan - reality is people are ready to overthrow!”The app, owned by China’s ByteDance, has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan and is the third-most downloaded app over the past year after WhatsApp and Facebook, local media reported citing analytics firm Sensor Tower.The short video app has a huge user base among young Pakistanis, with some attracting millions of followers.But it has come up against backlash in the ultra-conservative Islamic country, where in recent months several dating apps including Tinder and Grindr have also been banned and YouTube was threatened with shutdown.Pakistanis were unable to access the app on Friday evening.Arslan Khalid, a digital media adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan, has previously claimed the “exploitation, objectification & sexualisation of young girls on TikTok” was causing pain to parents.Earlier this week, Pakistani TikToker Jannat Mirza became the first in the country to reach 10 million followers, with lip-syncing and slow motion clips among her content.“TikTok is a major source of entertainment for lower and middle class Pakistanis, as well as illiterate citizens that includes half the population as it is video based and easy to use,” said Usama Khilji, a digital rights activist, who said the ban violates freedom of speech.Akhlaq Ahmed, who ran a TikTok account with friends from the remote town of Jhal Magsi in Balochistan province, said the news was like “losing someone from my family”.“The ban is unfair and unjustified... instead of banning the app the PTA should have called on TikTok to ban those users,” he said of the “immoral” content.Campaigners have long criticised the creeping censorship and control of Pakistan’s internet, printed and electronic media.PTA said it would review its decision if the app put in place mechanisms to moderate unlawful content.In a statement, TikTok said it was “hopeful to reach a conclusion that helps us serve the country’s vibrant and creative online community.”The app was blocked in Bangladesh last year as part of a clampdown on pornography, while Indonesia briefly blocked access over blasphemy concerns.It has also faced increasing controversy over how it collects and uses data although it has repeatedly denied sharing user information with Chinese authorities. The app is facing a possible ban in the US, after officials said it was a national security risk and President Donald Trump said he wanted it taken out of Chinese hands.India has already banned the app, along with dozens of other Chinese mobile platforms, following a border standoff with China.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bans-tiktok-over-indecent-immoral-content/story-ktv1vNrGejoHE8BihsS3DK.html

Trump will undergo a medical evaluation in a Fox News appearance Friday. And he said the Michigan governor was not appreciative enough of him after the FBI foiled a plot to kidnap her.There are 25 days until the election and 66 days until the Electoral College meets.Trump has “no interest” in a virtual debate against Biden over concerns the Democratic nominee might use a teleprompter, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday.“Joe Biden, he could barely keep up on the debate stage last time and now putting him in a forum where he has access to maybe teleprompters, who knows. The president certainly wouldn’t be there to hold him accountable,” McEnany said during a Fox News interview when asked if Trump would participate in a virtual debate.Trump’s campaign has repeatedly suggested Biden uses a teleprompter during virtual interviews and television appearances. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced earlier this week the Oct. 15 contest between Biden and Trump would no longer be held in person as a coronavirus safety precaution, after the president and several top aides became infected.Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the commission, told Fox News on Thursday there would be media stationed in both locations so that neither candidate could use a teleprompter to read answers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-continues-to-claim-that-biden-could-cheat-during-virtual-debate/story-ItscHoVsYU655qb5HoCBTM.html

In addition, X17 apologized to the family.“We apologize to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their son for the distress we have caused,” X17 said in a statement. “We were wrong to offer these photographs and commit to not doing so again.”The agency also agreed to pay a portion of the family’s legal fees, according to a Michael Kump, an attorney for the couple. “This is a successful outcome,” Kump said in a statement. “All families have a right, protected by law, to feel safe and secure at home.”Meghan, Harry and Archie now live in Los Angeles after the couple stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March to forge new careers.

09-10-2020||World||Museums sell Picasso and Warhol, embrace Black, Latino art to survive||The one-two punch of Covid-19 and the racial-justice movement has upended huge swathes of society -- work, school and health care. Below the radar, it’s also shaking the foundations of another set of US institutions -- museums -- forcing them to sell prized works and broaden the definition of great art.For generations, museums lived by a tightly scripted set of rules. They accepted tax-deductible donations and acquired artists seen as great -- mostly European and American, mostly white, mostly men. In deference to the sacredness of their task, they were permitted to sell a work only to buy another, not to keep on the lights or pay conservators.This past April, after museums from San Francisco to Maine shut their doors due to the pandemic, the Association of Art Museum Directors announced that for two years, works could be sold and the proceeds used for “direct care,” with each institution defining what that means.The impact has been profound. Museums are not only selling works long off the market but acquiring pieces by female, Black and Latino artists, and -- they hope -- gaining new visitors who will see themselves reflected in the hushed halls. In other words, they’re expanding the canon and hoping to turn this crisis into an opportunity.Masterpieces are pouring into the market. This week at Christie’s, Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York, sold its sole Jackson Pollock painting for $13 million and Springfield Museums in Massachusetts offloaded a Picasso for $4.4 million. Brooklyn Museum’s only Lucas Cranach is heading to the auction block next week while the Baltimore Museum of Art is shopping around its signature, monumental Last Supper by Andy Warhol for about $40 million.“This is really an unparalleled moment,” said Brent Benjamin, president of the museum directors association and director of the Saint Louis Art Museum. He said earlier financial crises, like the one in 2008, were hard, “but we’ve never seen anything like this.”Museums are slowly reopening but with reduced staff -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art eliminated 400 jobs during the pandemic -- and at lower capacity. They can’t hold fund-raising events in person or deepen relationships by organizing trips to international exhibitions and fairs. They’re selling to stay alive, and auction houses Sotheby’s and Christie’s are busy.Museums represent the distress in the art market while their rich patrons, for the most part, have been so far immune from forced sales. The works are extremely desirable because they’re fresh, historically significant and come from the most exalted of collections.“In the next two weeks, we’ll be making some significant announcements,” said Nina del Rio, Sotheby’s head of advisory and museum, private and corporate art services, who was granted the $65 million consignment from the Baltimore Museum of Art and smaller ones from Palm Springs Art Museum, San Diego Museum of Art and Art Institute of Chicago.Adam Levine, the new leader of the Toledo Museum of Art, says he consults often with del Rio. He is exploring if there are ways to extract liquidity from art without breaching public trust, he said. The museum got permission to use $200,000 this year in restricted funds for collection management and its staff is finalizing a plan to diversify its holdings.“Museums have amazing power,” Levine said. “When we put something on the wall, it becomes unimpeachably great.”It also becomes unimpeachably valuable, and museums are under pressure to give power and value to those who’ve been underrepresented. Levine’s first acquisition was Black artist Bisa Butler’s large-scale quilted portrait of Frederick Douglass, whose title alludes to his speech to abolish slavery.To be sure, museums have in the past sold works outside the rules and have occasionally been sanctioned for it. Most exhibit a tiny fraction of the art they own, with the rest in storage rarely if ever seeing light of day.Taking something off the wall can be precarious. Everson Museum’s sale of Pollock’s “Red Composition” drew sharp criticism. And Brooklyn Museum’s sale of the Cranach, among other works, raised eyebrows.“These aren’t easy decisions,” said Anne Pasternak, the Brooklyn Museum director. “The Cranach was an outlier in our collection and had need for restoration. Am I sad to let it go? Sure. Are there more important works in the museum collection? Yes.”She plans to sell at least $40 million worth of art in the next two years, starting with 12 pieces valued at $2.3 million to $3.6 million at Christie’s next week, and use the income to care for the 160,000 objects in the museum’s care. In Baltimore, the city’s encyclopedic museum is selling three signature works -- by Clyfford Still, Brice Marden and Warhol -- to raise $65 million.The sale of the Still especially stings some locals. A key Abstract Expressionist who spent the final decades of his life on a Maryland farm, Still gave his “157-G” painting to Baltimore as a gift. It’s estimated to sell for $12 million to $18 million and some funds are to be used to buy works by women and people of color.“The imperative to act and address decades of inaction around equality in the museum is enormously important,” said Christopher Bedford, museum director. He says the emphasis on diversity will “ensure that the story we are narrating is the full and true story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/museums-sell-picasso-and-warhol-embrace-black-latino-art-to-survive/story-WQU5D6IqGCjHT0q3IruWiL.html

09-10-2020||World||‘Covid-19 broke out in various parts of the world, China happened to report it first’: Hua Chunying||By K J M Varma Beijing, Oct 9 (PTI) China on Friday claimed that the coronavirus broke out in the various parts of the world last year but it was the only one to have reported and acted first, refuting the widely-held view that the deadly contagion originated in Wuhan before turning out to be a pandemic. China, besides denying the US allegations that Covid-19 has emerged from a bio-lab in Wuhan, also rejected that it emanated from a wet market in the central Chinese city from bats or pangolins before infecting humans. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing that “the coronavirus is a new kind of virus as more and more facts emerge as reports reveal, we all know that the epidemic broke out in various places in the world at the end of last year, while China was the first to report the outbreak, identified the pathogen and shared the genome sequence with the world.” Hua’s comments came in response to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s allegations of a cover-up by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC). The coronavirus crisis was infinitely made worse by the Chinese Communist Party’s cover-up, Pompeo had said in Tokyo at the QUAD ministerial meeting of the US, India, Australia and Japan on Tuesday. The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement was made as the World Health Organisation (WHO) was gearing up to probe the origin of the deadly coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 36 million people and killed more than 1 million across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 7.6 million cases and more than 2,12,000 deaths. China has reported 90,736 cases and 4,739 deaths due to Covid-19. The WHO has given to Beijing a list of global experts to be sent to China to probe the origin of the coronavirus, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. The WHO is awaiting its approval. In May, the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the Geneva-based WHO’s decision-making body currently headed by India, passed a unanimous resolution to probe the origin of the virus. China also backed the resolution. In August, a two-member team from the WHO, which visited China, completed the groundwork for the probe into the animal source and reservoirs of the Covid-19 which first emerged in Wuhan in December last year. On Monday, WHO health emergencies programme executive director Mike Ryan told a special meeting of the organisation’s executive board that “a list of candidates has been submitted to the Chinese authorities for their consideration and for the next steps in order to deploy that team”. Hua, while refuting Pompeo’s charge of a cover-up, said that a high-level group of Chinese scientists first identified the person-to-person transmission due to coronavirus on January 19. After a thorough research and investigation, China made the decision at the earliest and closed Wuhan city to the outside world and placed most rigorous measures in isolating Wuhan city and Hubei province, Hua said. She said that the CPC Politburo discussed the virus outbreak on the first day of the Lunar New Year in January and convened a meeting on the outbreak of its 31 provinces and municipalities, and activated the level one emergency response. “On January 23 as China placed Wuhan on lockdown, there were only nine confirmed cases outside China and the US had only one. “On February 2, when the US closed its border to the Chinese citizens, the US only officially confirmed a dozen cases. Now the confirmed cases in the US exceeded 7.5 million and 2.10 lakh deaths,” she said. “How could the most powerful country on earth with the best medical resources on hand screw up the tests so badly. Why hasn’t the US discovered this virus at the earliest and why hasn’t it taken prompt measures to test as many people as possible to prevent and control the spread of this virus?” Hua asked. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”.

The move escalates a standoff between Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s government and the conservative-led Madrid regional chief who believes the curbs are illegal, excessive and disastrous for the local economy.Many of the 3.8 million people affected in the capital city and nine satellite towns were bemused and cars continued to pour out for a holiday weekend.“I feel bad because I don’t know how to act, what to do, if I’m doing things right or wrong, and I feel totally misruled by our politicians who are just not up to the job,” said 64-year-old retiree Jesus Doria.Following a Health Ministry order, Madrid authorities last week reluctantly barred all non-essential travel in and out of the city and other nearby towns. The region had 723 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the two weeks to Oct. 8, according to the World Health Organization, making it Europe’s second densest cluster after Andorra.‘What do we do now?’But instead of a blanket restriction, the Madrid region chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso wants tailored restrictions in different neighbourhoods according to local contagion levels.A Madrid court sided with her on Thursday, effectively suspending the restrictions until the government responded with its two-week emergency order. “We had an alternative plan we have been defending until the last moment, but it has not been possible, which is a pity. The state of emergency was totally avoidable,” Madrid region spokesman Ignacio Aguado told reporters.“As usual, it’s the citizens who face the consequences, they don’t know if they can go on vacation,” he added as Spaniards prepared for a long holiday weekend to mark Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492.It was unclear when the restrictions enforced by the state of emergency would come in. TV footage showed lines of cars on the main highways out of Madrid on Friday afternoon for what is usually one of the busiest weekends for domestic tourism.“I feel a little disconcerted and surprised and now everyone is saying, ‘I’m going away for the weekend, no I’m not, what do we do now?’,” said Esther, 45, in Madrid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-cases-rise-in-spain-govt-invokes-state-of-emergency-in-madrid/story-SgZVAPDMXSGlExCsPXvfHI.html

Both sides have no-deal plans.Barnier, who left London on Friday just 12 hours after arriving, wants a few more concessions from Britain before entering the so called “tunnel” - the final stretch of highly secretive, make-or-break negotiations.“We need to get a little bit more from the UK side before he (Barnier) … is ready to enter the tunnel,” said a senior EU diplomat.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said some progress had been made but the two sides did not yet see eye to eye on all matters.“We’ve had useful discussions this week and progress has been made in some areas. However, there still remain differences on some important issues,” the spokesman said.Johnson has set a deadline of the Oct. 15 EU summit for a deal, and while his top Brexit advisers say that additional work on a text would have to follow, they have warned the EU that they will not do a deal at any price.As he grapples with a swiftly accelerating second wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Johnson will ultimately have to make the final call on whether to accept a narrow trade deal or go for a more tumultuous no-deal that could be blamed on the EU.He has repeatedly said that his preference is for a deal but that Britain could make a success of a no-deal scenario, which would throw $900 billion in annual bilateral trade into uncertainty and could snarl the border, turning the southeastern county of Kent into a vast truck park.DEAL TIME?After Johnson’s bid to undercut the 2020 Brexit divorce treaty, there are fears that London is employing what one European diplomat said was Madman Theory - a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon’s attempt to convince Moscow that he was irrational during the Cold War.“You always need to do contingency planning, I mean the end of the year is approaching rapidly and we still don’t know whether there’s going to be a deal or not,” said the EU diplomat.“Companies need to prepare, but also in addition they need to prepare for a no deal. But that does not mean that we feel that a deal is impossible - I think it’s still very well possible.”One emotive trouble spot is fishing.The EU wants to secure consistent rights to fish in British waters, an important issue for France where coastal fishing communities are politically influential. Britain wants a deal more like that of non-EU member Norway, under which quotas are set each year.“I do not believe that … this (fisheries stand-off) will be a major impediment to an EU-UK agreement,” the EU diplomat said.“What I see now is that the UK is, you know, trying to say ‘OK, you know, this is really valuable, it’s a matter of sovereignty’ - but they see it as a lever to gain market access to the European Union. I think that’s the game that we’re seeing right now.” (Reporting by John Chalmers in Brussels and Guy Faulconbridge in London; Editing by John Stonestreet and Hugh Lawson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-talks-eu-seeks-more-concessions-from-uk-as-deadline-looms/story-gdQRDF2Lu3cv5R41rT2alL.html
09-10-2020||World||New India-UK defence logistics pact on cards reflects policy shift in London||India and the UK are in the final stages of agreeing on a key defence logistics pact, reflecting a policy shift in London as the Boris Johnson government finalises its one-in-a-generation Integrated Review of Britain’s foreign policy, defence and international development in the post-Brexit world.Experts say the MoU is part of a new approach to India and Asia that will be outlined in the high-level review to be released in November, as the UK prepares for a future outside the European Union from January 1.The review, intended to take into account the current and projected domestic and global context in 2030, was commissioned by Johnson as a policy-led, evidence-driven, whole-of-government process, going beyond the parameters of a traditional defence and security reviews.The official announcement on Wednesday that the ‘Defence Logistics MoU’ is in the final stages of agreement between New Delhi and London is part of several defence-related deliverables in the pipeline. It is seen as London beginning to move beyond attempts to ‘balance’ relationships.Avinash Paliwal, an international relations expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies, said on Friday: “A defence logistics pact between India and the UK is significant for multiple reasons. Apart from the military strategic value of such a pact, especially in the IOR (Indian Ocean Rim), it signals a foreign policy shift on London’s part on the China and Pakistan questions”. “For long, the UK has tried to balance relations between China and the US, as well as India and Pakistan. Such a defence logistics pact affords clarity of intent i.e. the UK is increasingly wary of China, and is unlikely to let Pakistan’s sensitivities hinder a truly strategic partnership with India (something that has been the case for many years).”Indicating that India would emerge as a key theme in the UK’s post-Brexit worldview, Jan Thompson, acting high commissioner of the UK to India, said in a recent webinar that India will “come through as a very strong theme” in the Integrated Review.The review would “underscore the centrality of India to Britain’s view of the world,” Jo Johnson, member of the House of Lords and former minister, told the webinar organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and the Vivekananda International Foundation.Among the key drivers of change over the next decade identified by the review is “a shift in the international order, marked by intensifying great power competition and a shift in the world’s economic centre of gravity towards Asia.”Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, senior fellow at IISS, said: “The UK’s once-in-a-generation security review with a tilt towards the Indo-Pacific, growing convergence on China and the recent government-to-government arms transfer pact, set the political context for boosting bilateral defence links and maritime security cooperation in the western Indian Ocean”. Outstanding issues in the bilateral relationship include illegal migration, anti-India elements operating from UK soil and the long-held perception in New Delhi of London’s pro-Pakistan tilt. But there are indications that some of these seemingly intractable issues may not hinder India emerging as a “very strong theme” in the review.Paliwal added: “To be clear, the UK would not want to jeopardise bilateral relations with Pakistan given the sizeable Pakistani diaspora in the UK and Rawalpindi’s support for London’s counter-terrorism efforts. But, for a change, London has begun looking at India from a security-strategic perspective, instead of a purely economic lens.”“The defence logistics pact (unlikely to be challenged by the Labour Party under Keir Starmer’s leadership, who has also ameliorated the party’s stand on Kashmir more to India’s liking), will set a new more collaborative tone between India and the UK, and help reducing mistrust in New Delhi about the UK’s ‘pro-Pakistan’ inclinations in the long run,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-india-uk-defence-logistics-pact-on-cards-reflects-policy-shift-in-london/story-2qBXEOxgnZwa7Xr3rzN4jO.html

India banned TikTok on June 2020 along with more than 150 other mobile applications citing that they were ‘prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.’ The move came weeks after the People’s Liberation Army of China tried to alter the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-blocks-chinese-app-tiktok-over-vulgar-content-reports-pak-media/story-yyYaBKnWmuf44PWOAQjeyL.html
09-10-2020||World||Donald Trump maps return to campaign trail after White House says Covid-19 treatment complete||Republican President Donald Trump on Friday prepared to return to the campaign trail with a pair of weekend rallies after his Covid-19 diagnosis sidelined him for a week in the race against Democratic nominee Joe Biden for the White House.Trump, who announced he had been infected with the coronavirus on Oct. 2 and spent three nights in a military hospital receiving treatment, said late on Thursday he was feeling “really good” and, with a doctor’s blessing, aimed to campaign in Florida on Saturday and in Pennsylvania on Sunday.Trump’s illness has kept him from crisscrossing the country to rally support and raise cash in the final weeks before the Nov. 3 election. A return to in-person events would be aimed at convincing voters he is healthy enough to campaign and to govern.While Trump has released several videos on Twitter, he has not appeared in public since he returned home from the hospital on Monday. He is scheduled to do an on-camera interview with Fox News on Friday night, his first since being diagnosed. He told the network late on Thursday he was likely to be tested for the virus on Friday. The White House has declined to say when he last tested negative for the disease.U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines say people who are severely ill with COVID-19 might need to stay home for up to 20 days after symptoms first appear.Biden has continued to campaign during Trump’s illness, with events scheduled on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada. The former vice president, who has sharply criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic, is beating the Republican in national polls, though that lead is narrower in some of the swing states that may determine the election’s outcome. White House physician Sean Conley said in a memo released on Thursday that Trump had completed his course of therapy for Covid-19, remained stable since returning home from the hospital and could resume public engagements on Saturday. Sounding hoarse and occasionally pausing and clearing his throat, Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview on Thursday night that he was doing well.“I feel so good,” Trump said. The president is expected to host a “virtual rally” on Friday by appearing on conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh’s radio program. The Trump and Biden campaigns sparred on Thursday over a televised debate that had been planned for next week. Trump pulled out after the nonpartisan commission in charge said the Oct. 15 event would be held virtually with the candidates in separate locations because of health and safety concerns after Trump contracted COVID-19. Biden’s campaign arranged a town hall-style event in Philadelphia instead.Trump’s White House and campaign have experienced an outbreak of the virus in the last week, with multiple top aides, including the president’s press secretary and campaign manager, testing positive. Trump and his staff have largely eschewed wearing masks, against the guidance of health professionals. They have also held rallies with thousands of people in indoor and outdoor venues despite recommendations against having events with large crowds.Trump’s health will remain in the spotlight even if he begins holding events again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-maps-return-to-campaign-trail-after-white-house-says-covid-19-treatment-complete/story-cp5I0UG1yLGqNB4EWUKr6K.html
09-10-2020||World||Most US shoppers say they won’t set foot in a mall this year||For most Americans, this holiday shopping season won’t include one longtime staple: the mall.Just 45% of US consumers plan to go to a shopping mall this season, down from 64% who visited last November and December, according to an International Council of Shopping Centers survey released Friday.The forecast is a fresh blow to American malls already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended the economy, shifted spending habits and made people wary of crowded places. Dozens of mall-based retailers have filed for bankruptcy this year, including J.C. Penney Co. and J. Crew.This year will also bring an increase in e-commerce and deals spread out over a longer period, the council found. More than three-quarters of respondents said they expected to start shopping earlier than usual this year.Even with the changing behaviors, a majority of American holiday shoppers -- about eight in 10 -- said they will still spend in a physical store during the coming months. More than half of respondents plan to purchase more from small businesses hurt by the Covid-19 outbreak.Malls usually shine during the holidays, serving as gathering places where families can browse, eat and take pictures on Santa’s lap. But health concerns have been ever-present since the pandemic began. In the ICSC report, which surveyed 1,004 US respondents from Sept. 28 to 30, Baby Boomers -- whose age puts them at higher risk for the coronavirus -- were least likely to say they would visit a mall this holiday season.Unusual YearGiven the anomalous nature of this year, the trends may not represent a death knell for malls, according to ICSC Chief Executive Officer Tom McGee.“We have to look at this year somewhat in isolation,” he said in an interview. “We’re in the midst of a pandemic and that’s clearly going to temper people’s appetite for going out to public spaces.”Malls should play up their advantages over online retailers, he said, such as experiential elements.“A big part of the holiday is creating that holiday mood experience, so you’ll see a lot of investment in that,” McGee said. “Walking around a mall that’s heavily decorated with music playing and so forth does put you in a holiday mood that you’re not going to get sitting behind a PC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-shoppers-say-they-won-t-set-foot-in-a-mall-this-year/story-sZPPVTi8sidFN9tQh5fFGL.html
09-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: With pandemic dominating election, are older voters turning away from Trump?||Many older Americans have turned away from President Donald Trump this year as the coronavirus ravages the country, eroding an important Republican support base that helped propel him into the White House in 2016, Reuters/Ipsos polling data shows.Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden now split American voters aged 55 years and older almost evenly: 47% say they are voting for Biden on Nov. 3 while 46% back Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos national surveys in September and October. That could be an alarming sign for the president, who trails Biden with 25 days to go before the election. Republicans have relied on the support of older Americans in national elections for years, routinely benefiting from a demographic that consistently shows up in force on Election Day.Trump won the 55-plus age group by 13 percentage points in 2016, according to exit polls. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, achieved the same margin.Reuters/Ipsos state polls also show Biden outperforming Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, among older voters in a handful of battleground states, where seniors make up an outsized proportion of the electorate. Winning those states will be critical to the outcome of the 2020 race: whoever takes the most battleground states will be on track to win the Electoral College and the White House.Biden is beating Trump among older voters in Wisconsin by 10 points and drawing about the same amount of support as Trump is with that demographic in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Arizona, according to the state polls conducted in mid-September and early October. Four years ago, Trump won older voters in each of those states by 10 to 29 points.Half of the older voters in the five battleground states blamed the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country - nearly 7.6 million cases and more than 210,000 deaths - on “poor leadership and policy decisions from President Trump,” the polls show.Randy Bode, 59, a Republican in Douglas, Arizona, who voted for Trump in 2016, said he was disappointed with Trump’s suggestion that people could protect themselves from COVID-19 by drinking bleach. “He shouldn’t be saying the things he’s saying” about the coronavirus, he said.Bode, who is now undecided, is also concerned about Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and how that would leave millions of Americans without health insurance during a health crisis.“He’s had four years to come up with a plan, and he hasn’t done it,” he said.A DETERIORATING BASETrump’s standing with older Americans has deteriorated this year as the novel coronavirus swept the country, closing thousands of businesses and overwhelming the health care system that seniors rely on more than others.Sixty-one percent said this week in a national Reuters/Ipsos poll that they disapprove of the president’s handling of the coronavirus, up 12 percentage points from May. And Trump’s net approval for his response to the virus dropped among all Americans to its lowest level since Reuters started asking the question in early March. Among older Americans, 83% were concerned about the threat that the coronavirus poses to their personal health and safety. “Seniors were much more worried about COVID than younger Americans,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist whose firm has spotted a similar trend in its polling data.Trump’s campaign has been working to stop the bleeding, and last weekend he dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to campaign at The Villages, the conservative retirement community in central Florida.On Thursday, while still convalescing at the White House from his recent coronavirus infection, the president addressed America’s seniors in a video, calling them his “favorite people in the world” and pledging to make new virus-fighting drugs available to them for free. “You are vulnerable and so am I,” Trump said. “We’re going to take care of our seniors.”The Trump campaign pointed to an executive order he signed last year aimed at bolstering Medicare, the national insurance program for Americans 65 and older.“President Trump and his administration remain laser-focused on protecting our most vulnerable citizens, including our nation’s senior citizens,” said Ken Farnaso, a Trump campaign spokesman. Biden is also pitching directly to older voters, particularly in Arizona and Florida.His campaign has been running ads featuring a Florida couple who can’t see their grandchildren because of the pandemic. Other ads have focused on Trump’s threat to eliminate the payroll tax, which funds Social Security. Conant said Trump needs to figure out how to bring seniors back into the fold - and fast.“It’s crucial,” he said. “Trump will not win without strong support from senior voters.” (Reporting by Chris Kahn and James Oliphant, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Sonya Hepinstall)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-with-pandemic-dominating-election-are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/story-opW0YpDZEHxPKtSoouUZnO.html

At Northumbria University, there were also 619 new cases and Durham University confirmed 219 cases in students in the last week.Most universities are planning to switch to online teaching for at least three weeks, except in cases where in-person lessons are essential.Newcastle University said “the overwhelming majority of cases” were from “social and residential settings” and said appropriate measures were being taken to protect everyone on campus.“We expected to see cases rise in light of the increase in cases both locally and nationally and all HE (higher education) institutions have to manage this on an ongoing basis,” a spokesperson said.“We feel confident that we have appropriate measures in place to protect us all while we are on campus and to reduce the potential for transmission in our community,” the spokesperson said. Durham University has asked students living in two colleges to remain on campus for the next week following the sharp rise in cases and Northumbria University said it was “continuing to make extensive efforts” to provide support for its self-isolating students with online concierge services or food parcels delivered by staff and the students’ union. Meanwhile, Leeds University said 555 students and three staff members tested positive between September 28 and October 4. “We are acutely aware that behind each number is an individual with their own needs and concerns, and ensuring the safety, health and wellbeing of everyone is our absolute priority,” said the university’s Vice Chancellor Professor Simone Buitendijk. Manchester’s two main universities – Manchester University and Manchester Metropolitan University – had earlier announced suspension of all in-person teaching for the rest of October, with the exemption of a few practical training courses. In a joint statement, the universities told local media that they met with public health authorities and Manchester City Council following a “significant increase in the number of COVID cases across the city of Manchester”. It comes amid growing concerns for student well-being on university campuses, with many reporting troubles with accessing essentials as they go into compulsory quarantine. Universities UK, the organisation that represents the country’s leading universities, published a checklist this week as a guide for universities supporting students who are self-isolating. “Self-isolation is key to containing the spread of COVID-19. Where it is necessary for students to self-isolate, university staff and students’ unions are making huge efforts to take care of both their physical and emotional wellbeing, including access to testing and health care, mental health support, continuing learning online, safe social interaction, food deliveries, laundry, and financial support,” said Alistair Jarvis, Chief Executive of Universities UK.“This checklist builds on previous guidance published by Universities UK to ensure universities continue to provide each and every student with the support they need,” he said.

US President Donald Trump claimed credit for the British decision.“The West must urgently unite to advance a counterweight to China’s tech dominance,” Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence committee, said. “We must not surrender our national security for the sake of short-term technological development.”The committee did not go into detail about the exact nature of the ties but said it had seen clear evidence of Huawei collusion with “the Chinese Communist Party apparatus”.Huawei said the report lacked credibility.“It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,” a Huawei spokesman said.When asked about the committee’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that some in the UK should think before they speak, and that the legitimate interests of Chinese companies were being damaged.“The openness and fairness of the UK market, as well as the security of foreign investments there, is highly concerning,” she said, speaking at a daily news conference in Beijing on Friday.Trump identifies China as the United States’ main geopolitical rival, and has accused the Communist Party-ruled state of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which he calls the “China plague”.Washington and its allies say Huawei technology could be used to spy for China. Huawei has repeatedly denied this, and says the United States is simply jealous of its success.British ministers say the rise to global dominance of Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People’s Liberation Army engineer, has caught the West off guard.The defence committee said it supported Johnson’s decision to eventually purge Huawei from Britain’s 5G network but noted that “developments could necessitate this date being moved forward, potentially to 2025” to be economically feasible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-colluded-with-the-chinese-communist-party-apparatus-uk-parliament/story-MH6xFgCF3JDtryG9iFjt7H.html
09-10-2020||World||As German Covid-19 cases rise, Merkel set to meet 11 mayors||German Chancellor Angela Merkel was meeting Friday with the mayors of the country’s largest cities as Germany’s coronavirus numbers continue to rise, primarily in metropolitan areas.Merkel was to meet by video conference with 11 mayors in the early afternoon to discuss what should be done to slow the spread of the virus.Germany has won wide plaudits for slowing the spread of the coronavirus when it first broke out but is grappling with what to do now that it seems to be picking up again.Berlin’s mayor Michael Mueller told reporters Friday that large gatherings had to be avoided and people need to take precautions on public transport, among other things.“We need to prevent a lockdown,” he said.Germany’s disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 4,516 new cases of coronavirus overnight Friday, and many cities have now reached the critical warning level of 50 new infections per 100,000 residents.Berlin’s figure was at 51 per 100,000 residents, while Bremen was at 53.9, and Cologne and Essen were close, with 49.8 and 48.4 per 100,000 respectively, according to the Robert Koch Institute.Overall, German has counted 314,660 coronavirus cases, with 9,589 deaths, a toll one-fourth that of Britain and one-third that of Italy.Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday he was “very concerned” and urged Germans to respect social distancing and hygiene measures to avoid reaching a point “where we lose control.”___Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-german-covid-19-cases-rise-merkel-set-to-meet-11-mayors/story-45GUdDUZS7OosIKK00eO7N.html
09-10-2020||World||World Food Programme: Five things to know||The UN’s World Food Programme, which won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, delivers food assistance in emergencies, from wars to civil conflicts, natural disasters and famines.Here are five facts about the Rome-based organisation:- Beginnings -Created in 1962 on the request of US President Dwight Eisenhower as an experiment to provide food aid through the UN system, WFP had only existed a few months when an earthquake struck northern Iran.Over 12,000 people died. WFP sent survivors 1,500 metric tons of wheat, 270 tons of sugar and 27 tons of tea.Others soon needed its help: a typhoon made landfall in Thailand; war refugees needed feeding in Algeria.In 1963 WFP’s first school meals project was born. In 1965, the agency became a fully-fledged UN programme.By 2019, it would come to assist 97 million people in 88 countries. WFP says that on any given day it has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes on the move. It distributes over 15 billion rations of food yearly.- Mission -WFP focuses on emergency assistance as well as rehabilitation and development aid. Two-thirds of its work is in conflict-affected countries, where people are three times more likely to be undernourished than elsewhere.It works closely with the other two Rome-based UN agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which helps countries draw up policy and change legislation to support sustainable agriculture, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which finances projects in poor rural areas.WFP is funded entirely by voluntary donations, most of which comes from governments. It raised $8 billion in 2019, which it says was used to provide 4.2 million metric tons of food and $2.1 billion of cash and vouchers.It has more than 17,000 staff, with 90 percent based in the countries where the agency provides assistance.- Where in the world? -There are few places where the WFP has not provided assistance. In western Sahel in the 1970s, ravaged by drought, it used “everything in its power -- from car to camel, from road to river -- to assist those in need”.It delivered 2 million tons of food during Ethiopia’s 1984 famine. It was present in Sudan, Rwanda, and in Kosovo, then later in Asia after the 2004 tsunami, and Haiti’s 2010 earthquake.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is suffering the second largest hunger crisis in the world, it assisted 6.9 million people in 2019, as well as helping fight a deadly Ebola virus outbreak.It helps 4.5 million people in war-torn Syria and 300,000 acutely malnourished children in conflict-struck Nigeria.But WFP’s largest emergency response has been in Yemen, where it tries to feed 13 million people each month.- Hunger today and coronavirus -Over 821 million people in the world are chronically hungry, while another 135 million are facing severe hunger or starvation, and an additional 130 million could join them by the end of 2020 due to coronavirus, the agency warns.The number of severely food insecure people in the world had already risen nearly 70 percent over the past four years, and the economic fallout from the virus pandemic is expected to spark “a hunger pandemic”, WFP said.“We urgently need more support from donors, who of course are already hard-pressed by the impact of the pandemic in their own countries”.- Coronavirus -WFP’s logistics services used a network of hubs, passenger and cargo airlinks, and medical evacuation services to enabled a steady flow of cargo and workers to the frontlines of the pandemic. The coronavirus fallout is being felt hardest in Latin America, which has seen an almost three-fold rise in the numbers of people requiring food assistance, as well as West, Central and Southern Africa.“Before the coronavirus even became an issue, I was saying that 2020 would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II,” WFP’s executive director David Beasley told the UN security council this year.“With Covid-19, we are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-programme-five-things-to-know/story-mjTqXYdZtF0OIzwNP4bvFM.html

Cook said she was disappointed.Last week, public elementary schools in New York City welcomed back students to the classroom as part of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s blended learning plan after a months-long hiatus.But this week New York officials began imposing fresh restrictions to curb a worrying rise in infections in several ‘hot spots.’Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “I’m disappointed because I don’t think that the location of our school really puts us in jeopardy,” Cook, a real estate broker, said on Thursday. “The neighborhood and parents are scrambling.”The school, in the Windsor Terrace-Kensington area of Brooklyn, is located in a so-called ‘orange zone.’ Schools in those zones have been ordered shut as part of new rules imposed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to try to stamp out the virus in several parts of the state, including neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.A group of parents and their children gathered outside the school on Thursday morning to protest, flanked by two local politicians.Its postal code was “not a Covid hotspot & the schools do not meet any of the agreed upon metrics for closing,” New York State Assembly Member Robert Carroll, who attended the protest, wrote in a Twitter post.De Blasio told reporters on Thursday that 169 schools had closed in the city under the governor’s rules, 61 more than under a plan he had put forward on Sunday that delineated the neighborhoods where closures would be enforced using ZIP codes.Click here for compete coronavirus coverage The mayor’s plan drew scorn from Cuomo, a fellow Democrat with whom he has often feuded. The governor on Tuesday released new color-coded maps delineating closures, sowing confusion among residents.New York is one of about 30 out of 50 US states where cases have risen over the past two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis. Nationally, both cases and the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients are rising, hitting record levels in the upper Midwest and West.Backlash continues In New York, the rapid spread of new infections in so-called ‘clusters’ has alarmed health officials who fear the city, once the US epicenter of the pandemic, could see a second wave.As well as school closures, new restrictions aimed at damping down transmission in the clusters’ ‘red zones’ include capping religious gatherings at 10 people. Many of the clusters are areas that include Orthodox Jewish communities.That has led to a backlash among some members of the community, who say they have been singled out without sufficient consultation. Brooklyn’s Borough Park saw angry protests on Tuesday and Wednesday.On Wednesday evening, Jacob Kornbluh, a well-known journalist working for Jewish Insider, said he was assaulted and beaten by protesters after they recognized him.Police did not respond to a request for comment, but the attack drew the condemnation of the World Jewish Congress, which represents Jewish communities worldwide, as well as both city and state officials.“There’s no excuse for violence, especially against a reporter,” Cuomo said. “It was disgusting behavior, frankly.”Other Jewish community leaders have come out in support of the steps taken by authorities to try and contain the outbreaks.“We support the governor’s and mayor’s efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 by using a data-driven, geographically-based approach,” said Matt Nosanchuk, the president of the New York Jewish Agenda, in a statement released on Thursday.Legal challenges have already begun in the US District Court in Brooklyn, arguing Cuomo’s zones are unconstitutional.In one lawsuit, a Brooklyn law firm in a red zone said the governor’s “arbitrary” line-drawing forced it to shut down though it has had no infections and did nothing wrong, depriving it of due process.Another lawsuit from three Orthodox Jewish synagogues in Brooklyn and Queens said limiting the size of gatherings violated their religious rights.In response, Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Cuomo, released a statement. “We’ve been sued virtually every day for every action taken. We’re concentrating on reducing the virus in these hot spots and saving lives, period,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-parents-scramble-to-deal-with-new-school-closures-as-covid-19-resurges/story-UdxEbqNOA5XmJfgukgvepL.html
09-10-2020||World||Battered Louisiana coast braces for 1 more: Hurricane Delta||Boarded windows and empty sidewalks made parts of Louisiana’s Acadiana region look like empty movie sets as major Hurricane Delta roared ever closer to the U.S. Gulf coast, apparently on track to smash into the same southwestern part of the state where Hurricane Laura blasted ashore six weeks ago.Forecasters said Delta — the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season — would likely crash ashore Friday evening somewhere on southwest Louisiana’s coast. The question was whether it would remain at devastating Category 3 strength or drop just before landfall to a still extremely dangerous Category 2 storm — with winds falling below 110 miles per hour (177 kph).Either way, people in this battered coastal region were taking Delta seriously.“You can always get another house another car but not another life,” said Hilton Stroder as he and his wife Terry boarded up their Abbeville home with plans to head to their son’s house further east.As Delta churned north at 12 mph (19 kph) on Friday morning, the National Hurricane Center had a hurricane warning in place for the Gulf Coast extending from High Island, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana.It marked the sixth time this season that Louisiana has been threatened by tropical storms or hurricanes. One fizzled at the southeast Louisiana tip and others veered elsewhere but Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June. And Laura demolished much of the southwestern part of the state on Aug. 27, causing more than 30 deaths.Life wasn’t at a complete standstill though. A gas station was doing steady business as people filled their cars and spare gasoline cans and a grocery store served last customers stocking up. Similar scenes played out not far away in New Iberia, where the few signs of life included cars lined up at a drive-thru daquiri shop and people grabbing food at take-out restaurants.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards noted in a radio show that Delta appeared headed for the area near the Texas state line that was devastated by Laura, including Lake Charles and surrounding Calcasieu Parish, and rural Cameron Parish on the coast. “And we’ve got people who are very tired,” he noted.“People of Lake Charles and in Cameron Parish have already suffered enough, and then here comes this one,” said Desi Milligan, who owns an RV park in Cameron that was heavily damaged by Laura.Reminders of Laura’s danger are everywhere in the region. In nearby Bell City, some debris piles are more than 6 feet (2 meters) high and 75 feet (23 meters) long. Concerns mounted Friday that Delta’s arrival would cause the debris to become airborne, deadly projectiles.Though homes and farmhouses in the area still stood, many rooftops with lingering damage from Laura were covered in blue tarps. In Cameron Parish, power poles along Highway 27 in a desolate stretch of marsh were all either broken or leaning — none appeared to have been repaired since the August storm. A few miles down the road, Creole presented a scene of utter devastation under an overcast sky that soon gave way to pouring rain. Where there used to be buildings, exposed slabs remained. A church and a convenience store had been reduced to debris, and fences were blown over or completely torn down.Delta had already clipped Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 2 hurricane just south of the resort city of Cancún early Wednesday, bringing high winds and heavy rain. No deaths or injuries were reported there.New Orleans, well east of the projected landfall area, was expected to escape Delta’s worst impacts. But tropical storm force winds were still likely in the city on Friday, and local officials said they were preparing for the possibility of tornadoes.And in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency like his counterpart Edwards did in Louisiana. Forecasters said southern Mississippi could see heavy rain and flash flooding.In Abbeville, Tony Russo was loading up on groceries late Thursday. “I don’t know really any different,” he replied when asked his reaction to the busy storm season. “You’re here. If you love it you stay,“ he said. But he added with a chuckle: “2020 has been a hell of a year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battered-louisiana-coast-braces-for-1-more-hurricane-delta/story-4kXOVZ5jcCbqevCDcGpl7I.html

The Kremlin said Putin’s initiative followed a series of calls with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.The latest outburst of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces began Sept. 27 and marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994.The Kremlin said Putin proposed calling a cease-fire to exchange prisoners and collect the bodies of dead soldiers, adding that the top Azerbaijani and Armenian diplomats were invited to Moscow for consultations.The Russian Foreign Ministry said they confirmed their attendance Friday, but there was no immediate comment from Armenia or Azerbaijan to the Russian initiative.Azerbaijani officials and Nagorno-Karabakh separatist authorities said heavy shelling continued overnight.Fighting with heavy artillery, warplanes and drones has engulfed Nagorno-Karabakh despite numerous international calls for a cease-fire. Both sides have accused each other of targeting residential areas and civilian infrastructure.On Thursday, a historic cathedral in the town of Shusha in Nagorno-Karabakh came under shelling, a shell piercing its dome and damaging the interior. No one was hurt in the attack, but hours later more shelling wounded two Russian journalists inspecting the damage. The Azerbaijani military denied targeting the cathedral.According to the Nagorno-Karabakh military, 350 of its servicemen have been killed since Sept. 27. Azerbaijan hasn’t provided details on its military losses. Scores of civilians on both sides also have been killed.Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, has been under intense shelling. Residents are staying in shelters, some of which are in the basements of apartment buildings.Facing international calls for a cease-fire, Azerbaijan made its acceptance conditional on Armenia’s withdrawal from the region.Armenian officials allege that Turkey is involved in the conflict and is sending Syrian mercenaries to fight on Azerbaijan’s side. Turkey has publicly backed Azerbaijan in the conflict but has denied sending fighters to the region.____Associated Press writers Avet Demourian in Yerevan, Armenia and Aida Sultanova in Baku, Azerbaijan contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-russia-offers-to-host-cease-fire-talks/story-UVJWLHc4xS7uCT64ZiNeoN.html

Funded countries will receive enough doses to vaccinate up to 20% of their population in the longer term, GAVI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-purchase-covax-vaccines-for-1-of-population-foreign-ministry/story-2Y6EAVvVyEomGu22jPC9SO.html
09-10-2020||World||World Food Programme awarded 2020 Nobel Peace Prize||The World Food Program on Friday won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger and food insecurity around the globe.The announcement was made in Oslo by Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Nobel Committee.The Nobel Committee said that the coronavirus pandemic has added to the hunger faced by millions of people around the world and called on governments to ensure that WFP and other aid organizations receive the financial support necessary to feed them.There was no shortage of causes or candidates on this year’s list, with 211 individuals and 107 organizations nominated ahead of the February 1 deadline.However, the Norwegian Nobel Committee maintains absolute secrecy about whom it favors for arguably the world’s most prestigious prize.The award comes with a 10-milion krona ($1.1 million) cash prize and a gold medal to be handed out at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway, on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death. This year’s ceremony will be scaled down due to the pandemic.On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday’s prize for physics honored breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize on Wednesday went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool. The literature prize was awarded to American poet Louise Glück on Thursday for her “candid and uncompromising” work.Still to come next week is the prize for outstanding work in the field of economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-programme-awarded-2020-nobel-peace-prize/story-CZBp2dvJd2xxTJ0M7yfZAO.html
09-10-2020||World||Almost 3 million migrants stranded due to Covid measures, says United Nations||More than 2.7 million migrants who wished to return home have been stranded abroad because of restrictions put in place to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations said on Friday.The world needs to urgently step up cooperation to allow people to return in a safe manner despite the coronavirus constraints, said the UN’s International Organization for Migration.The IOM warned in a report that border closures and travel bans had left large numbers of migrants stranded.It defined stranded migrants as people outside their country of habitual residence who wanted to return home but were being prevented by restrictions related to the pandemic.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIOM chief Antonio Vitorino urged countries to do more for the roughly 2.75 million people stuck in limbo.“The scope and subsequent enforcement of tens of thousands of mobility restrictions, including border closures and nationwide lockdowns related to Covid-19, requires states to reach out to their neighbours and to migrants’ countries of origin to address their needs and vulnerabilities,” he said in a statement.“Migrants can be returned home in a safe and dignified manner despite the constraints imposed by Covid-19.”IOM said it had calculated the 2.75 million figure from official sources on known cases up to July 13 of migrants stranded abroad in need of assistance, including food, water, shelter and repatriation.They include seasonal workers, temporary residence holders, international students, migrants who travelled for medical treatment and seafarers.The Middle East and North Africa had the most stranded migrants, with 1.26 million stuck, followed by Asia and the Pacific with 977,000.There were a further 203,000 in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and 111,000 in North and Central America and the Caribbean, it found.‘Large underestimation’Based on data from 382 locations in more than 101 countries, it “is considered a large underestimation of the number of migrants stranded or otherwise impacted by Covid-19”, IOM said.The IOM said it had received requests to assist nearly 115,000 stranded migrants to return home safely and voluntarily, and had been able to do so for more than 15,000 of the most vulnerable in recent months.“Once stranded, some migrants are at a higher risk of abuse, exploitation and neglect,” it warned.“The loss of livelihoods can increase vulnerabilities and expose them to exploitation by criminal syndicates, human traffickers and others who take advantage of these situations.”The organisation said that too often, migrants were excluded from national coronavirus response and recovery plans due to their irregular status.“The Covid-19 mobility policies and measures -- spanning from various travel restrictions, health requirements and measures to full border closures and nation-wide and/or localised lockdowns -- have, in some cases, created new challenges for migrants whilst in parallel exacerbated their existing vulnerabilities,” the report said.It also raised the issue of some 400,000 seafarers currently stranded at sea, some of whom have been aboard their vessels for up to 17 months -- six months longer than the maximum allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-3-million-migrants-stranded-due-to-covid-measures-says-united-nations/story-ye2GbfEfsxvjZlV6tSE7GP.html
09-10-2020||World||China’s holiday travel is back to 80% of pre-Covid-19 pandemic level||Travel in China rebounded over the eight-day holiday period this month as the nation displayed further evidence that it is overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, with about 637 million trips made, government data show.While that was down from the 782 million trips made during the same period in 2019, it is much better than during the 5-day holiday period in May, according to Macquarie Group Ltd economists. The full total for the Autumn Festival period was 81% of 2019’s level, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism released late Thursday show.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The containment of the virus provided the basic public health conditions for holiday activities, which showed an “obvious revival,” according to a report from Citigroup Inc. “Household purchasing power recovered steadily, and consumer confidence also came back on overall economic recovery,” they wrote.The number of trips doesn’t indicate the number of people who travel, according to the China Tourism Academy. A single person could make multiple trips during the same holiday.Domestic tourism income during the holiday was about 467 billion yuan ($70 billion), according to the ministry. That is down 28% from the seven-day holiday a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations, when income was 650 billion yuan.There was a strong recovery in consumer spending during the holiday period, according to economists at Macquarie led by Chief China Economist Larry Hu. This suggests that “service consumption, largely driven by the pent-up demand, could rebound quickly once things are returning to normal.”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here One factor boosting domestic tourism is the effective collapse of international movement due to travel bans and stringent quarantine requirements on returning to China. Mainland visitors to Hong Kong were down 99%, and dropped 85% to Macau during the holiday period, Macquarie said.“Many brands in the luxury hospitality sector are back to pre-Covid levels of occupancy,” said Chloé Reuter, founding partner Gusto Luxe & Gusto Collective. “Sanya in Hainan is a key destination for domestic travelers and for shoppers at the largest duty free mall in the world,” but more experiential and back-to-nature destinations like Yunnan are also seeing high numbers of travelers, she said.There was an 149% increase in duty-free shopping in Hainan Island in southern China over the holiday, Chinese customs said, according to a state TV report Friday.However, schools in Beijing and other places were discouraging their students from traveling during the period, which may have undercut demand.”Travel to the western regions indicated that consumers are releasing pent-up demand due to lockdown during Chinese New Year and shift from international tourism to domestic,” according to Jason Yu, managing director at Kantar Worldpanel Greater China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-holiday-travel-is-back-to-80-of-pre-covid-19-pandemic-level/story-GMSjnf5LN8BjG1Fa2cplQL.html
09-10-2020||World||Even mildest Covid risks leaving lingering symptoms months later||Covid-19 patients who experience even the mildest illness risk suffering symptoms for months, researchers in France found.Two-thirds of patients who had a mild-to-moderate case of Covid-19 reported symptoms 60 days after falling ill, when more than a third still felt sick or in a worse condition than when their coronavirus infection began. Prolonged symptoms were more likely among patients aged 40 to 60 years and those who required hospitalization, according to staff at Tours University Hospital, who followed 150 non-critical patients from March to June.Their study, published Monday in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection, adds to evidence that a proportion of the 35 million people known to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide will suffer lingering effects weeks to months later. Post–Covid clinics are opening in the pandemic’s wake to cater for an expanding population of so-called long-haulers -- survivors left with scarred lungs, chronic heart damage, post-viral fatigue and other persistent, debilitating conditions.“We were able to assess the evolution of the disease and demonstrate that even the mildest presentation was associated with medium-term symptoms requiring follow up,” Claudia Carvalho-Schneider and colleagues wrote. “Thus, the Covid-19 pandemic will involve a care burden long after its end.”Covid Malaise Poses Economic Drag Long After Virus AbatesTwo months after developing Covid-19 symptoms, 66% of adult patients reported suffering from at least one of 62 complaints, mainly a loss of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and fatigue, the researchers found. The study sought to identify the risk of longer symptom duration in patients with non-critical Covid-19, since much of the existing international research was based on survivors admitted to intensive care units, they said.Longer-ranging studies and clinical trials will be critical to elucidate the durability and depth of health consequences attributable to Covid-19 and how these may compare with other serious illnesses, Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine, and colleagues wrote in an editorial Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association that reviewed the coronavirus’s persistent effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-mildest-covid-risks-leaving-lingering-symptoms-months-later/story-g2q4rCzJAPqvtbLpJKRVAM.html
09-10-2020||World||Nobel Peace Prize 2020: Greta Thunberg, WHO, Jacinda Ardern among top picks||The Nobel Peace Prize remains one of the much-awaited categories, which will be announced on Friday at around 2.30pm (Indian time). This year, 318 nominations have been submitted, including that of 211 individuals and 107 organisations.The names are always kept secret. However, the secrecy around the names never stopped speculations. Here is a list of the frontrunners:Greta ThunbergReports said Swedish teenage activist Thunberg could be honoured, either alone, with other activists, or with her “Fridays for Future” movement. UN’s climate science advisory panel IPCC and former US vice president Al Gore had won the Peace prize in 2007. In 2018, Greta addressed the United Nations Climate Change Conference. In 2019, she sailed to North America to attend the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit where her speech “how day you” brought her international acclaim.“This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope? How dare you,” she had said.If she wins, she would be the second-youngest Nobel laureate in history, just behind Pakistani activist Malala, and the 18th woman to win the Peace Prize. World Health OrganizationThough WHO’s response to the pandemic has invited severe criticism, it is also one of the top favourites as it is working towards ensuring equitable distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine, once it comes. It has set up a vaccine pool, COVAX, which will have rapid access to doses of safe and effective vaccines as soon as any vaccine is approved. Countries which have joined COVAX will get the benefits.Jacinda ArdernNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s response to the Christchurch mosque attacks in 2019 and her leadership in eliminating Covid-19 from the country have kept her as one of the favourites of the bookies betting on probable winners. Ardern was nominated last year tooAlexei NavalnyRussia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was recently poisoned by Kremlin, has been nominated for the prize. The recent news of Navalny being hospitalised after being poisoned during a flight has created a stir in the international media. But Navalny has been fighting against corruption for over a decade now. Russian authorities arrested him several times. Last year, the award went to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, for his efforts to end a 20-year-post-war stalemate with Eritrea. Many other names of possible Nobel winners have also been circulating in Oslo, including Afghan peace negotiator and women’s rights activist Fawzia Koofi, the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN and its secretary general Antonio Guterres, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the icon of Sudan’s revolution Alaa Salah.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-peace-prize-2020-greta-thunberg-who-jacinda-arden-among-top-picks/story-mIklbkXiXORmEcZZhdnxQM.html

09-10-2020||World||Imran Khan’s problem matrix to get complicated with FATF verdict on Pak record||Prime Minister Imran Khan, already facing a mounting challenge to his leadership by a joint coalition of 11 opposition parties, could find his problem matrix getting far more complicated later this when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) takes a hard look at Pakistan’s track record to stop terror. The global anti-terror financing watchdog is expected to conclude that Islamabad should be kept in the grey list with a new set of compliances based on the October 2019 mutual evaluation report (MEP). The mutual evaluation report is done on member countries after every eight years.According to diplomats based in Paris and counter-terror experts, the FATF plenary, which is going to hold its virtual meeting on 21-23 October, is likely to prepare a new action plan for Pakistan based on the October 2019 MEP and add points not compiled by Islamabad for the previous 27-point action plan.Also Read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his handsWhile Islamabad routinely blames India for politicising FATF, fact is that Pakistan based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) are constantly targeting innocent civilians and security forces in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. JeM’s Kasim Jan, one of the key accused in the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack, is still the principal handler of terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir with sleeper cells all over India. Proscribed LeT’s co-founder Hafiz Saeed’s son Talha is active in planning and executing terror action against India with impunity.Pakistan watchers believe that PM Imran Khan may try to leverage its influence over both Taliban and Haqqani Network to negotiate for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and attempt to buy some relief at the FATF. Already, US President Donald Trump has announced that US troops will return from Afghanistan before Christmas this year.However, this is easier said than done since the FATF’s mutual evaluation report 2019 says that Pakistan faces significant money laundering and terror financing risks. “A number of terrorist outfits, including UN-listed groups, operate in Pakistan all of which raise funds through a variety of means including direct support, public fundraising, abuse of non-profitable organisations, and through criminal activities. Funds are moved through formal and informal (mainly hawala or hundis) channels. Pakistan’s geographical landscape and porous borders increase its vulnerability to terror financing and heightens the risks associated with cash smuggling. At the time of the last evaluation, there were 66 organizations and approximately 7,600 individuals proscribed under UNSC resolution 1373, which was passed to prevent and suppress financing of terror acts post 9/11 attacks,” the report stated.The MEP report on Pakistan further stated : “Major money laundering crime include corruption, drug trafficking, fraud, tax evasion, smuggling, human trafficking and organized crime. Corruption is endemic across Pakistan’s economy….and connected with a range of other predicate offences….Illicit funds from predicate crimes are generally money laundered through domestic real estate, precious gems/jewellery and the financial sector. Criminal proceeds are also moved offshore via formal and informal channels.”Also Read: Pakistan’s opposition, public increasingly irked by the military’s role in politicsEven as Pakistan is still to comply with the previous 27-point action plan, the MEP 2019 presents a very grim picture of Pakistan with caustic comments about both its lead enforcement agencies as well as federal agencies for not understanding the full purport of money laundering and terror financing acts.“Based on MEP 2019, a new assessment will be made of Pakistan and a set of tasks to be complied with by Islamabad will be prepared. Under the circumstances, it is very difficult for Pakistan to walk out of the grey list of FATF,” said a counter-terror expert in New Delhi.Also Read: Pakistan PM Imran Khan heads into his biggest challenge. Military is also targetThe downside of Pakistan remaining in the grey list means that much needed loans for reviving a comatose economy will be very hard to come by and PM Imran Khan’s problems will be further accentuated by a united opposition, which is no longer afraid of the all powerful Pakistan Army. On Thursday, former Pak PM Nawaz Sharif, who has been a primary force in cementing the opposition, said that his problem was not with Imran Khan but his selectors (Army). FATF’s October plenary, which would likely keep Pakistan in the grey list, will just exacerbate political tensions in Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-problem-matrix-to-get-complicated-as-fatf-decides-on-pak-record/story-iQ5Nf4zE99Hy0XuUeQoQoO.html
09-10-2020||World||Facebook removes fake accounts linked to conservative group||Facebook has removed 276 accounts that used fake profiles to pose as right-leaning Americans and comment on news articles, often in favour of President Donald Trump, the company announced on Thursday.The platform also permanently banned an Arizona-based digital communications firm that it said was behind the fake accounts.The move was prompted by reporting last month in The Washington Post that a pro-Trump group known as Turning Point Action was paying teenagers to post coordinated, supportive messages, a violation of Facebook’s rules.Facebook and Twitter have been regularly removing fake accounts — both domestic and foreign — that try to insert themselves in the US political discourse and influence the election. But social media companies face broader threats around misinformation and voter suppression that at times come from President Donald Trump himself.The latest network Facebook removed became active before the 2018 midterm elections and went dormant until June, when the accounts began posting on topics including the coronavirus pandemic, criticism of the Democratic Party and its nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as praise for Trump and other Republicans.“So sick of democrats continuing to make republicans look bad! It makes me tired of politics and I just believe Republicans are much more humble when it comes to money because Democrats will do anything to screw over Americans,” read one post Facebook cited as an example.Individuals behind the accounts used stock photos to create fake profiles, many of which were removed by Facebook’s automated detection software. Facebook determined that the accounts were being coordinated by Rally Forge, an Arizona-based firm.“Although the people behind this network attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation linked this activity to Rally Forge,” Facebook said.While Facebook’s investigation cited Rally Forge’s work for Turning Point USA, the work was actually performed on behalf of Turning Point Action, an independent political action committee, according to a statement from the organisation. Turning Point Action added that it will work with Facebook “to rectify any misunderstanding” about its content.Turning Point Action was founded last year by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based non-profit that recruits college students to advocate for conservative causes. The group posts memes and videos on its social media pages that support Trump and other conservative politicians. Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr have also delivered speeches at Turning Point USA or Turning Point Action events, most recently during a June campaign rally in Phoenix.Messages left with Rally Forge and Turning Point USA were not immediately returned Thursday.In all, 200 Facebook accounts, 55 pages and 76 Instagram accounts were removed. Facebook said the network had more than 370,000 followers on Facebook, and 22,000 on Instagram. While most of the fake profiles had posed as conservatives, Facebook said some pretended to be left-leaning in 2018.Twitter, meanwhile, said Thursday that it had suspended 104 accounts linked to an Iranian effort to “artificially” amplify debates over the death of George Floyd and racial justice in the US. The platform said that in some cases, the accounts had been hijacked from their original owners.“In cases where we identify that an account has been compromised ... we aim to restore the account to the original account holder,” Twitter said in a statement. “We were able to do so successfully in most cases here.” (AP) SCY SCY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-fake-accounts-linked-to-conservative-group/story-i2Mn08eSuW3bL788tYZ3bN.html
09-10-2020||World||More than 6.6 million Americans have already voted, suggesting record turnout||Americans are rushing to cast ballots ahead of the Nov. 3 election at an unprecedented pace, early voting numbers show, indicating a possible record turnout for the showdown between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.With less than four weeks to go before Election Day, more than 6.6 million Americans already have voted, more than ten times the number who had at this time in 2016, according to the United States Elections Project, which compiles early voting data.The shift has been driven by an expansion of early and mail-in voting in many states as a safe way to cast a ballot during the coronavirus pandemic and an eagerness to weigh in on the political future of Trump, said Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, who administers the project.Also Read: US Prez Trump says wants to hold campaign rally on Saturday in Florida“We’ve never seen this many people voting so far ahead of an election,” McDonald said in an interview earlier this week. “People cast their ballots when they make up their minds, and we know that many people made up their minds long ago and already have a judgment about Trump.”The early surge has led McDonald to predict a record turnout of about 150 million, representing 65% of eligible voters, the highest rate since 1908. Biden leads Trump in national opinion polls, although surveys in crucial battleground states indicate a tighter race.The numbers reported so far come from 34 states plus the District of Columbia. All but about a half-dozen states allow some level of early in-person voting.The percentage of voters who cast their ballot at a voting machine on Election Day already had been in steady decline before this year, according to the US Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency.Also Read: Joe Biden says hopes to win election by undeniable marginThe total number of early or mail-in votes more than doubled from nearly 25 million in 2004 to 57 million in 2016, it said, representing an increase from one in five of all ballots cast to two in five of all ballots cast. Trump has railed against mail-in voting, making unfounded accusations that it leads to fraud. Experts have said such fraud is rare.Those attacks by the president have shown signs of depressing Republican interest in voting by mail. Democrats have more than doubled the number of returned mail-in ballots by Republicans in seven states that report voter registration data by party, according to the Elections Project.A national Reuters/Ipsos poll taken last week found 5% of Democrats nationwide said they had already voted compared to 2% of Republicans. About 58% of Democrats planned to vote early compared to 40% of Republicans. McDonald said early voting typically starts strong, then drops before surging just ahead of the election. But in some states, rates of participation already have skyrocketed a month out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-6-6-million-americans-have-already-voted-suggesting-record-turnout/story-4LH8VG7MAr3VzSOzABludN.html

That means the second debate is probably not going to happen at all.The commission decided to make the Oct. 15 debate virtual after Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Fahrenkopf says the group wanted to “protect the health and safety of all involved” and that the decision was guided by the advice of the Cleveland Clinic, its heath partner for the 2020 debates.Trump’s doctor, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, said in a letter Thursday evening that Trump would be cleared to resume public activities Saturday, 10 days after his diagnosis.Earlier Thursday, Trump balked at the virtual event and said he wouldn’t participate. Biden’s campaign then said Biden would participate in a town hall hosted by ABC News on Oct. 15 instead.

09-10-2020||World||High-profile Covid-19 lockdown breachers fuel Israeli mistrust||Public anger has deepened in Israel over a bitterly unpopular second coronavirus lockdown after reported violations by high-profile figures, including a hairdresser visiting the prime minister’s wife.Israel, which currently has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 infection rates per capita, has re-imposed draconian movement restrictions, with people compelled to remain within a kilometre (less than a mile) of their homes.Only essential workers are allowed to leave their residences, adding further stress to an already battered economy, while Jews have been barred from gathering with friends and family over the High Holidays.A spokesman for the family of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his wife’s decision to summon a hairdresser to their official residence, saying it was part of her efforts to contain the virus.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA family statement said Sara Netanyahu booked the appointment ahead of filming a “video, in which she called on everyone to wear masks”.“Ms. Netanyahu is an influential public figure and this is an informational video for the public service, she assumed that hairdresser services can be used, as is customary on television channels,” the statement further said.It added that the hairdresser wore a mask and gloves and that the premier’s wife “strictly adheres” to all health ministry guidelines on containing the novel coronavirus.Israeli PM’s wife may have violated lockdown with haircutThe Yediot Ahronoth newspaper voiced outrage at what it described as hypocrisy.“Thousands of barbers and hairdressers stayed at home, without their livelihood,” because of the lockdown, it wrote on Wednesday.“Yet once again, it turns out that the rules that apply to Israeli citizens do not apply to the prime minister’s circle and his associates.”Security chief, environment minister Sara Netanyahu’s alleged quarantine infraction came after environmental protection minister and Netanyahu ally Gali Gamliel travelled to Tiberias -- 137 kilometres (85 miles) from her Tel Aviv home -- on Yom Kippur.Israel’s attorney general is due to rule on whether to open a formal investigation into Gamliel’s alleged infraction.Days later, the head of the powerful Shin Bet internal security agency, Nadav Argaman, was accused by Israeli public radio of hosting relatives at his private home for the Sukkot holiday, breaking lockdown rules.Argaman leads an agency responsible for tracking quarantine violators through their cellphones.For Denis Charbit, a political scientist at the Open University of Israel, the “transgressions” of prominent figures serve as a justification for ordinary Israelis to breach the lockdown.“Individual freedoms are hampered by the government-imposed containment, and the lockdown rules are not effective if leaders do not respect them,” he told AFP.“The impunity that these politicians generally enjoy reinforces the public’s mistrust in the authorities,” he added.Within the opposition ranks, lawmaker Miky Levy of the Yesh Atid party resigned from parliament’s coronavirus committee following media reports that he spent Sukkot in his son’s home.Political damageNetanyahu won praise for his initial response to the coronavirus outbreak in March, but surging transmission in recent months and the renewed restrictions have hurt him politically.A protest movement partly driven by frustration over his virus management has continued, with demonstrators constantly adapting to comply with lockdown measures, including gathering in small clusters across the country.Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, which won 36 out of 120 parliamentary seats in March polls, would currently take just 26 seats, according to a poll this week by Israel’s Channel 12.The same survey found that 65 percent of Israelis believe Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis “poorly”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/high-profile-covid-19-lockdown-breachers-fuel-israeli-mistrust/story-I3Z4rOsBrstJnjlDLKoYfK.html
09-10-2020||World||China joins WHO-backed global vaccine alliance COVAX||China has formally joined the WHO-backed global Covid-19 vaccine initiative known as COVAX, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Friday, saying it was doing so to ensure “equitable” distribution of vaccines for developing countries.The ministry did not share details about its level of involvement, but China is now the biggest economy to join the international initiative, with the US and Russia staying out of it.“We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,” ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement.“China will also strengthen vaccine cooperation with relevant countries through the COVAX network,” she added.The WHO hopes to distribute 2 billion doses of vaccines through the initiative by the end of 2021.On October 8, China and Gavi, the international Vaccine Alliance, signed an agreement, officially joining COVAX.COVAX, jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the vaccine alliance Gavi, is “designed to give governments an opportunity to hedge the risk of backing unsuccessful vaccine candidates and give less developed countries access to shots that would be otherwise unaffordable,” a Bloomberg report said in September.It currently has nine vaccines in development and nine others under evaluation in its portfolio.“This is an important step China has taken to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honour its commitment to turn Covid-19 vaccines into a global public good,” Hua said.In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping had pledged to make any coronavirus vaccine universally available once it’s developed and said China will provide $2 billion over two years to support the fight. “To that end, we have solemnly pledged to make vaccines developed and deployed by China a global public good, which will be provided to developing countries as a priority,” Hua said.“Therefore, China has maintained close communication with COVAX with a positive attitude towards joining it. Even when China is leading the world with several vaccines in advanced stages of R&D and with ample production capacity, it still decided to join COVAX”.As many as 11 Chinese vaccine candidates are under clinical trials, four of them in phase three. Chinese companies are working with related organisations including those in the Middle East, South America, and Southeast Asia, Wu Yuanbin, a senior official with the Chinese science and technology ministry, had said in late September.China’s annual production for Covid-19 vaccines is expected to top 1 billion doses by 2021 while it is expected to reach 610 million doses by the end of this year.The country’s national health commission (NHC) has shared an outline of how the vaccines will be distributed in China when available. The first is the high-risk group, which includes frontline medical workers and those working in the seaports. The second is the vulnerable group, such as the seniors and children. And the third one is the general population. “When we allocate vaccines, we will meet their needs according to those groups,” Zheng Zhongwei, director at NHC’s Development Centre of Medical Science and Technology has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-joins-who-backed-global-vaccine-alliance-covax/story-m8oMw8hNlLKWVhKVdaFpwJ.html

The drugs company said it has asked federal regulators to authorise its antibody treatment for Covid-19 for emergency use.What is Regeneron?REGN-COV2, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a Mint report.Also Read: Trump says wants to hold campaign rally on Saturday in Florida“To develop REGN-COV2, Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s VelocImmune mice, which have been genetically modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from Covid-19,” a statement issued by the pharma company said.Trump received the antibody cocktail last Friday under a compassionate use program.Late last month, Regeneron reported preliminary results from a trial showing that the cocktail could reduce virus levels in coronavirus patients outside of the hospital.Free drug for all AmericansRegeneron has said it currently has doses available for approximately 50,000 patients and expects to have doses available for 300,000 patients within the next few months.The company said in a statement that under its agreement with the US government, the latter would be responsible for the distribution of the drug and would have to make the initial doses available to the American people free of cost if an emergency authorization is granted by the US Food and Drug Administration.Donald Trump’s healthDonald Trump’s physician said the President’s blood samples from Monday show that he had protective antibodies, but according to the pharmaceutical company, those were likely the Regeneron antibodies given to him at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and not a natural response.Also Read: Trump suggests two delayed debates, Biden accepts oneMeanwhile, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci has pointed out that we do not know if the president is well, because patients’ condition can go downhill more than a week after showing the first symptoms.However, White House physician Dr Sean Conley said that the President should be able to return to public engagements as early as Saturday, according to news agency Bloomberg.

09-10-2020||World||US Supreme Court says women can get abortion pill by mail, for now||The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would for now continue to allow women to obtain an abortion pill by mail during the Covid-19 pandemic.The action came over the dissent of two conservative justices who would have immediately granted a Trump administration request to reinstate the requirement that women must visit a hospital, clinic or medical office to obtain a pill.The court did little more than defer its first action on an abortion-related issue since the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month. The court called for a lower-court judge to take a new look at the issue and rule within 40 days. That would put any further high court action after the Nov. 3 election.The court said in an unsigned opinion that it was holding the administration’s appeal “in abeyance.”The administration is asking to be allowed to enforce a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rule. The administration has suspended similar in-person visits for other drugs, including opioids in some cases, but refused to relax the rules for getting the abortion pill.A federal judge in Maryland ruled in July that, during the public health emergency declared by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, health care providers can arrange for mifepristone to be mailed or delivered to patients. The FDA has approved mifepristone to be used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy or manage a miscarriage.Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said they would have granted the administration’s request. “Six weeks have passed since the application was submitted, but the Court refuses to rule,” Alito wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justices-say-women-can-get-abortion-pill-by-mail-for-now/story-QZaXieAIkurRLJFUewVCeK.html

Emergency medical technicians and paramedics responded to their Southfield home.A doctor at a Southfield hospital who didn’t attend the scene pronounced Beauchamp deceased after one of the first responders reported by telephone that she had been unresponsive for 30 minutes and showed no signs of life.Beauchamp wasn’t taken to a hospital until hour later when Cole Funeral Home in Detroit called 911. The state has said funeral home staff actually saw her chest moving earlier when they picked up the body at the Southfield home.Beauchamp’s family said they were assured by the medical crew that she was dead.“All of this could have been avoided, had more care been taken,” Fieger said in his release.Southfield Fire Chief Johnny Menifee has said the city is investigating. He told reporters in late August that Beauchamp might be alive because of “Lazarus syndrome,” a reference to people who come back to life without assistance after attempts to resuscitate have failed.The Associated Press left messages seeking comment Thursday afternoon on the family’s lawsuit from Menifee and the city’s community relations office.The suit names the city of Southfield, Michael Storms, Scott Rickard, Phillip Mulligan and Jake Kroll. Storms, Rickard, Mulligan and Kroll filed a lawsuit last month in federal court to stop their licenses from being suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-woman-mistakenly-declared-dead-sues-michigan-city/story-gRkkWFkwMGbPHtaIZg7aPI.html
09-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, Barr at odds over slow pace of Durham investigation||President Donald Trump is increasingly at odds with Attorney General William Barr over the status of the Justice Department’s investigation into the origin of the Russia probe, with the president increasingly critical about a lack of arrests and Barr frustrated by Trump’s public pronouncements about the case, according to people familiar with the matter.Trump and his allies had high hopes for the investigation led by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, betting it would expose what they see as wrongdoing when the FBI opened a case into whether the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia to sway the 2016 election. Trump has also pushed to tie prominent Obama administration officials to that effort as part of his campaign against Joe Biden, who was serving as vice president at the time.But a year and a half into the investigation, and with less than one month until Election Day, there has been only one criminal case: a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to altering a government email about a former Trump campaign adviser who was a target of secret FBI surveillance.With time running out for pre-election action on the case, Trump is increasingly airing his dissatisfaction in tweets and television appearances. Barr, meanwhile, has privately expressed frustration over the public comments, according to a person familiar with his thinking. It’s not dissimilar to a situation earlier this year, when Trump complained publicly that he believed ally Roger Stone was getting a raw deal in his prosecution, even as Barr had already moved to amend a sentencing position of the prosecutors in the case.Despite Trump’s unhappiness, there’s no indication Barr’s job is at risk in the final weeks of the campaign. Still, the tensions between Trump and the attorney general over the fate of the probe underscore the extent to which the president is aggressively trying to use all of the levers of his power to gain ground in an election that has been moving away from him.This account is based on interviews with six people who have direct knowledge of Trump and Barr’s relationship. They were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Trump is also said to blame Barr for comments from FBI Director Chris Wray on election fraud and mail-in voting that don’t jibe with the president’s alarmist rhetoric. Wray has said there has not historically been any kind of mass voter fraud, whether through the mail or otherwise, a message at odds with Trump and Barr’s repeated efforts to sound the alarms about a process they claim is especially vulnerable to abuse.Still, much of the uptick in tensions between Trump and Barr centers on the Justice Department’s handling of the Durham probe. A senior administration official said Trump feels like he’s given Barr wide latitude to advance the investigation, including declassifying documents related to Russia. In the absence of blockbuster findings, Trump is now moving to make documents public himself with his new acting head of intelligence.On Thursday morning, Trump did not hide his displeasure in an interview on Fox News Business.“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes — the greatest political crime in the history of our country — then we’ll get little satisfaction, unless I win,” he said. “Because I won’t forget it. But these people should be indicted. These are people who spied on my campaign. And we have everything. And I say, Bill, we’ve got plenty, you don’t need anymore. We’ve got so much.”The comment followed an earlier barrage of presidential social media posts, including one in which Trump retweeted a doctored image of Barr superimposed with the late “Saturday Night Live” actor Chris Farley in character as a motivational speaker yelling at him. The caption: “for the love of God ARREST SOMEBODY.”The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter. The White House did not immediately comment.Since Durham’s appointment, he has cast a broad net in interviewing former government officials, including ex-CIA Director John Brennan. It is unclear when Durham plans to submit his report or how damning any of his final conclusions might be.Even the outlines of the case involving FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty in the Durham probe, were already known before he was charged. And the case against him didn’t allege any broader FBI conspiracy to go after Trump.Barr has privately expressed frustration over the president’s public pronouncements on the Durham investigation. Though Barr is broadly in agreement with Trump on the need to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, he’s often bemoaned Trump’s lack of understanding about the intricacies of the legal system and the steps that need to be taken to complete an investigation.A friend of Barr’s said there has been obvious “tension” between the president and the attorney general, and while Barr himself believes deeply in the importance of the Durham investigation and in the president’s authority to exercise control over federal agencies, he will not tolerate interference in specific investigations.The friend said the Justice Department officials were eager for Durham’s work to be completed while Trump is still in office for fear the investigation would be shuttered in a possible Biden administration.Trump aides had banked on the Durham probe being finished before 2020 election to lend credibility to Trump’s claims that his own investigative agencies were working against him. A report from the Justice Department’s inspector general in December knocked down multiple lines of attack against the Russia investigation, finding that it was properly opened and that law enforcement leaders were not motivated by political bias. But Barr has said he and Durham disagreed with the inspector general over whether the FBI had enough information to open a full investigation and, in particular, to use surveillance on a former Trump campaign aide.Despite being close allies on a range of issues, tensions have flared between Trump and Barr at other points, including earlier this year when Trump was tweeting about Stone’s case. Barr later reversed a recommendation from prosecutors that Stone be sentenced to 7 to 9 years in prison, and critics argued he was doing Trump’s bidding.Barr said in an interview with ABC News that the president’s tweets were making it “impossible” to do his job and told those close to him he was considering resigning. The two eventually patched things up.___Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-barr-at-odds-over-slow-pace-of-durham-investigation/story-w3Dex24TjzDtCn2xVVbuWO.html
09-10-2020||World||Putin invites Armenia, Azerbaijan foreign ministers for peace talks||Russian President Vladimir Putin invited the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan to visit Moscow for peace talks Friday and said fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh should be halted for humanitarian reasons.Putin’s invitation came as there appeared to be no end in sight for nearly two weeks of fighting between Azerbaijan and ethic Armenian separatists that has claimed hundreds of lives.“The foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia are being invited to Moscow on October 9,” Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin.“The President of Russia is issuing a call to halt the fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh on humanitarian grounds in order to exchange dead bodies and prisoners,” the Kremlin added.Yerevan has so far ruled out any talks between the two countries’ top diplomats as long as clashes are ongoing.Earlier talks were held in Geneva but expectations were low and no statements were likely from the negotiations which were being conducted behind closed doors -- and without Armenian participation.Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov was to meet diplomats from France, Russia and the United States, who make up the “Minsk Group” that has sought a solution to the Karabakh conflict since the 1990s.Armenia on Thursday accused Azerbaijan of shelling a historic cathedral in Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia said several journalists were injured in strikes on the cathedral after an initial bombardment left rubble strewn across the floor, pews knocked over and a layer of dust coating the interior from parts of the building’s limestone walls that had been hit.“There is no military, nothing strategic here, how can you target a church?” said local resident Simeon, who lives nearby.Azerbaijan and Armenia are locked in bitter fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azerbaijani region controlled by Armenians who declared an unrecognised breakaway statelet after the fall of the USSR and emerged victorious from the war that followed.Hundreds including civilians have been killed in the current fighting, the worst since a 1994 ceasefire, with both sides doubling down on entrenched positions over who should control the region.Defence officials in Azerbaijan and Armenia said fighting continued into Thursday, with both sides claiming to have inflicted heavy losses and accusing the other of shelling civilian areas.There was a gaping hole in the roof of the Ghazanchetsots (Holy Saviour) Cathedral, AFP journalists reported, after Armenia’s defence ministry accused Azerbaijan of targeting a cherished site for the Armenian Apostolic Church.- Thousands forced to flee -A section of the cathedral’s metal roof collapsed and fell to the ground outside.Baku denied its forces were behind the first attack, saying that unlike Armenia, “the Azerbaijani army does not target historical, cultural, or especially religious, buildings and monuments.”Explosions and sirens sounded in Nagorno-Karabakh’s regional capital Stepanakert as the city continued to face regular shelling early Thursday, AFP journalists said.Heavy bombardments have levelled many homes since fighting erupted late last month and Stepanakert is pockmarked with unexploded ordnance and wide craters from shelling.Alongside the new bombardments in Stepanakert, Azerbaijan said Armenian shelling on several villages near the frontline had left people dead and wounded.Alamshar Hasanov, a resident of Shukurbeyli near the border with Karabakh, said his village was subjected to Armenian shelling on a daily basis.“See for yourself,” he said. “A neighbour’s house was destroyed.”“May God grant our soldiers, officers, and commanders health. We rely on them,” he told AFP. Armenia’s rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan told AFP on Wednesday that the renewed fighting has displaced around half of Karabakh’s 140,000 residents and forced some 90 percent of its women and children from their homes.The fighting in one of the most combustible frozen conflicts resulting from the fall of the Soviet Union reignited on September 27, with Azerbaijan insisting the region must return to its control.- Threat of international conflict -Dozens of civilians have been confirmed killed in the fighting and the Armenian side has acknowledged more than 300 military deaths. Azerbaijan has not admitted to any fatalities among its troops.International leaders have repeatedly called for an immediate halt to the fighting but there are no signs yet of the conflict abating. Turkey’s strong backing for Azerbaijan has sown fears in the West that the conflict could spiral into a full-blown war embroiling Ankara with Moscow, which has a military treaty with Armenia.Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the world leaders to denounce the reported deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to Karabakh. Iran on Wednesday warned of “terrorists” who had joined the conflict from abroad.Azerbaijan announced Thursday that it was recalling its ambassador to Athens following reports that Greek citizens were joining Armenian forces in Karabakh.bur-im-jbr/as/har/lc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-invites-armenia-azerbaijan-foreign-ministers-for-peace-talks/story-uUwHoXDXiUutk3RfVvs1AJ.html
09-10-2020||World||Trump suggests two delayed debates, Biden accepts one||President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will not participate in the second debate with Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger, shortly after the organising body announced that the October 15 event would be held virtually.The two campaigns were trying to rescue the debates in an ongoing exchange of statements.“I am not going to do a virtual debate,” Trump, who is convalescing from Covid-19, said in an interview to Fox Business. “I am not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate, that is ridiculous.”The Trump campaign then suggested two in-person debates: a delayed second debate on October 22, when the third and final debate was to take place, and pushing the third debate to October 29.The Biden campaign, which agreed to the virtual debate on October 15, also consented to it being shifted to October 22 and be held in-person. But it rejected the suggestion to hold the third debate on October 29, saying, “We look forward to participating in the final debate, scheduled for October 22, which already is tied for the latest debate date in 40 years. Donald Trump can show up, or he can decline again. That’s his choice.” The Commission on Presidential Debates, an independent body that has conducted presidential and vice-president debates for decades, announced on Thursday morning that “in order to protect the health and safety of all involved”, the second presidential debate scheduled for October 15 “will take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate remote locations”.The third debate is scheduled for October 22, less than a fortnight before the close of voting on November 3, as per the original calendar.The commission did not cite specifics but there were concerns that President Trump might have been already infected at the first debate, which was held on September 29. He and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the disease on October 1, which was confirmed by a more elaborate test the next day.Calls for changing the next debates, including for vice-president, to virtual events, peaked after the president’s hospitalisation. He has since returned to the White House to recover, but has been eager to get out, claiming he is no longer contagious. “I’m back because I’m a perfect physical specimen,” he said in the fox interview.The president also went on to call Senator Kamala Harris a “monster”, a “communist” and “unlikeable” for her remarks at the debate with vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday night.The vice-presidential debate on Wednesday night was in-person but Pence and Harris were separated by plexiglass to minimise chances of Covid exposure. Pence has tested negative but the White House has turned into a “hot-spot” with increasing infections.The Trump administration’s handling of the deadliest health crisis in more than 100 years dominated the vice-presidential debate, with Harris, further cementing her place in US history as the first woman of colour and Indian-American of either gender to participate in such an event, landing the first punch.“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris said, in response to a question in the first segment of the debate, held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.“I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,” said Pence, defending Trump and himself as head of the White House task force appointed by the president to lead the fight against the pandemic.Despite the underlying tensions, Harris and Pence debated calmly, unlike their respective ticket leads Biden and Trump whose debate had devolved into name-calling.With 210,000 dead, more than 7 million infections and President Trump, the first lady and a growing number of people in their circle testing positive, Covid-19 was the top issue at the debate. They clashed also on Covid-19 vaccine, climate change, trade war with China, economy, racism, healthcare, Supreme Court, women’s right to abortion and religion.As the running mate on a ticket that’s leading in national polls by a wide margin, Harris was expected to play it safe and not hand the Trump campaign a lifeline. She did just that, overlooking many opportunities to attack Pence, to the disappointment of supporters who had expected to see flashes of her prosecutorial skills.“The debate was civil and constructive as compared to the Presidential debate,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, a leading Indian-American advocacy group. “Kamala and Pence delivered their positions passionately and we now have 27 days to decide.”Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican running for Lt Governor in Virginia, a state that used to be Republican but has widely come to be considered Democratic lately, said “VP Pence clearly distinguished himself by highlighting the exemplary job done for the American people by President Trump and his administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-suggests-two-delayed-debates-biden-accepts-one/story-siLxgYnwdNnno1MZFwmhfK.html

09-10-2020||India||Uproar after Sikh man pushed, turban pulled at BJP Bengal rally||A day after a man named Balbinder Singh was arrested with a pistol from GT Road in Howrah during the agitation by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, the party alleged that the Sikh community was insulted as Singh’s turban fell off when he was being taken into custody. The police, however, have denied the charge, saying that the pagri fell off during the scuffle and that the man was asked to put it on before he was arrested. The outrage over the incident had cricketer Harbhajan Singh tweeting to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday, saying: “Please look into this matter @MamataOfficial this isn’t done.”He posted tweets and news video clippings tweeted by BJP’s Delhi unit secretary Impreet Singh Bakshi. The same tweets and videos were also shared by BJP national secretary Arvind Menon and other leaders.“In Bengal, is there no respect for people from other religious faiths except a specific one?” tweeted Menon. A few members of the Sikh community staged a silent protest in central Kolkata. They carried small posters that sought “justice” for Singh. News footage of Thursday’s incident showed that Singh grappled with three policemen and there was jostling during which his turban came off. Police charged Singh under the Indian Arms Act as the licence he carried was issued in Rajourie, Kashmir. It was not valid in West Bengal. Singh was produced in Howrah court on Friday and remanded in custody. “The concerned person was carrying firearms in yesterday’s protest. The Pagri had fallen off automatically in the scuffle that ensued, without any attempt to do so by our officer (visible in the video attached). It is never our intention to hurt the sentiments of any community,” The West Bengal Police tweeted around 10 pm on Friday, attaching a video of the incident.  The concerned person was carrying firearms in yesterday's protest.

The man is the bodyguard of one of our state BJYM leaders. He has a valid licence for carrying the weapon. He works for a private security agency,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. “The BJP is doing dirty politics. Nobody intentionally took off the man’s turban. It happened during the jostling,” said Trinamool Congress spokesperson and former Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh. BJYM national president and Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore South, Tejasvi Surya has also accused the police of insulting the party’s MPs.Surya and two BJP MPs from Bengal went to Jorasanko police station to lodge complaint against the police for the injuries suffered by party workers during the baton charge on Thursday. The BJP MP alleged that he and the others were shoved by the officers. In a video of the incident that he tweeted on Friday, Surya said the MPs will bring a motion of breach of privilege against these policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uproar-after-sikh-man-pushed-turban-pulled-at-bjp-bengal-rally/story-cYyDfiCWCqSKQoG3sTmF6K.html

The move follows concessions made by the state government after the All Assam Motor Transport Association (AAMTA) launched an indefinite strike since Monday, seeking an increase in fares to offset losses suffered due to Covid-19 restrictions. “The bus operators have been asked not to carry passengers beyond the total seating capacity, provide hand sanitisers, ensure everyone wears a face mask and sanitise the buses after each trip,” Ashok Bhattarai, chairman of Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) said. The list of demands by the AAMTA included waiving of road tax for one year, waiver of quarterly tax on vehicles, increase in bus fares and financial relief to transporters due to Covid-19 restrictions. Also read: Flipkart tells Nagaland customer no service outside India. Then apologisesAs per the government guidelines, buses and other commercial passenger vehicles in Assam were operating with 50 percent occupancy to maintain social distancing among passengers. To press for their demands, buses and other passenger vehicles stayed off the roads since Monday while the government tried to ease problems faced by passengers by plying around 650 buses belonging to the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) on the roads. After a round of deliberations on Tuesday between the AAMTA and the government failed to end the strike, another meeting was held on Thursday where it was agreed that operating vehicles with 50 percent occupancy with the existing rates was not commercially viable. “We received a notification from the government on Thursday evening allowing us to operate with 100 percent occupancy. We have called off our strike and most vehicles are back on the roads from Friday,” Pradip Das, general secretary AAMTA told media. The government, however, refused to allow transporters to increase bus fares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-time-since-lockdown-commercial-vehicles-in-assam-begin-carrying-100-passengers/story-gcRQKent5at82PWZCzwLFO.html

09-10-2020||India||India gets second set of data on Swiss bank account holders: Official||The Switzerland authorities have shared details of bank accounts of Indians nationals and entities allegedly holding black money as part of a confidential agreement between the two countries, people familiar with the development said. The data will be examined by agencies dealing with black money investigations to see if there are any irregularities in these bank accounts belonging to Indians, people cited above added. The latest exchange of financial data by Switzerland’s Federal Tax Administration (FTA) – second time in last one year - is part of the framework of the global standard on the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) to combat the problem of offshore tax evasion and avoidance and stashing of unaccounted money abroad requiring cooperation amongst tax authorities, a senior finance ministry official said.The information exchange this year with 86 countries including India involves nearly 3.1 million (31 lakh) financial accounts, FTA said in a statement on Friday. It is not immediately known exactly how many of these are accounts linked to Indians.India has activated AEOI relationship for receiving information from over 96 jurisdictions such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands and Mauritius. Switzerland and India had signed a joint declaration on the introduction of AEOI on tax matters on November 22, 2016 on reciprocal basis. The first set of documents on accounts held by Indian residents in Swiss banks was shared in September last year for the year 2018, said this finance ministry official. “The data, thus, received are processed by tax authorities and agencies and the processing of information takes time. If some suspicious activities are found involving certain individual accounts, agencies probe their details further and on the basis of material evidence, notices are served and taxes along with penalties are recovered,” the official said. This official declined to divulge any detail because of the confidential agreement.Amit Maheshwari, Partner AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm told HT, “AEOI is an important tool under the aegis of Gobal Forum to help countries get important information on an automatic basis instead of on request. This will help countries and in this case India to use this information to investigate whether account holders have correctly paid taxes on these overseas assets. Overseas assets by Indians are a focus area of the government and this exchange of information would form the backbone of the quest to bring to task tax evaders who have stashed money abroad.” Sherbir Panag, Partner at Panag and Babu and international legal expert on white collar crimes, said: “The Global Forum is a step in the right direction towards a more cohesive exchange of financial accounts between countries. Safe havens and lack of transparency, touted by some countries for foreign investment attraction - remain a big impediment to the global fight against money laundering and financial crimes. Nothing frustrates the efforts of national law enforcement authorities and victims of fraud, as much as lack of international cooperation.

09-10-2020||India||Odisha CM’s Twitter handle falls victim to fake news on Oxford University||A spate of news articles on a study by a team of researchers at the Oxford University, UK, and the Northeastern University, US, on the Odisha model of Covid-19 may turn out to be fake. The news was also shared by the official Twitter handle of Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik but the post was deleted. On Thursday, a few websites reported that a study by UK’s Oxford University and the Northeastern University of the United States praised the Ganjam district of Odisha and Dharavi slums of Mumbai for their strategy to deal with the pandemic. First reported by a little-known website called pledgetimes.com on October 8, the report described how a study by the Oxford University found Ganjam in Odisha and Dharavi slums in Mumbai managed to “imprison Corona”.The news item did not mention the title of the study but spoke of how Ganjam and Dharavi managed to control the surge in Covid-19 cases trying to pass off the success as the findings of the study. Several news portals and websites of local newspapers picked up the story with each of them repeating that “Oxford University study praised the Ganjam and Dharavi model of fighting the pandemic”.Also read: ‘Modi made crises’ India could’ve avoided: Cong’s 10 point attack at CentreWhen asked on Twitter to post the link of the study, the CMO Twitter handle did not reply. However, a senior official of Odisha government later pointed out to a study titled ‘Crowding and the shape of Covid-19 epidemics’ by the Oxford University and the Northeastern University that was published in the highly-respected “Nature Medicine” journal on October 5. The study said small, close-knit communities are at high risk for rapid, intense Covid outbreaks especially if they haven’t yet experienced outbreaks of Covid-19. The study showed that whether Covid outbreaks come to a fast, dramatic peak or whether they are long and drawn-out is more closely related to city layout and social structures than city size and density.The paper, ‘Crowding and the shape of Covid-19 epidemics’ used epidemiological data from Chinese cities and Italian provinces, climate and population data, and the response to local interventions as measured by human mobility and Covid-19. Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset was used to identify drivers of transmission and create a model to predict the risk of high-peak outbreaks based on similar data from 310 cities around the world.While several websites claimed that the study praised the Ganjam and Dharavi model of dealing with the pandemic, none of these claims was found in the report whose central hypothesis was how unaffected area can see a rapid peak in cases when individuals had high rates of contact within social units, such as households, care homes and prisons.The study also did not include Ganjam as it selected only 310 urban centres from the European Commission Global Human Settlement Urban Centre Database. To ensure global coverage, up to five most populous cities in each country were selected including Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.An e-mail sent to the study’s lead authors Samuel V Scarpino, Oliver G Pybus and Moritz UG Kraemer, seeking reply whether the paper praised any particular model of controlling the pandemic, did not elicit any response.Ganjam, which saw an influx of over 5 lakh migrant workers from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other parts of India after lockdown, had become a Covid-19 hotspot by late July when it reported around 10,000 cases. Apart from the returning migrants, the compartment-like dwelling housing of the people in the district contributed to the surge. Later, intensive door-to-door screening of people with Covid-19 symptoms and quick treatment brought the numbers down. Though it recorded the highest Covid-19 casualty of 221, the active caseload has come down too.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrita Kulange, whose Twitter handle too posted a tweet talking of the praise from Oxford University over its handling of the epidemic, said he has not seen the study. “The Oxford University people may have done the study independently. But no one has contacted me for the study,” said Kulange. After several people started questioning the authenticity of the claim of the government, the CMO’s Twitter handle deleted one post which referred to the praise by Oxford University.This is not the first time when well-known, verified Twitter handles have fallen victims to fake news. In August this year, Odisha Governor Ganeshi Lal and Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Pratap Sarangi congratulated IAF wing commander Nikhil Rath for a feat he never accomplished.While all of them took to Twitter to congratulate Wing Commander Rath for being “selected for the country’s first manned space mission Gaganayan” scheduled for 2022, none of them had checked the authenticity of the information. Though Rath had been included among the 25 pilots shortlisted in 2019 for Gaganayan, he never made it to the four candidates who were finally selected for the mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-s-twitter-handle-falls-victim-to-fake-news-on-oxford-university/story-Wbp9TQZksoNJBFf8rYcmVK.html

09-10-2020||India||‘Modi made crises’ that India could have avoided: Congress launches 10-point attack at Centre||The Congress on Friday focussed on 10 moves taken by the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government during the coronavirus pandemic, including the lockdown and the three farm laws, which the opposition party said could have been avoided.“10 Modi made crises that could have been avoided but have instead devastated our nation. #BJPseNaHoPayega,” the grand old party posted on Twitter along with a video. In a one-minute clipping, the Congress slammed the government for India being on the spot in terms of Covid-19 tally, ‘ill-planned” lockdown decision, farms laws and “lying” on Chinese intrusion in Ladakh.  10 Modi made crises that could have been avoided but have instead devastated our nation. #BJPseNaHoPayega pic.twitter.com/VAYVwjYnlMAmong others issues, the Congress targeted the government over the migrant workers’ crisis, scams amid the pandemic, Covid-19 relief package, passing of bills without discussion in the Rajya Sabha, allowing gross violations of human rights in Uttar Pradesh and lying about data related to migrants, Covid-19 and jobs. The party added that the list goes on and on.Here’s a look at some of Congress’ key allegations against the Modi government1. Ill-planned 8pm lockdownThe Sonia Gandhi-led party slammed the government for suddenly announcing the 21-day nationwide lockdown on March 24 when the coronavirus disease had claimed 12 lives and there were more than 500 confirmed cases in the country. Prime Minister Modi had stated that a shutdown was the only way to break the chain of infections.The Congress has time and again slammed the move as “ill-planned” saying that the government did not take into consideration the plight of migrants and daily-wage workers. It had also called the lockdown a “pause” and not a solution for the crisis at hand.2. Migrant workers’ crisisThe grand-old party also took note of the migrant workers’ crisis as scores of them across states had to walk back on foot to their home states as no transport was available during the initial days of the lockdown. Former party president Rahul Gandhi also met some migrants in Delhi in May. In a video, the migrants were seen saying that more than the coronavirus, hunger is hurting them and that is why they were not afraid of getting killed on the roads.3. Scams amid pandemicIn the video on Friday, the party accused the government of leading scams amid the pandemic but did not reveal any details about the claim it made in this regard. It was an apparent reference to senior Congress leader and former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah’s allegation that the BJP government in the state was involved in a Rs 2,200 crore scam related to the purchase of Covid-19 related equipment.4. Lied on Chinese intrusionThe Congress had earlier too attacked the Centre over the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) intrusion amid an ongoing border standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. A row had erupted over a defence ministry statement on August 4 that acknowledged that the Chinese army had transgressed into multiple areas in the sensitive sector but was taken down two days later.5. Jumla relief package for the economyThe Congress renewed its attack on the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package that the government launched in view of the coronavirus crisis. Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram had earlier said, “There is nothing in what the finance minister said for the lakhs of poor, hungry and devastated migrant workers who have walked — and many thousands are still walking — back to their home states. This is a cruel blow dealt to those who toil every day,”6. Black farm bills that will destroy farmers, benefit crony capitalistsDays after concluding several tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana, the Congress again accused the Modi government of passing “black farm bills” during the monsoon session of Parliament. The party was referring to The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which were cleared in the Rajya Sabha amid a ruckus by the Opposition parties that the bills were passed without voting.7. Gross violations of human rights in UPIn an apparent reference to the gang-rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman by four “upper caste” men in UP’s Hathras district, the Congress has alleged the government has allowed gross violations of human rights in the state. This comes after the victim died last week in a Delhi hospital and her body was cremated by the UP police at 2:30am the following day against the wishes of her family members, who were allegedly locked inside their home and were being threatened. A Congress delegation, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, met the victim’s family members and assured them of support in seeking justice for their daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-made-crises-that-india-could-have-avoided-congress-lists-a-10-point-jibe/story-iU7rKe8ioMWkBn9ByfBYVO.html

There was some patchwork left in Farhan Akhtar’s ‘Hello Chalie’, and have now finished ‘Safaibaaz’ in Lucknow,” the actor said after completing his shoot in the state capital. In November, he will be finishing his portions in ‘Hungama-2’, ‘Bole Chudiyan’ and ‘Bhool Bhuliya-2’. But, right now, he is geared up for the shooting of Hindi-Punjabi ‘Mitthu Singh Da Bya’ in Patiala.“For the first time in my career, I am playing a Sikh. I am playing the title role and it’s a very ‘jaandaar’ character. Besides, I have a good role in ‘Coolie No 1’ which is ready. So, there is a beautiful bouquet of films that the audience will get to watch in the coming months,” he said.Rajpal has done his theatre academics from Bhartendu Natya Academy in Lucknow. “First I did ‘padhai’ (education) here, then did ‘ghumai’ (roaming) and now got an opportunity to do some ‘safai’ (cleaning) with my role in ‘Safaibaaz’. If Shahjahanpur is my ‘maa’ (mother), Lucknow is my ‘dai-maa’ (granny) who has nurtured me as an actor due to which I could make a name in the world of cinema.”The actor also went to his native village in Pilibhit. “I am very happy that UP is coming up with a film city and it’s a dream come true for me. But, instead of Noida, I feel the film city should come up in Pilibhit where we have forests, foothills, plains and the Himalayas in the backdrop. I have done a comprehensive study on it and I am ready to share all the details,” he suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/rajpal-yadav-on-a-film-completion-spree/story-si7XJTi1KpxNWxDJahvBhL.html

In addition to repeated advisories, warnings and booking of at least three cases against MP for violation of Covid guidelines, there is no improvement in behaviour,” Mishra wrote in the letter.“Such irresponsible behaviour on the part of a people’s representative will demotivate the Covid Warriors and is an insult to all those who have lost their lives. And it also sends a completely contradictory message to the people at large especially in the light of the Honourable Prime Minister’s repeated messages and his appeal yesterday,” he said.Sarangi, who in July was penalised by police for violating social distancing guidelines, however denied that she had violated any Covid guidelines.“After arriving at Bhubaneswar two days ago, I have always been masked up. PM Modi ji has asked us to do our work with proper masking and I have not forgotten it. But did the minister raise any questions about one of his ministers and party MLA attending the funeral of party MLA Pradip Maharathy last week despite testing positive for Covid-19. Did he write to CM questioning their conduct,” asked Sarangi.The minister further wrote that as Sarangi is a people’s representative and national spokesperson of the BJP, it is important that she inspires people to follow the Covid guidelines at this very critical juncture.“These are tough times when people have obeyed the lockdown and sacrificed their livelihood. But the video clearly shows Sarangi surrounded by hundreds of women who are neither wearing masks nor maintaining social distance and indulging in song and dance with utter disregard to Covid guidelines issued under the National Disaster Management Act despite repeated appeals made by the Prime Minister regarding the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-gets-complaint-against-bjp-lawmaker-for-violating-covid-guidelines/story-kePPUfZc8CEvpi2RhKT2RI.html

The court said Naik had filed an application under section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for investigation. “The office is hereby directed to issue intimation to the circle police inspector of Kyathasandra police station along with (a) photostat copy of the complaint for the report,” the court said, according to PTI.Watch | ‘File FIR against Kangana Ranaut’: Karnataka court over ‘anti-farmer’ tweet Naik, who hails from Kyathasandra, said the court had directed the jurisdictional police station to register an FIR and inquire in connection with his criminal case against the actor.“People who spread misinformation and rumours about CAA that caused riots are the same people who are now spreading misinformation about Farmers bill and causing terror in the nation, they are terrorists. You very well know what I said but simply like to spread misinformation,” Ranaut had tweeted on September 21 from her Twitter handle @KanganaTeam. Naik said Ranaut’s tweet had hurt him and prompted him to file a case against her.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in a series of tweets, reassured farmers that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the government procurement of farmers’ produce will continue after the bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha. The actor had picked up one of PM’s tweets, described the protesters as “the same terrorists who indulged in bloodshed even though no countryman lost citizenship due to CAA”.She had clarified that she did not call farmers terrorists and dared anybody to prove it. “Like Lord Krishna has Narayani Army, similarly Pappu has his Champu army that knows only to fight on the basis of rumours. This is my original tweet, if somebody can prove that I called farmers terrorists then I will apologize and leave Twitter forever,” she tweeted in Hindi later.According to Live Law, Naik in his plea alleged that Ranaut’s tweet has a clear intention to injure the people who are opposing the farm bills, “wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riots and promote the culture of non-violence in the young minds of society.”“....this posting on twitter account of the accused posted by her may lead to collision between the people of different group believe in different ideology. It seems that the government authorities have turned a blind eye to the same and does not have any established measures or rules and guidelines to control and regulate the same. On the bare perusal of all these content it is more than evident that the government is least bothered and as usual waiting for some dangerous consequences to happen before taking some appropriate actions,” he had said, according to Bar and Bench.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/book-kangana-ranaut-karnataka-court-directs-police-over-her-anti-farmer-tweet/story-QRc2qB7wnLEPfhr59FeSHN.html

Since he arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday, the chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and army chief Gen MM Naravane and briefed them on the peace process and the talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha. After the meeting on Friday afternoon, Jaishankar tweeted that he and Abdullah had a “good discussion on our bilateral cooperation and regional issues”. Jaishankar added: “Welcomed his insights and perspectives on recent developments. As a neighbour, India remains committed to peace, prosperity and stability in Afghanistan.” Abdullah said in a tweet that he and Jaishankar had “exchanged views on the #AfghanPeaceProcess, bilateral relations, & regional support for peace efforts. He assured me of India’s full support for peace in Afghanistan.” Abdullah’s visit is part of an outreach to key countries in the region to seek support for the negotiations in Doha. Before travelling to India, he visited Pakistan last week for talks with the civil and military leadership. Abdullah told the Pakistani leaders that a message about reducing violence and showing greater flexibility in negotiations should be communicated to the Taliban. At their meeting on Thursday, PM Modi assured Abdullah of India’s continued backing for the Afghan peace process. Abdullah also said Modi had assured him that India will back any settlement acceptable to the Afghan people. However, Abdullah said at an event organised by a think tank on Thursday that a premature withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan will have consequences, especially if the Taliban don’t deliver on commitments to prevent the use of Afghan soil by groups such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State. He made the remarks shortly after US President Donald Trump tweeted that he planned to pull out all American troops from Afghanistan by Christmas, months ahead of the earlier deadline of May 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-support-for-peace-in-afghanistan-jaishankar-to-abdullah-abdullah/story-GVuBoC3UO6vrBrGG4bAUYM.html
09-10-2020||India||‘Navratri special’: Vande Bharat train likely to shuttle between Katra and Delhi||Ahead of the nine-day-long Navratri festival, the BJP government plans to run Vande Bharat express trains to Katra town in Jammu and Kashmir from Delhi for Shri Mata Vaishno Devi pilgrims. The plan, however, is likely to materialise after things settle down in neighbouring Punjab where farmers have blocked rail tracks over controversial farm laws recently passed by the Parliament. This year, the Navratri festival will begin from October 17. Vande Bharat train service was suspended in March this year after the pilgrimage was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “To begin with, Vande Bharat Express trains will be run but we are waiting for Punjab protests to settle down,” union minister Dr Jitendra Singh told HT. On Thursday, he said that the Vande Bharat express train from Delhi to Katra, a town near the Mata Vaishno Devi temple, will resume soon. “Discussed with Railway Minister Sh @PiyushGoyal. #VandeBharatExpress train from Delhi to #KatraVaishnoDevi to resume soon. This should be a reassuring piece of information for pilgrims from across the country planning a visit to Holy shrine during #Navratri festival,” Dr Singh had tweeted on Thursday. Also read: Ram temple construction - Carved stones being moved from Nyas workshop to JanmabhoomiRailways have plans to run two trains to Katra for the ensuing Navratri festival when the cave shrine attracts maximum pilgrims from India and abroad. “Though there is no request from us to run special trains for the ensuing Navratri festival, we have come to know that Vande Bharat trains are likely to be run following intervention by union minister Dr Jitendra Singh,” said officials of the shrine board. They informed that the board has started making arrangements for the Navratri festival. “However, this time around there will be no extravaganza. Only Durga Saptshati Paath shall be held at the main bus stand at Katra purely as per SoPs for the Covid-19 pandemic,” they informed. Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, however, has decided to increase the cap on the number of pilgrims to 7,000 from 5,000 per day. “From October 15, the shrine board has decided to allow 7,000 pilgrims per day and there is no rider on how many outsiders should be present among the number of pilgrims,” they added. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic the, sanctum sanctorum will be decked up with exotic flowers. “The Bhawan (sanctum sanctorum) will be decorated with flowers from abroad like we do every Navratri festival. The mobilisation has started on Friday,” said officials. They informed that flowers from Britain, Switzerland, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Dubai will be brought and floral decorators will get down to the task of tastefully decorating the sanctum sanctorum. These flowers include gladiolus, carnations, lilies and anthurium orchids. They remain fresh for almost ten days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navratri-special-vande-bharat-train-likely-to-shuttle-between-katra-and-delhi/story-63Q0oLSuiNl3AHtlU6Gt6L.html

She succumbed to her injuries at a Delhi hospital on September 29.A senior police official said the investigators are trying to collect all possible evidence related to the crime. He further said they (investigators) have decided to recreate the crime scene in different ways as the statements of the family and other witnesses are quite different.Another official, requesting anonymity, said the investigators have found four sickles and a slipper from the crime scene in a ‘bajra’ field near the victim’s house. He said it suggests that there were at least four people who were cutting crops and may have been eyewitness to the entire episode.The statement of the victim’s mother and brother, the officer said, will be recorded in detail to recreate the sequence of events in their presence. He said although the state government has already recommended a CBI probe into the case, but police investigators are trying to collect all details related to the crime and it will be handed over to the CBI when it takes over the case.5 police officers suspended Meanwhile, the three-member SIT recorded the statement of several witnesses on Friday. On the basis of SIT’s preliminary report earlier, the state government suspended five police officers, including the then Hathras superintendent of police Vikrant Vir, earlier.The SIT comprising secretary (home) Bhagwan Swaroop Srivastava, deputy inspector general of police Chandra Prakash and commandant, Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Agra, Poonam (goes by one name).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crime-scene-in-hathras-case-to-be-recreated-in-presence-of-victim-s-family/story-YGWpfe69df9QtmpWwzTVJO.html

The government has stationed Rs 20 crore, and the tower will come up in 10 months, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, claiming that it will be the first of its kind in the world.Following high pollution levels in the national capital, the Supreme Court had in November 2019 asked the Centre and the Delhi government to come up with a road map on installing smog towers in the national capital region (NCR) to combat air pollution. Delhi’s first smog tower came up at Lajpat Nagar central market on January 3. Gautam Gambhir, former cricketer and BJP MP from East Delhi inaugurated a prototype air purifier at Lajpat Nagar. The 20-feet-tall tower is fitted with exhaust fans to suck in polluted air and can remove up to 80% of the particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM10) -- the primary pollutant in Delhi’s air.Know everything about smog tower and how it works:1. Smog towers are structures designed to work as large-scale air purifiers. They are usually fitted with multiple layers of air filters, which clean the air of pollutants as it passes through them.2. The smog tower sucks the polluted air, which is purified by the multiple layers before re-circulated into the atmosphere. To purify the air; the highly effective H14 grade Highly Effective Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) filter would be used. This filter can clean up to 99.99% Particulate Matter (PM) present in the air with the help of pre-filter and activated carbon.3. The smog tower installed in Lajpat Nagar is cylindrical in design and built like a pole with a big inlet and four outlet units. The giant air purifier is fitted with exhaust fans to suck in polluted air with the help of a big inlet unit. It is painted in four colours – orange on the top, white in the middle, green colour just above the bottom and blue at the bottom. The tower will run on electricity.4. The cost of each smog tower is to be around Rs 10 to 12 crore which includes filtering equipment, monitoring system and construction of the tower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-connaught-place-to-get-a-smog-tower-what-you-need-to-know/story-UQ4l6aJvlMVjYUfDqWlqpN.html

The device developed could largely help in monitoring the quality of food being offered to children in schools under the mid-day meal programme in the country. It could also potentially help the farmers in selling their produce directly to the buyers by enabling the buyers to assess the quality of the produce from any corner of the state. Ankur Jain, founder and CEO of the startup named Udyog Yantra said, “The device was developed in about one and a half years before it was launched in March this year.” “It is based on AI and IoT based mechanism with connection to the internet. Recognised by Startup India, the device ensures real time monitoring and quality control of food, agricultural and farm supplies” said Jain. Also Read: Uttarakhand forest department uses solar repeller technique to check movement of wild animals He informed that the startup is in talks with some state governments to install the device in schools to monitor and control the quality of food served under mid-day meal programme. “Once installed in the schools, if a child with his mid-day meal food stands in front of the device, it will provide all information like how much nutrients it has, its temperature and even quantity. This will help the authorities concerned to monitor the programme, riddled with complaints of sub-standard food,” said Jain. “It would have been installed in some schools of the country by now but due to Covid-19, it got delayed,” said Jain. Also Read: Uttarakhand govt told to answer 97 questions scrutinising health facilitiesStartup co-founder Puneet Gulati, said the device would also be very helpful in farmers selling their produce anywhere in the world. “Usually, there are middlemen in between the farmers and the buyers. But if the farmer wants to sell his produce on the basis of quality claims, this device will enable him to contact the potential buyer sitting anywhere. The buyer will be able to evaluate the quality and quantity of the produce and match it with farmers claims,” said Gulati. Gulati add that the device has been used by some cloud kitchen platforms in Mumbai to let the customers know the quality and quantity of the food they were going to buy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-device-to-monitor-quality-of-mid-day-meals-developed-by-iim-startup/story-40xvnknmUpQaOLJEoriq3H.html

09-10-2020||India||NCPCR decision to send children in care centres back to their families draws Supreme Court ire||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to explain why it had ordered the immediate repatriation of children in child care institutions (CCIs) to their families when they were more prone to domestic violence and abuse during the pandemic.The letter issued by the NCPCR’s Senior Consultant, Legal Division, on September 24 to Karnataka was produced before the court in a suo moto proceeding. In addition to Karnataka, seven other states received similar letters from NCPCR.Taking serious view of the letter, amicus curiae Gaurav Agarwal, who is assisting the court in the suo moto proceeding, said, “The pandemic has rendered children even more vulnerable, as it appears that cases of domestic abuse, child labour, child marriages are increasing, and increasing poverty has led to a substantial increase in the number of children in need of care and protection.”Annexing the letter with a short note, Agarwal said that such a direction could not be given by NCPCR unless they were satisfied about the suitability of the parents, guardian, or fit person with whom the child is to be repatriated. This duty is cast upon NCPCR under Section 40(3) of Juvenile Justice Act, Agarwal said.The three-judge bench of justices LN Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi agreed with Agarwal and issued a notice to the Centre and NCPCR to file a response. The bench said, “Such repatriation may be done on a case to case basis but not as a general order…This may be problematic for children who have been sent back.” The court has posted the matter for hearing on November 24.The Centre, too, shared the concern expressed by the Court. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhatti said, “Our officers are trying to find out the circumstances under which such a direction was issued by NCPCR. It is true that cases of domestic violence and abuse of children are on the rise during the pandemic.”The apex court had issued an order on April 3 this year asking CCIs and shelter homes to ensure there is no crowding of inmates in their institutions. Two instances were brought to the attention of the court wherein children contracted Covid-19 as necessary precautions were not taken.“The NCPCR seems to have made the April 3 order of the Court as the basis for its letter,” Agarwal said, pointing out that the April 3 order was a temporary measure to help contain the spread of pandemic. “Many children are in CCIs due to poverty or their parents’ incapacity to look after them. There are children who are orphaned, abandoned, victims of child abuse, trafficking, child labour, child marriage, and homeless. For them, institutional care is the only resort,” Agarwal stated in his note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncpcr-decision-to-send-children-in-care-centres-back-to-their-families-draws-supreme-court-ire/story-gu4hfUlcuOPir8TovL6h5I.html
09-10-2020||India||‘Kerala hasn’t learnt’: Ecologists react to tunnel project in Western Ghats||Green activists in Kerala are opposing the proposed 6.8 km tunnel along Kozhikode-Wayanad road, to be the third longest tunnel in the country once completed, calling it a recipe for ecological and other natural disasters. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had launched the project on Monday with much fanfare and vowed it will be completed in three years time. The state government had given administrative sanction for the first phase of the project, worth Rs 658 crore, and roped in the Konkan Railway Corporation Limited for its construction. The government also took the Catholic Church into confidence before announcing the project. Thamarassery Bishop Remigiose Inchananiyil was one of the guests at the launch ceremony. During protests against Madhav Gadgil and Kasturirangan committee reports on the Western Ghats, the church was at the forefront as most of the fringe forest areas were allegedly occupied by associated believers. The church had said the two reports were a ploy to push believers out of their land. The project is yet to get mandatory environmental clearance from various agencies and no environmental impact study has been done, claimed a prominent group of environmentalists. “It is a big joke that the CM announced the project one fine morning and gave it much publicity like the recent Atal tunnel in Leh. No environmental impact or feasibility study was done. We feel it is only a poll gimmick and we suspect mining barons want to plunder granite and stones in the name of tunnel construction,” said Wayanad Prakruthi Samraskshna Samiti, a prominent group of environmentalists and nature- lovers. However, the Left parties said the “dream project” will go ahead and there will be no surrendering to “hyper green activism.” Also Read: IIT Mandi researchers develop cost-effective, environment friendly catalystThe CM said many projects were stalled due to controversies in the past and the tunnel project will not be allowed to meet the same fate. They have asked grassroots units of the party to muster support for the project. “Many development projects are mired in controversies. Now controversies can wait, developmental projects will go ahead,” the CM said, and added that the government will clear all the hurdles in its path. According to the government the tunnel will reduce the distance between Kozhikode and Mysuru by 30 kms. It is alleged that the state forest department was kept in the dark over the tunnel project, which will pass through mountain ranges of the ecologically sensitive Camel Hub Complex. State forest minister K Raju is reported to have registered his protest on the issue. Also Read: Kanjur draws black kites, may threaten aircraft safety while landing: BNHS tells Bombay HCIt is the same area where a massive landslide took place last year claiming many lives in Puthumala. Geological Survey of India had suggested minimum human interference in the area. “Kaladi, where the tunnel will end is a high intensity rainfall area which receives at least five times the normal rainfall. In both expert panel reports on Western Ghats (Gadgil and Kasturirangan), it was earmarked as the most sensitive area. It is also a favourite habitat of the Asian elephants,” said N Badusha, a conservationist. He said it was difficult to buy the government’s theory that a subterranean tunnel won’t affect dense forests and pristine hills. Environmental activists are planning a convention in Wayanad against the tunnel once Covid-19 situation improves. They say they are shocked by the way the CM announced the project and set a deadline. “It seems Kerala is yet to learn a lesson from two consecutive floods that claimed many lives; its greed is not on the wane either. It has kept its eyes on some of the remaining green cover. Votaries of the tunnel should think about the next generation also,” said Dr V S Vijayan, environmental scientist who was in the team of Madhav Gadgil committee that prepared a report on the fragile ecology of depleting Western Ghats. Vijayan said it is one of the most vulnerable areas of the 1,600 km long Western Ghats mountain ranges that play a key role in breaking clouds during the monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hasn-t-learnt-ecologists-react-to-tunnel-project-in-western-ghats/story-C17vG9Zr9Jsm7G2yNaiG5M.html

Rajasthan Police’s slogan seems to have now changed to ‘Apradhi Mast, Janta Trast’ under Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot,” Poonia told reporters here.The BJP leader further condemned the incident, terming it “inhuman” and “horrifying.”Meanwhile, police have arrested the main accused in connection with the incident, in which a temple priest succumbed to his injuries on Thursday night after he was allegedly burnt alive by few people over a row on land at Bukna village in Sapotra, Karauli district.Superintendent of Police (SP), Karauli, Mridul Kachhwa said that the prime accused has been arrested and the remaining suspects will also be nabbed soon.“Priest Babulal gave a statement to police in the hospital that few influential people including accused Kailash Meena and his sons tried to encroach his land and during a dispute accused set the fence on fire in which priest got severely burnt. Six of our teams are working currently and the remaining accused too will be nabbed soon,” Kacchwa said.Meanwhile, Additional Commissioner, Law and Order, said that the victim’s family had put forth some demands which will be conveyed to the administration.“Relatives of the victim demanded ex-gratia, we will send the proposal to the government. Secondly, they also want action against local police, alleging negligence. We have assured probe and action against the cops in 24 hours if they are found guilty,” Additional Commissioner Rahul said.The official said that a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) level officer from another circle will carry out the investigation.Furthermore, the late priest Babulal’s relatives have demanded the arrest of the accused’s entire family, along with action against the local officers.“Only one accused has been arrested for burning the priest. We demand the accused’s entire family involved in this case should be arrested and police officials should be suspended for inaction. There is anger in the entire Brahmin community,” Ramakant Sharma, a relative of the late priest said.Earlier, the State’s former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has condemned the incident and urged the Congress government to “wake up from its slumber and ensure strict punishment to the culprits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-satish-poonia-slams-rajasthan-police-after-priest-s-death/story-KxDBwDBqBKtGWN4k6b94AJ.html

A Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft was used to test-fire the indigenously developed new generation anti-radiation missile (NGARM) off the country’s east coast.Rudram 1 can be integrated to IAF’s Sukhoi-30 jets and used as its launch platform. Rudram 1 can be used to detect and hone in on a radio source, according to defence website defenceupdate.in. This gives Rudram 1 the ability to detect enemy radars on the ground. Once these missiles disarm enemy radars on the ground, it can help inflict more damage in the attacks that follow the first wave.NGARM’s primary guidance system is an on-board passive homing head (PHH) armed with broadband capability. These features allow it to choose and select a target among the range of emitters that it sees at that point of time. The new NGARMs with PHH operates in the D-J band and can detect radio frequency emission from 100km away. Rudram 1 is a target seeking missile and contains a radar dome which is critical for missiles which can be used to target and destroy enemy based radars on the ground. Rudram can strike any range between 100-250 km.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated IAF and DRDO for its successful test. “The New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile (Rudram-1) which is India’s first indigenous anti-radiation missile developed by DRDO for Indian Air Force was tested successfully today at ITR, Balasore. Congratulations to DRDO & other stakeholders for this remarkable achievement,” the defence minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rudram-missile-how-do-ngarms-work/story-C2mUYlqGY9hvU34D7lty2H.html

Union minister for panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar will also join the programme. The property cards being rolled out under the SVAMITVA scheme launched by the Prime Minister in April are physical copies of property titles of the villagers’ homes and the surrounding areas they own (as opposed to the cultivated land), which will be handed over to around 132,000 landowners during the event.Post the launch, the state governments will physically distribute the cards to people from more than 750 villages across six states. “The historic move set to transform rural India” will enable around 100,000 property holders to download their property cards through an SMS link delivered on their mobile phones.According to the PMO, the beneficiaries are from 763 villages including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and 2 from Karnataka.Beneficiaries from all the states, except Maharashtra, will receive the physical copies of the property cards within one day and since the western state has a system of recovering the nominal cost these cards, it will take a month’s time, it added.The SVAMITVA scheme will cover 662,000 villages in a phased manner over a period of four years and the move will pave the way for using property as a financial asset by villagers for taking loans and other financial benefits, the statement said. The PMO also hailed the exercise as the first such large-scale exercise, involving the most modern means of technology, that will benefit millions of rural property owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-property-cards-under-svamitva-scheme-on-oct-11/story-6ortWNs79HseKp26cTMmRP.html

In a tweet, PM Modi later said he appreciated Putin’s “immense personal contribution” to strengthening the special and privileged strategic partnership between the two counries. Among others who congratulated President Putin on his birthday were leaders of Israel, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Moldova, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.It is interesting to note that while Russia and China have an economic and security relationship, the personal touch between President Putin and President Xi Jinping has been missing from both sides.According to diplomats based in Moscow and New Delhi, while Russia has offered India winter clothing and Sprut light weight tanks with a T-90 barrel for Ladakh stand-off, there are reports that Moscow has delayed the supply of the second S-400 surface to air missile system ostensibly on account of the coronavirus pandemic. China has contracted to buy four S-400 systems from Russia, the first one has already been deployed near Nyingchi across Arunachal Pradesh.India has a deal to buy 5 S-400 systems from Russia, deliveries of which are likely to begin at the end of next year. The order of additional Su-30 MKI and MiG-29 fighters to replenish the reserve are already on schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-phones-putin-appreciates-his-personal-contribution-to-deepen-ties/story-mg8pCmFI2Vrko45fFUUumI.html

The party had used the same formula in 2007 assembly polls in which it won a majority.With about 18-months left for UP polls, BSP’s Brahmin face, Satish Chandra Mishra has started holding meetings of Brahmins district committees to mobilise them in favour of BSP.In the last two months, Mishra, also party’s national general secretary, has chaired meetings of 73 such committees in which an impressive number of Brahmins participated.“Except for a few districts of west UP, the Brahmin committee meetings of east UP, central UP and Bundelkhand regions have been concluded. The party is getting an immense response, similar to what we got in 2007 assembly elections,” said Mishra.He added that the meetings were a success despite the restrictions in place due to Covid-19 guidelines. “Due to Covid-19, the meetings have been organized according to the government guidelines. Batches of hundred influential Brahmin community members participated in each meeting to ensure social distancing and were told to hold meetings of the community in their areas,” Mishra said.“I will hold meetings of the Brahmin community in all 403 assembly segments after October 15 when the central government is expected to announce fresh guidelines for political and social meetings and after which I will plan the next round of the meetings across UP,” he said, giving a glimpse of his planned outreach to the influential community.

He joined the company his father started in 1966, after graduating from the University of Westminster in 2001.SII has been in the spotlight for the past few months as it is to manufacture the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute and AstraZeneca in India. It began trials in the country in August-end and in last week of September, the third phase of human clinical trial began at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital in Pune.On September 26, Poonawalla tweeted whether the Indian government would have Rs 80,000 crore available over the next one year because that is the amount which is required to buy and distribute vaccine everyone in the country. A day later, he applauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision. “We share and applaud your vision @narendramodi ji, on providing vaccines to the global community. It is a proud moment for India, thank you for your leadership and support. It is clear that all your arrangements for India will take care of all needs for the Indian people,” he said.After overcoming a hurdle on September 10, when the trials had to be paused in India a day after the United Kingdom-based developers announced a global halt of the human experiments because a patient developed a potentially serious condition, SII has got back to planning around manufacturing and distributing the vaccine once it is ready. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave approval to the institute a week later to resume the trials.“The permission has been given to restart the trials with certain conditions,” said a senior official aware of the developments in the DCGI office. “Extra care during screening, additional information [for] informed consent and close monitoring for similar events during the study follow-up would need to be followed,” DGCI said. According to Adar Poonawalla, the SII is to produce one billion doses of the vaccine candidate which is among the front-runners in the fight against coronavirus.In September, the institute claimed that it along with along with Gavi and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will manufacture an additional up to 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses for India and low- and middle-income countries, according to news agency PTI.The latest collaboration between the partners brings the total number of vaccine doses to be covered to an aggregate of up to 200 million doses, SII said in a statement.Another recent statement that put Poonawalla under the spotlight was his response to a tweet by film producer Ronnie Screwvala. Screwvala had tweeted about a special quota of Covid-19 vaccine for Parsis. “More than enough” doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca will be kept for the Parsi community, Poonawalla replied.He, however, did not specify the quantity of the doses that will be kept for the community which is grappling with shrinking population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-look-at-serum-institute-and-its-ceo-adar-poonawalla-s-2020-journey-as-world-awaits-covid-19-vaccine/story-A7L1IJZCkivgQ2fTJnpR5H.html

It was tested at the interim test range Balasore, off the coast of Odisha in the Bay of Bengal, at about 10.30 am.“This is a huge step forward,” a senior government official said about the DRDO’s successful test firing. “The IAF will now have the capability to perform SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defence) operations deep into enemy territory to destroy enemy air defence setup,” the official said.This would allow the IAF’s strike aircraft to carry out their mission unhindered effectively. “This test demonstrates the capability of an Anti-Radiation Missile with large stand-off ranges,” a second official said.Watch l Watch: India test fires anti-radiation missile Rudram-1 l All you need to know The New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile, or NGARM, is integrated on Su-30MKI fighter aircraft. Its range depends on the height at which the fighter jet is flying. It can be launched from a height ranging from 500 metres to 15 km and can hit radiation emitting targets within a range of 250 km.All radars and Electro Optical Tracking System tracked the launch and point of impact, a senior government official told Hindustan Times.The tactical, air-to-surface anti-radiation missile is equipped with a passive homing head that tracks sources of radiation of a wide range of frequencies. It can lock into a target not only before launch but also after it has been launched.Also Read: India launches Rudram missile. How do NGARMs workThe missile is comparable to the tactical air-to-surface missile AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile that was inducted by the US Navy only in 2017 and can engage relocatable Integrated Air Defence targets and other targets equipped with shutdown capability. This means that if the enemy shuts down the radar after the missile is launched, it will still hit the target.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted his congratulations to the DRDO team that developed the supersonic-capable missile that can be launched at speeds ranging from 0.6 Mach to 2 Mach.“The New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile (Rudram-1) which is India’s first indigenous anti-radiation missile developed by DRDO for Indian Air Force was tested successfully today at ITR, Balasore. Congratulations to DRDO & other stakeholders for this remarkable achievement,” Rajnath Singh said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-test-fires-rudram-1-its-first-anti-radiation-missile-to-take-down-enemy-radars/story-SYP6qWQOXmZrK7ViSPG54K.html

Three accused have been arrested so far.While speaking to news agency ANI, Chhattisgarh BJP President Vishnu Dev Sai condemned the incident and said that the Congress-led government has no right to protest against the Hathras case when rsimilar incidents are taking place in Congress-ruled Chattisgarh.“There are constant attacks happening on tribals in the state, the Chhattisgarh government’s police are not ready to register FIRs. Congress is holding protests against Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras incident in Chhattisgarh, but they themselves are not able to do anything about the multiple Hathras’ in the state,” Sai said, adding that there is no rule of law in Chhattisgarh.State Congress chief Mohan Markam defended the state government’s approach by saying that the incident came to knowledge recently and prompt action had been taken, including the arrest of the three accused.“Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel government is sensitive to such incidents and believes in taking prompt action. It is definitely a matter of concern that such acts are taking place repeatedly, it cannot be allowed to happen in the civil society,” he added.On Wednesday, the victim’s body which was buried at the Dhanora police station area was exhumed for further examination by the police after her family members alleged that there was no action taken. Police officials said that the incident was not reported to them.Meanwhile, Bastar range’s inspector general of police (IGP) Sundarraj P said that a Special Investigation Team has been formed to investigate the case.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhanora-rape-case-chattisgarh-bjp-demands-bhupesh-baghel-s-resignation-prompt-action-was-taken-says-congress/story-gz3LfoYzbJ7xGEqIgv2pRN.html

He had also served in important capacity in the SPG (Special Protection Group).” Kumar was found hanging at his home in Shimla on Wednesday. The 69-year-old left behind a suicide note saying he was “embarking on a new journey”, officials have said.The editorial said the retired IPS officer had a strong mind and body and that is why the government gave him important assignments during his decades-long career.“Such a person ends his life and nobody questions it ...this is surprising,” the Marathi daily said.Without naming Kangana Ranaut, the editorial said, “An actress who is currently residing in Himachal Pradesh should speak on whether Kumar was really fed up with his life or was under some kind of pressure.” The saffron party said news channels should also speak up on the circumstances which led to Kumar’s suicide.The Sena publication said questions raised in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case can come up in the Kumar matter as well.“Sushant was a reel life hero,while Ashwani Kumar was a real-life hero,” it said.The editorial said despite medical proof, some people are not ready to accept that Rajput committed suicide.“But no one is interested in knowingthis mystery (behind Kumar’s death). Times are very difficult,” it said.“We recovered a suicide note in which he (Kumar) had written he is embarking on a new journey. His family members were present when he went inside the room, locked it and committed suicide by hanging himself with a nylon rope.“The family does not suspect any foul play. We have seized the items in the room, Himachal Pradesh DGP Sanjay Kundu had said.

Vaccine producers are carrying out clinical trials as countries are sealing new deals. Apart from the safety concerns of the vaccines under trial, the flurry of deals has become a new worry as richer nations are at an advantage to pre-book vaccines, which may lead to unavailability for other countries. Here are the latest Covid-19 vaccine updates:Hong Kong to start trial of nasal sprayHong Kong will start trials for an experimental vaccine which will be administered through nasal spray. This vaccine will be a dual vaccine — to be used for both influenza and Covid-19. Research on the experimental spray received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in Norway and Hong Kong’s government, and will join dozens of clinical trials around the world aimed at identifying safe and effective vaccines to prevent Covid-19, Bloomberg reported.University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology. The candidate vaccine is similar to a nasal spray flu immunization already on the market that’s designed to start working where respiratory viruses typically enter the body: the nose.European Union seals new deal with Johnson & JohnsonThe European Commission has sealed a deal with Johnson & Johnson for the supply of its potential Covid-19 vaccine for up to 400 million people. This is the third advance purchase contract signed by the EU. The other two were with Astrazeneca and Sanofi.

Provision of patients’ vitals in real-time on doctors’ mobile phones, robots that transport blood samples, virtual assessments of cardiac risk and telemedicine are at the forefront of the Covid-19 fight at the Bengaluru hospitals now.The hospitals use technology platforms called Atma and Neha. Atma facilitates payment for consultation, acts as a discharge counter and the pharmacy. Doctors employ Neha to remotely access data such as a patient’s temperature, blood pressure, cardiac arrest risk assessment and to advise patients. Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 6.9 million mark; active cases further fall below 900,000The overhaul was discussed as part of a session at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY)’s conclave RAISE (Responsible Artificial Intelligence for Social Empowerment). MEITY additional secretary Rajendra Kumar moderated the session, which was attended by researchers and participants from across the medical ecosystem. “Analytics can provide relevant information to manage diseases; it can make our access to affordable care easier and promote technology for the poor and the common man. Artificial intelligence for diagnostic solutions, personalised predictions and drug discovery, and repositioning is the future. It can help us tackle Covid-19 and other future pandemics,” Kumar said. Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, chairman and executive director of Narayana Hospitals, said that Covid-19 has fast-tracked the legalisation of telemedicine. “At present, we are treating 400 Covid-19 patients, 100 of whom are in the Intensive Care Unit,” Shetty said. “Our attempt has been that the least number of doctors and support staff comes to the hospitals.” He added that over 17 years, the hospital has treated 53,000 patients with technology. “We asked for telemedicine to be legalised but it didn’t happen. One week of Covid-19 and telemedicine is now a reality,” he added. Shetty said the hospitals leveraged artificial intelligence to develop tools, such as devices attached to patients, that transmit real-time data to doctors’ phones. “We were able to segregate 20% of the patients who were at a higher risk of cardiac arrest, due to comorbidities or other reasons, so that we could provide the vulnerable extra care,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-s-narayana-hospitals-employs-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-covid-19/story-CDml4Fr0kNraNJGSPNOR4O.html

Swamy alleged that fake evidence had been planted in his computer before he was arrested by the NIA. Swamy had been questioned as a suspect in the case by the investigating agencies, including by the Pune police in 2018 and also by the NIA on several occasions since 2018.He is likely to be produced before the special NIA court on Friday, where the agency may seek his custody. Swamy is known for fighting for tribals rights in the state of Jharkhand and was part of the Jharkhand Organisation against Uranium Radiation (JOAR), a campaign run against Uranium Corporation India Limited in 1996. He has been working for welfare and rights of displaced people of Bokaro, Santhal Parganas and Koderma. A senior NIA official, who confirmed the arrest, said Swamy was a member of CPI (Maoist) and was actively involved in the activities of the banned outfit.“He also received funds through an associate for the furtherance of CPI (Maoist) activities. He is the convenor of persecuted prisoners’ solidarity committee (PPSC), a frontal organization of CPI (Maoist). The documents related to aiding the activities of CPI (Maoist) and propaganda material of the banned outfit, including its literature, were seized from his possession,” the NIA official said on the condition of anonymity.Swamy had approached the Bombay High court in October 2018 for quashing the complaint filed against him in this case. His lawyer Mihir Desai had then submitted to the court that PPSC has no political colour.Also Read: Bhima Koregaon judicial panel requests state to put hearings on hold due to Covid“The persecuted prisoners solidarity committee is formed by the elite in the society with the aim of assisting prisoners, unnecessarily languishing in various jails in several states and it has no political colour,” reads the submissions made by Desai, mentioned in the court order. The prosecution had also claimed then that Swamy is just considered a suspect and not an accused. The court had dismissed the plea. Two years later, the NIA, which took over the probe in January this year, again began probing his role in the violence case.Also Read: Minor sisters found dead in Jharkhand, police launch probe In a statement released just before he was arrested, Swamy said, “The nature of the present NIA investigation of me has nothing to do about Bhima-Koregaon case in which I have been booked as a ‘suspected-accused ’ and consequently raided twice (28 August 2018 and 12 June 2019). But it had everything to do to somehow establish (i) that I am personally linked to extremist leftist forces, (ii) that through me, Bagaicha is also related to some Maoists. I denied both these allegations in the strongest terms.” Bagaicha is a Jesuit-run social centre, where Swamy lives in a room.Swamy also alleged that NIA fabricated evidence against him. “I was interrogated by NIA for 15 hours during a span of 5 days (July 27 to July 30 and on August 6). Apart from my bio-data and some factual information, several extracts allegedly taken from my computer implicating my connection to Maoist forces were placed before me. I told them all these are fabrications stealthily put into my computer and I disowned them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-evidence-planted-jharkhand-activist-stan-swamy-claims-before-arrest/story-AjN6dIkfBgZ6WkRschPPPO.html

Gretchen Whitmer argued in a speech Thursday that President Donald Trump’s words had been a “rallying cry” for extremists.Whitmer, a Democrat, said the Republican president has spent the last seven months of the coronavirus pandemic “denying science, ignoring his own health experts, stoking distrust, fomenting anger and giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.”She singled out Trump’s debate comments, when he didn’t condemn white supremacist groups and told one far-right extremist group to “stand back and stand by.”“Hate groups heard the president’s words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry,” Whitmer said. “When our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight. When our leaders meet, encourage or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit.”There’s no indication in the criminal complaint that the men arrested were inspired by Trump. Authorities also have not publicly said whether the men were angry about Whitmer’s coronavirus orders, which sharply curtailed businesses and individuals in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.Democrat Joe Biden sought to tie Trump to the plot as well, pointing to the president’s tweet earlier this year to “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” Whitmer’s coronavirus response has faced criticism from conservatives, and the GOP-led Michigan Legislature sued her in May to try to invalidate her stay-at-home order and other measures.The arrests and Whitmer’s comments come less than a month before the presidential election in a key battleground state, where recent polls show Biden has a lead.Six men were charged in federal court with conspiring to kidnap the governor in reaction to what they viewed as her “uncontrolled power,” according to a federal complaint. Separately, seven others were charged in state court under Michigan’s anti-terrorism laws for allegedly targeting police and seeking a “civil war.”Trump criticized Whitmer’s remarks, saying she has done a “terrible job” and should open the state. Her stay-at-home order was lifted months ago, but mask requirements and gathering restrictions remain.The president tweeted that “my” Justice Department and federal law enforcement had thwarted a dangerous plot against her.“Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist,” he tweeted before accusing Biden and Democrats of not condemning “looters and mobs that burn down” Democratic-run cities.“I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence,” Trump said. “Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President!”Whitmer also called for kindness and empathy during the pandemic and issued a warning to those who threaten violence.“Hatred, bigotry and violence have no place in the great state of Michigan,” she said. “If you break the law or conspire to commit heinous acts of violence against anyone, we will find you, we will hold you accountable and we will bring you to justice.”___This story has been corrected to reflect that Trump said “stand back and stand by,” not “stand up and stand by.”___Associated Press writer David Eggert in Lansing, Mich. contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-s-words-inspire-extremists-says-michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer/story-mu1sRpHoKmYXIrJirN80qJ.html

He had been in active politics for more than five decades.LJP chief and his son Chirag Paswan broke the news on Twitter. “Papa .... Now you are not in this world but I know you are always with me wherever you are. Miss you Papa…,” he tweeted, with a throwback photo of his father hugging him. पापा....अब आप इस दुनिया में नहीं हैं लेकिन मुझे पता है आप जहां भी हैं हमेशा मेरे साथ हैं। Miss you Papa... pic.twitter.com/Qc9wF6Jl6ZPrime Minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah were among the many politicians who tweeted their condolences to the departed leader’s family.“I am saddened beyond words. There is a void in our nation that will perhaps never be filled. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan Ji’s demise is a personal loss. I have lost a friend, valued colleague and someone who was extremely passionate to ensure every poor person leads a life of dignity,” Modi said in his condolence message.“Shri Ram Vilas Paswan Ji rose in politics through hardwork and determination. As a young leader, he resisted tyranny and the assault on our democracy during the Emergency. He was an outstanding Parliamentarian and Minister, making lasting contributions in several policy areas,” he said in subsequent tweet.“Modi government will be committed to fulfill his dream of the welfare of poor and development of Bihar. My condolences to his family and supporters. I pray for the peace of the departed soul,” Amit Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-vilas-paswan-passes-away-national-flag-flies-at-half-mast-in-delhi-other-capital-cities/story-267Ue4WPZQLf5xA2VxYisN.html
09-10-2020||India||IIT Mandi researchers develop cost-effective, environment friendly catalyst||Researchers from Indian Institute of Technology Mandi have developed a carbon-based nanosheet that can be used as a catalyst for industrial hydrogenation reactions, instead of the precious heavy metals currently in use. This could reduce the cost of the processes as well as make them environment friendly. Hydrogenation—a process of adding hydrogen to a compound—is commonly used in industries to produce aromatic alcohols for perfumes, pharmaceutical products, agrochemicals and other chemical substances. Instead of using hydrogen gas, which can be inconvenient and expensive, industries use hydrogen donor chemicals that release hydrogen for the reaction. Also Read: Shut down thermal power plants around Delhi, demands AAPHowever, a catalyst is needed for the completion of the reaction. A catalyst is a compound that increases the rate of a reaction without getting consumed in the process. For hydrogenation, industries currently use precious metals such as rhodium, iridium, platinum and ruthenium that are expensive and lead to environmental pollution. The recovery of these metal catalysts is also difficult. The team from the School of Basic Sciences at IIT Mandi, in collaboration with researchers from IIT Ropar, have developed a carbon-based graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheet that can be used instead of a metal catalyst. “We synthesised a catalyst by the chemical oxidation of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheets, which results in the generation of water-loving (hydrophilic) carboxyl, hydroxyl and ketonic groups over the GCN surface,” said Dr Venkata Krishnan, associate professor at School of Basic Sciences, in a release. These hydrophilic groups are the active reaction sites for the hydrogenation process. Nanosheets are tiny sheets of the material, 100,000 times thinner than a single human hair, but present a large surface area for the reaction to occur. The team tried various hydrogenation reactions using the carbon-based catalyst and found it produced high yields for these reactions, proving it to be versatile. In addition, these nanosheets can be recovered and reused for several runs without any loss in catalytic activity. “We cannot overestimate the practical importance of catalysis. Almost all the synthetic products we use now relies on industrial preparations, which in turn make use of catalysts,” said Krishnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-mandi-researchers-develop-cost-effective-environment-friendly-catalyst/story-OLFGhzOUUpTUxOpf9VWGnO.html

09-10-2020||India||Train tickets to be available 5 minutes before departure from tomorrow. All you need to know||From October 10 onwards, railway seats will be available even five minutes before the train leaves the station, as the Indian Railways has decided to restore the pre-covid system of preparing the second reservation chart half an hour before the departure time. Regular passenger train services remain suspended in wake of the pandemic. But the Indian Railways in a staggered manner is restoring the pre-Covid practices and is also running special trains.Here is all you need to know about the new changes:1. The second reservation charts will be prepared 30 minutes before the schedule departure of trains from stations. This was normal before Covid. But when the Indian Railways started special passenger trains amid the pandemic, the second reservation chart was being prepared two hours before the schedule departure.2. Train tickets can be booked until second reservation chart is prepared. As from tomorrow, these charts will be prepared between 30 minutes to 5 minutes before the scheduled departure, tickets can be booked during this time. 3. The first chart is prepared at least four hours before the scheduled departure of the train. If seats become vacant owing to cancellation, they can be booked through PRS counters and online till the preparation of the second chart.4. Tickets can also be cancelled during this time, as per the provisions of the refund rules.5. The timings were changed during the pandemic as initially tickets were only available online. The Railways was avoiding crowding at the stations and the aim was to discourage people from travelling unless absolutely necessary.6. In the last few months, the situation has changed. The Centre has been focussing more on reopening instead of locking down. The Railways has started several new trains as well. With the festive season coming, the Railways has already announced 39 pairs of new special trains. It has not yet announced a date for these special trains but they will be operational between October 15 and November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-tickets-to-be-available-5-minutes-before-departure-from-tomorrow-all-you-need-to-know/story-CaEaQHnUaan1FG4pcn5yTP.html

It has been learnt that Sinha travelled for six hours and walked for about 4 km to reach village Tarkassi in the far flung area of Rajouri in the Jammu division to meet the families on Thursday.He expressed grief and sorrow over the incident and assured them of justice. He said that the government will take care of all the three families and all assistance would be provided to them, said the official. Sinha also conveyed sympathies to the families on behalf of the PM. Close on the heels of the army’s findings of irregularities in the Amshipora operation, the family of the three young Gujjar men have demanded severe punishment to the guilty under the law. All the three men hailed from Tarkassi village of Rajouri district and were related.The family has also demanded that the alleged informant, who told the army officials that the three were terrorists, in the hope of receiving “rewards and awards”, should also be exposed. The three men- Imtiyaz Ahmad, Abrar Ahmad and Ibrar Mohammad- were missing since July 17 and the army confirmed that they were killed by the security forces in Shopian on that day. An army inquiry has found that the security forces involved in the Amshipora operation had breached the rules. Lal Hussain, uncle of the three youths, said “We have lost three young men. They were my nephews, who had gone to Shopian to earn money for the families back home. I demand that those involved in the fake encounter and the contact, who branded my nephews as terrorists and passed on the information to the security forces, must be punished under the law of the land.” “The pictures of the alleged terrorists killed in the encounter that went viral on social media sites were of my nephew Imtiyaz Ahmad and two other relatives Abrar Ahmad and Ibrar Mohammad Khan,” he added. The three young men aged 21, 26 and 18 years had left Rajouri and reached Shopian via Mughal Road on July 2 and July 17 to work as labourers. Thereafter, they remained missing. On July 18, the army claimed it had killed three unidentified terrorists in Amshipora of Shopian. Also Read: Three terrorists gunned down in encounter in J-K’s ShopianOn August 14, a police team from Shopian collected DNA samples of three families in Rajouri to match them with those of the three young men. Lal Hussain had been all along claiming that his nephews were innocent Gujjar boys, who had gone to Shopian to work as labourers and that they had nothing to do with terrorism. The Army had said that “The inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the Do’s and Don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened. Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable”. Also Read: Pak ‘spy’ arrested in J&K’s Samba“The evidence collected by the inquiry has prima-facie indicated that the three unidentified terrorists killed in Op Amshipora were Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammad Ibrar, who hailed from Rajouri. Their DNA report is awaited. Their involvement with terrorism or related activities is under investigation by the police,” it added. The Indian Army statement had also reaffirmed its commitment to “ethical conduct of operations” and added that further updates on the case will be given periodically without affecting due process of the law of the land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/l-g-promises-justice-and-jobs-to-kin-of-men-killed-in-fake-shopian-encounter/story-quu1LxJuszfezbqgo4uyFJ.html

The system will use meteorological data in combination with geospatial and population data to assess the impact of the cyclone in a particular area and provide location of district-specific tailored warnings for the tropical cyclones. “Damage caused to infrastructure due to cyclones is increasing world over. With India’s growing economy, we aim to reduce the damage and economic losses to property and infrastructure. The dynamic, impact-based cyclone warning will be commissioned this season,” said Dr Mrityunjay Mohapatra, IMD’s director general. NDMA, meanwhile, has taken up National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project to develop a Web-based Dynamic Composite Risk Atlas (Web-DCRA) in collaboration with IMD and the governments of coastal states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-to-use-impact-based-warning/story-iCYq00aPiv0udkHZx66evL.html
09-10-2020||India||Allahabad HC rejects plea in Hathras case||The Allahabad high court dismissed on Thursday a petition that alleged the government illegally confined the 19-year-old Dalit gang rape victim’s family to their house, with the judges observing that the matter was being heard by the Supreme Court.This came on a day the victim’s brother rejected allegations by the prime accused in the case – Sandeep Singh -- that the Dalit’s woman family killed her because they disapproved of her relationship with Singh.“They are trying to pressure a Dalit family and leveling allegations against a family which has lost its daughter. These are afterthoughts aimed at twisting the case and will not sustain,” the victim’s brother said. “How can one think of killing his own sister? These are tactics being adopted to mislead the probe agencies,” he added. In high court, a two-judge bench of Justice Pritinker Diwaker and Justice Prakash Padia dismissed the petition filed by an organisation working for the Valmiki community, to which the victim’s family belonged.“In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, judicial propriety demands that it will not be proper for this court to entertain the present petition on merits, especially when security has been provided to petitioners 1 to 6 and other family members of the deceased victim-girl on the observation made by the Hon’ble apex court and also on the basis of the directions issued by the Lucknow bench of this court,” the judges observed.On September 14, the victim was raped by four members of Thakur caste in Hathras district when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She was partially paralysed in the attack.As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29. At 2.30am the next day, the police forcibly cremated the body without the family’s consent in a field near the village. Since then, Opposition leaders have made a beeline to the village even as the government has denied she was raped, citing the forensic report. Five police officials have been suspended even as the government has ordered a probe into an alleged “international conspiracy” to defame the administration. The four accused have also garnered significant support in the locality – especially after a mega meeting or mahapanchayat was organised by Brahmin and Thakur communities.On Friday, Singh wrote a letter to the superintendent of police (SP), Hathras, and claimed he was innocent. He said he was friends with the woman, and blamed her mother and brother for beating her to death because they never accepted his friendship with her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-hc-rejects-plea-in-hathras-case/story-obBHzuY7BINo7zzBnMoouJ.html

09-10-2020||India||IAF has shown capability to engage adversary: Air chief||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Thursday said the IAF had “clearly demonstrated” its resolve and operational capability to “effectively engage” the adversary should the need arise, at a time India and China are locked in border tensions in the sensitive Ladakh sector. In his address on the 88th IAF Day celebrations at the Hindon airbase, during which Balakot heroes were presented gallantry awards, the IAF chief said, “I would like to commend all warriors for the quick response, in the recent stand-off on our northern frontiers, when we deployed our combat assets at short notice to handle any eventuality, and provided proactive support to all the requirements of deployment and sustenance for the Indian Army.” Three days ago, the IAF chief said at his annual press conference that China couldn’t get the better of India in any conflict and the air force was ready to handle any contingency, with its capability and intent serving as a deterrent for the adversary. The IAF celebrated its 88th anniversary with a ceremonial parade and fly-past involving 59 aircraft including the Rafale jets. It was the second public appearance of the Rafales after the planes were formally inducted at the Ambala airbase on September 10. The fly-past this year was marked by elaborate air displays by front-line fighter jets, transport aircraft and helicopters that flew in synergy in line with the theme of ‘Innovate, Integrate and Intimidate.’ Bhadauria presented gallantry awards to several IAF personnel including fighter pilots who were associated with the air force’s 2019 airstrikes against terror camps in Pakistan’s Balakot. These awards were announced on the eve of Independence Day last year but given away on Thursday. Several Yudh Seva Medals and Vayu Sena Medals for gallantry were announced last year for officers who were a part of the Balakot operation on February 26, 2019 and dogfight with the Pakistan air force the next day. Those awarded the YSM by the IAF chief on Thursday included Air Vice Marshal Sunil Kashinath Vidhate, Group Captains Yeshpal Singh Negi, Hemant Kumar, Hansel Joseph Sequeira and Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal. Aggarwal, a woman fighter controller, played a key role in intercepting the Pakistan air force’s attempt to launch retaliatory air attacks after the IAF’s Balakot airstrikes, which were in retaliation for the February 14, 2019 Pulwama suicide car bomb attack that killed 40 troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Those who were given Vayu Sena Medals for gallantry included Group Captain Pranav Raj, Wing Commander Amit Ranjan and Squadron Leaders Pankaj Bhujade, Shashank Singh and BKN Reddy. “With Atmanirbharta {self-reliance} as the bedrock, IAF has been rapidly shifting to indigenous equipment. The light combat aircraft, advanced light helicopter, Netra AEW&C, Akash surface-to-air missile systems, ASTRA air-to-air missile, BrahMos…are many successes of our home industry, which are already operational in the IAF today,” the IAF chief said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-has-shown-capability-to-engage-adversary-air-chief/story-s1z2nL7pDqBt2r0V6D3VtM.html
09-10-2020||India||Delhiwale: Portrait of a knife sharpener||His profession isn’t something common any more. “I am a dhaar walla (knife sharpener),” says Muhammed Waseem, explaining that his job is to sharpen the dhaar of the household knives. This morning, his stall is parked by a central Delhi street. The establishment is very makeshift and very mobile, consisting of a simple bicycle. A sharpening machine is installed on the crossbar — Mr Waseem calls it “shaan”. It comprises of a battery-operated metal disc that revolves with great speed when being used. The knife blade is placed directly over the disk; the sparks fly and the blade gets its dhaar.But right now Mr Waseem is standing idle, waiting for customers. “I spend the day going about many parts of the city.” Right now he is in Lakshmi Nagar. Later he will pedal to Preet Vihar and Karkardooma “and perhaps even to Anand Vihar”.Mr Waseem’s father is a dhaar walla too, in their native Mewat region, in Haryana. But Mr Waseem came to live in Delhi on his own. Only 21, he says he picked up the work five years ago. On being queried if he has any burning dream, he stays silent for a while, his gaze fixed ahead as if he was thinking really hard. After what appears to be a long pause, he shrugs his shoulders, muttering—“What dream, no dream.”He studied until 10th standard. He shrugs his shoulders again on the possibility of further studies. “I have two brothers... one is a carpenter... the other is very young.”Mr Waseem’s day starts at 7am. He doesn’t cook at his room. “I always eat in the hotels outside.” This morning he fortified himself with a glass of chai and two fens. He shall have a more substantial meal for lunch. Meanwhile, a great stack of knives are arranged on the handle bar of his cycle. “I sell them.” He didn’t make them, he clarifies, saying he buys the knives from a wholesaler in Sadar Bazaar. After posing for photos, he says, “people like me don’t think about dreams.” He will return to his room by 4pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-knife-sharpener/story-oflwtLtUfxYm2b4juxsAzI.html
09-10-2020||India||Ram Vilas Paswan: Socialist icon, consummate politician||In 1969, a tall and lanky Dalit political activist, in his early 20s, entered the Bihar legislative assembly as a legislator of the Samyukta Socialist Party.It was a time of political ferment. The hegemony of the Congress had been eroded, for the first time, in state elections in 1967, and alternative ruling coalitions — usually led by socialists — had taken over many state capitals in north India. But this political ferment itself was a result of social churn. The first cracks in upper caste dominance were visible. Backward communities were making their presence felt in democratic politics. Social justice for the marginalised was becoming a central political plank. It was in this milieu that the young Dalit man from north Bihar threw in his lot with socialists. On Thursday, 51 years after his entry into public life as an elected representative, the young activist, who went on to become one of India’s most senior politicians and, arguably, the most senior Dalit leader in the country, passed on.In life and death, Ram Vilas Paswan represented the possibilities and limitations of the politics of social justice in India. He symbolised the pathway that democratic electoral politics offered to marginalised communities to demand their space and challenge the hierarchies present in the social order. But he also symbolised the pragmatism — and what critics would call the opportunism — that often marks high politics in India. It was in how Paswan navigated the twin streams of the politics of justice and the politics of power, while remaining eternally relevant, that made him a true survivor of Indian politics.To understand what Ram Vilas Paswan meant for Dalit politics — much before Mayawati became its face and far surpassed Paswan’s political stature in the community — it is important to understand the social context in which he came from. In Bihar’s deeply stratified society, he entered the political realm not as a beneficiary of patronage or largesse but by unapologetically asserting his identity. As he said in an interview to HT two years ago, while his father’s generation would get slapped and abused and could do nothing about it, his generation would resist — this resistance did not bring outright change, but it created an opening.Resistance for Paswan was simple — a space in the mainstream political structure. Power, he believed, was key to justice. And it helped that he had an instinctive smell for power, earning him the label of “mausam vaigyanik”, or weather scientist, in recent decades for his ability to read the political winds and shift strategies accordingly.To achieve this, Paswan was committed to the constitutional and electoral route. After opposing the Emergency, in 1977, he entered the Lok Sabha for the first time — with a record margin from Hajipur. He was to return to the Lower House seven more times, and shifted just recently to the upper house. And in this period, he would ally with every political stream in India. He was a minister in the VP Singh government, and emerged as a key champion of the implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations. He was a minister in United Front governments in the mid-1990s, arguing for the need for a Third Front, only to be disdainful of it in later years. He was a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government on the grounds that India needed stability before he resigned, in 2002, citing the Gujarat riots. He was a minister in the Manmohan Singh government till 2009, on the grounds of wanting to defeat communal forces. And he was a minister for the past six years in the Narendra Modi government, on the plank of “sabka saath, sabka vikas”, in what can be termed as a supremely ironical twist given why he had resigned from the Vajpayee government. But he was able to pull off all these shifts, almost seamlessly and without controversy, because he was clear-headed about what he wanted. He was ambitious and wanted to expand his power and resource base; this was possible through political authority; and this also helped his political constituency get benefits. Paswan was careful to keep this constituency intact — be it the broader Hajipur belt in north Bihar geographically or Paswans socially. And so he focused on getting projects to his region, or employment for members of his community, or opposing atrocities when it became an emotive issue for Dalits. This base was not enough to win him Bihar’s chief ministership or become a pan-India Dalit leader. But it was enough to make him a key swing force in Bihar, with a loyal vote base, useful for other larger parties, which in turn allowed him to then bargain for a slice of power. In his final years, Paswan had only ambition — to establish his son, Chirag, as not just his political successor but as a leader meant to achieve even greater things than he did. He relentlessly promoted his son, be it through political introductions across the spectrum (he had friends in every party), encouraging media coverage (he was an accessible minister, giving interviews as well as off the record insights), and most recently, handing over the responsibility of the Bihar election. But he also understood that Dalit politics itself was changing. In the same interview quoted above, where he spoke about the difference between his father’s generation and his,Paswan said: “The Chirag Paswan generation is not ready to accept it (slaps and abuses). People ask, why is there a protest on smaller issues? It’s because young Dalits want a life of respect.” At a time when the Hathras protests have shaken the BJP, his word of advice to his bigger ally on how to handle Dalit protests may seem apt too: “Work without antagonising anyone. There is lava inside — when it comes out slowly, the volcano doesn’t erupt; but if you suppress it, then it becomes an active volcano.” It was because of this recognition that Paswan persuaded the Modi government in its first term to push back against the Supreme Court verdict which was seen as diluting the atrocities act or asking it to publicise the benefits Dalits received with welfare schemes. Paswan died just as his party, the Lok Janashakti Party, has decided to contest the Bihar elections separately — in opposition to Nitish Kumar, who is the face of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the state, while remaining a part of the same alliance at the centre. While his death is sure to have an impact on Bihar elections, what many would see as the dualism of the LJP at the moment — of enjoying power while being the Opposition — is perhaps symbolic of the dualism of Paswan himself, of espousing the politics of justice while being enmeshed in the politics of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-vilas-paswan-socialist-icon-consummate-politician/story-gpocgpVLzqUImxT2o0cwfN.html
09-10-2020||India||IMA asks health minister to give proof on AYUSH, yoga-based treatment of Covid||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Thursday asked the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan to produce substantiating evidence on the protocol of prevention of Covid-19 infection based on AYUSH and yoga.IMA posed several questions to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan for issuing protocol of Covid-19 prevention and treatment of asymptomatic as well as mild cases based on AYUSH and yoga.On October 6, the Central government announced the National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for Management of Covid-19. Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan released the protocol in the virtual presence of AYUSH Minister Shripad Yesso Naik.“Is there satisfactory evidence regarding the claims made from studies done on Covid-19 patients based on the above criteria? If so, whether the evidence is weak or moderate or strong? The evidence should be in the public domain and available for scientific scrutiny,” it said in a statement.The IMA asked, “whether the severe form of Covid-19 a hyperimmune status or an immune deficiency status?”“Whether the proponents of this claim and his Ministry are prepared to subject themselves as volunteers to an independent prospective double-blind control study in the prevention and treatment of Covid? How many of his ministerial colleagues have so far made the informed choice of getting treated under these protocols?” the IMA asked.“What is stopping him from handing over Covid care and control to AYUSH ministry?IMA has demanded that the Union health minister should come clean on the above posers. “If not, he is inflicting a fraud on the nation and gullible patients by calling placebos as drugs,” it added.Questioning the scientific basis of these protocols, the IMA has asked the health minister “to give reproducibility of a claim elsewhere in non-conflict situations and double-blind control studies”.The National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for Management of Covid-19 guidelines has recommended doing gargles with warm water added with a pinch of turmeric and salt. Water boiled with triphala also can be used for gargling. They also recommend nasal installation/application of medicated oil (anu taila or shadbindu taila) or plain oil (sesame or coconut) or nasal application of cow’s ghee (goghrita) once or twice in a day, especially before going out and after coming back to home.The protocol also recommends steam inhalation with ajwain or pudina or eucalyptus oil once a day and adequate sleep of 6 to 8 hours.The guidelines point out specific measures and symptom management for prophylactic care in the high-risk populations, primary contacts, for asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 patients.The AYUSH Ministry is also studying four studies covering a huge sample size for prophylactic care. It has also undertaken about seven studies on `Guduchi’ as prophylactic care on about 1.33 lakh population.AYUSH ministry is also studying the combination in about 200 participants through two studies in moderate Covid 19 with very positive trends. It has also undertaken six clinical studies across India which are showing very positive trends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-asks-health-minister-to-produce-proof-on-ayush-yoga-based-treatment-of-covid/story-MJbHmt3vyKb9YSldTzO6KM.html
09-10-2020||India||MHA relaxes Covid curbs in poll states||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday partially modified its latest Covid-19 guidelines to allow political rallies with immediate effect in 12 states where elections are scheduled to be held. According to the original guidelines issued on September 30, political, social, religious and other gatherings were to be allowed, in open spaces, from October 15, with no ceiling on the number of attendees. In closed spaces, the upper bound on the audience for such gatherings was raised to 200 from 100. Both of these changes will now be applicable with immediate effect in the poll-bound states. The changes will mean political parties can hold election rallies and meetings, usually conducted outdoors, ahead of the Bihar assembly elections and by-polls in 11 other states -- Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Nagaland and Odisha. The home ministry has asked all political parties to ensure that people follow all other safeguards listed in it September 30 guidelines, such as ensuring the wearing of masks, social distancing and checking the temperatures of the attendees. Bihar will vote in three phases , on October 28, November 3, and November 7. The results of the election will be declared on November 10. The voting for 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh will be held on November 3 and the results will be announced on November 10. In his order sent to the 12 poll-bound states, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that “it is decided that the state governments concerned may permit political gatherings outside containment zones beyond the existing limit of 100 persons on any date before October 15, 2020 in those assembly / parliamentary constituencies only where elections are to be held subject to the following conditions”. As per the conditions, for holding political gatherings in closed spaces, a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed with a ceiling of 200 persons and the wearing of face masks, social distancing, provision for thermal scanning, and use of hand wash or sanitizers will be mandatory. In open spaces, the political gatherings will have to keep in mind the size of the ground or space with strict observance of social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitizers. “State or Union Territory governments will issue detailed SOPs (standard operating procedures) to regulate such political gatherings and strict enforce the same,” the home secretary’s order said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-relaxes-covid-curbs-in-poll-states/story-GSzuf07pfV0zXNHegw0QPN.html

Though extradition proceedings against the liquor baron concluded in May after the UK high court rejected Mallya’s plea to approach Britain’s Supreme Court against the move to send him back to India, the “secret” proceedings have delayed his departure. “We have been informed that there is a secret legal matter that is yet to be resolved, and that without its resolution, he cannot be extradited,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. “We are not a party to this matter and we continue to be in touch with the UK government,” he said, without giving details. On Monday, the union government told the Supreme Court that Mallya’s extradition had been stalled by the “secret” proceedings in the UK. “He has exhausted all avenues for appeal and after that, we are in constant touch with the UK government so that he is extradited to India as soon as possible,” Srivastava said. Mallya flew to the UK in March 2016 as a consortium of Indian banks, which claims he owes ₹9,000 crore, closed in on him to recover the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-cannot-be-extradited-till-secret-legal-matter-in-uk-gets-resolved-says-mea/story-Az73YnxMpyJ3gDsfYkt4NN.html
09-10-2020||India||Govt may allow 75% flight ops, says Hardeep Puri||As demand for air travel increases steadily, the government is considering allowing airlines to operate at up to 75% of their pre-pandemic capacity, raising it from the current 60%, but the removal of restrictions on international flights depends on a raft of factors including the discovery of a Covid-19 vaccine, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said on Thursday.A decision on raising flight capacity will be made over the next seven to 10 days, Puri said at a press conference, as the festive season that’s usually the peak period for air travel approaches.The civil aviation ministry has allowed limited domestic flight operations up to 60% of pre-Covid-19 capacity. After domestic passenger flights resumed on May 25 following a two-month gap because of the lockdown to curb the contagion, the Centre allowed Indian airlines to operate only 33% of their pre-Covid domestic flights. On June 26, the ministry increased the capacity to 45% and to 60% on September 2.Pre-pandemic, Indian airlines used to operate around 3,100 flights a day, according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data. Airlines are currently operating around 1,500 flights per day, according to data until October 8. “Our internal thinking is that we will watch it for another week or 10 days....If the figures (of passengers travelling) continue to be healthy, we would open domestic civil aviation to 75% of pre-Covid levels. There is no deadline,” Puri said. “But this can happen soon as the domestic numbers are going up...I am confident that by the first quarter next year, we will be able to surpass the pre-Covid numbers.” “With regard to the number of daily domestic air passengers, the figure on October 2 was 176,000 passengers...by the end of this month, we’ll be at 200,000. Between Diwali and the year’s end, we will reach 300,000,” Puri said.According to the ministry, around 300,000 to 350,000 passenger travelled on domestic routes before the pandemic. Puri said a complete resumption of international flights depends on the availability of a vaccine for Covid-19, and hinted that so-called travel bubble arrangements may continue until March-April.“It is difficult to say (when regular international flights will resume) as there is no country which has completely opened its borders for all. It depends on the availability of a vaccine as countries will feel more confident once a vaccine is there,” the aviation minister said.“There are basically three issues to consider before resuming regular international flights. One, resuming domestic connectivity... Second, the nature of the virus on which I can’t comment, and the third is international restrictions,” Puri said.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended since March 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-allow-75-flight-ops-says-hardeep-puri/story-An5Db00e47mQST6Nm22JWO.html
09-10-2020||India||Horse plasma can be used to treat Covid-19 patients, says ICMR study||Antibody-rich plasma obtained from horses can be used to treat patients infected with Covid-19, according to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) pre-print study, following which the apex medical research body has received regulatory approval to conduct clinical trials using the equine plasma on humans. The study was published on Research Square.In the study, 10 healthy horses between the ages of four and 10 years were injected with inactivated Sars-CoV-2 antigen subcutaneously (under the skin) at the Hyderabad-based Biologicals E Ltd, and after 21 days of immunisation, their plasma samples were tested. Sars-Cov-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19. The plasma had Covid-19-specific high-quality antibodies with virus neutralising capacity, which is ideal for preventing infection. The results are in line with other studies on equine antisera that reported the generation of a high level of antibodies in horses against the receptor binding area of the virus’s spike protein. A receptor-binding domain is a key part of a virus located on its spike domain that allows it to dock to body receptors to gain entry into cells and lead to infection. It is safe, and can be prepared in bulk at a low cost, the ICMR study shows. “With Biologicals E we have developed horse sera which may be considered. We have completed some animal studies where we have a predictive dose… we have got clearance for a clinical trial,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR. The virus strain was isolated from the throat and nasal swab specimens of a Covid-19 positive patient at the maximum containment facility of ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune. Diseases for which equine sera has previously been tried include many viral and bacterial infections such as rabies, hepatitis B, vaccinia virus, tetanus, botulism and diphtheria. “…This study suggests promising efficacy and therapeutic potential of equine hyper immune sera against Sars-CoV-2. The quality control assessments of the different batches proved to have consistent nAb (antibody) titres (volume of antibodies produced)… that can demonstrate consistent and high neutralization activity,” says the paper. “Further, in-vivo testing for efficacy of this indigenously developed, cost effective product will pave the way to clinical evaluation. Additionally, being a donor independent method, this may prove as an efficient alternative to convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19 patients,” the researchers say. Virologists agree that animal antisera are a good option. “It does have advantages over convalescent plasma as the quality of convalescent plasma is entirely donor dependent. The quality will be different from one donor to the other. Use of antibodies that have been raised in large animals is common, and has worked successfully in the past. If an animal study has shown promise against Sars-Cov-2, then it is good news,” said T Jacob John, former head of the virology department at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Animal-derived plasma can help overcome the challenge of limited availability of convalescent plasma from recovered patients, and find a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies (man-made proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system) that are laborious and expensive to generate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/horse-plasma-can-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-patients-says-icmr-study/story-wTDhCQSUjBWqx4orMhr6DO.html
09-10-2020||India||Four wanted men nabbed after shootout in Rohini||The Delhi Police Thursday arrested four men wanted for murders, attempts to murder and extortions in Delhi and Haryana following a brief shootout in Rohini. Police said all four suspects sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital for treatment.The men were identified as Sunil Gahlot, 23, Amit Raj, 26, Rohit, 23, and Ravinder Yadav, 31. Six pistols, three bulletproof jackets and three bulletproof helmets were recovered from them, police said.In the past 10 days, this is the third such encounter wherein the police and suspects have exchanged fire but ended with the arrests of the suspects. Four days ago, the special cell had arrested two alleged gangsters after a shoot-out. Both men were shot in their legs. On October 28, police had arrested another alleged criminal in Delhi after an exchange of fire.Giving details of Thursday’s arrests, deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said they had received information that members of the infamous Lawerance Bishnoi-Kala Jatheri -Sube Gujjar gang -- whose members are wanted in several cases of murder, attempts to murder, extortion and robbery in Delhi-NCR -- would be arriving in Rohini from Haryana early Thursday, allegedly to eliminate their rivals. “Acting on this information, a trap was laid in Khera village in Rohini on Thursday morning. Around 3.30am, a white car was spotted coming from Khera village. When our team signalled the driver to stop, the occupants of the car tried to speed away. As the road was blocked with a police SUV, their car hit the divider. They were asked to surrender but they instead opened fire at the police team,” Yadav said.Three bullets hits the police’s Innova that had been used to block the road. “One bullet grazed inspector Man Singh’s arm. Another hit sub-inspector Ravi Rana, but he was wearing a bulletproof jacket, which saved him. The police team returned the fire and two bullets hit Sunil in his leg, while one hit his hand. Amit was shot in his legs and so was Rohit, who carried a cash reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest. Ravinder was also injured in his leg,” Yadav said.A total of 22 rounds were fired by the suspects, while the police fired 28 rounds in retaliation. “The local area police were informed and ambulances called in to shift the injured to BSA hospital, Rohini. These men are wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, robbery, firing, etc. Four automatic pistols with 50 live cartridges and two countrymade pistols with 10 live cartridges, three each of bulletproof jackets and helmets were recovered from them. Further investigation is on,” the DCP said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-wanted-men-nabbed-after-shootout-in-rohini/story-SSsOsIWRgMneXgg3LUvctO.html

09-10-2020||India||India weighs plan to keep ‘inimical’ nations out of core industries||Indian national security planners are considering a security architecture that weeds out inimical countries from participating in core economic sectors such as power, telecommunications and roads by verifying the origin and testing the reliability of imported equipment related to such sectors, officials aware of the development said.India will also forge collaborations in the development of critical technologies such as 5G and 5G-plus telecommunication standards through government-to-government or industry-to-industry partnerships rather than opt for off-the-shelf purchases of equipment in the future.The government will participate through the entire development process “so that it has the option to go for a different partner in case of any technology denial”, said a senior government official involved in the move who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Foreign companies participating in Indian core sector will not be allowed to mask their origins and will have to go for full disclosure in case of any suspicion,” the official added.While the Narendra Modi government is tight-lipped over the matter, the “verify the origin” debate started in July after China threw all past bilateral agreements out of the window and transgressed into eastern Ladakh, resulting in a tense military standoff that is yet to be resolved. The transgression and a June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian troops dead, besides an unspecified number of Chinese casualties, triggered calls for a boycott of Chinese products. Since then, the power ministry has decided to put in place specific testing guidelines that require the country of origin of imported equipment to be disclosed and to ensure that there is no malware embedded in critical sector equipment.“The new testing guidelines for power equipment are to ensure that the country of origin does not install a malware which can be activated to engineer a power crisis in India,” said a senior power ministry official, requesting anonymity.Although national security planners and technology advisers to the Modi government are on the same page, there is a push-back from the telecommunication department and industry whose representatives believe alternative equipment will cost more, and want the government to define a threshold for disclosure of the country of origin.Even in developing the 5G and 5G-plus technologies, India is keen to find out the provenance of imported technology, with test-bed collaboration being the first step in confirming that imported telecommunication equipment is clean. While India is keen to collaborate in 5G with Japan, it has kept the option of choosing European and US telcos open in case of any opaqueness in joint ventures. In the past two decades, it has come to the notice of the government that foreign companies bidding for core sector contracts would often mask their country of origin through a third country and use state subsidies to emerge as the lowest price bidder and win the contract.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-weighs-plan-to-keep-inimical-nations-out-of-core-industries/story-YNWpwbU1k4TTrsxfuK2iGI.html
09-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||October 7 saw a new record for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19): the highest number of daily cases around the world. According to worldometers.info, the world saw 343,386 new cases on Wednesday; according to the New York Times database, the number was marginally higher, 351,107. Countries may be seeing waves – the first wave seems to be over in India, and the number of daily cases has dipped – but the number of daily cases around the world continues to rise, powered, in many cases, by second waves that are, especially in some countries, steeper than the first. The world has seen around 36 million cases of Covid-19, and the numbers do not appear to be going down. Indeed, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Centre, seven of the 10 countries with the highest number of daily cases currently are continuing to see a rise in their seven-day averages, an indication that case numbers are headed up in these.The 10 countries currently with the highest number of daily cases are: India, the US, Brazil, the UK, France, Argentina, Russia, Mexico, Spain, and Colombia. Among these, only India, Brazil, and Argentina are witnessing a fall in their seven-day averages (of daily cases). The rest are seeing a rise (including a sharp rise in some). Together, according to worldometer, these 10 countries accounted for 238,746 new cases of Covid-19 on October 7, or 70% of the world’s cases that day.RELENTLESS SPREADCountries may be seeing waves – the first wave seems to be over in India, and the number of daily cases has dipped – but the number of daily cases around the world continues to rise, powered, in many cases, by second waves that are, especially in some countries, steeper than the first. The world has seen around 36 million cases of Covid-19, and the numbers do not appear to be going down. As an aside, that level of concentration shouldn’t surprise anyone: most Covid-19 cases have come from a few countries. The three countries worst affected by the pandemic, the US, India, and Brazil, account for 54% of all global cases so far (they also account for 44% of all deaths). And the top 10 countries by cases (marginally different from the top 10 countries based on current daily cases) account for 71% of all cases seen thus far. The countries in this list are: the US, India, Brazil, Russia, Colombia, Spain, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, and South Africa. To return to the list of countries that are currently seeing the most cases, the seven whose seven-day average (of daily cases) is on the rise again account for 47% of daily cases in the top-10, and a third of all daily cases in the world on October 7. This is perhaps an indication that there will be no letting up in the increase in new cases around the world, even as countries in the northern hemisphere prepare for an onslaught of cases expected in the coming winter months.THREAT REMAINSThe continuing global march of the coronavirus disease reminds us of the severity of the threat. Election season has kicked off in India. The Union home ministry has allowed, with immediate effect, open-air political rallies in 12 poll-bound states. It’s also the festive season in India. Restaurants are open and cinemas will open soon. But India continues to see an average of 75,000 cases a day.According to worldometer, the seven-day average of daily cases on October 7 was 304,879, the highest it has ever been. There have been some dips in the trajectory of this metric over the months, but none very sharp; a fall in cases in one region has usually been more than offset by a rise in another.These numbers establish a simple truth: it isn’t over yet. As cities and states and countries open up, it’s sometimes easy to forget or ignore the looming threat in the background. The continuing global march of the coronavirus disease reminds us of the severity of this threat. Election season has kicked off in India –the assembly elections in Bihar and bypolls in several states will be held shortly. The Union home ministry on Thursday allowed, with immediate effect, open-air political rallies in 12 poll-bound states (they were previously allowed from October 15). It’s also the festive season in India with what is arguably the country’s biggest festival, Deepavali, in mid-November. Restaurants are open. Cinemas will open soon. But India continues to see an average of 75,000 cases a day (the seven-day average on October 7 was 74,623).The Jan Andolan (public campaign) launched by the government on Thursday needs to be seen in this context.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter: “Let us always remember: wear a mask; wash hands; follow social distancing; practice “Do Gaj Ki Doori” [a distance of six feet]; together, we will succeed.”I couldn’t agree more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-qsn4SNfrJGYdq2amOaeZLM.html
09-10-2020||India||Socialist icon, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan dies aged 74||Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, a socialist and anti-Emergency crusader who broke through Bihar’s deeply caste-stratified society to establish himself at the highest level of Indian politics in a career spanning five decades, died of heart failure in New Delhi on Thursday. He was 74.Paswan, one of India’s tallest Dalit leaders who nurtured relationships across political parties, held the portfolios of food, public distribution, and consumer affairs. He was an eight-time Lok Sabha member from Bihar’s Hajipur and, since 2019, was a member of the Rajya Sabha from Bihar.Paswan was admitted to Delhi’s Fortis Escorts Heart Institute with heart failure and kidney problems on September 11. He was subsequently put on ventilator and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but his condition deteriorated in the past 24 hours. He passed away at 6.05pm, read a statement from the hospital. “Papa... Now you are not in this world but I know you are always with me wherever you are. Miss you Papa,” tweeted Paswan’s son Chirag Paswan. The national flag will be flown at half mast on Friday in Delhi and capitals of all states and Union territories, and Paswan will be accorded a state funeral, the government announced.Often called a “kingmaker” in Bihar, Paswan was known to be affable and approachable. His death capped an eventful and consummate political career that saw him become a national leader, serve as a minister under six different prime ministers and earn for himself the sobriquet of “weathervane of Indian politics” for his ability to gauge the mood of the electorate. “Saddened beyond words. There’s a void in our nation that will perhaps never be filled. Ram Vilas Paswan’s demise is a personal loss,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. President Ram Nath Kovind also paid tribute. “In the demise of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the nation has lost a visionary leader. He was among the most active and longest-serving members of Parliament. He was the voice of the oppressed, and championed the cause of the marginalized,” he said. Born in pre-Independence India in Khagaria district of Bihar, Paswan was selected as a state police officer but chose a life in politics, winning his first assembly election in 1969 as a member of the Samyukta Socialist Party. In 1974, he joined the Lok Dal, of which he became general secretary. When the Emergency was imposed next year, Paswan hit the streets and was arrested. In 1977, he stormed into the Lok Sabha on a Janata Party ticket from Hajipur, setting a record at that time for the highest victory margin of 424,000 votes. He would go on to win seven more Lok Sabha elections. He first became a minister in 1989 under prime minister VP Singh. In 1998, Paswan, who was then minister of railways, quit the United Front government and was back as minister in the ministry headed by Atal Bihari Vajyapee who came to power the next year. In 2002, he quit the Vajpayee Cabinet — only to be back two years later as minister of chemicals and fertiliser when the United Progressive Alliance won the elections.Paswan’s death came at a time when his Lok Janshakti Party, now led by his son 37-year-old son Chirag, is at a crucial juncture: it ditched the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance to fight the upcoming Bihar assembly elections on its own. Since 1990, Bihar’s politics was said to revolve around the big three socialist leaders — Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar and Paswan. Along the way, Paswan fell out with the others politically but continued to enjoy warm personal relations.

The Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), is a set of curbs triggered in phases as the air quality deteriorates, which is typical of the October-November period. Farm fires in neighbouring states and cooling weather typically combine at this time of the year to blanket the region in smoke. It includes strict measures such as a ban on the entry of heavy vehicles, the odd-even road rationing restrictions, and a halt of construction work – each of which are likely to be impractical at a time when the pandemic has exacted heavy economic costs and public transport has been seen as an infection risk.“This winter, all agencies and state governments of Delhi-NCR must come together to try and not allow the need to bring in any additional emergency measures such as banning vehicles and construction. We recognise the economy is already under stress post-lockdown and therefore our combined effort must be to ensure there is no further disruption,” said Bhure Lal, the chairperson of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), the agency set up by the Supreme Court to tackle the perennial problem.  According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality in Delhi was in the “poor” zone for the second consecutive day on Thursday – typical for this time of the year. In the last four years, the air quality index (AQI) entered poor for the first time after the monsoons between September-end and first week of October.Thursday’s AQI was 208, slightly lower than Wednesday’s 215. But these are the worst numbers seen since mid-June, and the trend of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana suggest the levels may deteriorate further soon. According to observations from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) satellites, the number of farm fires in these two states in the last two months – at 2,636 -- has been the highest since 2014.The situation becomes such that cities have been likened to a “gas chamber” and experts warn that such conditions are likely to exacerbate Covid-19 infections. Lal said the agency recognises the Covid-19 risk factor link. “Hence, efforts are required on the ground to prevent pollution levels from rising,” he said. The Epca head added that a ban on entry of trucks may be unlikely this year since most such vehicles appear to have affixed radio tags that can help identify whether they have paid the Environment Concession Charge or are indeed meant to enter Delhi, instead of merely passing through. “The RFID (radio frequency identification) system is working well at 13 entry points. We plan to direct the Delhi government to deploy officials with hand-held devices at the remaining border points to check that trucks not destined for Delhi do not enter the city. Also, with both the eastern and western peripheral expressways, the truck traffic load has decreased significantly.” Stricter measures, however, have not been ruled out entirely and will depend on how bad the problem becomes, the authority decided at its Thursday meeting, according to a letter it sent to state authorities. Some measures that come into force from October 15 are meant for a more serious stage of air pollution, particularly the ban on diesel generators. Essential services such as hospitals will be exempted. Medical experts reiterated the need to curb pollution in order to mitigate Covid-19 risks. “There are several studies from across the world that show pollution certainly has an impact on Covid-19 related mortality. In Italy, there was 12% mortality in northern Italy as compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country. The study attributed it to high air pollution levels in the region. A study from Europe shows that 78% mortality was in regions with high Nitrogen Oxide levels. Another study from the US shows that every 1μg increase in PM 2.5 leads to an 8% increase in Covid-19 death rate,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Environment experts said the number of farm fires seen in Punjab and Haryana seen till now suggests the pollution peak may come sooner than usual. “With burning starting early, it may turn out that when the pollution peaks between October-end and November 15, the activity has receded and may not contribute to the peak as much. However, this is to be watched. Secondly, this year since many people are still working from home, vehicular emission will be somewhat lower than last year and pollution levels may not turn so severe as it has in the past,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi. He added that for a long-term measure, the four states -- Delhi, Haryana, UP and Punjab -- have to come together to draw up a plan to fight pollution. “Unless there is better coordination among these states, it will be difficult to bring down overall levels of pollution, as activities in all four states contribute to the pollution observed in Delhi every year,” he said. On Thursday, Epca decided that large-scale construction projects such as on highways and for the Delhi Metro in Delhi-NCR will need to give an undertaking to the respective state pollution control boards that they will comply with dust-control norms. Similarly, industries in the red and orange categories (classified as those with higher emissions) will be required to give an undertaking to the pollution boards that they will only use approved fuels. The Grap’s winter rules, which first were drawn up in 2017, will stay in force till March 31.

09-10-2020||India||Payal Tadvi suicide case: SC allows accused to resume studies||The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed three women doctors from Mumbai accused of abetting the suicide of a junior colleague last year to resume their postgraduate medical course in gynaecology and obstetrics, relaxing a restriction imposed on them by the Bombay high court.A three-judge bench headed by justice UU Lalit ruled that the three, Dr. Ankita Kailash Khandelwal, Dr. Hema Suresh Ahuja and Dr. Bhakti Arvind Mehare, can go back to their studies provided they appear in court whenever the case is posted for a hearing and don’t attempt to influence witnesses.The three were accused of abetting the suicide of Dr. Payal Tadvi, who was also a student of the postgraduate degree course in gynaecology and obstetrics at the same college and their junior, who killed herself by hanging in May 2019.The Bombay high court, while granting bail to the doctors, had stipulated that they should not enter the Topiwala National Medical College (BYL Nair Charitable Hospital), where they were pursuing their postgraduate studies.“In our view, the appellants (accused) must be allowed to go back to their courses of study; otherwise the pendency of prosecution against them will add further penalty in the form of prejudicing their career. In our considered view, ends of justice would be met if condition no. 4 as laid down by the high court is relaxed and the appellants are permitted to go back to the college to pursue their studies,” the Supreme Court bench, which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and Ajay Rastogi, held.After Dr. Tadvi’s suicide, her mother lodged a complaint that she had been harassed by the three senior postgraduate students on grounds of caste -- Dr.Tadvi belonged to the Tadvi Bhil Muslim community, which is a scheduled tribe and that they were directly responsible for the suicide of her daughter. The accused were then charged with abetment to suicide under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code and also for offences under provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 and the Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act of 1999. They were arrested on May 29, 2019.Their bail plea was rejected by the sessions court on June 24, 2019, but was allowed by the Bombay high court on August 7, 2019. The high court , however, ordered that the three shall not enter the college and the licences issued to them by the Medical Council of India as well as Maharashtra Medical Council would remained suspended until the conclusion of the trial in the case.The top court, while relaxing the stipulation, said the stay of the three accused on campus should be minimized as much as possible.“The appellants shall avail study leave so that their actual period of stay inside the college and the hospital gets reduced...If there be any holiday or vacation and it is permissible for the residents to be outside the college and hospital, the appellants shall avail that and keep themselves away from the hospital and the college,” the court said.If any untoward incident takes place, the authorities should immediately report to the police station of the area and ensure that the life and liberty of everyone, including the accused, are protected, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/payal-tadvi-suicide-case-sc-allows-accused-to-resume-studies/story-OfreQ8YKQlg6MoLt88ohdL.html

09-10-2020||India||Two same-sex couples move Delhi HC for recognition of marriages||Two same-sex couples have moved the Delhi high court seeking legal recognition for their marriages, arguing that the lack of formal acceptance of their union under Indian laws was a violation of their constitutional rights.The petitions were heard on Thursday by justice Navin Chawla, who directed that they be listed before the chief justice of the high court, who is already hearing a petition seeking recognition of same sex unions under the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act. The next hearing is scheduled on October 14. A petition seeking the recognition of gay marriage under the Special Marriage Act pending before the high court. The two petitioners were represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar. Guruswamy and Katju were among the lawyers who successfully convinced the Supreme Court to read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality, in 2018. The first petition was filed by two mental health professionals -- Kavita Arora, 47 and Ankita Khanna, 36 -- who said they had been living together as a couple for eight years, were in love with each other and sharing the highs and lows of life, but unable to marry as both were women.“They share the highs, the lows, the joys and sorrows of life; they go through the wear and tear of living together; they have the deep, unbreakable bond of two people who have come together in love. The petitioners are like any other couple you might meet, except they are both women,” their petition read.The second petition was filed by two men – Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an overseas citizen of India, who got married in the United States in 2017. An Indian consulate refused to register their union this year under the 1969 Foreign Marriage Act. The couple, who were in a relationship since 2012 and were supported by their families and friends, also claimed during the Covid-19 pandemic, non-recognition of their marriage prevented them from travelling as a married couple to India. “The petitioners submit that non-recognition of same-sex marriages is a wanton act of discrimination that strikes at the root of dignity and self-fulfillment of LGBTQ {lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) couples,” the petition read. The two women said that things like opening a joint bank account, buying family health insurance, or securing address proof – things that a married couple takes for granted – were a struggle for them. On September 30, they approached the marriage officer (the sub-divisional magistrate, South East Delhi, Kalkaji) seeking solemnization of their marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. “The marriage officer would have solemnized the marriage of any similarly placed opposite-sex couple. Sexual orientation discrimination is constitutionally prohibited under Article 15, but the petitioners were refused the right to marry a person of their choice on grounds of their sexual orientation alone,” they said.The petitions argued that the non-recognition of marriage between LGBTQ persons violated the fundamental rights of liberty, equality, life and freedom of expression guaranteed to them by the Supreme Court judgment, Navtej Johar vs Union of India, which decriminalised adult, consensual same-sex relations in 2018.The Delhi high court is already hearing a petition filed by defence analyst Abhijit Iyer Mitra and three others. In response to that petition, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said last month that Indian values didn’t recognise same-sex unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-same-sex-couples-move-delhi-hc-for-recognition-of-marriages/story-gzVejfNsnhCDFRyU7F8huK.html
09-10-2020||India||Oppn states seek GST dues redress system||States ruled by parties that are not part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are demanding that a dispute resolution system be set up to tackle differences over the Goods and Services Tax (GST), saying they don’t expect an October 12 meeting of the GST Council to settle an imbroglio over compensating states for an expected Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in revenue this fiscal year, three people aware of the matter said.The 10 states have refused to accept either of two options suggested by the Centre to make up the shortfall -- borrow Rs.1.1 lakh crore (the portion of the deficit resulting from GST implementation issues) without paying either the principal or interest, or borrow the entire Rs.2.35 lakh crore (including the shortfall caused by the Covid-19 pandemic) at a significant cost. These states want the Centre to borrow the money, reimburse the states in full and retire the debt from the amount raised as cess on luxury and sin goods luxury and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco products. The imbroglio has underscored an urgent need to put a GST dispute resolution system in place because the GST Council, which is headed by the Union finance minister and comprises her state counterparts, is unable to forge a consensus, the three people cited above said. It has happened once, on October 5, and the October 12 meeting is headed the same way, said two finance ministers of states opposed to the options, requesting anonymity.On October 5, the GST Council put off until October 12 a decision on compensating states for the shortfall in their share of GST revenue as the 10 states balked at the suggestion that they borrow from the market to make up a part of the shortfall.“A vote was almost certain on Monday [October 5] on this matter when the chairman deferred the matter to October 12 for more discussion. However, there is no material change in the respective positions as of now. Hence, the 10 states will demand a vote on this matter on Monday [October 12],” one of the ministers cited above said.When the new indirect tax regime came into force on July 1, 2017, subsuming a raft of central and state levies, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and said their revenue shortfall should be made good using the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products. The GST Council has extended the cess beyond 2022.“It is unfortunate that the Central government is departing from the convention of consensus-based decisions in the GST Council. The new tax regime, a unique example of cooperative federalism, was launched on the premise that its decisions will be unanimous. Its first chairman, former finance minister Arun Jaitley, did live up to that. But now, the spirit of cooperative federalism is fast waning,” the first minister cited above said. The GST Council, for the first time since its inception on July 1, 2017 resorted to a division of votes on the issue of a tax on lotteries at its 38th meeting on December 18, 2019. Twenty-one members voted in favour of imposing a uniform 28% rate on both state-run and state-authorised lotteries, seven ministers opposed the proposal and three abstained.Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said the states were, in effect, being threatened by the Centre that choosing neither of the options proposed by it would mean no compensation.“In the circumstances, if the avowed principle of consensus is not being upheld, the legal provisions for a dispute resolution mechanism within the Council should be activated without delay,” Isaac said. He also demanded the appointment of a vice-chairperson for the Council.An email query sent to the Union finance ministry did to elicit any response on the formation of a dispute resolution mechanism and the appointment of a vice-chairman.A Union government official said a proposal to form a dispute resolution mechanism had already been rejected. “A proposal to create a dispute settlement authority consisting of retired judges was mooted in 2011, even before the implementation of the GST regime, but it was rejected by the then Parliamentary standing committee,” he said, requesting anonymity.“Later, the then GST Empowered Committee headed by Sushil Modi also rejected the proposal, arguing that any such authority would undermine the sovereignty of the GST Council, which essentially consists of the Centre and states and whose recommendations are binding on state legislatures and Parliament,” he added. According to officials, the GST Council has committees such as the fitment committee, which determines the procedures to determine rates levied on various supplies, and the law committee to resolve disputes among members. The Council can also form groups of ministers (GoMs) and committees of officers to resolve any issue.“The present situation demands urgent action and cannot be expected through a dispute resolution mechanism even if it’s established at the earliest. However, given the rise in dissent from state governments, initiating constitution of a dispute resolution body should be done for speedy resolution in future and to avoid adding to litigation before the Supreme Court,” said Ayush Mehrotra, a partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The law does empower the GST Council to establish a system to resolve disputes between the Centre and one or more states, said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY India.“While one of the mechanisms could be setting up of an independent judicial body, various other avenues could as well be explored. Nonetheless, a formalised dispute resolution mechanism reflects lack of unanimity,” he added, noting that the ability to reach a consensus “has been quite an applaudable feature of the GST Council” so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-states-seek-gst-dues-redress-system/story-6Le4h7aQUpFla2oq9HScTM.html
09-10-2020||India||Supreme Court pulls up Centre for ‘evasive’, ‘nonsensical’ Tablighi affidavit||An affidavit filed by the Centre in response to a petition seeking action against television channels for allegedly disseminating fake news about the Tablighi Jamaat , and communalising a congregation organised by the Islamic missionary group, is “evasive” and contains “nonsensical” arguments, the Supreme Court observed on Thursday.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde took exception to the fact that the Centre’s affidavit had been filed by a junior officer from the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) and also did not address any specific instances raised by the petitioners.“You cannot treat this court in this way. The affidavit is filed by a junior officer. It is also extremely evasive and says the petitioner has not cited any instance of bad reporting. To say that you don’t agree with the petitioner is one thing, but how can you say no incident is pointed out,” CJI Bobde told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the central government.Mehta replied that he would see to it that a fresh affidavit is filed addressing the concerns raised by the court and also admitted that the affidavit should have come from a senior government functionary.The affidavit was filed by an undersecretary at the MIB in August, opposing the petition on grounds that any action against media houses could amount to a “blanket gag order” against the entire media in respect of reporting on the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, and be violative of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution that protects free speech.In March, the Tablighi Jamaat organised a religious congregation at its Markaz headquaters in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti whose participants violated curbs put in place, including a ban on large gatherings, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease. In March and April, around 900 foreigners were arrested in the city for allegedly violating the conditions under which they had been allowed to visit India. Petitions before the top court were filed in April by the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, Peace Party, DJ Halli Federation of Masjid Madaaris and Wakf Institute and an individual, Abdul Kuddus Laskar, alleging that the media was reporting the Markaz incident in a skewed manner and demonising the Muslim community.The centre’s affidavit said: “Such an order (to gag the media) would inevitably also impinge upon freedom of the citizen to know about the affairs of the society and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society.”Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who was representing the petitioners, submitted that the government has claimed the issue involved muzzling of free speech.“Freedom of speech is one of the most abused freedoms of recent times,” CJI Bobde remarked.About the incident in question, the Centre said: “Insofar as the Markaz issue is concerned, Union of India has neither come across nor has been intimated with any specific media report which has violated the provisions of Cable Television Network Rules 1994, Guidelines for Up-linking from India, and the Programme Code prescribed under Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995.” The court asked Mehta to ensure that the fresh affidavit is filed by concerned department’s secretary level officer.“The secretary must tell us what he thinks of the specific incidents (cited by the petitioner). He may agree and or disagree with what has been stated (by the petitioner) but must not make unnecessary, nonsensical averments like what has been done now,” CJI Bobde said and posted the case for further hearing after two weeks.The court also asked the Centre to clarify which provision of the law could be specifically employed by the government to impose a bar on the broadcast of television channels.The Nizamuddin area in Delhi was sealed on March 30 after it came to light that several people, who had attended the congregation, were found to be infected with the coronavirus disease. At least 16,500 people had visited the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters between March 13 and 24.The petitioners submitted that the reportage of the incident by certain sections of the media were in violation of journalistic norms and the provisions of the Cable TV Networks Regulation Act and the Programme Code under that Act which prohibits the airing of programmes attacking a religion or community and promoting communalism.The centre’s affidavit said that the petition had not cited any specific instance of objectionable news reportage published by any particular media house.It said the petition was based on opinions expressed in certain “fact check portals” and cannot be entertained given the doubts surrounding the veracity of reports published by such websites and the opinions canvassed by them.“These online fact check portals are unregulated websites and are mostly based on perception, conjecture, surmises and supposition of the individual writing them,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-centre-for-evasive-nonsensical-tablighi-affidavit/story-QOy2GtGgUGPcd0JL2V0SHO.html

Over the next five decades, Ram Vilas Paswan shifted parties and coalitions, built new partnerships, won new friends and some rivals as well.Paswan, described by his admirers as a firebrand socialist, branched out of the Janata Dal in 2000 to form the Lok Janshakti Party. Lalu Prasad Yadav had walked out three years earlier to form the Rashtriya Janata Dal. They had worked together for a long time before turning into political rivals after the split of the Janata Dal.“Ram Vilas bhai, you went too soon,” Lalu Yadav, who is also in hospital, said in a tweet that recalled their association going back to 45 years. It was Lalu Yadav, who had famously described Paswan’s uncanny ability to predict the poll outcome long before elections and set his sails accordingly as the “mausam vigyanik”, or a weather scientist. रामबिलास भाई के असामयिक निधन का दुःखद समाचार सुन अति मर्माहत हूँ। विगत 45 वर्षों का अटूट रिश्ता और उनके संग लड़ी तमाम सामाजिक, राजनीतिक लड़ाइयाँ आँखों में तैर रही है।रामबिलास भाई, आप जल्दी चले गए। इससे ज़्यादा कुछ कहने की स्थिति में नहीं हूँ।ॐ शांति ॐPaswan spoke of his ability with pride, underlining that he knew the pulse of the people. “I was one of the first who publicly claimed that there will be a Modi tsunami this time, not just a wave, and that is what happened exactly,” Paswan told reporters. He had predicted 40 seats for the NDA in Bihar in 2019; the alliance won 39.For the three-phase Bihar elections that start later this month, Ram Vilas Paswan had left it to his son Chirag to decide how to navigate the alliances. Chirag pulled out of the alliance in Bihar but stayed in the NDA at the Centre. Janata Dal United’s Nitish Kumar is their prime target. It was a balance that the senior Paswan had struck back in 2005 when he stayed put in the Congress-led UPA at the Centre but contested against Lalu Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Party in Bihar elections. 1969 मे मेरा DSP मे और MLA दोनो मे एक साथ चयन हुआ।तब मेरे एक मित्र नेपूछा कि बताओ Govt बनना है या Servant ?बस तभी मैंने राजनीति ज्वाइन कर लीBut Paswan, one of the most prominent Dalit faces in Bihar, almost didn’t join politics. As he tweeted a few years ago, back in 1969 he was in a fix when he won his first assembly election and cleared the examination to become a deputy superintendent of police in Bihar. Paswan consulted a friend who asked him: “Do you want to be the government or the servant?”. “I joined politics soon after,” Paswan tweeted in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-he-gets-better-son-chirag-tweeted-hours-before-ram-vilas-paswan-s-death/story-aCE1P2WvVQ45r105WZb4QN.html

Searches were being conducted in 11 locations, including at Hyderabad, Mumbai and West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh and the office and residential premises of the borrower in Secunderabad, in Ranga Reddy district and other areas, the CBI said in a statement. Raju, a parliamentarian from Narasapuram in West Godavari district, is the chairman of Ind-Barath Thermal Power Limited, and is facing allegations of causing an alleged loss of Rs 826.17 crore to a consortium of banks led by Punjab National Bank.“It was alleged in the complaint that the accused had cheated the Punjab National Bank led consortium banks by way of diversion/siphoning off bank funds etc. We have booked a case and investigation is continuing,” the CBI statement said. The CBI searches on the offices and residential premises of Raju came in the wake of his revolt against the YSRC led by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last few months. In July, the YSRC petitioned Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla seeking Raju’s disqualification from his membership for defying the party discipline, after he challenged the show-cause notice served on him. Since then, he has been attacking the YSRC leadership almost every day. In April 2019, too, the CBI conducted searches in the residences and offices of Raju for alleged loan default of over Rs 947 crore. The CBI charged Raju’s company with taking loans worth over Rs 2,655 crore from three non-banking financial companies -- Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd. The loans were taken for establishment of a 666 MW coal-based thermal power project in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. It was alleged that the company defaulted in payments of Rs 947 crore which turned into non-performing assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-searches-rebel-ysrc-mp-raghurama-raju-s-offices-residences-in-alleged-rs-826-cr-bank-fraud/story-Yem1uzUmDNFqQr0HCp8KwJ.html

In November last, after helming the Lok Janshakti Party for 19 years, Paswan stepped down from his post to make way for the appointment of his son and MP Chirag Paswan as the new party president.He was elected to Lok Sabha eight times and also held the record of winning his constituency, Hajipur, with the highest margin for several years.He was a minister in central governments headed by parties of contrasting ideological persuasions, ranging from the Janata Dal to the Congress and the BJP, since 1989.As the news of the leader’s death percolated, tributes poured in for him. “In the demise of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the nation has lost a visionary leader. He was among the most active and longest-serving members of parliament. He was the voice of the oppressed, and championed the cause of the marginalized,” tweeted President Ram Nath Kovind.“A firebrand socialist in youth, mentored by the likes of Jayaprakash Narayan during anti-Emergency movement, Paswan ji had enviable rapport with masses and he ardently strove for their welfare.

But when I told them I want to try acting they were surprised and reluctant. But, after much persuasion I was allowed to complete my graduation in Mumbai with specialization in advertising,” she said. Talking about her acting debut UP girl Nidhi, who is also a trained dancer, said, “I tried my hand at ads and sketches before getting my first digital series, ‘Permanent Roommates.’ It was an instant hit and then I got plenty of projects including ‘Every Delhi Girl in the World,’ ‘Man’s World,’ ‘Apharan’ along with films like ‘Long Live Brig Mohan,’ ‘Dil Junglee’ and more. And when bigger OTT platforms started to come in, the content got upgraded and work doubled up for all digital actors.” Currently, Nidhi is seen essaying a role of a cop in her recently released digital film ‘Bahut Hua Samman’. “BHS...that is being streamed on Hotstar, was a fun project and playing a no-nonsense cop made it super fun for me to portray. Then shooting in Varanasi was a double fun as I was working near my hometown and was all glad being there. I’m also thrilled with the response my new web series is garnering.”For the road ahead, Nidhi wants to continue doing good projects with strong female characters she is known to play. “Offers are there but due to ongoing Covid-19 crisis things have slowed down thankfully my projects were all streamed on time and script reading for fresh ones is underway,” she shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/nidhi-wants-to-do-projects-with-strong-female-characters/story-4vwT8skvo3pNkWzANnf03O.html
09-10-2020||Editorials||The significance of the Pence-Harris debate||The duel of words between Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican counterpart, Vice President Mike Pence in their debate was noteworthy because of its ordinariness. It also gave an opportunity to discern the genuine ideological and policy spaces between the two parties — something only dimly discernable amid the rancour of the presidential debate. Ms Harris and Mr Pence differed on climate, policing, racism and health care. The only foreign policy issue was who was tougher on China. Both signalled, through evasion, that their parties were ready for hardball politics. Mr Pence refused to say his party would not challenge the election results while Ms Harris declined to say a Democratic administration would not pack the Supreme Court with judges. But the core of the debate was the Covid-19 pandemic and it was here Ms Harris drew blood, helped by the continuing spread of the pandemic and a viral outbreak in the White House that has included President Donald Trump.For Ms Harris, the debate represents the pinnacle of the Indian-American’s role in the campaign. The pandemic and the recognition that her running mate Joe Biden is what matters in an election where middle-of-the-road whites are the swing vote have kept Ms Harris in the shadows. She assists Mr Biden by representing the spirit of America’s future: A successful female politician, representative of two ethnic minorities and strongly connected to Silicon Valley. The vice-presidential candidates do not matter to voters even though they have a better than average chance of inheriting the Oval Office given the age of the two contestants. The US election remains centred around Mr Trump and that, more than anything else, is why Mr Biden continues to pull ahead in the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-significance-of-the-pence-harris-debate/story-Cek9yncELQngzuR2fv1EkM.html
