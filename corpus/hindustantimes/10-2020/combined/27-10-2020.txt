27-10-2020||News||Genes may decide the coronavirus disease path | Opinion||The world has already experienced three coronavirus attacks in the 21st century, beginning with Sars in 2002, Mers in 2016 and now Covid-19. While the first two have been far less infectious but more lethal with fatality rates of 10% and 34% respectively, the Sars-CoV-2 has proved more infectious, but much less lethal with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3%. As per the World Health Organization organogram, there is a considerable disparity both in infection numbers and death rates among nations with the highest fatality rates recorded in Europe and the Americas, and the least in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. India has done exceptionally well by keeping CFR at 1.54%. What is even more remarkable is the observed heterogeneity in disease presentation with most infected people remaining asymptomatic or presenting with mild symptoms. Among those who require hospitalisation, only a small percentage develop critical symptoms and lose the battle. According to the ministry of health statistics, age and underlying co-morbidities account for much of this disparity. But could a person’s DNA profile determine the course of Covid-19? To define the possible role of genetics, experts employ the highly sophisticated techniques of molecular biology to scan the DNA of a set of patients and an equal number of healthy controls (usually upwards of 1,000 each), and look for any informative markers from among millions of DNA sequences and ascertain if any of these confer susceptibility and/or protection from the disease. The first such study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June identified two genes linked to respiratory failure in a sample of 1,980 Covid-19 patients with severe disease from Italy and Spain. Of these, one gene located on chromosome 9 coinciding with the ABO blood groups identified higher risk of disease among persons with blood group A and a protective effect for those with blood group O. Similar results were obtained by the Danish health registry indicating least vulnerability of blood group O to Covid-19, as well as a Vancouver study reporting that A and AB blood group types were at a comparatively higher risk of severe symptoms. However, it would be premature to draw any definitive conclusions from these results unless extensive studies are carried out in other populations and the underlying mechanisms get clarified. The Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative, an international study group of eminent geneticists, has released a new dataset to suggest that a region on chromosome 3 shows significant association with severe Covid-19 with an odds ratio for requiring hospitalisation to be 1.6. The gene encodes for a protein that seemingly influences interaction between two important cells of the immune system, namely the dendritic cells and T-cells, and thus may directly control the clinical course of the disease. This has been confirmed in a genome-wide association study led by Kenneth Baillie of the University of Edinburgh on over 2,000 critically ill Covid-19 patients suggesting at least half a dozen additional gene variants. These results, if proven by others through appropriately-designed clinical trials, could guide treatment schedules. Of the additional genes linked to severe Covid-19 in the Edinburgh study is the IFNAR2 that codes for interferon, which acts as a powerful messenger that influences the development of innate and the adaptive immune responses against viral infections. The increased expression of this gene could reduce the odds of severe Covid-19. This raises hopes of better outcomes for ongoing trials of interferons as a plausible Covid-19 treatment. The other five genes act in pairs and influence two biological mechanisms: One set determines innate immunity-driven antiviral defences early in the disease and the other, inflammatory lung injury that occurs later in the disease course and is life-threatening. Again, these claims must be tested in large-scale clinical trials. In the most comprehensive trans-ancestry sequencing study of Covid-19 involving over half a million individuals, researchers at the Regeneron Genetics Center in New York have focused on three main components namely, susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 infection, disease severity as determined by hospitalisation and the third of patients who required ventilation or had passed away. This attempt confirms the involvement of chromosome 3 gene but not the ABO blood groups suggesting that it may be a false positive. Further, they identified three additional novel genes expressed on, one, chromosome 1 and found mostly in individuals of African ancestry, two, chromosome 16 and, three, chromosome 22, the last of which also influences the IFNAR2 gene. Elucidating host genetics of Covid-19 holds the potential for understanding both susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 infection as well as heterogeneity in clinical presentation and severity in disease outcome. Genetics could help to explain why most people infected by the virus never feel sick, while others develop serious symptoms and lose their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/genes-may-decide-the-coronavirus-disease-path-opinion/story-ATkcglBreJMXgKvQbDES6O.html
27-10-2020||News||The RJD shifts from an antagonistic discourse to ‘Sarvjan’ politics||The Bihar assembly elections mark a definitive, historical shift in the politics of the state. This can be seen in the slogans and narratives of the campaigns. The Janata Dal (United)’s hoardings read “Nitish sabke hain” (Nitish represents everyone). His main opponent, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s Tejashwi Yadav has promised to give one million government jobs to people on his first day as chief minister (CM). Appealing across caste-class lines is nothing new for Kumar but the Yadav scion’s promise is a tacit acceptance that the old vocabulary of the Mandal politics of caste will not yield positive results. Hence, it has been replaced with an appeal to mobilise the poor with a promise of stable government jobs. This marks the entrance of sarvjan (all people) politics in Bihar.This change was seen in the ideological somersaults of the RJD on the issue of reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS). When the Narendra Modi government introduced EWS reservation, the RJD was the only Mandalite party to oppose the bill.However, soon after, senior RJD leader, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who passed away recently, declared that the party regretted its decision to oppose the bill in Parliament. By the time the bill was introduced in the Bihar assembly, Tejashwi Yadav said he was not against EWS reservation in principle. This non-antagonistic political vocabulary is not confined to Bihar alone. In Uttar Pradesh (UP), this change was visible in the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)’s strategy to openly court the Brahmin vote in the 2007 elections.Such strategies have been described as part of the “coalition of extremes” in the past. However, this is a mischaracterisation of the socio-political map, for it is premised on the misleading Brahmin-vs-non-Brahmin dichotomy born out of an excessive focus on the rhetoric of the Mandal-based parties and the BSP in Bihar and UP as well as the Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu earlier.This strategy was tempered by electoral arithmetic in other Hindi heartland states such as Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh which did not have a single numerically preponderant non-Brahmin caste to act as a pivot for electoral mobilisation. Here, the Other Backward Class (OBC) and Dalit leaders have always employed the strategy of using non-antagonistic vocabulary to ensure silent mobilisation of their own caste while enabling building multi-caste alliances to obtain a majority. Nitish Kumar and the Lok Janshakti Party’s late Ram Vilas Paswan employed this method of mobilisation as their own castes did not have the numerical strength to emulate the RJD or the BSP.In Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh, OBC leaders such as Ashok Gehlot, Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Bhupesh Baghel respectively have championed this model of politics for a long time. It is based on ensuring upward mobility through modernisation and cultural inclusion within the Hindu social order rather than employing antagonistic rhetoric and rejecting Hindu cultural norms like the early Ambedkarite movement did. However, this model of politics has been ignored by the media and academia.This election is unique for the complete absence of the old rhetoric and dichotomies of secularism versus communalism or forward-versus-backward castes. On the contrary, it is employing a universalistic language, claims of representation in employment, development, corruption and good governance. This has been brought about by a rapid shift towards a market-based economy, which makes the promise of reservation less appealing; fragmentation within OBCs; and a modicum of upward mobility and socio-political confidence among a section of the oppressed castes, which makes their mass mobilisation difficult.There had always been a disconnect between the RJD’s rhetoric and its arithmetic. But now, it has astutely accommodated the upper castes through disproportionate representation via its alliance partner, the Congress. This is nothing new. What has been called the coalition of extremes in the UP/Bihar has long been the model for silent mobilisation in the Hindi heartland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-rjd-shifts-from-an-antagonistic-discourse-to-sarvjan-politics/story-4dFHFM20VBQKSDKRCSqo7H.html

NCB on Tuesday conducted a search and found drugs in small quantities at Prakash’s Versova home, but she was not present in the house, said NCB officials. Prakash was then summoned by NCB for questioning on Wednesday. NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed the development. NCB questioned Prakash on September 25 and 26 for approximately 12 hours as part of its probe into Rajput’s death. The agency also questioned Padukone and actors Rakul Preet Singh, Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor. So far, 24 accused have been arrested in Rajput’s case, including Rajput’s domestic help and alleged drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdul Basit Parihar. Arrested accused actor Rhea Chakraborty was granted bail on October 7, while her brother Showik is among the arrested accused still in jail. Meanwhile, in a separate case, NCB arrested Joshua Crasto, 39, on Monday and recovered 50 grams of local marijuana, 25 grams curated marijuana, 2.8 grams charas and 2.2 grams of cocaine from him. Crasto has revealed to NCB that he procured curated marijuana from abroad and hashish from local contacts in Worli and nearby areas. Wankhede said Crasto has revealed he both consumed and supplied contraband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-summons-deepika-padukone-s-manager-in-drugs-case-after-search-at-her-mumbai-home/story-7iKj1iW6gRexclnCt8pXrL.html
27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Denial of senate polls plan to demolish democratic governance of PU: Senators||Fifteen Panjab University senators have said that the denial of senate elections is nothing but a calculated plan to demolish the democratic governance of the University.The senators from Punjab, including HS Dua, Jarnail Singh, KK Sharma and Iqbal Singh Sandhu, on Tuesday sought an immediate intervention of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in the matter (conduct of senate polls at PU). “Any covert game plan to install a Board of Governors (under National Education Policy 2020) consisting of all nominated members would lead to complete alienation of stakeholders from the decision-making processes of the university. Punjab government has yet to adopt NEP and as a stakeholder, if the consent of Punjab government is not taken, it would cause unrest in the region,” reads the letter. “It is a murderous attack on the federal nature of Panjab University’s administrative structure, since the process of election to PU senate was scuttled midway after the nominations had been finalised and polling was to take place,” they said.Senate polls of PU, which were earlier scheduled for August 24, were postponed by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar for the second time on October 15 due to Covid-19 pandemic. The letter to CM stated that “the repeated postponement of PU senate polls under the pretext of Covid-19 pandemic has serious implications for the landscape of education in the region and in the state of Punjab”.The term of the present PU senate will end on October 31 and the senators have appealed to the Punjab CM to immediately intervene in the matter and ensure that elections to PU senate are conducted immediately.PUTA writes to UT administratorMeanwhile, Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) has also written to Chandigarh administrator and Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore and sought his intervention to ensure immediate conduct of senate polls of PU. The teachers’ body in its letter stated that apprehensions have grown stronger with each passing day that the “age old governing structure is in danger”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/denial-of-senate-polls-plan-to-demolish-democratic-governance-of-pu-senators/story-9bCfGvD6Ru7YJlZy66Qq1N.html
27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Second Covid surge anticipated, won’t lower guard: Chandigarh health department||Suggesting that a second wave of Covid-19 was anticipated during the festive season, and considering high pollution levels and approaching winters, the UT health department has said that lowering the guard at this point can prove detrimental.The department has said that early identification of cases was key in preventing the second surge for which the testing was being made more accessible in dispensaries, for patients visiting the hospital OPDs and in religious places as well.UT director of health services and family welfare, Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, said that the infection rate in the coming days will depend on a number of factors for which the department is making up the arrangements.“The testing has to be more accessible at common points within the city. The mobile teams are visiting every nook and corner of the city and encouraging people to get tested. So the identification part is being catered to,” Dr Kang said.She added on Tuesday more than 100 samples were collected in the temple in Sector 20 and all of them were tested negative. Similarly, around 205 patients who visited the Government Multi-Speciality Hospital Sector 16 for consultation with doctors were encouraged to undergo Covid-19 tests and 3 of them were found to be infected.The department said that a fresh campaign for Covid appropriate behaviour during festivals was being launched. “1.5 lakh pamphlets will be distributed in houses which will be visited by the health staff during the upcoming polio drive. How people respond to the communication will show how the trajectory of cases is. Many other parts of the country have seen cases surging again and the best way to prevent it here is to follow the guidelines,” Dr Kang said.Last month saw a major surge in infections, with the record being set on September 13 (449 cases); the highest number of active cases was reported on September 16 (3,171).Though the number of cases started declining in the last four weeks, September alone accounted for 61% (7,266) of the cases reported between March 18 (first case) and September 30. Also, in comparison to the 41 deaths in August, Chandigarh witnessed 106 deaths in September.To prevent fatalities, the department has ordered that the asymptomatic elderly and patients with comorbidities should be counselled for admission in hospitals instead of home isolation.“The zonal heads under the health department have been directed to ensure that the patients are counselled and this category of patients are admitted to hospital and remain under constant medical examination. Similarly, those who choose to remain in home isolation, oximeters are provided to them and they check the vitals three times and communicate to the concerned in-charge,” Dr Kang added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/second-covid-surge-anticipated-won-t-lower-guard-chandigarh-health-department/story-n6pEOIak6aqfET6S94qVeM.html

Thirty-three of these cases were reported from Mohali city. Civil surgeon Dr GB Singh said, “Cases have been reported from various parts of the district. In the past one week, 56 patients have been tested positive for dengue. Health teams were already put on alert and have been conducting door-to-door checks to identify potential dengue larvae spots.” The Mohali health department had in September issued a warning that coronavirus and dengue co-infection may prove risky after detecting mosquito larvae at several places. While issuing an advisory, the civil surgeon had said that at this hour of Covid-19 pandemic, when we all are engaged in a battle against the deadly virus, it is equally important and essential to save ourselves from the dangerous bite of mosquito named aedes aegypti. The civil surgeon said that people should clean coolers, flowerpots, fridge trays, water tanks and other containers which are general breeding sites of mosquitoes. He reminded that every Friday should be observed as ‘Dry Day’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dengue-tightens-grip-on-mohali-56-cases-emerge-in-1-week/story-bkHn6YpFMRjhPbI7w5sEoJ.html
27-10-2020||City||Hope revives for realty as GMADA finds buyers for 50% of its sites in Mohali||After enduring a torrid time for more than a year, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) finally saw half of its properties (both commercial and residential) getting buyers in its 15-day e-auction that concluded on Monday evening. The development authority sold 57 of its 113 sites and earned ₹417 crore against the total reserve price of ₹800 crore. A residential plot of 500 square yards in Aerocity went for ₹1.93 crore against the reserve price of ₹1.4 crore, while a booth in Sector 61 went for ₹1.15 crore against the reserve price of ₹77 lakh. GMADA after a gap of almost eight months auctioned 113 residential and commercial properties after slashing the reserve price by 10%. To attract more bidders, additional 10% off will be offered on full payment within 60 days. The last auction for these properties was held in February this year after a 20% cut in reserve prices, when 32 of the 67 units were sold. Out of total 22 residential plots, GMADA auctioned 14 sites, while out of 32 booths, 28 were sold out. A hospital site in Aerocity went for ₹49 crore against the reserve price of ₹24 crore. A group housing society in Sector 77 went for ₹97 crore against the reserve price of ₹45 crore. Similarly, a commercial site in Aerocity measuring four acres went for ₹116 crore against the reserve price of ₹83 crore. GMADA also sold a one-acre IT site in Sector 83 for ₹8.5 crore against the reserve price of 6.37 crore. However, there were no takers for a school site in Eco City and four hotel sites in various parts of Mohali.GMADA chief administrator Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said, “We are satisfied with the auction result and it shows that the realty sector has picked up. We were able to earn ₹417 crore against reserve price of ₹800 crore. We are hopeful that in the next auction, we will be able to sell all our sites.”Among the properties auctioned were 22 residential plots ranging from 100 square yards to 500 square yards and others located in Eco City 1 and Sectors 64, 61 and 56. The commercial units included 32 booths in Sectors 59, 60, 61, 63, and 65; six shop-cum-offices (SCOs)/shop-cum-floors (SCFs)/single-storey shops (SSSs) in Sectors 61, 53, 56 and 64. Seven IT industrial plots located in Sectors 83 and 101 and one hotel site in Sector 66-B with a reserve price of ₹12.7 crore were also listed.“The auction has got a good response and now, we can hope that realty market will bloom again. We request GMADA to slash its reserve price more as it will help in healthy competition and help the development authority earn bigger profit,” said Shailander Anand, former president, Mohali Property Consultants Association (MPCA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hope-revives-for-realty-as-gmada-finds-buyers-for-50-of-its-sites-in-mohali/story-B3RWJfeSra6KKAUSqjl0LL.html
27-10-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Man barges into woman’s house, molests her||Greater Noida: A 28-year-old man allegedly barged into the house of a 26-year-old woman on Sunday night and molested her. When the woman raised an alarm, the suspect hit her with a wooden stick and fled the spot, the police said, adding that the victim’s leg got fractured in the incident. The woman’s younger sister has filed a complaint at Site V police station. “The suspect had barged into our house at 11pm and molested my elder sister. My sister raised an alarm and we rushed to her. The suspect grabbed a wooden staff from the floor and hit my sister on the leg,” the sister said in the FIR. The suspect allegedly also beat the complainant when she tried to rescue her sister. The family members rushed the victim to a private hospital for medical treatment in Bilaspur, the police said. When contacted, the victim’s father said that the suspect was not known to his family. “The suspect lives about one kilometre away from our house. We do not have any relation with the suspect. We do not know why he had barged into our house,” he said. The family informed police about the incident. Vivek Trivedi, station house officer, Site V police station, said that a police team reached the spot after getting the information, but the suspect managed to escape by then. “It appears the suspect barged into the house in an inebriated condition. We have launched search to arrest him,” he said. The police have registered a case against the suspect under Section 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), Section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and Section 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-man-barges-into-woman-s-house-molests-her/story-x9EKaotPH2muYWOQ89fzPI.html
27-10-2020||Noida||Aqua Line’s Sector 50 station renamed as Pride Station; six transgender staff hired||Noida: The Sector 50 station on the Aqua Line was on Tuesday dedicated to the transgender community and renamed as ‘Pride Station’. The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC), which operates the metro service between Noida and Greater Noida, also hired six transgender staff – four for ticketing and two for housekeeping – aimed at inclusive development, officials said. Ritu Maheshwari, managing director of NMRC, said that the initiative aims at the meaningful participation of transgender community. “Earlier we had named two stations – Sector 51 and Pari Chowk as Pink Stations – for women empowerment. With the Pride Station, NMRC feels extremely proud to have qualified members of transgender community as part of its NMRC family. It also instils a ray of hope for the upliftment of the community and breaking stereotypes about them,” she said. The name -- Pride Station -- was selected after receiving suggestions from the general public and some NGOs that work for the community, the officials said. NMRC also collaborated with National Backward Classes Finance & Development Corporation (NBCFDC), which works under the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, for providing soft skills training to four transgender community staff who got placement in NMRC. Two other staff members were placed through a Noida- based NGO. The transgender staff have been deployed at the Sector 50 metro station after they were provided with necessary training by NMRC. Mahi Gupta, Panya Pawar, Kajal Kashyap, Shanu – are hired for ticketing, while Pawan and Kunal Mohar are hired in the housekeeping department.Mahi said that she is very happy after getting a job in NMRC. “There is discrimination and stereotype against our community members in the society. We want to work hard and prove that we are equally competent,” she said. Kajal said that she is pursuing master of social work (MSW) programme through distance mode. “I could not continue my study after class 12 because students used to tease me. I have been associated with an NGO for seven years. I got to know about this vacancy, applied and was selected,” she said.GB Nagar member of Parliament Mahesh Sharma, chief guest at the event, said that this is a welcome step by NMRC. “Noida is a land of hope and aspirations. NMRC has paved a way for the transgender community members for their upliftment. If transgender staff can successfully work here, they can also work in other private companies and factories in Noida,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/aqua-line-s-sector-50-station-renamed-as-pride-station-six-transgender-staff-hired/story-7CSJITHBxPt2GEnKnERIRM.html

No suicide note was recovered from the spot, the police said.According to police officials, they were informed about the incident around 12.30pm.“The woman, along with her family, lived in a rented house on the third floor of a building. Today afternoon she jumped down from her balcony. Her four children and husband were there, but the family found out about it when the locals informed them. They then called us and a team was rushed to the spot. The body has been sent for an autopsy,” said Prabhat Dikshit, station house officer, Sector 24 police station.Dikshit said that according to the family, the woman had been depressed for the past few months and was undergoing treatment. “The family feels that this could be the reason for the woman taking her own life. Preliminary investigation did not turn up any dispute or issue which might have triggered this. Even the neighbours did not mention any problems,” said the SHO.Following the autopsy, the body was handed over to the family who has not filed any complaint in the case, the police said.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 9582208181 (Snehi) and Delhi-based 011-23389090 (Sumaitri).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/woman-jumps-to-death-from-her-house-in-noida/story-ctWWAeYNUzlTEhrF9SqPnL.html
27-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation proposes 17 entry gates to city||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has proposed to install at least 17 entry gates at as many intra-city, inter-district and inter-state border locations in the city. Officials said that the move is aimed at demarcating the areas under the corporation jurisdiction. As part of the project, the corporation has proposed 17 gates with intra-city borders with other local bodies, with districts like Gautam Budh Nagar and also with nearby states like Delhi. According to the officials, 10 of these will come up in Vasundhara zone, three in Kavi Nagar zone and two each in Mohan Nagar and Vijay Nagar zones. “The idea is to clearly demarcate the boundaries of the corporation wherever they start or end. The commuters should know the jurisdiction they travel in or out. The gates will be beautified to give a new look to the city limits as well. We have started the process and there could be more of such gates which we will include further,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. “It is likely that the work will start soon and well before the next Swachh Survekshan that starts in January,” he added. By the end of December, the work for the Delhi-Meerut Expressway is also likely to get complete and proper connectivity between major city roads to the expressway will also be given. “The proposal for the gates will have to be taken up before the executive committee and then taken to the corporation board for final approval. In my opinion, the gates if they come up at the inter-district borders will be more helpful for commuters who are coming to Ghaziabad district,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar. “But, if the officials are trying to put them up inside the city, it will prove cumbersome as the city areas are already congested and will not be viable,” Tyagi said. The officials have proposed eight such gates at boundary with GB Nagar district while five have been proposed to come up at Ghaziabad borders with Delhi.Residents said that the entry gates will give a new look to the city. “Such gates will give the city a new look, besides clearly demarcating the boundaries. It will also be helpful for commuters to have knowledge of the jurisdiction they are entering. We already have three old gates in heart of the city. They must be preserved,” said Vikrant Sharma, a resident of Raj Nagar Extension and a lawyer. The three old gates which mark the walled city in Ghaziabad are Jawahar Gate at Ghanta Ghar, Dasna Gate and Delhi Gate. The corporation officials said that the gates are maintained by the Ghaziabad development authority which takes up their repairs, lighting, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-proposes-17-entry-gates-to-city/story-3MMttdeVd1PtL7nhcqkQ1I.html
27-10-2020||Noida||State govt declares Child PGI in Noida as non-Covid hospital||NOIDA: The state government on Monday removed the Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute, better known as Child PGI in Gautam Budh Nagar district, from the list of Covid-dedicated hospitals. The management of Child PGI had requested the government to declare the hospital as a non-Covid facility, to take care of minor patients suffering from other ailments. The Child PGI was converted into an L-2 Covid facility in April this year after the Covid-19 outbreak. “It is the first government Covid-dedicated hospital of the district that has been de-notified. However, it has been made clear that in case of any emergency, the hospital can once again be made a Covid-19 facility, with a notice period of maximum seven days,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. The DM further said that after the denotification, the hospital will be very helpful in treatment of minor patients. Child PGI director Dr DK Gupta said that at present, the hospital has 10 Covid-19 patients. “As a Covid-19 facility, we had 150 beds, including 20 ventilator beds and 30 beds with oxygen. Once the positive patients are discharged, the hospital will be sanitised and then it will start its operation as a non-Covid hospital, exclusively for minors,” he said. Gupta further said that the 250-bed hospital has some exclusive facilities like new-born intensive care unit (NICU) and advanced thalassemia, cancer and dermatology clinics. “From September 28, we had started our free out-patient department (OPD) for the persons, who were discharged from the hospital after defeating Covid-19. So far, nearly 800 Covid-19 positives, including 200 minor patients, have been discharged from this hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/state-govt-declares-child-pgi-in-noida-as-non-covid-hospital/story-594tAFzdHvLbiOIcWCmyUM.html
27-10-2020||Noida||Majority of Covid-19 deaths took place in urban segments of Ghaziabad, reveals interim analysis of health dept||Ghaziabad: An interim internal analysis of the Covid-19 related fatalities in the district has revealed that 71 of the 82 deaths reported so far have come from the urban segments of the district. Officials of the district health department said that dense population in urban areas and nearness to Delhi resulted in the spread of infection. The assessment of the district health department also indicated that out of 82 fatalities, 54 patients suffered co-morbid conditions. Of the 54 fatality cases having co-morbid conditions, 24 patients suffered at least one disease while other 30 suffered more than one ailments which further complicated the Covid-19 condition of the patients, as per the analysis. When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey referred the matter for response to the chief medical officer (CMO). “More deaths took place in urban segments as there is about 80% of population base in urban areas in the district. Also, these localities are densely populated as compared to villages. Areas like Kaushambi, Vaishali, and Indirapuram always had high number of cases due to large working population which goes to Delhi for work. So, the inflow of infection was also high,” said Dr NK Gupta, CMO, Ghaziabad. “The villages, on the other hand, barricaded their entry/exit points since the lockdown and put up stricter checks on incoming of outsiders. A major proportion of the fatalities also took place in hospitals outside the district where many patients went on their own. At later stages, the use of nasal cannula and medicines like Remdesivir, among other things, brought positive results and many patients who were facing severe conditions recovered,” Gupta added. At present, the district has a total of 82 fatalities of which 55 alone took place in the month of June. In October, five deaths have been reported so far, according to the state control room figures. As per the analysis, 28 deaths were of the patients in the age group over 60 years, while 17 deaths took place in age group 51-60 years and 18 in age group 41-50 years. In addition, there was one death in the age group 0-10 years. Of the total deaths, men accounted for 51 fatalities while the rest were women. The survey report also said that 59 patients who succumbed were admitted to the intensive care unit. Notably, of the 82 deaths, only 39 took place at hospitals in Ghaziabad while the rest were in other hospitals at Meerut, Noida and Delhi. “Since the Covid-19 infection was new, there was regular upgrade of infrastructure which was used in due course of time. The greater number of fatalities in urban segments were due to spread of infection in densely populated areas. Over a period of time, the case fatality has reduced and the severity of infection has also come down,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “Moreover, it was in urban segments that initial set of foreign travellers arrived and severity of infection then was high. Majority of containment zones were created in urban segments,” Jindal added. At present, the district has a case fatality rate of 0.45% even as the total number of Covid-19 cases has gone up to 18,154. In order to prevent spread of infection and prevent further fatalities, the state health department officials in an internal communication have directed the district officials to review each death in depth and disseminate the findings to stop preventable deaths in future. “The state officials have directed us to focus on ways to prevent delays and ensure quality treatment to save lives. We have also been asked to continuously monitor home isolated patients and ensure that visits are paid on first, fourth and seventh day as stipulated. For early testing, we have been asked to focus on testing of highly vulnerable groups like vendors, auto rickshaw drivers, healthcare workers, and symptomatic cases found at Covid help desks,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/majority-of-covid-19-deaths-took-place-in-urban-segments-of-ghaziabad-reveals-interim-analysis-of-health-dept/story-oJHZysU1hICcsZYG1966MO.html
27-10-2020||City||Panel formed for study and research on rise in air pollution||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Authority has formed a panel of experts to research into the reasons that has led to rise in air pollution and how it can be effectively contained. The panel that will have professors from Gautam Budh Nagar University, Sharda University, Amity University, Shiv Nadar University and other educational institutions and will focus on two points- local causes and external causes.“Once the research is completed, we will establish the exact causes of pollution within the jurisdiction of our authority and external causes such as stubble burning in remote state like Punjab or Haryana etc. It will help us make a detailed project report to act to contain air pollution,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority.The internal causes of air pollution are construction activity, traffic jam, garbage handling, industrial sources and other causes limited to a city.“As per old studies, 30% air pollution causes due to construction activity in a city,” said Bhooshan.The authority has been sprinkling water on roads, doing mechanical sweeping and enforcing the NGT guidelines.“But still the air pollution is rising in the city. It means there are gaps and we all need to do better be it enforcement or taking other effective steps. Panel research and preparing action plan is not a short term project. We aim to see the results of this research in next 2-3 years,” said Bhooshan.The increasing air pollution has become a cause of concern for the authority also because they feel that if the air pollution will continue to increase every winter then it will have repercussions on industrial growth and investment as it will put off the international investors.“With Expressway, International airport, Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and other mega projects Greater Noida region has become an international city in terms of big investment projects coming up here. Therefore we need to make this region ecologically sustainable and to make that happen we need to research and then act,” said Bhooshan. “We have decided to participate in this research that aims to find out how we can effectively mitigate the air pollution that has become a major cause of worry every winter season for our society. Our professors are already brain storming on methods to reduce air pollution. And now with the panel we will work towards finding a sustainable solution to this menace,” said vice chancellor of Gautam Buddha University BP Sharma. The private universities are also willing to play a role in this project.“We had an interaction with the Greater Noida authority CEO Narendra Bhooshan on the issue of rising air pollution. Our professor from the department of environmental science and environmental engineering will be a part of this panel that is important to address the air pollution issue,” said Dr Ajit Kumar spokesperson of Sharda University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panel-formed-for-study-and-research-on-rise-in-air-pollution/story-kbB50HM1rVckBz8wjdvkFM.html

Sudhir Garg, UP principal secretary (forests), reviewed the pollution scenario with officials of 16 non-attainment cities in the state that have been consistently violating air quality standards. Pollution levels have spiked in October with coarse particulate matter PM10 and ultrafine particulate matter PM2.5 emerging as primary pollutants. “With regards to Ghaziabad, the principal secretary has directed that we should make more efforts to check PM10 levels that has large number of local sources. He has directed us to keep check on road dust as well as take up repair of broken roads besides keeping tab on construction sites as well,” said Utsav Sharma, Ghaziabad regional officer of the UP-pollution control board. “Our monitoring stations at Loni and Indirapuram are primarily affected due to construction. We said that there is strict watch on such activities especially with respect to the Delhi Meerut Expressway and Regional Rapid Transit System. The corporation also told that they have initiated work of road dust collection in dust bags and the scheme has been gaining momentum.” The officials said that they also gave details to the principal secretary about the installation of CCTV cameras at construction sites over area of 20,000 square metres and above. “So far, we have got CCTV controls of eight out of 34 construction sites and verification process is on for sites that have completed their self-audit as directed by the UPPCB. Out of about 75 air polluting industrial units, we have CCTV camera controls of 39 units. In case, the CCTVs are not readied by end of October, we will start levying penalties,” Sharma said. During the video-conferencing on Tuesday, the principal secretary also issued directions to the UPPCB officials of Noida. “We have been asked to maintain smooth flow of traffic wherever road construction/repair works are taken up. The principal secretary told that there should be alternate routes which should be made available for smooth passage of traffic in case some road is getting constructed. Besides, we have been told to intensify water sprinkling as well as take up proper garbage management in order to control pollution,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of the UPPCB, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-pollution-review-for-non-attainment-cities-up-directs-ghaziabad-to-control-pm10-noida-to-ensure-smooth-flow-of-traffic/story-Okbpym6gsFiWjOKye6VKxM.html
27-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Image of district will be hit if you don’t follow pollution norms, officials tell realtors||With pollution season here and high monetary penalties on contractors not helping, a high-level meeting of officials from Greater Noida and Noida authorities, district administration and the police department tried to impress upon them that the image of the district would take a hit if they did not take responsibility.At the same time, officials said they would not shy away from taking strict action.The Greater Noida authority on Tuesday imposed ₹1.25 crore penalty against the 25 realtors for pollution norms violations, a day earlier it had slapped ₹97 lakh penalty against nine realtors. The Noida authority imposed ₹50,000 penalty against three persons on Tuesday. However, officials on the ground said the violations continued unabated. “We have realised that imposing the penalty against the developers are not going to achieve any results until the realtors willingly follow the guidelines. Noida and Greater Noida are International cities with world class infrastructure projects including airport at Jewar and attracting investment in big projects. Rise in Air pollution will damage the brand image of the city and have negative repercussions on every business. So we need to work together to protect the image,” said Greater Noida authority chief executive officer (CEO) Narendra Bhooshan who chaired the meeting.Gautam Budh Nagar’s police commissioner Alok Singh and district magistrate Suhas LY, Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yedia) CEO Arun Vir Singh and representatives from at least 30 real estate firms attended the meeting in Greater Noida authority’s sector Knowledge Park-IV administrative office.According to the NGT’s construction guidelines construction material should not be left uncovered, when ferried they should be covered a sheet, large construction sites should be surrounded by plantation to keep dust under check and anti-smog guns had to be installed at all sites spread over 20,000 square meter-plot.“All the realtors or others engaged in construction need to adhere to these rules. Also, we will enforce traffic rules through strict enforcement to minimise the pollution that is caused due to traffic congestion. Vehicles such as tractor or others violating rules will face action,” said Alok Singh police commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar.“We have made it clear to the realtors, industrial unit owners and others that they should comply or face strict action. If construction sites, which are operational without workable smog guns need to be shut or face severe action. We have requested everybody in meeting that follow rules or be prepared to face action from different agencies be it administration or UPPCB,” said Suhas LY district magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar.The developers said they are ready to follow the rules.“We have installed anti-smog guns at our sites so that the air pollution that is caused due to construction activity can be contained. We have assured the officials that all realtors will follow to rules and do their bit to mitigate air pollution,” said RK Arora president of national real estate council Uttar Pradesh chapter.“We have appealed to all realtors to follow national green tribunal guidelines. And all realtors are already very serious on implementation of the rules of NGT,” said Prashant Tiwari president of confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-image-of-district-will-be-hit-if-you-don-t-follow-pollution-norms-officials-tell-realtors/story-MZCP0Hnc0weM1no7onEHZK.html
27-10-2020||Noida||As pollution rises, Ghaziabad officials identify 17 traffic congestion hotspots||Ghaziabad district administration officials have identified 17 major traffic intersection points in the city as hot spots where traffic snarls and bottlenecks were likely to add to the ultra fine particulate matter PM2.5 levels this winter. The district magistrate directed officials to prepare a plan to ensure that traffic here was smooth and unhindered. The 17 points include six major intersection the under construction Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) where the phase 2 work is in progress and dusty conditions also add high levels of coarse particulate matter PM10 to the existing pollution levels. The six points were identified at ABES cut, Vijay Nagar crossing, Tigri cut, Santosh Medical crossing, Lal Kuan flyover and Atma Ram steel crossing near Vijay Nagar. “The district magistrate has directed the regional transport department to intensify checks for pollution certificates and other enforcement measures ahead of the upcoming festival season. He also directed the officials of the traffic police for deployment of staff,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. “Within the next couple of days, different departments have also been directed to prepare the plan to ensure that there are no traffic snarls or bottlenecks.” The other major points identified include the major crossings near Ghanta Ghar, Meerut Crossing, Raj Nagar Extension crossing, Sihani Chungi, Old vegetable market, Sahibabad-Seemapuri crossing, Bhopra crossing, at Sahibabad site IV industrial area, Loni crossing, Tila Morh crossing and also at Tronica City. According to the records of the UP Pollution Control Board, the PM10 levels have been ranging up to three times the safe limits (100µg/m³) in Ghaziabad in October, while the PM2.5 levels were almost double its safe limit of 60µg/m³. Environmentalists said that these hot spots should have been identified before the start of winter and plans put in place from October 1. “There have been traffic management initiatives like the integrated traffic management plan which has died out and not being taken up. Further, the Central Road Research Institute also prepared a detailed traffic management plan. But residents don’t know how much of it was implemented. So, traffic has always been a major issued in the city but there is hardly anything concrete which has been done,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. “At every major market, there will be hundreds of vehicles parked roadsides as there is hardly any parking facility available. In festival season, the rush will increase manifold. So, simply identifying the traffic congestion points in late October is no major achievement and just eyewash. The city suffers traffic issues throughout the year.”Box: traffic congestion hotspots ABES cut, Vijay Nagar crossing, Tigri cut, Santosh Medical crossing, Lal Kuan flyover, Atma Ram steel crossing near Vijay Nagar, Ghanta Ghar, Meerut Crossing, Raj Nagar Extension crossing, Sihani Chungi, Old vegetable market, Sahibabad-Seemapuri crossing, Bhopra crossing, at Sahibabad site IV industrial area, Loni crossing, Tila Morh crossing and Tronica City||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/as-pollution-rises-ghaziabad-officials-identify-17-traffic-congestion-hotspots/story-eiEcMljmLeWYEJ6ruGcghN.html
27-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Slight improvement in air quality||Favourable meteorological conditions on Tuesday improved the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, however the air quality still hovered within the “very poor” category. Greater Noida and Noida was the second and third most polluted cities in national capital region (NCR), following Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, on Tuesday. The condition may however, deteriorate over Wednesday and Thursday.According to the India meteorological department (IMD), the wind speed increased from average 8 kmph on Monday to around 20 kmph on Tuesday leading to proper dispersion of pollutants. This is likely to significantly drop on Wednesday and Thursday. “Wind speed was good on Tuesday as expected, so the dispersion of the pollutants leads to slight improvement in the air quality. We had recorded an average wind speed of 18 to 20 kmph today of westerly and north westerly directions. However, the wind speed will drop to 8-10 kmph on October 28 and 29,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that good wind speed is expected between October 30 and November 1. “We expect good wind speed by the month end, which will further help in dispersal of pollutants,” said Srivastava. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperatures for next three days are expected to hover around 32 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 13 degrees Celsius. According to the data assessed by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the air quality index (AQI) in Noida on Tuesday on a scale of 0 to 500 was 320 against 376 a day before. The AQI of Greater Noida was 332 against 384 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 306 against 365 a day earlier. The AQI between 300 to 399 is considered ‘very-poor’. Meanwhile, the Knowledge Park-V area of Greater Noida showed marked improvement with an AQI of 316 against 435 (severe) a day earlier. While the second monitoring station of Greater Noida – Knowledge Park—saw an AQI of 327 against 349 a day earlier. The PM10 concetration of the Greater Noida area dropped from 602.66 microgrammes per cubic metres on Monday to 336.32 units on Tuesday. The standard limit of PM10, or larger suspended particles in air is 60 units. The average PM2.5 of Noida dropped from 198.67 units a day earlier to 166.88 unit on Tuesday. The PM10 concentration of Noida also dropped from 414.52 units on Monday to 314.30 units. The PM2.5 values of Ghaziabad also improved from 204.18 units to 170.73 units, while the PM10 concentration improved from 361.70 units to 308.71 units. “Met conditions have favoured the dispersion of pollutant in the region leading to improvement of air quality on Tuesday. Besides, we have also recommended the agencies concerned to intensify the water sprinkling in several areas with heavy construction activities. We also held a meeting with over 40 builders instructing them to take appropriate dust and emission control measures at their respective sites,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-slight-improvement-in-air-quality/story-NB3aOzX9NvY7FsXBOQFrzL.html

27-10-2020||City||Ludhiana: ‘Rail roko’ pushes industry off track with many forced to shut shop, shift to other states||As trouble deepens for the industry due to the ongoing ‘rail roko’ agitation by farmers which has interrupted supplies, the industrial associations on Tuesday said that many exporters were forced to shut down their units, while some are planning to shift business to other states.With over four containers carrying goods and raw material worth crores stuck at ports or in transit due to no movement of goods trains in the state, the industry is facing an acute shortage of raw material and exporters fear cancellation of orders due to the delay being caused in delivery of goods. The cost of raw material available has also increased due to low supply.The Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) also organised a meeting of industrialists on Tuesday and urged the state government to intervene in the matter.President CICU, Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary, Pankaj Sharma said that the rail services were not stopped even when terrorism was at its peak in the state. Industrialists are being forced to shut down units due to a shortage of raw material including steel. The industry was already reeling under losses due to the lockdown and the situation has worsened due to the farmers’ rail roko agitation, they said. Some industrialists do not have funds to pay salaries to their staff. Further, the shipping companies are planning to charge for containers stuck with them, they added.“Importers and exporters are under a lot of stress. As the Inland Container Depots (ICD) in the state are closed, the industry is mulling transportation of goods meant for export to Gujarat and Mumbai by road, from where the shipments would be released, but this will increase the transportation cost. The auto parts manufacturers are worried as they will have to pay heavy penalties if the supply of parts to automakers gets delayed. The medium and large-scale industry is planning to shift units to other states due to frequent disturbances being witnessed in the state,” said Ahuja.Industrialists rued that the state government has extended support to the protest for political mileage.President of All Industries and Trade Forum, Badish Jindal said that the state government is indulging in politics rather than resolving the issue. “The industries in the state purchase around 3-lakh tonnes of steel every month which includes wire rods, H R Coil, C R Coils, TMT, billets and blooms, etc. But due to farmers’ agitation, the supply through the railway has stopped and they have to bring the steel through the road network, which increases the transportation cost of steel by Rs 2,000 per tonne,” he said.States like Haryana and Rajasthan do not have such problems, although farmers there are also suffering. Those states have maintained law and order and movement of goods is going on, said Ahuja while adding that the industry is exploring legal options to resolve the issues being faced by them and a delegation will also meet chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in the coming days.President of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association, DS Chawla said, “The large industry is planning to shift units to other states but small manufacturers have no choice and they are on the brink of closure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-rail-roko-pushes-industry-off-track-with-many-forced-to-shut-shop-shift-to-other-states/story-SsMmFQRFLUDmOy8PS5ubMK.html

27-10-2020||City||President’s nod to inquiry into ‘misgovernance’ at Delhi University||New Delhi: President Ram Nath Kovind has given his assent to an inquiry into alleged misgovernance at Delhi University, officials said on Tuesday. The President is the visitor (head of the institution) to the university. “The president has given his assent for a probe into issues of misgovernance. The Union education ministry has raised questions about the governance of the varsity and the consent has been received. The ministry will now set up a committee that will probe the issues,” said an education ministry official. The official added that vice-chancellor Yogesh Kumar Tyagi will continue to be on leave.Meanwhile, an email notification issued on Wednesday gave a new twist to the ongoing turf war over the appointment of top officials in the central institution. In the notification, issued by PC Jha in his capacity as the registrar, all DU officials were asked to comply with the DU Act, its statutes and ordinances. Soon, Vikas Gupta, the registrar, issued a notice to Jha for issuing the notification illegally. Jha represents the lobby backed by vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi and Gupta is backed by the group led by pro vice-chancellor PC Joshi. After a bitter spat over the appointment of a new registrar that went on for two days, the Union education ministry had nullified the appointment of Jha, saying since Tyagi is on sick leave he could not take such decisions. Gupta’s appointment had also been cleared by the executive council, the highest decision making body of the varsity, in a meeting on October 21. Gupta on Tuesday issued a memorandum to Jha for issuing a notification while posing as the registrar. “Jha has been constantly issuing statements falsely posing as the registrar of the university. We had issued a memorandum to him last Saturday on the same grounds but he is yet to respond to it. Now, if he will not respond to this new memo in the next 24 hours, action will be taken against him,” Gupta said in the memo.Jha, however, said that as per the university’s norms he is the “duly appointed” registrar. “The vice-chancellor has appointed me as the acting registrar and the ministry cannot interfere in it as per the DU Act. I do not accept the validity of the memo issued by Gupta as he is not technically the registrar of the university.”Earlier in the day, an e-mail was sent out from V-C Tyagi’s official mail ID to the university officials, principals, and media persons describing the achievements of the institution under his tenure since 2016. From DU getting an institution of eminence (IoE) tag and autonomy in 2019 to building journalism school and cybersecurity institute, the email lists out several other initiatives the university has taken between 2016 and 2020. While Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts sent for comment, Jha said, “The email was sent out by the V-C himself. It’s a befitting response for those who have been alleging that Tyagi did not do any work during his tenure.”Gupta said that the university will soon ask the technical team to hand over the rights to the V-C office email to the acting V-C PC Joshi. “As far as we know, V-C Tyagi is on leave and we do not know who has the access to his e-mail ID and password. Our technical team will soon block it and hand it over to the pro-VC,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/president-s-nod-to-inquiry-into-misgovernance-at-delhi-university/story-uIxFlIvKcNJQYnpYKWCAyN.html
27-10-2020||City||Samrala govt school shuts for a week after lecturer tests +ve||Government Senior Secondary School (for boys), Samrala, has been closed for a week after a lecturer tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. The lecturer has been sent into home isolation and the health department has started the procedure to trace all people who came in contact with him recently. The lecturer, along with 44 other faculty members of the school, had undergone Covid-19 tests last Friday. After he tested positive, all faculty members have been asked to go for a re-examination. At least 60 senior class students had been coming to the school since it reopened earlier this month, as part of the fifth phase of the unlocking process.Samrala civil hospital’s senior medical officer (SMO) Taranjot Singh said as the students are minors, the health department would need their parents’ consent to take their samples for testing. He said that if any student has developed flu-like symptoms, they can get their test done from the health development.School principal Davinder Singh said the teacher was also a class in-charge so he had lots of paperwork to do. He had come in contact with some students who had come to him for registration and document-related tasks.158 students appear in examinationWhen the report of the lecturer testing positive for Covid-19 came on Tuesday, as many as 158 students of open school were taking their English exam at the school. Though these students were allowed to stay back till they completed the exam, 60 other students who had come to attend classes were sent home immediately. The principal said there was no other option but to let the students finish their exam. The school has, however, requested the education department to shift the students to some other school for Thursday’s paper. 2 dead, 50 more infectedAs many as 50 new Covid cases and two deaths were reported in the district on Tuesday.

27-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s minimum temperature drops slightly, winter still month away, says IMD||Mumbai’s suburbs on Tuesday experienced a nip in the air as the minimum temperatures dropped to 22 degrees Celsius, a three-degree drop from 25 degrees Celsius the previous day.The Santacruz weather station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum temperature of 33.5 degree Celsius and minimum temperature of 22.2 degrees Celsius which was one degree below the normal temperature of 23 degrees Celsius. The Colaba station recorded a maximum temperature of 32.2 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Minimum temperature of around 23 degree Celsius with partly cloudy sky is expected over the next two days, according to the IMD’s forecast.The MeT bureau clarified that while temperatures have dropped and may remain low for the next couple of days, winter was still at least a month away. Also read: Facebook India’s Ankhi Das quits as head of public policy“Temperature dropped slightly on Tuesday but it is not an indication of the onset of winter. As monsoon will start withdrawing from Mumbai, it is expected that humidity will decrease and temperatures will be recorded around 22-23 degrees. Low temperatures may continue for a couple more days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. However, the onset of winter will begin only in December as usual, he added. There was no change in the withdrawal line of monsoon from north Maharashtra. The IMD had declared the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from north Maharashtra on Monday. The withdrawal is likely to start on Wednesday. The line of withdrawal passes through Dahanu in north Konkan, Nashik, north-central Maharashtra, parts of Marathwada and entire Vidarbha. Monsoon withdrawal from other parts of the Konkan coast, including Mumbai, is expected over the next 24 hours, the IMD said.

27-10-2020||Gurugram||H-Rera to take action against property dealers charging more than prescribed commission rate||The Haryana-Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) on Tuesday said that the authority will take action against property dealers who are charging more than one percent commission rate on the sale of properties as prescribed by the Haryana Regulation of Property Dealers and Consultants Rules, 2009, made under the Haryana Regulation of Property Dealers and Consultants Act of 2008. Officials of the authority also said that H-Rera will soon formulate a code of conduct for property dealers to ensure that they do not indulge in unfair trade practices.KK Khandelwal, chairman, H-Rera, said that rules call for one percent commission on agreed consideration value to be paid by the seller and purchaser of the property on finalisation of the deal as per the agreement entered in the register of the dealer under a valid receipt. “Instances have come to the notice of the authority that some of the property dealers are falsely representing the services of a particular standard or grade and making false or misleading representation concerning the services and approvals of the project. Misleading advertisements of projects are also being issued by brokers of upcoming projects, violating rules,” he said. “As such all real estate agents are hereby cautioned not to charge commission more than what is prescribed in the rules. Doing so will be deemed as an outright violation of the provisions of the law,’’ the chairman said. Khandelwal added that code of ethics will prescribe not only the additional books of accounts to be maintained by the property dealers (so as to check whether the commission is being charged as per the law) but also ask for keeping a record of transaction which may be perused by the authority in case of a dispute between a buyer and a broker.The authority also observed that the property dealers/brokers were indulging in malpractices in connivance with the promoters and charging much more than the prescribed commission both from the sellers and buyers. It has been reported that commission as high as 5% to 10% of the value of the property is being charged by the agent and the burden of this additional commission is ultimately being shared by the allottee, it said. The authority is also keeping a vigil on brokers, who are developing and selling unauthorised colonies. SC Kush, member, H-Rera, said that brokers/ property dealers who do not have the necessary documents pertaining to projects in which they deal, shall also be penalised. Penalty might include the cancellation of their registration with the authority and even a withdrawal of the licence. The code of ethics also proposes to make displaying the details of the real estate project mandatory at a place where the sale is being facilitated, he said.When asked about the proposed code, Ravinder Aggarwal, president, Association of Certified Realtors of India, said that H-Rera has the right to prescribe a code of conduct but it should also put its own house in order. “Most of the orders and directions issued by authority remain unimplemented and the buyers are kept waiting for years. The government needs to appoint judicial officers and empower them so that real intervention can take place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/h-rera-to-take-action-against-property-dealers-charging-more-than-prescribed-commission-rate/story-Wei133gq2XGIgD8CHhYXxO.html
27-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG to take stock of available parking spaces on Mall Mile, Golf Course Road||With the aim of increasing the total number of available parking spaces in the city, teams from the taxation wing of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will be visiting all commercial buildings, having basement parking facilities, on the heavily congested Mall Mile and Golf Course Road (GCR) next month. MCG officials said the owners of such buildings would be subsequently be given an option to get an exemption from the civic body on property taxes for their basement areas, provided they offer their basements to residents for parking free of cost. Officials said, on their visits, they would ask owners to provide a declaration, listing details such as the total number of parking spaces available, the type of parking rates they are charging, and the annual property tax they pay to the civic body. As per MCG officials, depending on the size of the parking space, the property tax of a basement floor can cost anywhere between ₹10 lakh-₹20 lakh on an average annually.“Starting from the first week of November, we’ll ask owners of all commercial buildings along the MG Road and GCR to give a declaration regarding the use of their basement floors. Subsequently, they would be given an option to either become a part of MCG’s parking policy or continue paying property tax to us. The rationale behind this move is to create more parking spaces in the city and reduce congestion along stretches which have a high volume of traffic,” said Sameer Srivastava, zonal taxation officer (ZTO), MCG.The MCG introduced its parking policy in March 2017. However, it mainly covered malls. Around 110 buildings are currently under the civic body’s parking policy. Associations of commercial buildings’ owners said that such a policy would be lucrative only for those buildings where the parking volume is low and earnings from parking tickets are negligible.“For buildings such as ours, the MCG’s parking policy is simply not lucrative or even economically feasible. The amount of property tax we pay for our basement parking floors annually is recovered through parking earnings in a month. Hence, this policy makes little sense for us. However, for buildings where the total occupancy for parking is low and the earnings through it is also insignificant, such a policy may make sense,” said Aman Bajaj, member of MGF Metropolitan Mall Association.Parking is a major problem in Gurugram with only one multilevel parking and 43 sanctioned parking lots for a city which registers around 30,000 new vehicles annually.MCG officials are estimating that they would be able to increase parking spaces for vehicles by 10,000-15,000 along these stretches by integrating more commercial buildings into their policy.The MCG’s policy, however, comes with its own set of problems. Just a week ago, the civic body served a notice to a mall on GCR, after receiving a complaint through the CM window that the mall was charging parking fees to visitors despite being a part of the civic body’s parking policy and displaying a signboard outside the mall, stating “free parking”. The complaint further alleged that the mall was getting an annual property tax exemption of ₹50 lakh from the MCG.Srivastava said that the MCG is probing the matter and has asked department of town and country planning (DTCP) for building plans of the mall.In December last year, the MCG had received complaints of three malls on Sohna Road charging visitors for parking despite putting up signage of free parking. Subsequently, the MCG had issued notices to all the buildings under its parking policy, warning of sealing if any building was found to be violating the terms of its parking policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-take-stock-of-available-parking-spaces-on-mall-mile-golf-course-road/story-QFX5nU0qbiNXEekSIENelJ.html
27-10-2020||Gurugram||Two men who jumped bail five years ago held from Khandsa Mandi||The city police on Tuesday arrested two persons, identified as Praveen alias Sonu of Arjun Nagar and Mukesh Kumar of Sohna, who are proclaimed offenders and have jumped bail in an attempt-to-murder case five years ago. A team from the crime investigation agency of Sector 14 arrested the two men from Khandsa vegetable Mandi on Tuesday afternoon, when they came to meet their friends. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that both the suspects have been together and changing their locations for the last five years. They had come from Rajasthan to meet their friends and had to collect some cash to pay the rent of their room in Bharatpur, Rajasthan. A case under sections 323 (assault), 506 (threatening for life), 34 (common intentions) and 302 (murder) was registered against them at the city police station in 2015, said the police. Sangwan said the suspects have been sent to a two-day police remand after being produced before the court on Tuesday. They had allegedly thrashed a friend who later died undergoing treatment at a private hospital in 2015. “They were out on bail, when they fled the city and did not appear for their court days. They were declared proclaimed offenders in November 2015,” he said. The Gurugram Police has compiled a list of 925 proclaimed offenders in the district who are yet to be arrested. The police said they have formed teams and assigned duties to each of them to ensure that all offenders are behind bars within the next three months. Sangwan said the crime teams are conducting an investigation based on technical surveillance and keeping a close watch on the movements of the proclaimed offenders, their relatives and family members. A weekly report is also being submitted to the commissioner of police for updates, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-men-who-jumped-bail-five-years-ago-held-from-khandsa-mandi/story-wVDDzXvFkZvyLL4T0D95uK.html
27-10-2020||Gurugram||30-year-old cheats woman on pretext of job, nabbed from Sector 40||Gurugram Police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old man for allegedly stealing a laptop and belongings of a job aspirant on September 9, after approaching her on the pretext of offering a job. The suspect was identified as Vishal Kumar, a native of Vaishali in Bihar, who was living in a rented accommodation in Sector 103, said police. According to the police, Kumar had posted a bogus opening for a job in a multinational company in Gurugram on a social media platform, following which the victim had approached him. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they received a complaint on September 21 at New Colony police station alleging that a man — identified as Vishal Sharma — had called the victim for an interview at a nearby bakery and had asked her to get her laptop. “The suspect asked her to keep her laptop bag and her belongings in this car and took her inside the bakery and ordered two cups of coffee. After a few minutes the suspect excused himself by stating that he will be back in two minutes and fled with his car and the victim’s belongings,” he said. The victim then waited for an hour and called the mobile number of Kumar, which was switched off. She then took an auto rickshaw and returned home and informed her parents regarding the incident following which a complaint was lodged. A case under section 379 (theft) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code was registered at New Colony police station. Sangwan said they had recovered CCTV footage from the bakery and the suspect and his car was identified with the help of that. A probe was launched in the matter soon after. On Monday, the crime investigations unit of Sector 40 received a tip-off and nabbed the suspect from Sector 40 when he was waiting for another victim near a market, police said. During questioning, Kumar allegedly revealed to the police that he started duping people since lockdown and took advantage of the fact that many people had lost their jobs during that period. Sangwan said they have recovered the suspect’s car, two laptops, mobile phones, 10 SIM cards and power backups from his possession. Kumar was produced before the court on Tuesday and was sent to two days police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/30-year-old-cheats-woman-on-pretext-of-job-nabbed-from-sector-40/story-chUWnTOhsHTKDBna7tudmK.html
27-10-2020||Gurugram||After CBSE, Haryana board reduces syllabus by 30%, teachers say not enough||Taking a cue from CBSE’s handbook, the Haryana board too has decided to reduce its syllabus by 30% for classes 9 to 12 to ease the pressure on students whose classes have been disrupted by the closure of schools owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The state has rationalized the syllabus on the pattern of CBSE and the revised syllabus was shared with teachers earlier this month. Government school teachers are, however, worried about the completion of syllabus for students in senior classes with teachers saying that the reduction in syllabus is still not adequate in view of the condition in which classes had been taking place.Vidushi Kataria, a computer teacher, said that some of the topics that had been excluded had already been covered by schools at the beginning of the academic session. “The syllabus for class 12 is a lot and some more topics could have been excluded. We are making efforts to cover the syllabus as quickly as we can, but there are challenges. Not all students have access to devices and the internet at all times, due to which the pace gets disrupted,” said Kataria. A class 11 English teacher, who did not wish to be named, said that while the reduction in syllabus for students of class 12 was adequate, the students of classes 9, 10, and 11 wouldn’t benefit much since not many topics had been excluded. “A very small portion of the syllabus has been reduced for students in classes 9 and 10. The reduced portion is not even 30%, of what we had expected. The syllabus in class nine especially is a lot and almost negligible rationalisation has been done. The reduction will not be enough to ease the burden on students,” said the teacher. She said that while teachers had high hopes about the reduction in syllabus, the final revised syllabus for senior classes was shared only a few weeks ago. Board of School Education Haryana (Bhiwani) chairman Jagbir Singh said that while the rationalised syllabus was shared on the public domain this month, teachers had been apprised much earlier that the state board would be reducing the syllabus on lines of the CBSE. “We had informed the teachers union well in advance. Once the formal notification was issued, the syllabus was shared with all,” said Singh. He said that online classes were taking place in both private and government schools in the state and there was still time for syllabus completion. “Classes have been taking place and we are confident that the syllabus will be completed since we still have time,” said Singh, adding that further reduction of the syllabus was not feasible. “While we held consultations at the state level before reducing the syllabus, it has been rationalised on lines of the CBSE, since NCERT books are followed in senior classes. We cannot allow our students to fall behind by following a different model, since they need to appear at national level exams that tests students on lines of CBSE pattern,” said Singh. He said that the board had been in touch with the CBSE and there are no further plans to reduce the syllabus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-cbse-haryana-board-reduces-syllabus-by-30-teachers-say-not-enough/story-OqsQojnRV29ajM8y1Hj0GK.html

27-10-2020||Gurugram||Air quality slips back into ‘very poor’ category||The city’s air quality slipped back into the ‘very poor’ category on Tuesday, recording an air quality index (AQI) reading of 306 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, a deterioration from Monday’s AQI reading of 258, which was in the ‘poor’ category. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 267.25 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Tuesday, as per data recorded by CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. The PM2.5 level was more than four times the permissible limit of 60µg/m3.According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), air quality is likely to deteriorate further on Wednesday and Thursday, to the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category, and expected to persist till Friday. A significant increase in the number of stubble fire points across Punjab, Haryana and UP were impacting the air quality of Delhi-NCR, the air quality forecast stated.According to experts, pollution levels are expected to increase further in the first week of November due to the interplay of factors such as dip in temperature, the prevalence of low-speed winds and stubble burning. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Delhi, said that the low wind speed was unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. “The wind speed needs to pick up and improve so that pollutants can be dispersed. Stubble burning is affecting the air quality along with other emissions and as the temperature drops further, air quality might deteriorate in the coming weeks,” said Srivastava On Tuesday, the maximum temperature dropped by two degrees. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 30.1 degrees Celsius, a drop from Monday’s 32.6 degree Celsius. The minimum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 13.1 degree Celsius. While the minimum temperature is expected to hover in a similar range on Wednesday, the maximum temperature is expected to rise by two degrees and touch 32 degree Celsius as per the India Meteorological Department’s forecast. Clear skies have been predicted till the end of the week, by the IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-slips-back-into-very-poor-category/story-Wqob006DsnrOdOqFzkDWoL.html
27-10-2020||Gurugram||Crackdown on diesel gensets starts||A day after the government sought exemptions for 19 residential societies and IT firms, officials started cracking down on those using diesel generator sets, in violation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). Officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Tuesday served a show cause notice to a warehouse for using diesel generator sets. It is the first case of diesel genset use registered by the Gurugram office of the pollution board since Grap came into effect on October 15. In Delhi-NCR, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) has imposed a ban on the use of diesel generator sets. As per the Epca directions issued on October 8, the use of diesel generator sets is banned due to ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality during winter months. Other than for essential and emergency services, its use is banned in Delhi and NCR cities — Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh, and Faridabad and Gurugram in Haryana. On Tuesday, Gurugram was in the ‘very poor’ category of the central air quality index, with a reading of 306 as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. HSPCB, acting on the complaint regarding operation of diesel generator sets in violation of Epca guidelines, visited a warehouse in Pathredi, Pataudi block, on Monday where generator sets were being used for power supply. The site was visited by the additional executive engineer of the pollution board. Shakti Singh, regional officer (south Gurugram), HSPCB, and nodal officer for Grap implementation, said that the environmental compensation had to be paid by the violator under the provisions of Air (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981. “The violator has been asked to submit the compliance report and undertaking regarding adherence of Epca directions at the earliest. If they fail to submit a proper satisfactory report, the board will prosecute under the air pollution Act.” Singh said that as of Tuesday evening, they are yet to receive any report from the violator. In Gurugram and Faridabad, at least 19 residential societies have sought exemption from diesel genset ban. Their detailed affidavits have been submitted to Epca and a decision is awaited in this regard. The pollution board has also set up a control room, on the third floor of the HSIIDC complex at IMT Manesar, for handling complaints related to air pollution in Gurugram and Faridabad. Singh said, “Complaints received from citizens will also be redressed through Sameer application, Swachhata application, and their social media handles. The control room will be operation 24X7. The nodal officer will coordinate with different government agencies for addressing the grievances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/crackdown-on-diesel-gensets-starts/story-0pyIoTA0eNQURmztqP6cZN.html

The best practices from this school should be adopted by other schools so that we can repeat and multiply this success”.“Five years ago, the Delhi government dreamt of providing excellent education in the city’s state government schools. The 98% result in the class 12 board results, and the scale of success in JEE and NEET shows that our dream is coming true. It also shows that the quality of government schools in Delhi has become very high. We have to learn from these successes to make Delhi’s education revolution so effective that it will not only inspire our country but the whole world,” he said. The school’s principal Preeti Saxena said they adopted a “Five-C’s” model — Connect, Counselling, Constant Motivation, Curiosity, and Creative Thinking — to enhance the educational experience. “Teachers often tell us how they try their best to teach children in interesting and practical ways. For example, a mechanical lab is used to explain the various abstract concepts in Physics,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-visits-govt-school-where-five-students-got-into-iits-22-students-clear-neet/story-iaviDFZBYDzLKMFEEHdzdN.html

All suspects belong to the same family. A case of murder was registered at the Mahendra Park police station, the police said.Since the two families belong to different communities and there were apprehensions that the incident may lead to communal tension, police were deployed in the neighbourhood. Residents were asked not to believe in rumours ande, police officials familiar with the matter said. maintain peac“There is no communal angle in the incident. It was a fight between two families living in the same neighbourhood over playing loud music,” additional deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vikram Harimohan Meena said.The Delhi Police in a statement issued in the evening said the police control room received a call at 3.15 pm regarding a quarrel at a slum in Sarai Pipal Thala near the Adarsh Nagar Metro station’s gate number 4. A police team reached there and learnt that three brothers had been attacked with sharp weapons by five-six members of another family. The injured were taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital.One of persons identified as Sushil Chand,29, was declared brought dead at the hospital while his two injured brothers – Sunil and Anil – were out of danger. Anil’s statement was later recorded and both the injured were shifted to Safdarjung hospital for further treatment, the statement read. Locals told the police that Sushil Chand was sitting outside his home while loud music was being played inside. Around 3 pm, a family in the neighbourhood objected to the music. An altercation ensued and both the families started fighting, a police officer associated with the case said, requesting anonymity.“Five-six members of the neighbouring family stabbed Sushil and his two brothers multiple times with knives and fled. The victim’s family alleged that the suspects had planned the crime and loud music was just an excuse. We are verifying the sequence of events,” the officer said. Sushil and his brothers sold blankets on the road.Around a fortnight ago, communal tension gripped a neighbourhood in northwest Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar, not far from the spot of Tuesday’s incident, following the murder of 19-year-old Delhi University student, Rahul Rajput, who was beaten to death by the family and friends of an 18-year-old woman he was dating. The matter took a political colour as various political parties came in support of the victim’s family and demanded justice for Rajput. At least six people, including the woman’s brothers, were apprehended in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-killed-in-fight-over-loud-music/story-szxISGAI4ySyLiBr4nEjaI.html

It has now been decided to upgrade the biogas plant and establish effluent treatment plants for treating dairy waste and cow dung.The decision was taken in the meeting of the committee held under the chairmanship of mayor Balkar Sandhu at his camp office on Tuesday which was also attended by deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal.An official said that the authorities failed to find a suitable place for shifting the dairies in the nearby villages.

Superdari is handing over custody of something to a person till next orders. By way of this bond, the person receiving the vehicle gives an undertaking on his behalf or on behalf of the person who has authorised him, to produce the vehicle before the police or court, as and when required.In case no claims are received till November 3, the police have decided to start auctioning the impounded articles.Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said there are a lot of vehicles and other seized articles lying in the police stations as case property. The police have contacted the owners of the vehicles and other valuables to get the same released. People can contact the police station concerned with the court orders to claim their belongings on October 30.The police will release two-wheelers, four-wheelers, mobile phones, gold ornaments and other valuables confiscated under the law.“We are getting court orders for the process and also helping people through advocates. The advocates have been requested not to charge fees from the claimants,” said the police chief.At least 4,000 vehicles are dumped at police stations under different cases, including theft, snatchings and invalid documentation,” he revealed.Agrawal said sometimes people don’t come back for their vehicles because they either do not have any documents, the vehicle is very old or they have already taken claim from the insurance companies. “We will be auctioning the unclaimed articles from November 3,” he said.Hundreds of vehicles are dumped at 28 police stations in the city and in police lines compounds.Owners’ predicament Even as the police have urged people to claim their seized belongings, the task is quite complicated for some.Rahul of Tibba Road, who is a three-wheeler driver, said the police had impounded his second-hand auto around one and a half years ago. At the time, he had not transferred the vehicle ownership in his name to avoid the fee involved. But now he is unable to get it back. “As the vehicle is in police custody, the transport department is not transferring the ownership in my name. The auto is gathering rust and is already damaged,” he said.Wanting anonymity, a mobile shop owner on Pakhowal Road said burglars had stolen around 70 phones from his shop, including the ones that were under repair. Later, the burglars were arrested and around 20 phones were recovered from them, of which he managed to get back six new phones on superdari. He is not supposed to sell these phones till the case is under trial. “The phones I got back will be outdated soon and no one will buy them,” he rued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/space-crunch-ludhiana-police-to-auction-unclaimed-case-property-after-november-3/story-O6uDx3a6rRgFh34T39ZvFK.html

27-10-2020||Chandigarh||HARERA to issue restraint order on commission charged by property dealers||Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA), Gurugram, has decided to issue restraint orders to all real estate promoters and brokers, asking them not to charge commission arbitrarily in contravention of law. HARERA chairman KK Khandelwal said that promoters and brokers cannot charge commission higher than what is laid down in the Haryana Regulation of Property Dealers and Consultants Rules, 2009, made under the Haryana Regulation of Property Dealers and Consultants Act, 2008. Taking cognisance of the fact that property dealers were charging arbitrary commission from the sellers as well as the buyers of a property, a bench headed by Khandelwal and member SC Kush said that clause 10 of the Rules provides for 1% commission on agreed consideration value to be paid by the seller and purchaser of the property which is half per cent by each of them on finalisation of the deal. Khandelwal said that the property dealers and brokers were indulging in the malpractice in connivance with the promoters and charging arbitrarily more than the prescribed commission both from the sellers and buyers. “It has been reported that commission as high as 5% to 10% of the value of the property is being charged by the agent and the burden of this additional commission is ultimately shared by the allottee,’’ he said. The licences to the brokers and property dealers are granted by the deputy commissioner under the Haryana Regulation of Property Dealers and Consultants Act, 2008. The registration of the property dealer to negotiate real estate deal of a registered project is done by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority under Section 9 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and the registration is then granted subject to the condition that the real estate agent shall not contravene the provisions of any other law for the time being as applicable to him. “Accordingly, all real estate agents are hereby cautioned not to charge commission more than what is prescribed in the rules. Doing so will be deemed as an outright violation of the provisions of the law,’’ the chairman said. Khandelwal said that HARERA, Gurugram, was also in the process of prescribing a code of conduct for the property dealers to ensure that brokers do not indulge in any unfair trade practices. Instances have come to the notice of the Authority that certain property dealers were falsely representing the services of a particular standard or grade and making false or misleading representation concerning the services and approvals of the project. The real estate agents are also involved in issuing of advertisements of upcoming projects which are misleading to the public. The code of ethics will prescribe not only the additional books of accounts to be maintained by the property dealers so as to check whether the commission is being charged as per law and also keeping record of transaction which may be perused by the authority in case of inter se dispute between buyers and brokers, the chairman said. Khandelwal said it has also been noticed that some property dealers were indulging in sale of unauthorised colonies. A vigil is being kept on such brokers so that their registrations are cancelled and criminal/civil action, as per law, is initiated against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/harera-to-issue-restraint-order-on-commission-charged-by-property-dealers/story-Mp4eKFoVZa2dOQ3b14iwXI.html
27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Hooda ignored Baroda’s development when he was in power: Birender||Senior BJP leader and former Union minister Birender Singh on Tuesday accused former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda of ignoring Baroda assembly segment’s development during his regime. Hooda, in response, challenged the saffron party leader for a debate on development in the area.During his visit to Sonepat’s Gohana, Birender said: “Hooda had carried out developmental works in his home constituency Garhi-Sampla Kiloi and ignored the Baroda segment. Time has come that I and Hooda should retire from politics and stay home. This government will survive its five-year term and the people should elect BJP nominee Yogeshwar Dutt for development.” Reacting on three farm laws, the former Union minister said the minimum support price will not come to an end. “In 1967, the minimum support price (MSP) for wheat was ₹67 per quintal when a professor’s monthly salary was ₹280. Now, the salary of a professor is about ₹1.5 lakh while the MSP for wheat has gone up to ₹1,975 per quintal, which is very less. The governments have failed to increase the MSP and this is an attempt to boost farmers’ income,” Birender said.He said the Congress has six factions in Haryana headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, his son Deepender Singh, state unit chief Kumari Selja, Kuldeep Bishnoi, Randeep Surjewala and Kiran Choudhry. “If I were in Congress, I would led a seventh faction. There is no such thing in the BJP,” he added.Reacting to Birender’s allegations, Hooda said there was a long list of development works done in Baroda during his government and challenged the BJP for an open debate.“ The BJP has failed to carry out a single project in the state in the last six years and they have no moral right to seek votes in Baroda. The BJP government brought three anti-farmer laws to ruin the rural economy and farmers are forced to sell their crops below the MSP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooda-ignored-baroda-s-development-when-he-was-in-power-birender/story-AvcVUseamFBGOAMQGN1DQO.html

According to the state’s chief electoral officer HR Srinivasa, out of the 71 constituencies, 35 fall in Maoist-affected areas, which will restrict the standard polling exercise and will be carried out in a staggered manner.During this year’s round of electioneering in Aurangabad, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav was attacked with slippers while he was campaigning for his party’s candidate in the constituency ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. The attack took place when Yadav was sitting on the stage and was about to speak. While one slipper missed him completely, the other one landed in his lap.The Bihar assembly elections, seen as a mammoth exercise by political experts, will be the first in the country to be conducted by the Election Commission amid a raging coronavirus disease outbreak.The Commission has introduced several guidelines keeping the viral contagion in consideration. People have been instructed to wear a mask during all election related activities and thermal screening of everyone involved in the election exercises will be carried out by the EC officials.In a departure from the previous polling practices, only 1,000 voters will exercise their franchise at a particular booth, instead of 1,500 keeping the Covid-19 norms.

27-10-2020||Lucknow||Air quality depletes as UP records spike in farm fires, farmers fined||Amid depleting air quality, Uttar Pradesh reported a record number of farm fires on Sunday and Monday, according to satellite data observed over the state.According to the satellite data of NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which is also used by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), more than 734 incidents of farm fires were recorded on Sunday and Monday across the state. The reported incidents are at least 30 percent more than the average farm fires recorded this month.The UPPCB uses this data to monitor stubble burning incidents and alert respective district administrations. “The farm fire incidents were reported mostly from west UP districts where paddy plantation is more. Farm fires were also reported from some east and central UP districts,” said VK Singh, senior environmental engineer at UPPCB. He added that the incidents of stubble burning peaked because most farmers tried to clear their farms for the next crop by Dussehra.As per the system, most farm fires were observed in Saharanpur, Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Etawah, Bijnor, Baghpat, Hapur, Firozabad, Kanpur, Unnao, Badaun, Bareilly, Kannauj. Some farm fires were also observed in Rae Bareli, Ayodhya, Gorakhpur, Siddharthnagar, Pratapgarh, Amethi and Sultanpur districts.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput death - Rhea Chakraborty opposes sisters’ petition to quash FIR“Farm fires are recorded when farmers burn farm waste like stubble in their fields. Because the cultivation of paddy is more common in west UP and Terai belt, the satellite records more fire from this region,” said agricultural expert Ranbir Singh.Emissions by stubble burning are a major cause of air pollution. The increase in farm fires is reflected directly in the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the region. The daily AQI data released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded ‘very poor’ between the range of 301 to 400 over west UP on Sunday and Monday.The UPPCB is working closely with the respective district administrations to curb farm fires. A total fine of Rs 5 lakh has been slapped on over 100 farmers who were found burning farm waste this month. Around 30 farmers were fined on Sunday and Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/air-quality-depletes-as-up-records-spike-in-farm-fires-farmers-fined/story-nutTt18jT0BAeQ6joH3ZwJ.html
27-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Rhea Chakraborty opposes sisters’ petition to quash FIR||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, 28, has opposed the petition filed by Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, sisters of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, 34, for quashing the first information report (FIR) registered against them by Bandra police.In an affidavit in reply to the petition in the Bombay high court (HC), the actor has reiterated her allegations that Priyanka and Dr. Tarun Kumar, a cardiologist associated with Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in Delhi, had illegally prescribed medicines containing psychotropic substances, for the late actor without consultation.She has asserted that the FIR registered at Bandra police station at her behest, was required to be investigated thoroughly, as Rajput has ended his life barely within a week of receiving these prescriptions.According to her affidavit, Rajput had on June 8 received WhatsApp messages from Priyanka containing prescriptions, prescribing Nexito (5mg), Librium (10mg) and Lonazep MD (0.5mg), and all the three medications contain psychotropic substances such as chlordiazepoxide and clonazepam, as per the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.Chakraborty has asserted that since the allegations are serious, the investigation agency must be afforded sufficient opportunity to investigate the case.The HC bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnikhas, posted the petition filed by Priyanka and Meetu Singh for further hearing on November 4.In the petition filed through advocate Madhav Thorat, Rajput’s sisters have claimed that the medicines are not banned and the guidelines issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) on April 11, for telemedicine “allows the medicine to be prescribed to a patient even at the first consultation.”“A bare perusal of the complaint along with the FIR shows that the statements made there do not make out any cognisable offence,” the petition stated. The lodging of the complaint by Chakraborty was nothing but a feeble attempt on her part to scuttle the investigations against her and blame Rajput’s family members for his suicide, as she was on the verge of being arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB),” it further stated.No criminality could be attributed to the petitioners especially when the complaint was solely based on medicines prescribed by a doctor, it added.In support of their contention, they relied on a 2005 Supreme Court (SC) judgement in Jacob Matthew’s case, in which the apex court had held that no offence against a medical practitioner can be investigated without first obtaining the opinion of experts in the medical field.The petition also highlighted that there was an inordinate delay of 90 days in lodging the police complaint. The medicines were prescribed on June 8 – the day Rajput had asked Chakraborty to leave his house with her bag and baggage – but the complaint was filed on September 7.Rajput had died by suicide at his Bandra apartment on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-rhea-chakraborty-opposes-sisters-petition-to-quash-fir/story-Sy59sNeEnEDnBF6pJKVFgP.html

27-10-2020||Viral||Baba Ka Dhaba controversy: Blogger Gaurav Wasan refutes ‘fraud’ allegations||New Delhi Food blogger Gaurav Wasan, of Swad Official, who had shot the heartrending viral video of a roadside Malviya Nagar eatery, Baba ka Dhaba, to show the plight of an elderly couple, who run the place, has been accused by YouTuber Lakshay Chaudhary of running an online scam. In a recent video uploaded Chaudhary, it is alleged that Wasan had sought donations on the pretext of helping the poor couple, but did not transfer the donation money to Kanta Prasad, owner of Baba ka Dhaba. Now, in an exclusive chat, Wasan tells us that these accusations are based on hearsay, and he has not done any “fraud”.  Earlier this month, after the video of the couple, which was on the cusp of penury, had gone viral, people from all over the country had rallied in their support. This included various Bollywood actors, and soon after Delhiites started thronging to the food stall. Wasan, on being asked about the accusations of fraudulence, says, “I had given him (dhaba owner, Kanta Prasad) a check of Rs 2.33 lakh, and transferred Rs 1 lakh to his account, which completes the Rs 3.33 lakh that I had received as donation in his name. I’m in the process of arranging bank statements to prove the same.” Further refuting all claims of embezzlement, Wasan says, “All allegations that have been levelled against me are false. On October 9, I had assured Baba that his money was safe with me, and I have a proof of the same. I’m in the process of arranging bank statements to prove the same.”In the video that Chaudhary had released, he accused Wasan of going to give the money to the dhaba owners after he had released the video. He adds to his claims saying Wasan had collected over Rs 20 lakh in Baba’s name. Wasan, however, says, “I went to give the cheque to Kanta Prasad at 1pm the day when the video that had accused me was uploaded at 5pm... Also, if there were Rs 25 lakhs in my account, as alleged, there would be bank statements to support that claim. But there aren’t any!”   Inhe hamari help ko bahut zarurat he . . . #share #foodvideo #viralvideo #old #oldcoupleA post shared by  Gaurav Wasan (@youtubeswadofficial) on Oct 7, 2020 at 8:17am PDTResponding to the growing clamour on social media for proof of donations, Wasan says that he will put out all evidence in the public domain. “People who are asking for proof aren’t wrong in doing so, and I will put out all proofs necessary. These allegations have been made only to pull me down, there is no truth in them!” “I’ll soon be uploading all the evidences, and then people can themselves decide,” he concludes.

In this regard, Kumbh Mela administration has already given a presentation in New Delhi to officials of the union ministry of shipping. Kumbh Mela officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat said a communique has been sent to the union ministry of shipping. “As soon as the permission is granted, steps will be taken on priority to operate waterway services using hovercrafts or ferryboats,” he said. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, development and progress got affected in realisation of this inland water project. Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput death: Rhea Chakraborty opposes sisters’ petition to quash FIR“Mela administration is committed to making Mahakumbh 2021 a memorable experience for the pilgrims. Using river Ganga as a waterway will be a landmark development and a major attraction for pilgrims and tourists. It will also lessen traffic congestion on highway stretch and on inner roads, in particular during the festive baths,” said Rawat. Notably, union minister of state for shipping Mansukh Laxmanbhai Mandaviya, during his visit to Haridwar last year, had backed the hovercraft/ferryboat service on Ganga during Kumbh. Hovercraft and ferry boats can carry around 100-125 people in one stretch. Considering more than 8 crore pilgrims are expected to arrive during the 2021 Mahakumbh, alternative modes of transportation in and around Haridwar have gained significance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/hovercraft-ferry-boat-waterway-service-on-anvil-for-haridwar-mahakumbh-2021/story-X8aQ9CQIIgPq8PEkEoknVM.html

27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur condemns Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray’s remarks about Himachal being home to ganja||Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday came out in defence of Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut, who belongs to Himachal Pradesh, and took on his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray for his recent remark that the hill state was home to ganja (cannabis). “Himachal Pradesh is Dev Bhoomi and Uddhav’s remarks about the state are condemnable,” Thakur said, reacting to the Maharashtra CM’s derogatory comments. Kangana has been engaged in a war of words with the Maharashtra government ever since she compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Although Uddhav did not take any names during an address to Shiv Sena supporters on Dussehra, he indirectly attacked Kangana for painting Mumbai in poor light by calling it a hub of drugs despite the city being the source of her livelihood. Thackeray defended Mumbai Police and said, “Mumbai is PoK, there are drug addicts everywhere – they are painting such a picture. They don’t know in our house we grow tulsi (basil), not ganja. Ganja fields are in your state, you know where, not in our Maharashtra.” Kangana, who is at her Manali home at present, replied to Thackeray, saying, “Chief minister you are a very petty person. Himachal is called Dev Bhoomi as it has the maximum number of temples and zero crime rate. Yes, it has a very fertile land, it grows apples, kiwis, pomegranate, strawberries. One can grow anything here. You being a leader having such vengeful, myopic and ill-informed views about a state, which has been the abode of Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati along with saints such as Markandeya and Manu Rishi! The Pandavas spent a large part of their exile in Himachal Pradesh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chief-minister-jai-ram-thakur-condemns-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-s-remarks-about-himachal-being-home-to-ganja/story-MVAxbguIzKXDM8goPdivcJ.html

27-10-2020||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party eyes upcoming bypolls as springboard for UP assembly elections in 2022||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said his party is set on returning to power in Uttar Pradesh in the 2022 assembly elections and next month’s bypolls for seven seats will mark a beginning towards that goal. “The party’s target is the next Assembly election and its beginning is being made through the coming by-elections in which SP’s performance would be good. The next elections will decide the future of the country’s politics,” the party chief said. He said his party’s efforts would be to connect with the maximum number of people and claimed that the voters of UP are prepared to remove the current state government. The bypolls to seven assembly seats in the state is scheduled for November 3. As soon as the voters get a chance, everyone will see how this government is going to be defeated, the former chief minister said while welcoming members of different parties who joined the SP. Attacking the UP government for its performance on the law and order front, Yadav alleged that it hides the crime figures. There is not just one incident of crime against women but several that are being reported, he said. The 47-year-old also welcomed the Allahabad High Court verdict on cow slaughter and said it would have taken detailed information on it. The High Court had on Monday raised concerns over misuse of the anti-cow slaughter law in UP to target innocent persons and lack of forensic evidence to prove that the recovered meat is beef. “Anyone writing the truth faces the wrath and jail. FIRs have also been written against the journalists who had written the truth,” he said. Questioning the state government on its handling of the coronavirus pandemic which has claimed lives of ministers and officials, he said that now it is being said that we have to live with it. “If so, why are the facilities not being improved in hospitals,” he asked. The former CM also questioned the ruling party for its promise to double the income of farmers saying that it was a mere slogan. He wanted the government to disclose how many schemes of the more than Rs 40 lakh crore worth MOUs that were signed by it have actually taken shape. “This is a jhoothi sarkar against which people are coming together,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/samajwadi-party-eyes-upcoming-bypolls-as-springboard-for-up-assembly-elections-in-2022/story-2QntYOfgmNS0SzxYFeMpnM.html

As she accidentally ran into it on her way out, the glass broke into jagged shards and pierced her abdomen, killing her. If only the door was made of tempered safety glass made to Indian Standards specifications, it would not have broken so easily when Beena bumped into it and even if it did, it would have disintegrated into small, granules, thereby preventing any injury .It’s not as if state governments or the construction industry is unaware of the risks associated with the use of annealed glass in certain critical areas in buildings. In fact it was way back in 2007 that the Confederation of Construction Products and Services (CCPS), a non-profit organization, drafted the first set of guidelines on the selection of appropriate glass in modern buildings, to prevent glass related injuries and deaths. This was one of those private sector safety initiatives, but involving all stakeholders, including the government sector at the central and the state levels. The ‘Guidelines on the use of Glass in Buildings: Human Safety’ was thus an important milestone in the area of glass safety at a time when the use of glass in public, private and commercial buildings was increasing exponentially. The Guidelines of 2007 were reviewed and updated in 2009, 2013 and 2015 and throughout this period and even subsequently, concerted efforts were made by the Central Public Works Department, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (and even the Planning Commission at one stage) as well as CCPS to get the state governments to adopt the Guidelines . Many state governments did incorporate them, but it’s anybody’s guess as to how many states/local bodies are scrupulously implementing them and ensuring that only safety certified, tempered or laminated glass is used, as required under the Guidelines.Following Beena’s death, it was found that even though Kerala had adopted the 2015 Guidelines in its building rules, they were only applicable to multi-storeyed buildings!.The government has since issued a directive on compliance with the Guidelines in all buildings, but a PIL in the Kerala High Court has demanded that the building laws be amended.Hopefully, states that have not incorporated the Guidelines or are not enforcing the Guidelines strictly, will not wait for another tragedy, to rid all buildings of annealed doors, partitions and walls and ensure full compliance with the Guidelines. (The National Building Code 2016 also deals with human impact safety under ‘ Glass and Glazing’)I must also mention that since most ‘walk-through’ accidents involving see-through glass doors or partitions are caused on account of the impression of unimpeded path of travel created by them, the Guidelines also mandate incorporation of manifestations to make the glass visible. This is also an extremely important safety provision.Now in order to prevent the use of sub-standard or fake safety glasses in buildings, the union ministry of Commerce and Industry has brought them under mandatory quality certification. The Safety Glass (Quality Control) order says that safety ( tempered and laminated) glass cannot be sold or used without the mandatory ISI mark, indicating their conformity with IS 2553(Part 1) 2018: Safety Glass specification for architectural, building and general uses. This will come into effect from April 1, 2021.This will not only ensure the use of only quality certified safety glass in all commercial, public and residential buildings, but also help consumers using glass in their homes, particularly for partition and doors, to buy genuine safety glass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/incorporate-glass-safety-norms-in-building-by-laws/story-iiNp2oDKlw25bA0cYYr1VN.html

Daleep Singh Kunwar, senior superintendent of police (SSP), US Nagar said, “Illegal mining, as well as mining of more than allotted volume or area, will not be permitted at any condition in the district. To curb illegal mining, mining will not be permitted before sunrise and after sunset.” Illegal mining is rampant in US Nagar. Khatima, Sitarganj, Kichha, Bazpur and Kashipur are the main areas where illegal mining is witnessed throughout the year. People involved in illegal mining extract sand, stones and clay in abundance and mint money, leaving the area prone to flood and soil erosion in rainy season, said an official. The mining mafia is so powerful that sometimes when police or forest officials of the area concerned conduct raids, illegal mining operators don’t hesitate to attack them. They snatch dumpers, trucks and tractor trolleys if the police or forest officials seize them, said an official. Kunwar said, “Police will monitor mining areas round-the-clock where illegal mining is rampant. Officials of the department concerned will also accompany the police while raids are conducted in the future. Those found involved in illegal mining activities will be booked under the gangster act if they don’t mend their ways, as they are creating law and order problems.” “Apart from the government agencies, 23 mining leaseholders are operating in the district. Also, 77 stone crushers are in operation across the district. The department imposes penalties if it finds illegal mining activities or mining of more volume of the mining material,” said Amit Gaurav, district mining officer, US Nagar. On October 25, in a major action against the police for not taking action on illegal mining in the district, SSP US Nagar suspended ten police personnel - the entire staff of an outpost - and attached eight police personnel of another police outpost with the district police lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/crackdown-on-illegal-mining-in-uttarakhand-strict-curbs-on-mining-in-us-nagar/story-LcdM1tIRJ5pSZaZTMBeNDM.html

27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Cases have plateaued, focus now on vulnerable groups: Rajeev Arora||Additional chief secretary, health, Haryana, says testing has not gone down much as the government is still testing about 25,000 people dailyHow do you analyse the dip in coronavirus infection in the state? The surge in infection is followed by a stage of plateauing and decline. It’s a global and national phenomenon. Is the infection dip related to decreased testing? Not really. The testing actually has not decreased much. We are still testing about 25,000 people daily which is almost the same as in September and much higher than July and August. But why there’s variation in testing? With a reduction in the infections, the numbers of primary and secondary contacts of the infected patients have also declined. Thus, one sees a variation in sampling. So, how would you go about increasing the sampling? We are now focusing on groups who are more vulnerable to Covid-19 exposure, such as frontline workers, school teachers, industrial workers, people in commercial establishments and frequent travellers. See, we have been in favour of opening up economic activity right from the beginning and will continue with this policy as per the central government guidelines. Are you worried about a second wave during or after festival season? The propensity of people to lower their guard and shun safety measures is more during festivities. It all depends on human behaviour. Also, resumption of more activities like the opening of educational institutions, cinemas, multiplexes, entertainment parks, allowing social, religious and political congregations will contribute to the infection rate. That’s why we are focusing on these groups for targeted testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cases-have-plateaued-focus-now-on-vulnerable-groups-rajeev-arora/story-RVCrWRq7H1D6KrpiCQPjqI.html
27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Hope of virus curve flattening in Haryana marred by winter surge threat||The incidence of coronavirus infection in Haryana has seen a decline in the last four weeks, stirring optimism and hopes of flattening of the virus curve. Though the state reported 393 more new infections last week (Oct 19-25) as compared to the week before, the dip in the number of infections was more than 46% as compared to September 14-20, the week when Haryana reported an all-time high 17,616 viral infections. Nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, says the decline in the number of cases was expected. “We had a peak period in August-September. There is a trend — infection starts, picks up, gallops and then comes down. A lot of people are also not going in for testing nowadays,’’ Dr Chaudhary said. Asked whether the decline has something to do with the weakening of the strain of the virus, Dr Chaudhary said that they cannot comment on the virus strain as they do not have required data. “There was a significant community spread which took place. The positive cases reported were just the tip of the infection pyramid. There were a lot many asymptomatic patients than we know. There is a possibility that the virulence of the virus is reducing but we have no genomic data to ascertain this,’’ he said. The Covid-19 nodal officer said a second wave of infection is expected in the winters. “I am apprehensive because educational institutions are opening up. Also, winters, increased pollution and festival season can contribute to a surge. We will know where we stand by the end of November and early December,’’ he said. While the sampling using rapid antigen tests (RAT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for detecting new infections has also seen a decline in the past few weeks, health officials said that the variation is insignificant. Health officials though have maintained that the declining infection rate has outnumbered the reduced testing. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said the average per day tests were 11,238 in July, 17,339 in August, 26890 in September and 24,371 in October. “The sample positivity rate for October was about 4.9% as compared to 8.3% in September when per day testing was about 2,500 samples more than October,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hope-of-virus-curve-flattening-marred-by-winter-surge-threat/story-tZ9JdVA69YJHvtSa4061QM.html
27-10-2020||Pune||Social activist self-immolates in Kolhapur||A social activist who self-immolated in the premises of the Ichalkaranji municipal council office on Monday morning succumbed to his burns during treatment. Naresh Bhore (45), a resident of Shahpur, Kolhapur is survived by his ailing mother and two brothers, according to the police. “The immolation happened near the municipal council office which is in the Shivajinagar police station jurisdiction. His residence is in the jurisdiction of Shahpur police station. While the final decision will be based on the family’s complaint, the case will most probably be recorded at the Shivajinagar police station,” said Rameshwar Vainjane, the sub-divisional police officer of Jaysinghpur who is also handling an additional charge of Ichalkaranji division. The social activist raised the issue of corruption and cleanliness on various occasions with the local administration, according to the police. The police have now asked the local government to provide a list of the complaints that Bhore had made. “The bystanders tell us that he arrived in an autorickshaw, which we are yet to find, and was already doused in petrol when he entered the municipal council building. There was police bandobast at the main gate but he arrived through a small gate at the back of the building. He had suffered 50-60% burns but the burns were on vital body parts between head and stomach. His face and head were completely damaged,” said police inspector Ishwar Omase of Shivajinagar police station where the incident happened. He had warned the municipal council officials through a letter to the CO that he would take this step on Monday if they failed to intervene in an incident in his locality. “On October 18, a ‘ghanta gadi’ (garbage van) driver named Amar Lakhe was dragging a dead pig by tethering it to the vehicle. Bhore had asked him to put the dead animal inside the vehicle instead and it had led to a verbal fight where the garbage truck driver had hurled expletives at Bhore,” said police inspector Prakash Nikam of Shahpur police station where Bhore lived. His body was taken to IGM hospital in Kolhapur, but after preliminary care, they were asked to move to Sangli civil hospital for further treatment. At the Sangli civil hospital, Bhore was declared dead on Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/social-activist-self-immolates-in-kolhapur/story-DolYnf8WlYbDYGeboMcNDO.html

27-10-2020||Pune||Air travellers deal with rescheduling as night operations at Lohegaon airport shut down||Lohegaon airport’s tarmac is undergoing re-carpeting, which will go on for a year’s time. This has led to a lot of confusion among travel agencies who face the ire of passengers who have booked tour packages. Agents have also said that this will lead to a major blow to the aviation industry which has faced maximum losses in the lockdown and is now hoping to revive, but due to this work, will continue to suffer. Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents’ Association, Pune (TAAP) said, “This work could have been done when the pandemic was announced and the airstrip was completely shut. People have been frustrated in the lockdown and now want to travel. We have multiple bookings for Goa from Pune but we do not have a direct flight now. A road trip to Goa would probably take about 10-12 hours and a flight trip takes about 45 minutes. However, now there is no direct flight and now people have to opt for connecting flights to either Ahmedabad or Hyderabad which is about five-six hours depending on when the connecting flight is. Also, considering the business travel from Pune to Bengaluru and Delhi which was earlier in the wee hours, now it is almost impossible.” He explained that earlier an early morning flight from Pune to Bengaluru would leave at 4am and reach by 5am and so the person could go to the city, finish his or her work and then take a flight back to the city. “However, this is not possible now as the flight timings have been restricted from 8am to 8pm, including take-off and landing. Bengaluru Delhi routes have been affected the most due to this,” Bhansali added. Airport director Kuldeep Singh said, “The transition from night flight operations to day operations has been smooth. Passengers are happy about these timings and none of the flights has been cancelled. We operated about 13-15 flights at night which have all been rescheduled and none of them has been cancelled. This would not affect the Vande Bharat flights also which have been scheduled till December as they did not have any fixed schedule.” The official Twitter handle of Pune airport tweeted, “As per the flight schedule approved by DGCA up to 27th Mar 2021, only flights between 08:00am to 08:00pm are approved. Hence there are no flights between 08:00pm to 08:00am. These timings for flight operations between 08:00am to 08:00pm is likely to continue until October 2021.” The airport authority has said that this rescheduling has been done smoothly and that there is no cancellation of any flights, agents defer.Rohit Malusure, a travel agent who runs the Tourism Cafe said, “We are still getting updated schedules from the flight operators and even today the various websites of flight operators do show night flights which are likely to be cancelled. The passengers get last-minute messages and so it is a big mess especially when further planning is affected in case of connecting flights or the planned journey ahead. For example, I had a client who had to go to Chennai and from there go to Tirupati. They got a message that their flight is cancelled only a day before their flight. Yesterday evening we had to completely revamp the entire schedule from hotel bookings to their road travel from Chennai to Tirupati. We are not sure whether to take future bookings or not because of this uncertainty. All this has exposed the lack of coordination between flight operators and airport authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/air-travellers-deal-with-rescheduling-as-night-operations-at-lohegaon-airport-shut-down/story-hfDhDO48r4ZFAaqCaR5tRO.html

The festival on Sunday saw total 862 documents registered across 10 offices in the state with total revenue clocking in at Rs 5.07 crore. The offices were open despite being public holiday. Also, the reduction in stamp duty by the state government had a positive impact on the registration process. According to the registration office records, October (till25th) saw registrations of 2,14,274 properties wherein Rs 1,102.59 crore was generated until October 25 in Maharashtra. In 2019-2020, 1,93,695 properties were registered and revenue generation stood at Rs 2,234.6 crore for October, while in 2018-2019, as many as 2,38,779 documents were registered and Rs 2,280.81 crore revenue was generated. In 2017-2018, 1,49,249 documents were registered and Rs 1,948.51 crore was generated. The state inspector general of registration and stamps, Omprakash Deshmukh, said, “The registrars’ offices in Pune, Thane and Alibaug had sought permission to stay open taking into account the demand for real estate registrations in the area. It was a demand-driven exercise and we permitted them to function on Dusserah, an exercise which yielded good registrations and revenue which will drive up the real estate sector in the future.” Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments said that the return to normalcy is fuelling the need for housing which is being converted to demand. “As companies come to terms with the effects of the pandemic and the lockdown, the uncertainty around job security is rapidly lifting. This is leading to people buying homes this season,” Gera said. Jehangir Dorabjee, CMD, Dorabjee properties said, “The market is receiving a boost due to the auspicious occasion and as things are getting back to normalcy, buyers are stepping out with caution and taking their decision to buy properties. The market will improve further in the next few months as we inch closer towards vaccination. There is a strong renewed interest in buyers towards purchasing properties which is a positive sign of recovery.” The Covid-19 pandemic had a strong impact on revenue generations of the IGR which could garner only around Rs 250 crore for April when the average monthly earnings range from Rs 2,200 to Rs 2,300 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-property-registrations-outdo-2019-numbers/story-34MGRslxaRfKzvQtS8SwEI.html
27-10-2020||Pune||Dussehra drives rise in small car sales||The 2020 Dusserah festival saw a significant rise in car sales despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and interestingly, a majority of the buyers have preferred small cars. According to the Pune Regional Transport Office’s (RTO) new vehicle registration data, the total number of vehicles sold during the 2020 Navratri festival are less than last year’s Navratri, but the sales are on an upward rise. The revenue generation from vehicle registrations has increased by Rs 1 crore this year. Last year a total of 7,497 new vehicles were registered during the Navratri period with total revenue of Rs 30,63,62,859. Whereas this year the new vehicle registration has gone down to 6,454; but revenue increased to Rs 31,97,78,668, which means there is an increase of Rs 1,34,15,809 revenue this year. In the cars’ segment last year, a total of 2,000 cars were registered and this year it has risen to 2,338. “There is a considerable rise in car sales during the Navratri period compared to last year. And we have noticed that more than half of the new cars registered are small segment cars. So, it looks like people are now more concerned about their safety due to Covid-19, so they buy smaller cars to travel with family around the city,” said Pune deputy regional transport officer Sanjeev Bhor. Last year, 4,969 new motorcycles were registered, however, this year the number went down to 3,794. “There are two reasons for a drop in motorcycle sales this year. First, as colleges are closed, youth are not going to college and so parents didn’t buy vehicles for them this year. Another reason is due to labour workers. A majority of the workers use motorcycles to travel to their workplace and as they are not in town the sales are reduced this time,” added Bhor. The autorickshaw and bus sales have also reduced this year compared to last year. Talking about this year’s car sales Vaijayanati Shewade, general manager, sales at BU Bhandari cars said, “There was a very good response during the Navratri period in the last few days, as we sold out around 200 cars in this period. It is the best sale that has happened since unlock began and we are hopeful that until Diwali the sale of cars increases. People prefer to purchase a car now due to Covid-19 and want to travel safely.” BOX New vehicles registered by Pune RTO during Navratri period this year – October 17 to 25, 2020 Motorcycles – 3,794 Cars – 2,338 Autorickshaws – 43 Commercial vehicles – 218 Tourist taxis – 8 Buses – 3 Other vehicles – 50 Total – 6,454 Total revenue – Rs 31,97,78,668 New vehicles registered by Pune RTO during Navratri period last year – September 20 to October 10, 2019 Motorcycles – 4,969 Cars – 2,000 Autorickshaws – 321 Commercial vehicles – 297 Tourist taxis – 161 Buses – 36 Other - 34 Total – 7,497 Total revenue – Rs 30,63,62,859||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dussehra-drives-rise-in-small-car-sales/story-lzkVJPoAYo8iUCKKeqYhEL.html

27-10-2020||Election:||Anurag Thakur reminds Bihar voters of Gabbar Singh to keep ‘jungle raj’ away||Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Tuesday used the iconic ‘so ja bete nahi to Gabbar Singh aa jayega’ dialogue of the 1975 Bollywood blockbuster ‘Sholay’ to warn people against Bihar’s return to ‘jungle raj’ if the RJD was voted to power.Thakur, the Union Minister of State for Finance, asked people to be wary of parties who want to push the state back to the era of caste tension and social discrimination.“‘So ja bete nahi to Gabbar Singh aa jayega’. Mothers, who have seen the jungle raj days in Bihar, please do tell your children, especially youth, on the polling day to cast their votes carefully, otherwise they (the RJD) may return to power....those who ran a regime of terror and fear,” he told a press conference.Terming the RJD-led Grand Alliance a “depressed and confused” lot, Thakur reminded the electorate how a series of massacres along caste lines occurred in Bihar before the party now leading the coalition exited from power in 2005.Representatives of allies JD(U) and HAM were present at the press conference.“I just want to ask the RJD and its leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav why did he align with CPI(ML), tukde-tukde gangs, or those who believe in perpetrating massacres?” the union minister asked.“Do they want to bring the jungle raj days back in Bihar, or do they want the state to witness bloodshed once again?” Thakur wondered how will the people trust Tejashwi Yadav, the opposition alliance’s chief ministerial candidate, when he got even the photographs of his father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad removed from party’s posters and hoardings.The minister said Tejashwi also neglected his allies like the HAM of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, RLSP of former union minister Upendra Kushwaha and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of Mukesh Sahni. All of them were forced to leave the Grand Alliance, he said.Thakur exuded confidence that an NDA government will be formed in Bihar after the assembly election, particularly because the state’s image had undergone a drastic makeover under the “double-engine growth” powered by the alliance governments at the Centre and the state. He said the distinction between the 15 years of NDA rule and 15 years of Lalu-Rabri dispensation was clear from the per capita income, which stands at Rs 43,000 now against Rs 8,000 in 2005, the last year of the RJD government.The state’s growth rate has gone up from 3.5 per cent under the RJD to 11.5 per cent under the NDA government.Two AIIMS were set up in Bihar, besides central universities, engineering and medical colleges, power supply and road and rail connectivity were strengthened, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/anurag-thakur-reminds-bihar-voters-of-gabbar-singh-to-keep-jungle-raj-away/story-WcbImVGR0LiUbgIxgVvagI.html

27-10-2020||Delhi||AQI poor: Health conscious Delhi-NCR residents take to yoga, indoors||Since October set in, Capital’s air has gone for a toss impacting denizens. Those who were already fighting Covid-19, and staying indoors had started to come out only now, but no longer is that the case. The developing smog is enveloping Delhi-NCR yet again, discouraging many to not to venture out for their regular morning walks or jogs. Outdoor to indoor, in air purified environment “I’ve an early case of arthritis and was recommended regular, light exercises. I would earlier go to the neighbourhood park in my locality at least once every day to be able to do so. But now, breathing has become hard! Right in the morning hours one can see smog. So now, I’ve been staying indoors and doing yoga at home with an air purifier in the house. Health matters, especially during the time of a pandemic,” says Meenakshi Gupta, a resident of Noida. Yoga classes a hit, offline or online A few days back, one could spot hordes of people sprawled across various parks and gardens on a regular day, but now, many residents have taken to indoor yoga sessions amid rising pollution levels.Poonam Arora, from Priyasha Yoga Studio (for print - a Rohini-based yoga studio) in Rohini, informs that people are of late preferring to learn yoga indoors instead of an open space. “Yoga helps with breathing ailments which plague most Delhiites today because of the bad AQI. Since the situation has started worsening, I’ve seen an increase in number of people wanting to come to the studio, to keep their health in check. As far as the Covid-19 concern goes, I take special care of social distancing, screen everyone before a batch begins, and get the studio sanitised after every session!” An east Delhi based yoga instructor, Harendra Gautam confirms that demand for home visits for yoga classes have also increased in the recent past. “During this season, because of stubble burning, there are more cases of lung ailments reported by residents in Delhi-NCR. I’ve been getting requests for yoga classes from families and professionals who are working from home and earlier didn’t want to risk going out to the gyms, and now don’t feel like like going to open spaces or parks due to pollution. And there is definitely a more conscious realisation among people that yoga is helpful in keeping many diseases at bay,” he says.Health on priority? Yoga se hi hoga And some denizens have reverted to the virtual medium that they tried out at the start of lockdown. A Mehrauli-based yoga practitioner, Leelanand Thakur says he has been conducting yoga classes online for his patrons, which protects them from pollution induced ailments as well as builds their immunity to fight coronavirus. “Three of my clients had developed symptoms of coronavirus and through regular online yoga classes, they emerged unscathed. People are opting for virtual classes so that they can stay safe at home, and yoga does work wonders for their physical as well as mental health. Needless to say, it does benefit those having breathing ailments as well. So practising yoga amid rising pollution is of course a safe option indoors,” he adds.

27-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM’s son Raninder Singh doesn’t appear before ED, seeks adjournment in illegal foreign funds case||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s son Raninder Singh, who is also the president of the National Rifle Association of India, did not appear before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at its zonal office in Jalandhar on Tuesday, rather he sought adjournment in the matter. Last week, the ED had summoned Raninder in an ongoing probe into an illegal foreign funds case. Raninder’s lawyer Jaiveer Shergill said: “My client has sought adjournment as he is required to be present before the parliamentary standing committee for a hearing in connection with the Olympic Games, 2021.” “He has sought details from the ED of the case in relation to which he has been summoned as the summons issued are vague,” Shergill said. After Raninder didn’t appear before it, the ED issued fresh summons and asked him to appear before it on November 6. In August, the ED had filed three applications in a Ludhiana court for the inspection of new documents filed by the income tax department in the cases against the chief minister and his son. The matter is pending with the district and sessions court in Ludhiana. In July 2016, Raninder had appeared before the ED in the case and said he had nothing to hide. “I’ll attend the probe as they want me to as I have nothing to hide,” he said. ACTION UNDER FEMA ON I-T DEPT COMPLAINT The central agency initiated action against Raninder under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) after the income tax department filed a complaint in a Ludhiana court, saying he had lied under oath about trusts owned by him in Virgin Islands. In 2016, Raninder was summoned by the ED in connection with a FEMA violation. The I-T department said that Raninder misguided the agency by claiming that he did have documents related to the family’s income and trusts abroad. The I-T department alleged that Raninder was a ‘settler’ of Jacaranda Trust, which the family formed. Other undisclosed trusts include Mulwala Holdings Limited and Allworth Venture Holding Limited. Capt Amarinder Singh and Raninder also allegedly carried out ‘undisclosed’ financial transactions through a bank account in HSBC, Geneva, and HSBC Financial Services Limited (Middle East), the department said. The I-T department said the trusts were established in 2005 and most of the deals were routed through Virgin Islands. The agency submitted in the court that it has documents sourced from Virgin Islands that show Captain Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder as owners of Marine Mansions in Dubai and other properties in the United Kingdom. Both Amarinder and Raninder have denied any wrongdoing and termed the charges false.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-s-son-raninder-singh-doesn-t-appear-before-ed-seeks-adjournment-in-illegal-foreign-funds-case/story-uaG5IsQMs2tizo7pOi7fxK.html

27-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC revives plan to set up desalination plant for potable water||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities plan to set up a desalination plant near Gorai beach following a growing need for an alternative potable water source due to changing patterns of rainfall. The desalination plant will purify seawater into potable water.Maharashtra minister for environment Aaditya Thackeray on Monday gave a go-ahead to the project and has directed the BMC authorities to prepare a feasibility report by reviving the civic body’s 2007 plan.The 2007 desalination proposal was meant to provide an alternative water source owing to poor rainfall in the catchment areas of the dams that supply water to Mumbai.Later in 2016-17, the BMC had initiated the process to set up two desalination plants – one in south Mumbai and other either in the suburbs or anywhere in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The plants were supposed to have a capacity of processing 100 million litres per day (MLD) of seawater into potable water. However, later, the project was put on hold due to high cost.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC, said, “The cost for a desalination plant has been optimised because of evolution of technology. The cost of construction of the plant is the same as that of a dam. It is estimated to cost around Rs 1,800 crore to construct a 200 MLD plant.”“We had to find a sustainable solution because of changing patterns of rainfall. We cannot go on constructing dams by cutting trees. We need a back-up plan,” he added.At present, seven lakes such as Bhatsa, Vaitarna, Middle Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tulsi, Tansa and Vehar supply drinking water to Mumbai. The lakes are located in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The civic body supplies 3,750 million (m) litres (l) of water daily, as compared to the demand of 4,200 ml.BMC officials said they would collect seawater samples from the west coast in north Mumbai for setting up the desalination plant. Initially, a pilot project will be undertaken, which will cater to 5% of Mumbai’s drinking water needs, and later the capacity will be successfully augmented to 200 MLD.“A suitable plot will be considered for the project on the west coast as the Port Trust authorities own land on the east coast. We plan to acquire a plot owned by the government owing to the cost factor,” said a BMC official, requesting anonymity.The BMC has zeroed in on a plot near Gorai beach for the project. However, a final call will be taken after the submission of the feasibility report. “An Israeli company has been tasked to submit the feasibility report, which was involved in a similar 650 MLD-capacity plant in Israel. It will take around three years to construct the plant,” said Velrasu.Dubai is the first city in the world to construct a desalination plant. Chennai, which has three such plants, had constructed its first project in 2003 that supplies 90 MLD of water to the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-revives-plan-to-set-up-desalination-plant-for-potable-water/story-OicYLsDVvAOedaySUvhlgK.html

Over 10,000 people are directly connected with this industry in the state.Also Read: Ankle bells are key to classical dance forms such as Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathak, and Manipuri.Bells from Jalesar also adorn temples in Kashi, Mathura, and Ayodhya, among other religious places across the country.The raw material used for making these bells such as mud, white powder, and brass of premium quality is found in abundance in Jalesar.“We have been working towards reviving the [ankle bell] industry and providing a platform to the dying art under the ODOP scheme,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, micro small and medium enterprises, and export promotion, Uttar Pradesh.He added the government has come out with a plan to promote, preserve, and develop the lesser-known, but exclusive products of each district globally. “Under the ODOP scheme, the state government is providing free training and making necessary equipment available to artists to promote indigenous products. As part of this project, around 1,000 youths have been trained,” Sehgal said.Officials said loans worth Rs 350 crore have been provided to artisans from 75 districts across the state under the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-powered-by-odop-jalesar-s-ghungroos-get-global-market/story-gvuyu9eWS2GRVCYM0naoIJ.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation mayor to meet Hindu Rao doctors as their strike continues||North Delhi municipal corporation mayor Jai Prakash will be visiting the striking doctors of Hindu Rao hospital at 11 am today. The doctors have been on strike for 22 days and on hunger strike for four days now. Doctors from the four other North Corporation-run hospitals, as well as senior doctors for the hospitals and dispensaries, who were holding off their strike, also joined in on Monday. The mayors of North, South and East Delhi corporations protested outside the chief minister’s residence on Monday, demanding that the Delhi goverment cleared the dues of Rs 13,500 crores so that the salaries of doctors and other healthcare workers could be paid. A statement from North Corporation late on Monday said, “He (health minister Satyendar Jain) has assured that all the dues pending of all the three municipal corporations with the Delhi government would be cleared in 10 days. So all three mayors called off their sit-in dharna.” Also read | Fresh row between govt, corporationsAAP has, however, insisted that the Central government owes the corporations over Rs 12,000 crore. Meanwhile, amid the political row over funds owed to the corporation, doctors from at least 12 government hospitals in Delhi – run by Delhi government and the Central government – have decided to either go on a two-hour pen-down strike to stop non-emergency work between 10 am and 12 noon today or protest with a black ribbon in the hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. “This time, we will not take the strike back even if we are paid the salaries of a month or so. We need a permanent solution, we cannot come back on the street every few months to demand our salaries. The last time we were paid was in June and that too, after our resident doctors went on strike and we joined in with a pen-down strike,” said Dr Maruti Sinha, general secretary of Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-north-corporation-mayor-to-meet-hindu-rao-doctors-as-their-strike-continues/story-2WsIRXn9tcc8K2uYZoi8aO.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Despite marginal improvement, Delhi’s air remains ‘very poor’ for fifth consecutive day||Despite marginal improvement, Delhi’s air quality remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Tuesday morning as per the data uploaded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading at 8am was 336.Though this is a marginal improvement from Monday’s AQI reading of 353, Delhi’s overall air quality is in the ‘very poor’ category for the fifth consecutive day.Air quality enters the ‘very poor’ zone between the 301-400 mark and crosses over to the ‘severe’ zone after exceeding 400.The improvement in air quality is mostly due to meteorological factors. According to the forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), while pollution levels showed a marginal spike on Monday, wind speeds improved through the day and its impact is likely to be experienced on Tuesday.“The pollution load was lower today [Monday] as compared to the last few days and the wind speed improved from 6kmph to 12 kmph during the day. Since CPCB’s evening bulletin is a 24 hour-average AQI figure, we will be able to see the impact of the winds from Tuesday,” said Vijay Soni, head of IMD’s Environment Monitoring Research Centre.The improvement in the air quality will, however, be temporary. Scientists said that from October 28, the AQI reading will be pushed back to the ‘very poor’ range and will remain in the danger zone till the end of the month.An analysis by the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) also suggests that stubble burning continued to contribute to Delhi’s foul air on Monday.“Safar-synergised stubble fire counts again increased to 1,275 on Sunday. The Safar model estimate of stubble burning share in PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) is 16% for Monday. While the expected slight increase in local surface wind speed is a positive sign for Tuesday, improved wind speed is not forecasted to stay longer,” the Safar air quality analysis read.Meanwhile, temperature is also set to dip this week in the national Capital. According to the forecast by IMD’s regional meteorological centre, Delhi;s weather will largely remain dry, and there will be a gradual decline in the maximum and minimum temperatures by 2°-3° C in the next three or four days. Delhi has been recording below-normal night-time temperatures for at least a week now.Till Tuesday morning, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 32.8° C which was one degree above the normal, and a minimum temperature two degrees below normal at 14.4° C. This is likely to dip further as November approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/despite-marginal-improvement-delhi-s-air-remains-very-poor-for-fifth-consecutive-day/story-oRtuUyV4OY7yo2BpDeq1qM.html

It sends a wrong message to the profession and the nation. It demoralizes the entire doctor community,” IMA said in a press release.IMA stated that the Supreme Court of India had specifically directed that salaries of doctors and health care workers should be paid in time, and non-payment of salaries by Hindu Rao Hospital is an adequate reason for the Court to initiate suo moto contempt proceedings against the administration of the hospital.“IMA demands that the authorities should pay the salaries of the doctors along with the dues immediately,” It added.Resident Doctors’ Associations of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) Medical College and Hindu Rao Hospital went on an indefinite hunger strike on Friday against non-payment of salaries during the Covid-19 lockdown.

27-10-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Why Delhi needs to ramp up testing again||After appearing to drop for a second time, new infections of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi have started rising again over the past two weeks. This spike in cases has come hand-in-hand with a steady rise in the positivity rate, suggesting that the outbreak may be expanding again. A rising positivity rate typically suggests that a region is testing inadequately. The positivity rate should drop to 5% or below if the testing programme is adequate and is keeping the outbreak in control, according to the World Health Organization. That is why testing enough, and using the right kind of tests, is the key to Delhi being able to control the outbreak in the next few weeks.1. A distinct third surge in new infections The case trajectory in Delhi shows three distinct surges. The first started in mid-June, and peaked when the seven-day average of daily cases, also known as the case trajectory, touched around 3,400 in the last week of June. This dropped to about 1,000 a day by the end of July. It remained in that range for a month, and the second surge started towards the end of August, rising till the middle of September, when average daily cases touched 4,174 – the highest the case trajectory has been so far.A strong upward trend is now visible for a third time. Average cases have been rising for 13 straight days – from 2,661 on October 12 to 3,663 on Friday. The rising graph of cases in the city – days after it was starting to come under control – has come right at the heels of the festive season, and is being attributed to more people coming out of their homes, poor mask discipline, and lack of adherence to safety protocols due to Covid fatigue. 2. Low testing caused drop between 2nd, 3rd surgesAfter the first peak ended,and the daily cases went down to 989 (August 5) and positivity rate to 5.8% (August 13), Delhi appeared to make a crucial mistake by easing off on testing, instead of ramping up further to suppress the virus.This led to a gradual increase in positivity rate over time, and consequently in daily cases, prompting the situation to reach a point on August 26 (1,693 cases, 8.5% positivity rate), when chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held an emergency meeting and decided that the rate of testing would be doubled from 18,000-20,000 daily. This was a crucial intervention -- on average there were a just little over 20,000 tests being conducted daily at the start of September, and by September 20 this was up to nearly 60,000 tests -- leading to a spike in cases (since more tests were being conducted) but bringing down the positivity rate. The average positivity rate over time dropped to as low as 5.3% for the week ending October 8.But after touching its peak, tests started to drop again – for the week ending October 9, daily tests were down to 47,612 from the September 20 high of nearly 59,368. October 9 was also the day when the case trajectory dropped to its lowest – 2,574 new cases a day. When placed alongside each other, it is evident that the dip in average daily testing has heavily influenced the drop in average daily infections being reported. 3. Low RT-PCRs led to numbers being suppressed A key concern even as the Delhi government increased its testing at the start of September was that much of it was through rapid antigen tests, which are cheap, easy to deploy, and give results within 15 minutes. Due to this, the proportion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered by experts as the “gold-standard”, dropped significantly in the overall test numbers.In the first 15 days of September, while overall testing rose, the share of RT-PCR tests nearly halved – from 32.3% for the week ending September 1 to 17% for week ending September 16. This may have suppressed the real positivity rate because rapid tests gives high “false negatives” (labelling infected people as uninfected). .The share of RT-PCR tests, however, has started rising again. In the past week, 28.2% of all tests have been RT-PCR. And this rise has overlapped with the rise in daily cases in the city since fewer positives are being missed. According to the Harvard Medical School, the reported rate of false negatives in antigen tests could be as high as 50%.  4. Rising positivity rate points to a big problemThe positivity rate for Covid-19 has started rising again, with 6.8% samples tested in the past week coming back positive (this is the highest in nearly a month, since 6.95% on September 27). The number was 5.88% the week before, and 5.49% the week before that. On Sunday and Monday, it went as high as 8.17% and 8.23%.Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with an increase new cases, indicates that the virus is spreading fast. Testing needs to be increased again to flatten the curve Delhi’s rising case rate has come right at the start of the festive season. The fact that it is coupled with the positivity rate increasing is further indication that cases may continue to rise.The silver lining is that testing is moving in the right direction. Both total tests and RT-PCR tests have increased – in fact the city has set new records for RT-PCR tests three out of the last five days. But if the objective is to bring the overall positivity rate below 5%, and keep it there for at least two weeks to suppress the virus, the time to increase tests in now. Any figure above 7% means that,even if tests may be up, Delhi is again not testing enough. Unless the number of tests is scaled up, with the share of RT-PCR tests staying high, matters could get out of hand again for the first hot spot in India that almost managed to contain its outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-delhi-needs-to-ramp-up-testing-again/story-D6makGLAUzBXmtk2JDV8oN.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Man arrested 2 days after body found in a bed box||The police on Monday arrested a suspect in connection with the death of a 27-year-old man, whose body, bearing multiple stab wounds and injuries caused by a blunt object, was found inside a bed box in his rented flat in north Delhi’s Sant Nagar near Burari two days earlier. The suspect, Salman, was the suspect’s childhood friend and flat partner. Both are from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. Salman works as a mason and was employed with Malik, who was a building and manpower contractor, deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said. During interrogations, police said, Salman confessed and told police he killed his flatmate, Sameer Malik, following an argument over two months’ salary the latter owed him. Salman had moved to Malik’s flat around three months ago, a police officer associated with the probe said. Since Salman was missing, a murder case was registered and he was marked as the prime suspect, because he was missing. The police raided his possible hideouts and caught him from Morabadad. During the interrogation, Salman told the police that Malik had not been paying his salary for the past two months. On Friday night, the DCP said, the two consumed liquor in the flat and got into a fight over the payment issue. “During the scuffle, Salman stabbed Malik and hit him with a brick, because of which he died. Salman put Malik’s body in the bed box, locked the flat, and fled,” said Alphonse, adding that the knife and brick used in the crime were recovered from Salman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-arrested-2-days-after-body-found-in-a-bed-box/story-H0oJyqlKiOLORUEFBVOILK.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the chef for the evening||He’s away from home, and never thought he would have to cook a whole meal by himself.In his early 20s, Rohit Kumar describes himself as a labourer. “I’m currently living with 8-9 saathi (colleagues),” he explains. “And this is our kitchen.”He shows, on the footpath, the two burner cooking gas range, the red LPG cylinder, the half-filled bottle of mustard oil, the three metal pans, the red mug, the spatula, the plastic basket filled with ginger, garlic, onions and masala packets, and the half-empty packet of atta (flour).Mr Kumar is sitting on his haunches, in the middle of all this equipment, wearing a t-shirt and shorts. His face is half-covered with a red check gamcha—perhaps a substitute for the mask. He is speaking in a muffled tone, and one has to strain one’s ear to hear his words.Mr Kumar is part of a “gang of workers”, laying out underground cables for a telecom company in this part of south Delhi. Indeed, a great mass of cables is lying in loops next to a big truck, parked on the same pavement. The men have been staying here for a week. “We set up our base in one spot for a few days,” Mr Kumar explains, “and sleep at night inside the truck, and when the work in one area is complete, we drive to the next spot.”All the labourers, including Mr Kumar, are from Lucknow, in UP. But where are the rest of the folks this evening?“They still have to return from work.”Mr Kumar explains that he is the cook at the moment. Each worker in the group performs this duty in turn, and these days it is Mr Kumar’s task to feed his colleagues.He has already made a few rotis.“At home my mother cooks, but I never thought of learning from her.” After pausing for some moments, he solemnly says, “I never thought that one day I would have to make dal chawal.” He picked the skills in real time, though. “Earlier, my rotis would never be gol (round)... but after some practice I got better.”The menu usually consists of dal, rotis, rice and subzi. Tonight, however, Mr Kumar is skipping dal. “I’m making aloo gobhi with rassa (gravy)… it will be nice with rice.”He starts measuring the masalas—his mates will be here anytime soon.An hour later, the footpath has grown dark but one sees a bunch of men huddled together, quietly having their meal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-chef-for-the-evening/story-pJ6Rkhxgey2aq8r8n9Cc5I.html

27-10-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly election 2020: Campaigning for 1st phase ends||Campaigning for 71 seats that go to the polls in the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections ended on Monday with key leaders locked in a bitter verbal war to shore up their prospects in the southern districts, many of which are ravaged by decades of Maoist violence. A total of 1,066 candidates are in the fray – 114 of them women – in the first phase of the polls that will also decide the fate of six sitting state ministers. Roughly 24.5 million people will vote across 31,380 polling stations.The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is contesting 42 seats and its ally Congress is fighting on 21. The Janata Dal (United) has fielded candidates in 35 constituencies and its ally Bharatiya Janata Party is contesting 29 seats.The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which decided to part ways with the NDA in the state while remaining a part of the ruling coalition at the Centre, is fighting on 41 seats.Chief minister Nitish Kumar addressed meeting at Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, which go to the polls in second phase on November 3. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav addressed more than 60 rallies focused on constituencies going to the polls in the first phase. In meetings at Arwal and Nokha – which go to the polls on Wednesday -- LJP chief Chirag Paswan trained his guns at chief minister Nitish Kumar and his flagship governance promise of Saat Nishchay (seven resolves).“Saat Nishchay is a scheme formulated by him. We will get it probed after an LJP government is formed. And if found guilty, the chief minister will also go to jail,” he said.At Nokha in Rohtas district, he also alleged the chief minister “lied” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he built drainage systems and streets, and provide piped water to everybody in the state. “The chief minister says there is no corruption in Bihar, whereas the corruption in Saat Nishchay is the biggest in the history of state” Paswan alleged. The NDA hit back and asked the LJP chief to maintain “decency” with state minister Sanjay Jha likening Paswan to “a monkey dancing to someone else’s tunes”.“Some people indulge in conspiracies during elections. They want to make a dent in the NDA. On one hand, they criticise chief minister Nitish Kumar but on the other they praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said BJP chief JP Nadda in a rally in Aurangabad.At Sakra in Muzaffarpur, Kumar pitched for continuance of development carried out by his government for the last 15 years. “Some leaders get publicity and eyeballs by talking against me. Let them do it. I am not interested in taking any publicity. I have worked for Bihar and will continue to work for the state, if given another chance,” he said. After the rally, a slipper was flung at Kumar by some protestors; three men were arrested by police.Addressing women, Kumar said his government was the first to give reservation to women and institute schemes to provide cycles for girl students. “We have built thousands of schools’ buildings, round the clock electricity, better health services and all weather roads for better connectivity with block headquarters as well district headquarters,” he added.Addressing rallies at Purnia and Aurangabad, Nadda said India, under the leadership of PM Modi, and Bihar, under Kumar, were progressing rapidly. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar have emerged as the synonyms of development whereas RJD and Congress leaders are indulged in playing spoiler politics,” he said.Nadda cited the revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, to underline that the NDA was committed to “One nation, One rule” principle. “We have removed all obstacles in the making a grand temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya,” he added.Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad exhorted the people to give another term to Kumar for the sake of progress and prosperity of Bihar. “We are doing politics over development” Prasad said.Yadav continued his attack on Nitish Kumar at Rohtas, alleging the CM could not provide employment and set up industries in the last 15 years. The RJD leader also claimed that things were better for the poor under his father and former CM, Lalu Prasad. “When migrants got stuck, where was his chopper? Then he said, stay where you are,” he added.

27-10-2020||Chandigarh||UT employees’ housing scheme: CHB high-rise proposal needs amendment in master plan||Even as the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) plans to offer a 10-storey option under the UT employees’ housing scheme, there is no provision under the current buildings laws and rules of the city to allow such building heights. The UT urban planning department has intimated the same to CHB. “For allowing these many floors in a multi-storey building, amendments in the zonal plan and Chandigarh master plan would be required. Currently, there is no provision for such building heights under the UT laws and rules,” said a senior official, who didn’t want to be named.In a bid to reduce the rates of flats under the scheme, CHB has developed two project options — seven-storey and 10-storey buildings. A 10-storey construction would reduce the land needed for the scheme. As the major cost component of the project is high price of land, reduction in area requirement is expected to bring down the cost for the applicants, say CHB officials.Currently, discussions on these two options are going on with the urban planning department. The department is yet to give consent to any of the two options.On the question if there are no provisions under the city laws and rules to allow 10-storey building project, then why CHB is pursuing such an option, CHB chief executive officer Yashpal Garg said, “After these designs get the nod of the planning department, we will access the revised cost of the project. In case the revised cost for allottees comes lower than the current costs, we will request the competent authority to allow for one-time amendments in the rules and permit the 10-storey project.”The process to reassess and revise the cost of the project started after the August-19 meeting between UT administration officials, employees’ representatives and ministry of home affairs officers. The meeting was chaired by the Union home secretary to discuss all matters regarding the housing scheme.In the meeting, it was decided that the rates will be calculated again for different categories by considering various factors such as floor area ratio, collector rate and plotted area in consultation with the representatives of petitioners of UT Employees’ Housing Scheme court case.The much-delayed schemeAround 4,000 flats were to be built in Sectors 52, 53 and 56 by CHB for government employees as a part of a scheme launched in 2008.A draw of lots was held in 2010, wherein 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around ₹57 crore with CHB under the scheme.Later, the scheme was shelved and then revived after the employees took up the matter with city MP Kirron Kher. But the ministry of home affairs allowed the administration to transfer the land to CHB at the current collector rates.With this, the apartment costs shot up to ₹50 lakh for Category D, ₹1 crore for Category C, ₹1.64 crore for Category B and ₹2.08 crore for Category A.When the scheme was announced, the rates were only ₹34.7 lakh for Category A, ₹24.3 lakh for Category B, ₹13.53 lakh for Category C and ₹5.76 lakh for Category D.The employees then moved the high court, alleging that CHB was charging five times the initial price for land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-employees-housing-scheme-chb-high-rise-proposal-needs-amendment-in-master-plan/story-xNeLOiIU7VIpm3XuO3DTUN.html
27-10-2020||City||Externment order cannot be on non-existent criminal complaint: Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC) set aside an externment order issued by the police on the grounds that the decision was vitiated, as the authority did not take cognisance of the acquittal of the externee. The court observed that as the externment order was based on a case that did not exist against the externee, it was not valid.The division bench of justice SS Sinde and justice MS Karnik, was hearing a plea challenging an externment notice issued to Ganesh Bajantri by the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) zone 7. The notice issued on October 8, 2019, stated that Bajantri had been externed from Mumbai and Thane for some months for a crime he had committed eight months ago in Mulund, stated the externee’s lawyer advocate Ganesh Gupta.Gupta informed the court that the DCP’s externment order was confirmed by the division commissioner on December 2, 2019. He further submitted that though his client had responded to the show-cause notice before the externment notice was issued in his name, the externment was not paid heed to. He further submitted that while no reason was stated for the externment, Bajantari was acquitted of the crime. However, the authority did not take cognisance of these facts nor did it follow due process, and hence the externment order deserved to be quashed. The additional government pleader said that the externment order was justified as there were three other complaints registered against Bajantari that were pending investigation. After hearing the arguments, the court observed that the externment authority had overlooked facts and not followed due procedure, and hence it was set aside the order.“The externing authority has proceeded on the footing that the offences are registered against the petitioner under Chapter 16 and 17 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code), when as a matter of fact, there is no offence registered against the petitioner under Chapter 17 of the IPC, which shows total non-application of mind in passing the impugned order. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the externment order is also vitiated on the ground that live nexus between his activities and the necessity of externing him has snapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/externment-order-cannot-be-on-non-existent-criminal-complaint-bombay-high-court/story-icyTrA0y05GuBF4QOi276N.html

27-10-2020||City||Uncertainty prevails over additional water supply to Mohali||The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed by six months the project of Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to get additional supply of five million gallon daily (MGD) from Phases 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks.However, senior officials say even after the completion of the water treatment plant, which is coming up at Mohali’s Singhpur, there is uncertainty if the city would get additional water or not owing to an interstate dispute of water between Haryana and Punjab. According to the agreement between Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh in early 80s, it was decided that in order for any state to get additional water, all states will have to give their consent. However, Haryana has now refused to give water to Mohali.The previous project deadline was December 2020, which has now been pushed to June 2021.Mohali is short of 10 MGD water and the demand shoots up to 12 MGD in summers. Punjab department of housing and urban development principal secretary Sarvjit Singh said there were some issues with Haryana, “but we are hopeful of resolving them and will make sure that we get the water”.Another official of GMADA said the delay was due to shortage of specialised workers. “The work is going on in full swing now and we expect to complete the project by June next year,” he added.The construction work of water treatment plant at Singhpur was already delayed as there were some issues whether to construct a plant for 5 MGD or 20 MGD supply, but GMADA has now decided to go with the latter option. The cost of the project is ₹100 crore, which will be developed by a Vadodara-based company.Chandigarh, meanwhile, has already started getting its additional 35 MGD water under Phases 5 and 6, wherein 40 MGD pipelines were laid in October last year.For past several years, Mohali has been reeling under acute water shortage as the gap between demand and supply in the city stretches up to 10 MGD.MC councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who had filed a case in the Punjab and Haryana High Court regarding shortage of water in Mohali, said, “It is unfortunate that public is suffering for years. It is insensitive on the part of the administration that it is in no hurry to complete the project. It will take at least one more year for Mohali to come out of water shortage.”Delayed projectIn May 2012, GMADA had started laying pipelines to supply 80 MGD water to Mohali district and Chandigarh from Kajauli waterworks at a cost of ₹200 crore of which, ₹100 crore was borne by Chandigarh.Under the 5 and 6 phases, 40 MGD water will be supplied (35 MGD to Chandigarh and 5 MGD to Mohali). GMADA is yet to build the water treatment plant and lay pipes. Presently, Mohali gets 10 MGD water from Kajauli waterworks and 10 MGD from 75 tubewells.About Kajauli waterworksKajauli waterworks is located on Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Rupnagar district from where water requirement of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir are met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uncertainty-prevails-over-additional-water-supply-to-mohali/story-jo3V5A413a2W1fGuDGXlNK.html

Students will have to get consent from their parents or guardians before they are allowed to come, and officials are expecting about 25% of the students of government schools to show up once physical classes resume. Schools have also been asked to find out some alternative with permission from the UT district education officer (DEO) such as flexible, staggered and reduced timings in order to ensure physical and social distancing in case there aren’t enough rooms to accommodate the students. Schools will also have to reset their academic calendar and redefine the school attendance and sick leave policies.Meanwhile, private schools are still not willing to open from November 2. President of the Independent School Association, HS Mamik, said, “We will conduct a new survey on November 2, asking parents if they are willing to send their children to school. If we get a response of over 50%, we will open, otherwise we will wait for some more time.”The SOPs also mention other general instructions for schools to ensure the emotional well-being of students as well as the role of teachers in promoting the emotional health of students. There are instructions to create a learner-friendly school and classroom environment and provide assistance to children with special needs.Earlier, schools were opened for academic consultation from September 23. While around 1,500 students were coming to the 93 government schools that were open, private schools reported almost negligible attendance during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-schools-asked-to-prepare-own-sops-for-reopening-from-november-2/story-9d7NlWlVgtHlPLEUuJyDCK.html

So far, 286 fatalities have been recorded in the state. Shimla recorded 31 deaths in September while 29 people have succumbed in October so far. Kangra Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Gurdarshan Gupta said the reason for the high death rate in Shimla and Kangra was that Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College (RPGMC), Tanda, and Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC), Shimla are tertiary Covid care centres where serious patients from other districts are referred for treatment. Dr Gupta said of the total deaths recorded in Kangra, around 33% were people from other districts. The Covid tally in Shimla has reached 2,196 and the district is on fifth position in terms of cases. Shimla saw an exponential rise of 284% in Covid cases in September while in October cases grew by 68%. If cases continue to increase at this pace, the district will soon be among the top three worst-hit districts.

Adopt humane approach towards patients: CM to doctors Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur called on doctors to ensure communication with Covid patients as it goes a long way in recovery of the patients. Thakur on Monday reviewed the Covid situation in the state virtually with district police chiefs and deputy commissioners. He emphasised the need to ensure timely treatment of patients, as it has been found that around 90% of deaths reported due to Covid took place within 24 hours of patients being admitted in health institutions. The chief minister said senior doctors must visit Covid patients admitted in the hospitals so that patients get a sense of security. He urged the doctors to adopt humane approach in treatment of patients. “Elderly people and patients with co-morbidity must be paid special attention as their condition could deteriorate rapidly,” he said. Thakur directed health officials to ensure regular medical check-ups of the people who have opted for home isolation and it has been felt that they rush to hospitals only after their condition worsens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shimla-records-highest-covid-deaths-govt-anticipates-rise-in-cases-in-winter/story-5n3UfoHr2vhg3UC8oUPs5H.html

27-10-2020||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Dr Anand Teltumbde directed colleagues to run campaign against his implication, NIA charge sheet claims||Prior to the Supreme Court (SC) directing academician and activist Dr Anand Teltumbde to approach the Bombay high court (HC) for anticipatory bail in January 2018, he allegedly had asked his colleagues to run a campaign against his implication in the case. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is investigating Teltumbde for his role in the Bhima Koregaon case mentioned Teltumbde’s plans in the charge sheet filed against him earlier this week.Teltumbde’s name in the probe surfaced during the initial probe by Pune Police. As his name emerged from various materials seized from the other accused, Teltumbde moved courts up to the Apex court, but received no order in his favour, first for quashing of the case and later for anticipatory bail. He finally had to surrender before the NIA in April this year. However, in January 2019, when the SC asked Teltumbde to approach the HC afresh for anticipatory bail, he allegedly began garnering support from various groups, to stall his implication.In a mail retrieved by forensic experts of the NIA, Teltumbde had addressed members of the Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights (CPDR), Maharashtra. The mail is part of the NIA charge sheet. “You all know I have been out but now my days of freedom are coming to an end. I have been given four weeks to seek pre-arrest bail and as per the lawyers, it needs the backing of a visible campaign to be created in my support by a cross-section of people,” the mail stated.It suggested that the members garner support for him by various means. “It may be a signature campaign, writing mails and letters to the president, prime minister, chief minister of Maharashtra, issuing statements, writing newspaper articles, etc,” Teltumbde suggested in his mail, adding that it needed to happen as soon as possible. Teltumbde has been accused of being the key conspirator and key member of the CPI (Maoist) group. “Teltumbde is a senior member of CPI (Maoist) and is working in urban areas. He was the general secretary of CPDR and a member of Anuradha Ghandy Memorial Committee (AGMC), both front organisations of CPI (Maoist),” the charge sheet filed by NIA mentioned.The agency claimed that his role in the Bhima Koregaon programme, which led to widespread violence in January 2018, was very much appreciated by the central committee of CPI (Maoist) and he was directed to keep the flame ablaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-dr-anand-teltumbde-directed-colleagues-to-run-campaign-against-his-implication-nia-charge-sheet-claims/story-awKRppskSf5PTTvTufoz1M.html
27-10-2020||City||Mumbai outage: Maharashtra minister directs officials to review city’s islanding system||State energy minister Nitin Raut on Monday asked officials to review Mumba’s islanding system and upgrade it for the future. At a meeting held at the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) in Airoli, Raut questioned Tata Power officials on its failure to island Mumbai during the power outage on October 12. The islanding system is unique to Mumbai as it separates the city’s supply from the rest of the state in case of a power grid failure. According to a statement issued by his office, Raut also said that if Mumbai was the Prime Minister’s residence and if the Parliament was in session, he would not have heard any excuses. Last week, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Authority (MERC) also ordered a probe on the incident. “Tata Power, during the hearing (with MERC), provided details on how reduced and insufficient embedded generation in Mumbai over the past few years have led to over dependence on interchange power from outside through transmission system and has made islanding concept unworkable. MERC said better load management by SLDC at Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (MSETCL) Kalwa receiving station could have saved Mumbai from the power outage. At the hearing before MERC, Tata Power suggested for a complete relook of the present islanding concept and design with the help of Western Regional Power Committee (WRPC) and Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay’s (IIT-B) Civil Engineering Association (CEA) and other experts to ensure the robustness of system and continuity of 24X7 power to Mumbai citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-outage-maharashtra-minister-directs-officials-to-review-city-s-islanding-system/story-e2oTRMI8nDVbqTj4JTn5tJ.html

The decision came after union’s Haryana president Gurnam Singh Charuni and his associates met Ambala Range IG Y Puran Kumar and Ambala superintendent of police (SP) Rajesh Kalia. He said that police officials invited them for talks before the rally and sought some more time to investigate the matter.“They’ve told us that two different samples have been sent to Sonepat’s Khanpur and Karnal’s Madhuban and till October 29, reports can’t arrive. They said that the rally date is closer and till then, the investigation can’t conclude,” he added. “They’ve asked for one month for the process and have assured us that till the reports arrive, there will be no arrests in the case. We’ve given them more than a month and decided to organise the same mahapanchayat on December 10 at the same place,” Charuni said. IG Kumar said the cause of death of the farmer was their main concern and the investigation can’t conclude without the reports. “So, we have assured the farmers that no arrests will be made till then,” he added. This was the second round of meeting with the IG on the matter. Earlier, Charuni had met him with senior union leaders at the SP office on October 15, a day after an FIR amounting to murder was registered at Naraingarh police station against seven farmers, including BKU’s Ambala chief Malkit Singh.A 72-year-old farmer, Bharat Singh, of Shahzadpur area had died during BJP’s tractor rally led by Kurukshetra MP Naib Saini and Ambala MP Rattan Lal Kataria in Ambala’s Naraingarh.

27-10-2020||Mumbai||Second FIR against Cox & Kings after IndusInd Bank alleges ₹284-crore fraud||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the city police has registered its second first information report (FIR) against global tours and travel company Cox & Kings based on a ₹284-crore fraud complaint filed by IndusInd Bank. The executives of the firm have been booked for payment default, cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery. The FIR, filed on October 23 after a complaint by Audley Thomas Luis, vice-president, IndusInd Bank Ltd, names 10 people as accused – Ajay Peter Kerkar, CEO and group director; Urrshila Kerkar, ABM Good; Anil Khandelwal, Abid Khan, Subhash Nautiyal, Sagar Deshpande, Ajit Pimplikar, Rashmi Jain and Arup Sen. Sagar Deshpande was found dead in mysterious circumstances on railway tracks near Titwala, 55km from Mumbai, on October 12. His name will be dropped at a later stage if he is found not guilty, said an EOW official. The FIR was first registered at Andheri police station and was later transferred to the EOW’s banking unit-2 for investigation. The first FIR was filed after a complaint from Kotak Mahindra bank, alleging defrauding of ₹170 crore. EOW is also carrying out preliminary inquiry into a third complaint of ₹1,030-crore fraud filed by Axis Bank. According to EOW sources, in February 2015, promoters and directors of C&K approached IndusInd Bank and requested a commercial card facility on an unsecured basis. The bank approved it with a limit of ₹25 crore on personal and corporate guarantees. The card limit was later increased to over ₹350 crore over a period of three years. “For initial years, things went smoothly, however, since June 2019, IndusInd Bank observed that C&K defaulted on its payments like GST and TDS. IndusInd bank then immediately cancelled cash credit and bank guarantee to C&K,” said an EOW official. However, as per the complaint, C&K defaulted on repayments and the total amount crossed over ₹250crore. EOW has already issued lookout circulars (LoCs) against six accused as they were previously named in the Kotak Mahindra Bank case. C&K and some of its office-bearers are also under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) lens. ED had in June carried out searches at five locations connected to C&K in the Yes Bank case. Cox & Kings had reportedly borrowed ₹3,642 crore from Yes Bank. ED had arrested Anil Khandelwal, CFO of Cox and Kings Group, and Naresh Jain, internal auditor of Cox & Kings Group. According to ED, C&K is accused of routing the money from Cox & Kings, Ezeego and its other entities into shell companies and siphoning it off abroad. The irregularities and misappropriation of funds were confirmed after the banks – SBI, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank -- did their forensic audits. The banks informed the RBI, the apex bank, and then approached EOW. Cox & Kings, too, has lodged counter complaints. Promotor Kerkar lodged two FIRs blaming directors, CFO and other executives of his companies for siphoning off the money and framing him. Investigations in these complaints are also underway. Responding to queries, Kerkar said, “It is indeed surprising that an FIR would be registered against me when I have already registered an FIR against IndusInd for cheating Cox & Kings as early as the 3rd of September.” IndusInd Bank spokesperson said, “The bank declared the account as fraud on December 30, 2019 and filed a complaint with the appropriate regulatory agencies...The Bank has initiated legal proceedings and filed its claim with the Interim Resolution Professional appointed under insolvency proceedings initiated before National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai.”Cox and Kings’ statement given by Kerkar“With reference to the cash balance we have a registered FIR against IndusInd bank and officials for knowingly portraying a false picture of our cash balances as of March 2019. The bank had falsely claimed that there was no Lien on these cash balances and has given our statutory auditor a no dues certificate to attest to this fact. We feel that this was done to dupe credit agencies, the board of directors of Cox and Kings and other lenders into believing that the actual financial health of the company was better than it actually was. This was done as Indusind has profited by several hundred crores in terms of illegal fees charged to the Cox and Kings group through credit card charges and they were resolute in their desire to perpetuate this income stream. However they have recently stated that this was a mistake and they have copies of a true certified copy of a finance committee meeting provided by Rashmi Jain the ex Company Secretary stating that we had asked for a temporary overdraft of several hundreds crores which they agreed to. There was no finance Committee meeting ever conducted. It is inconceivable that the bank would have made a mistake on giving a confirmation for several hundred crores. It is pertinent to note that we have no proof of any board minutes or finance committee meetings that authorised requests for further limits from IndusInd bank. Ms Rashmi Jain and Anil Khandelwal have both admitted to the PwC audit team that was commissioned by the COC Of Cox and Kings that no finance committee meetings were recorded for two years. It is therefore surprising how Indusind has possession of these minutes when clearly Mrs Jain has already stated that there were none in existence. The conspiracy of the KMP of Cox and Kings is evident from the fact that the accused CFO of Cox and Kings Ltd, i.e. Mr Anil Khandelwal and accused Mr Naresh Jain; Internal Auditor did not report the debt of Rs. Six hundred crores incurred due to credit card transactions to the Board of Directors of Cox and Kings limited. The accused Anil Khandelwal and the accused Arvind Kumar Singh and other unknown officers of IndusInd perpetuated a massive fraud on the other lenders, Board of Directors of Cox and Kings Ltd, the statutory auditors (DTS and Associates) and the shareholders of Cox & Kings Ltd. by giving a confirmation of unencumbered cash lying in Indusind bank account of Cox and Kings Ltd amounting to Rs. Six hundred two crores as of the 31st of March 2019. The accused officers of Indusind Bank gave this confirmation to DTS and Associates, the statutory auditors of Cox and Kings Ltd physically at the Indusind BANK branch. The confirmation given by Indusind Bank to the statutory auditors of Cox and Kings Ltd confirms that no dues are pending from Cox and Kings Limited to IndusInd Bank as of the 31st of March 2019 concerning any loan and or credit facility and a balance of Rs 74 crores is held in the Fixed Deposit account of Cox and Kings Limited and the balance of Rs 602.58 crores is the deposit credit lying in the current account of Cox and Kings limited with IndusInd Bank. The said confirmation, given in May 2019 to DTS and Associates the Statutory Auditors of Cox and Kings Ltd clearly shows the complicity of the accused Bank Officers in the aforesaid crimes.” Kerkar added that the said manipulated confirmation was given by the accused officers of the Bank to the statutory auditors of Cox and Kings with a malafide intention to keep the promoters/directors/shareholders and other shareholders in the dark so that the fraud perpetrated by them in collusion with the KMP of Cox and Kings is not exposed. “The fraud played upon the promoters, and other stakeholders of Cox and Kings as well as Ezeego is not only limited to them. The scam has been virtually played upon the stakeholders of Indusind Bank also. The fraud is evident from the facts that to cover their dirty tracks, the management of Indusind Bank gave misleading confirmation of credits balance to the Statutory Auditor of Cox and Kings. To bolster the misleading credit balance confirmation, Induslnd credited the bank accounts of Cox and Kings with approximately Rs. Five hundred thirty-five crores on the 31st of March 2019. When the aim of misleading the statutory auditor of Cox and Kings was achieved, IndusInd Bank, debited the said Rs. Five hundred thirty-five crores back to its own account on the next working day, i.e. 2nd of April 2019.”The bank’s replyIndusInd Bank spokesperson said, “The Bank does not comment on matters that are under investigation. The Bank is cooperating and working with all investigating agencies with regard to the ongoing Cox & Kings investigations. The Bank declared the account as fraud on December 30, 2019 and filed a complaint with the appropriate regulatory agencies. The Bank has also initiated necessary legal proceedings against Cox and Kings and others, and filed its claim with the Interim Resolution Professional appointed under insolvency proceedings initiated before the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai. We would like to reiterate that IndusInd Bank conducts its business with the highest level of compliance to legal and regulatory requirements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/second-fir-against-cox-kings-after-indusind-bank-alleges-284-crore-fraud/story-e49jsBBcwlnatm4YDnkdLN.html

27-10-2020||Chandigarh||LAHDC polls: BJP wins 15 out of 26 seats, Cong gets 9||Amid strong resentment over the sixth schedule and the anti-BJP wave, the saffron party managed to clinch 15 seats in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) polls, the results of which were declared on Monday evening. Of the 26 constituencies, BJP won 15—three less than 2015. Congress took home nine seats —three more than last time, while two independent candidates won. Resentment against the BJP could be gauged from the fact that the sitting chief executive councillor (CEC) Gyal P Wangyal could not retain his seat from Sakti constituency. It was wrested by Congress’ Rigzin Tsering with a thin margin of 20 votes from AAP’s Urgain Phuntsog. On October 3, Wangyal had said, “People of Leh are in favour of the BJP . I am confident that the BJP will make a clean sweep”. The Leh Council has 30 seats, of which four candidates are nominated. ‘A mandate against the BJP’ Former BJP minister and ex-president of BJP’s Ladakh unit Chering Dorjay said, “In my opinion, this is a mandate against the BJP. In 2015, they had won 18 seats and this time around they have won 15. There is strong resentment against the BJP. They have lost their strongholds, such as Upper Leh.Their CEC P Wangyal lost Sakti. Phyang and Temisgam constituencies also went to Congress.” “Congress has improved its tally with nine seats and I think it was a big defeat for Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, the BJP MP and party chief of Ladak. Though 14 seats are required to form the council and numbers are on the BJP’s side but denial of sixth schedule and Wangyal’s performance did not go down well with the people,” said Dorjay. “The BJP has somehow succeeded in saving its skin. Had the people of Ladakh been happy with BJP, the party would have made a clean sweep,” he added. P Wangyal was unavailable for comments. BJP’s Ghulam Mehdi won the Turtuk seat by defeating independent candidate Ghulam Hussain with a margin of 367 votes. BJP’s Kunzang Lotus won the Hundar seat by defeating Congress’ Stanzin Chotar with a margin of 420 votes. The BJP managed to sweep all the five seats in Nubra valley, which has a significant Muslim population. The BJP and Congress had fielded their candidates in all 26 constituencies while the Aam Aadmi Party fielded 19 candidates. As many as 23 independent candidates were also in the fray. Leh demands sixth schedule The people of Leh have been demanding constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule and on September 28 former BJP minister and ex-president of the BJP’s Ladakh unit Chering Dorjay had cautioned the Centre of a sustained campaign in case the apex body was hoodwinked. Apex body of the People’s Movement, an apolitical body, has been demanding constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule of the constitution to Ladakh on the lines of north-eastern states. The umbrella group includes political parties, religious organisations and the all-powerful Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association. The safeguards guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers. On home minister Amit Shah’s assurance,the delegation withdrew its call to boycott the polls.  Thupstan Chhewang, the former BJP MP, had resigned from his post and primary membership of the party in November 2018 as the BJP had not granted UT status to Ladakh and had not fulfilled other promises made by the BJP in the 2014 general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lahdc-polls-bjp-wins-15-out-of-26-seats-cong-gets-9/story-lJzF4TAQwydFCYcS4ojk9H.html

27-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP hits back at Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray over his Dussehra rally remarks; NCP, Congress back him||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray slam-med the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Narendra Modi government during his annual Dussehra rally, the party hit back at its ally-turned-foe, terming the Shiv Sena and its chief “an opportunist and betrayer”. BJP on Monday held two press conferences and at least three other senior party leaders issued statements attacking Thackeray over his remarks. In response, leaders from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the ruling alliance of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, spoke out in support of the state’s chief minister. While former chief minister and BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Narayan Rane said Thackeray has “no right to talk about Hindutva” as he has ditched it in his quest for power, party legislator and former Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar said, “Thackeray’s Hindutva has been adulterated after he joined hands with Congress and Nationalist Congress Party and changed the ideology like changing a shawl.”“Thackeray’s speech in his Dussehra rally was a great flop show on OTT platform. His utterances in the rally were under pressure from the attack on his government...,” said Shelar. “He has criticised BJP over Hindutva, but he has no right to utter a word. Our Hindutva is like skin, while Sena has used it like a shawl. Whenever needed, they have changed it conveniently to acquire power.” “Thackeray has been saying he does not need any certificate for his Hindutva from us, but he will need it because of the adulteration in his ideology after going with Congress and NCP,” Shelar said. Thackeray in his Dussehra rally on Sunday had said instead of toppling non-BJP governments in states, BJP should protect their government at the Centre as the “mood of people was changing at national level”. Thackeray said his father the late Bal Thackeray’s Hindutva was not about “clanging bells and utensils” and “BJP must learn Hindutva from its ideological fountainhead, RSS”. Shelar said Thackeray’s bluster about attempts to topple his government has come out of his insecurity. “He has dared us to topple the government, but as we have said in the past, we dare him to run the government efficiently and step out of the house to understand the people’s hardship. He said BJP leaders were nowhere on scene when Babri Masjid was demolished. I want to ask Uddhavji where was he on the day of the high drama in Ayodhya,” he said. Rane, meanwhile, said Thackeray boasts of his father’s ideology, but entire Maharashtra knows how he was harassed and disobeyed during his last days. “He would never have made Uddhav chief minister of the state,” said Rane. The BJP MP alleged involvement of Uddhav’s son and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and said he will soon be arrested. Rane, however, did not substantiate his claim and said it’s for the investigating agency to find out. Thackeray found support from his allies NCP and Congress. Minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik, without naming Rane, said his language for the CM and malicious reference about Aaditya was not dignified. Congress leader and public works minister Ashok Chavan said what Thackeray said about BJP’s attempt to topple state governments of other parties was right and they support him on his stand. Sena’s Ratnagiri legislator and higher and technical education minister Uday Samant slammed Rane. “Maharashtra has a culture to speak in a respectful way about its leaders. Such statements and references to our chief minister in a disrespectful manner are not in our culture. Our chief minister has maintained restrain and he is extremely popular among the people. After this press conference, people will reaffirm their faith in Uddhavji Thackeray and stand with him,” said Samant.State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, also from Sena, said “Rane should get himself medically checked”. “Entire Maharashtra knows the history and geography of Narayan Rane. Looking at his appearance in today’s press conference, I think he should get his medical check-up done. If you try and spit on the sun, it lands on your face, and this is what has happened with him. One must learn the true understanding of patience and restrain from our young leader Aaditya Thackeray,” said Bhuse. The BJP also questioned Sena over its Hindutva as they have allied with Congress, which had insulted Vinayak Damodar (Veer) Savarkar. However, Sena, in a counter attack, asked why is the BJP-led Central government not awarding Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour, to Savarkar. BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam said Thackeray gave a “lesson on Hindutva” from Savarkar Memorial during Sena’s Dussehra rally. “Question is why he didn’t utter a single word of praise for Veer Savarkar. Probably, he is afraid of new friends, who have been repeatedly using derogatory remarks against Veer Savarkar,” said Kadam.Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said there is no change in party’s stance on Savarkar. “Sena never changed its stand on Veer Savarkar. Whenever an inappropriate comment was made to insult him, we stood by him. We’ve always had an emotional connect with him. Those criticising us must answer why they didn’t give him [Savarkar] Bharat Ratna. They have been in power for six years,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-hits-back-at-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-over-his-dussehra-rally-remarks-ncp-congress-back-him/story-WyGQ82gS3NWHuiMLt8oxhM.html
27-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government seeks constitution bench to hear Maratha reservation case||State public works minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee for Maratha reservation, said that the state government would request the Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday to hear an application made by them to vacate the stay on the quota before a constitutional bench. Chavan said that the application is scheduled for hearing before the three-judge bench which had on September 9 initiated the interim stay on reservation to the Maratha community in jobs and education. The bench had admitted the request by the Maharashtra government to hand the case over to the constitution bench.“The hearing to decide on the interim stay has been scheduled for Tuesday before the three-judge bench. We are going to request the Apex court to hold the hearing before the constitution bench instead of the bench which had stayed the reservation. Our request for the formation of the constitution bench is pending before honourable Chief Justice of India,” Chavan said.The state has argued that the interim stay was unfair as it has halted the admission and recruitment process in the state. The government also contended that in none of the other reservation cases transferred to the constitution bench, was a stay ordered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-seeks-constitution-bench-to-hear-maratha-reservation-case/story-6wA87Bz5NKIESsQONcTzvM.html

27-10-2020||City||DU row refuses to die down||New Delhi: The controversy over the appointment and transfer of senior officials at the Delhi University refuses to die down with officials indicating that vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, who is on sick leave since July, wanted to attend a meeting which is at the heart of the issue.The meeting of the executive council, the highest decision making body, was scheduled for October 21 and, according to members of the body, the V-C had expressed his willingness to join the meeting. However, Tyagi did not attend it and the meeting was chaired by pro vice-chancellor PC Joshi. The central institution had plunged into an unprecedented crisis last week with two rival groups -- one led by pro vice-chancellor PC Joshi and another backed by Tyagi -- appointing their nominees the new registrar simultaneously. While the Joshi group claimed that the nominee of their rivals did not have the backing of the executive council, the other group had removed Joshi and appointed Geeta Bhatt as the new pro vice-chancellor. The October 21 meeting had cleared the appointment of Vikas Gupta as the new registrar, hours after the group backed by Tyagi appointed PC Jha to the post. This raises questions over Tyagi’s leave of absence which has been a bone of contention during the ongoing power tussle in DU. Last week, the education ministry had nullified the appointments of interim registrar PC Jha and pro vice-chancellor Geeta Bhatt by the vice-chancellor on the grounds that he was on leave and could not take such decisions without the ratification of the executive council. According to retired professor Rajkumar Bhatia, who is also the Visitor’s nominee to the executive council, pro-vice chancellor PC Joshi had informed the members during an October 10 EC meeting that Tyagi had wished to attend the meeting. Joshi refused to comment on the matter while Tyagi did not answer requests for a response. “During the October 10 meeting, Joshi said he got a message from the V-C, saying that the latter wanted to attend the meeting. Following this, there was nearly an hour-long break and the pro V-C went to meet the V-C. According to Joshi, the V-C called for postponement of the meeting and said he would preside over the next meeting which would be held after 10 days,” said Bhatia. The next meeting was scheduled for October 21. Executive Council member Rajesh Jha also confirmed the sequence of events that took place on October 10. “We protested against the cancellation of the meeting because important agenda items were pending since the last EC meeting in March. Joshi told us that the meeting was cancelled out of deference for the V-C since he was retiring in March and this may be his last meeting. He also assured us that the next meeting (to be held on October 21) would not be cancelled,” said Jha. Commenting on the current state of affairs in the university, Jha said, “The current fight is for control of the university among the different factions of the ruling establishment. It is about influencing selection of the next V-C and not about the registrar,” said Jha. “The tussle can further dilute the eroded autonomy of the university,” he said. He also said that day-to-day functioning of the university is getting affected due to the feud. “Proposals and files are getting stuck because everybody is waiting for the turmoil to die down. Decisions taken during the meeting are also in limbo,” he said. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “While the admissions have kept us busy, all of this leaves an impact psychologically. The issue has become a talking point and everyone is worried as these kind of flip-flops haven’t happened before. We feel that this was not in good taste because the image of the institution has been tarnished and there is uncertainty all around. Besides, if the V-C said that he wanted to attend the meeting on October 21 and later postponed it due to other work, why the hurry? Why couldn’t they wait for two days to discuss the important agenda items?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-row-refuses-to-die-down/story-u6wy8GQwUD7yooNBOyNZnN.html
27-10-2020||City||4 months on, only 256 pet owners turn up for registrations in Ludhiana||Four months after the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) commenced the registration of pet dogs and cats in the city, only 256 residents have come forward to complete the formalities so far. All 256 are dog owners and no cat owner has turned up so far. This even as the deadline to complete the procedure is fast approaching.After December 31, if the pets are found without registration, the MC will be slapping a fine of Rs 4,000 on the owner, besides charging Rs 100 a day for the upkeep of the pets which will be taken into custody till the formalities are complete. Post registration, residents will be charged Rs 400 annually for one pet. At present the civic body does not have a count of the number of pet dogs in the city but it is planning to carry out a drive in the month of January to catch the violators. MC senior veterinary officer, Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “Residents can either visit our website mcludhiana.gov.in or visit MC’s zonal offices to get their pets registered. They will be asked to fill pro forma, giving details of the pet as well as the owner. The owner will also need to submit a copy of his/her Aadhar card. The brass tokens, which have to be tied around the pet’s neck, can be collected from the MC Zone office near Mata Rani Chowk.”Dr Dhalla further said in case of ferocious dogs, the owner must cover the pet’s face with a muzzle while taking it out for a walk. He added that so far only, 188 of the 256 residents who have registered their pets have collected the tokens. “If any dog is caught without registration, the owner will have to pay Rs 100 a day to the MC which will take care of the dog till the registration is done. The owner will also have to bear the expenses if the pet bites anyone,” said Dr Dhalla.Mayor Balkar Sandhu asked residents to get the registrations done on time to avoid penalty. He said that the registration will also help the civic body and residents to identify and locate the pet easily if it is lost or stolen. A helpline number 8437535700 has also been issued by MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-months-on-only-256-pet-owners-turn-up-for-registrations-in-ludhiana/story-wPcFBWKXjVCHB9YYIduVMN.html
27-10-2020||Kolkata||Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee put on ventilator; dropping platelet count worries doctors||Veteran Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee was put on ventilator on Monday afternoon while his platelet count dropped, which was ‘worrying’ said doctors. “We had to protect his airway. Around 3 pm we put him on endotracheal intubation. His consciousness was not doing well. There was an increasing chance of aspiration. Secondary pneumonia was there,” Dr Arindam Kar, who is leading a team of doctors treating the thespian, told media persons. The octagenarian actor had tested positive for Covid-19 on October 6 and has been hospitalised at a Kolkata hospital since then.“The only worrying part was that his platelet count went down along with gastrointestinal bleeding. We have consulted haematologists and all precautions were being taken. Measures to improve his platelet count and correct the overall coagulation function so that the bleeding stops were also taken,” he said. Doctors, however, said that Chatterjee’s blood pressure was stable and that his cardiac and liver functions were also doing well. “The overall situation, considering the patient’s comorbidities, seems to be stable,” the doctor said. One of the most celebrated actors in Bengal, Chatterjee has received many awards and honours including the Padma Bhushan, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, National Awards and Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna. He is best known for his collaboration with Oscar-winner Satyajit Ray and the Feluda series.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/veteran-actor-soumitra-chatterjee-put-on-ventilator-dropping-platelet-count-worries-doctors/story-TCe6ML2M6yJ4RIK0ZAoYNI.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Resident doctors from eight Delhi, Central govt-run hospitals to join north MCD docs’ strike||Resident doctors from at least eight hospitals, run by the Delhi and central governments both, have decided to go on a “pen-down” strike for two hours on Tuesday.The doctors will not perform any non-emergency duty between 10 am and 12 noon to support doctors from Hindu Rao and other North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run hospitals who have been on strike for 22 days and on hunger strike for the fourth.Doctors from Delhi government-run hospitals like Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Maharshi Valmiki, Bhagwan Mahavir, and Sanjay Gandhi Memorial hospitals have given a notice for a two-hour pen-down strike. Delhi government hospitals like Lok Nayak, Guru Teg Bahadur, and Rajiv Gandhi Super-Speciality that are dedicated for treatment of Covid-19 will join the protest wearing black ribbons.Central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia, Lady Hardinge Medical College, and Northern Railways hospitals will also go on the two-hour strike, while Safdarjung hospital has come out in its support.“We are coming out in support of resident doctors from North corporation-run hospitals. Something needs to happen. The resident doctors have not been paid for four months and this time we are demanding a permanent solution, so that they do not have to go on strike every few months,” said Dr Sandeep Yadav, president in-charge of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) too has come out in support of the doctors.In a letter, the IMA has said, “The issue of non-payment of salaries of doctors in Hindu Rao hospital is a case of systemic failure. Doctors who have served the nation during the corona pandemic deserve appropriate accolades and incentives. It defies logic that they have to resort to roadside agitations to get their legitimate salaries.”Over 2,000 senior doctors from five hospitals and all clinics and dispensaries run by the North Corporation have also joined decided to join in with the residents and go on indefinite strike. The doctors all went on a mass casual leave on Monday.“We have given enough time to the corporation to pay us. We were last paid our salaries for June. We even deferred our strike by a week so that patients do not get inconvenienced, but we still haven’t received our salaries. We cannot keep coming back to the streets every few months to demand pay. We will not accept just one month’s salary this time — we want the administration to tell us in writing what solutions are being explored to resolve the problem once and for all,” said Dr Maruti Sinha, general secretary of the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association.She said doctors were being intimidated to break the strike.“The administration is even trying to intimidate people to break the strike, some DNB doctors were threatened that their tenure would not be extended, some were transferred out of Hindu Rao hospital. Four doctors from Hindu Rao have been transferred to Rajan Babu TB hospital amid the protests. This happened when others on deputation were called back to the hospital for resumption of non-Covid services. The order came from the medical superintendent, and not the directorate of hospital administration as it usually does,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/resident-doctors-from-eight-delhi-central-govt-run-hospitals-to-join-north-mcd-docs-strike/story-Ij47syRR4RgUNmKo7EIj0O.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Cyclist dies after being hit by car in Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri||A 30-year-old cyclist was killed after an allegedly speeding car hit his bicycle on Jonapur-Mandi Road in south Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri on Saturday night, the police said. The errant driver fled the spot in his car, but was later arrested after the police examined footage from nearly 50 CCTV cameras in the area.The suspect, Rohit, runs an eatery in Gurugram, and the car is registered in the name of Ramesh Kumar, who is an acquaintance of Rohit’s, who had borrowed the car. The latter was travelling towards Chhatarpur when the mishap took place, around 8.30 pm on Saturday, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur, said. “We recovered the car from a service centre in Faridabad, where Rohit had given it for repairs. He has been booked for rash and negligent driving causing death. A case under sections 279 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the Fatehpur Beri police station,” Thakur said. The cyclist, Akhilesh, was returning to his Saket home from work on Saturday night. “Around 8.30pm, an allegedly speeding car hit his cycle from behind. The impact was such that Akhilesh was flung into the air and landed on the car’s bonnet and front windshield before falling on the road. His head hit the road and he lost consciousness.” an officer from the Fatehpur Beri police station said. A police team took Akhilesh to the AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he died during treatment, after which a case was registered. “We scanned nearly 50 cameras on various routes and sub-lanes in Jaunapur village. It helped us identify the offending vehicle, get its registration number and locate the owner, Ramesh Kumar. He told us that the car was with Rohit. We caught Rohit from his Gurugram home and his interrogation led us to the service centre in Faridabad where it was for repair,” the officer said. Police said Akhilesh’s family members told them that he commuted between his home and the furniture workshop where he worked on the bicycle to stay fit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cyclist-dies-after-being-hit-by-car-in-delhi-s-fatehpur-beri/story-KKX5KKAWNt8yqg02PQ2RoK.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Land-owning agencies meet to identify sites for electric vehicle charging depots||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday convened a meeting to identify potential sites owned by government departments and agencies for setting up electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in the city.The meeting was attended by senior officials from the transport department, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.(HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Ltd.(DIMTS) and Delhi Transco Ltd. (DTL).“Delhi has the distinction of having the maximum number of different land owning agencies. We understand how crucial making an EV friendly ecosystem is to the effective implementation of this policy, and I am happy to note that all these land owning agencies are aligned to Delhi government and our CMs vision of making Delhi the EV capital of India,” Gahlot said. “Our Working Group on Accelerated Rollout of Charging Infrastructure is already working diligently on identifying probable locations for installing charging infrastructure, and in the next few weeks, we are confident of having a final list of locations where charging stations would come up,” the minister said.The first meeting of the working group was held on September 17. During the meeting, the members had agreed that Delhi Transco Limited (DTL) will be the state nodal agency for EVs.“It was decided that the DTL will pool government land parcels and integrate a state-wise tender to install charging stations across the city of Delhi. Simultaneously, DTL and Delhi discoms will also conduct a joint-survey of the land parcels to identify sites for the tendering process,” the government said in a statement.The Delhi EV Policy, 2020 targets 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2024 to be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). In order to encourage the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, the government is focusing on the speedy roll out of electric vehicle charging Infrastructure in Delhi. For the installation of EV charging stations, a centralized tendering system will be adopted to hire an energy operator to run, maintain and upgrade charging stations. The land-owning agencies will be required to provide land for the installation of public EV charging stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/land-owning-agencies-meet-to-identify-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-depots/story-slWeYjfqseHeaeVqgRL6BM.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Scheme to give ownership rights to houses in illegal colonies moving at snail’s pace||The Centre’s ambitious Pradhan Mantri - Unauthorised Colony in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojna (PM-UDAY) scheme to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi is moving at a snail’s pace. In just over an year, of the over one million properties only 1,946 have been issued final documents (conveyance deeds and authorisation slips) by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) till October 23. DDA, however, said it has taken a number of steps to expedite the implementation of the scheme.Many residents of unauthorised colonies said that there is need to set up more facilitation centres and provision for assisting people with paperwork. DDA officials said that the process got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic as field surveys couldn’t be done during the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the viral infection.According to senior DDA officials, 345,000 people have registered under PM-UDAY of which 39,334 applications with all the required paperwork has been received till October 23. As per the data available with the DDA, 1,946 authorisation slips and conveyance deeds have been issued to property owners till October 23. According to DDA officials, 27,522 applications are pending and 2,859 applications have been rejected as they didn’t fulfil the criteria mentioned in the scheme. The Centre had notified PM-UDAY on October 29 last year and the DDA started the registration process in mid-December. Soon after 20-odd properties in Raja Vihar and Suraj Park in north Delhi where formalities were completed, the process was stalled due to Delhi assembly elections and then because of the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic. The work resumed pace only after June.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “Due to Covid-19, the process got severely impacted for four-five months. We are now running awareness campaigns, increasing the number of processing centres, deploying additional manpower to expedite the process. Since June, the scheme has picked up pace as more people are now applying. We have increased the number of processing centres. Today, we have eight processing centres and we will add two more by the end of this month. For this, we have deployed additional staff.”DDA officials also blamed the deficiencies in the documents submitted by applicants after registration for the slow pace of work. “We have issued 7,007 deficiency slips to residents. We have put out all the details needed along with the applications. We have set up 28 help desks to assist people,” said a senior DDA official.Residents of the unauthorised colonies say that they are facing problems in getting the paperwork in order and want the DDA to assist them. Kuldeep Chiilar, president of Raja Vihar RWA, said, “A large number of people living in our colony are not educated and work as daily wage labourers. They don’t know from where to get the papers and affidavits made. The DDA should make arrangements for getting the affidavits made at the help desk centres. This will reduce the running around one has to do just to get the papers ready.”Raja Vihar was one of the two unauthorised colonies in Delhi where the first set of 20 authorisation slip and conveyance deeds were issued in January this year.Officials said DDA is in the process of hiring more agencies to conduct the Geographical Information System (GIS) survey and expedite the process.Urban planning experts Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with the DDA, said, “There is a need to set up more centres to assist people, as a large number of people in these colonies are not aware of the process and don’t know how to upload documents. The DDA should set up camps in these colonies to help people.”Currently, the properties in these colonies are not registered with the Delhi government’s revenue records. Due to this, residents here can’t apply for bank loan against the property or reconstruct their properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/scheme-to-give-ownership-rights-to-houses-in-illegal-colonies-moving-at-snail-s-pace/story-KCl28A7zLEdlVXQO7V8H2H.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi ISBTs to reopen before Diwali: Govt||After being shut for more than seven months, interstate bus services are likely to resume in Delhi before Diwali on November 14, senior government officials said on Monday.The resumption of these services would mean that all three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi — in Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate, and Sarai Kale Khan — will also reopen.“The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has given its approval to resume interstate buses in the city and reopen ISBTs. The move will help a lot of people, especially migrant workers, who are now trying to return to Delhi to start work. We intend to open ISBTs well before Diwali, so people are not inconvenienced,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.The decision was taken in a Friday (October 23) DDMA meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, and the transport department is already preparing to issue an order necessary in this regard, a senior official said. Train and domestic flights services were restarted in May, though their operations are regulated.Once operational, fewer passengers may be able to board buses and no passenger will be allowed to stand. At ISBTs, provisions are being made to disinfect buses after each trip, and to thermally scan passengers. The departures and arrivals of buses will also be staggered to avoid crowding, a senior transport official said.Covid-19 testing camps currently are operational at the Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar ISBTs as they also cater to intra-state buses, and such testing camps will be extended to the Kashmere Gate ISBT as well, once it is reopened. Testing will be voluntary, but symptomatic individuals will have to undergo a test, a transport official said.In Delhi, interstate bus services were suspended on March 21. But before the onset of the pandemic, the three ISBTs saw a combined footfall of over 250,000 every day. At least 3,467 buses from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Chandigarh would ply through these ISBTs every day.Under the Unlock 1.0 rules, interstate travel was allowed (since June 8), a relaxation that was subject to both states assenting, and passengers carrying travel passes. None of these requirements applies any longer though. The Unlock 2.0 guidelines issued by the Centre on June 30 allowed passengers to travel across state borders without travel passes. In July, DDMA turned down a Delhi transport department proposal to allow the reopening of ISBTs.“States like Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan have already shown a keen interest in sending their state-run buses to our ISBTs. There is an increasing demand to open the service as many people used to travel on buses from neighbouring for their medical treatment in Delhi hospitals,” a second transport official said.For scores of office-goers, small-scale traders and the public in general — for whom travelling to Delhi over distances between 50km and 100km was a daily affair before the pandemic — the daily commute had turned into a nightmare due to lack of buses as many started traveling 40-50 kms or even more on cycles.Government reports show the transport department is losing over ₹5 crore per month because the three ISBTs are shut. The main source of revenue used to be the stand fee charged against each bus entering the terminals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-isbts-to-reopen-before-diwali-govt/story-G0bSHmB2qtpB9kaxT9EHLM.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi Cabinet ministers to urge drivers to turn off ignition from Oct 28||Delhi ministers will join the government’s ‘red light on, gaadi off’ (red light on, ignition off) campaign from Wednesday, in a major push to the anti-pollution drive aimed at curbing vehicular emissions, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Monday. The campaign was launched on October 21 and will continue across the city till November 15. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai’s office said from October 28, cabinet ministers including Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will also join this campaign and will visit different traffic signals, urging drivers to participate in the ‘red light on, gaadi off campaign’. The campaign, which is a voluntary move, encourages drivers to switch off their ignitions while waiting at red lights to reduce tailpipe emissions and to save fuel. The schedule of the campaign shared by the environment ministry shows that on October 28, Delhi minister of food and civil supplies, who formerly held the environment portfolio, Imran Hussain will participate in the citizens’ campaign. On October 30, health minister Satyendra Jain will join, followed by minister of social welfare, Rajendra Pal Gautam on November 4, Delhi speaker Ram Niwas Goel on November 6 and Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on November 9. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will participate on November 15, the last day of the campaign. “From October 28, we will scale up the campaign and the cabinet ministers will cover traffic signals around Connaught Place, Mandi House and India Gate. The idea is to garner maximum support for this campaign, so that a behavioural change is brought among public. Delhi’s pollution levels can be controlled only if the government and people come together to fight against it,” said a ministry spokesperson. The campaign, which started on October 21 to stop ‘idling’ at traffic signals (waiting with ignition on), has roped in over 2,500 environment marshals that are stationed with placards and banners deployed at different traffic signals. The focus of this reach out has been at 10 major traffic signals, where the waiting time is longer than two minutes. The campaign has slowly been expanding to various parts of the city, to ensure maximum participation. On Monday, Rai launched this in all the 70 constituencies of the city and announced that from November 2, the campaign will be taken to all the 272 municipal wards. “A single vehicle contributes to 15-20% pollution while idling at traffic signals. The aim is to reduce that 15-20% pollution by switching the ignition off. The problem of pollution is bigger than politics and party affiliations and we must all come together for Delhi,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-cabinet-ministers-to-urge-drivers-to-turn-off-ignition-from-oct-28/story-yebbM5DsVBX8GcCC9hj9pI.html
27-10-2020||Delhi||Most Covid deaths in Delhi since mid-July||The Capital reported 54 deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, the most single-day fatalities in 102 days. The city last added over 50 deaths a day from the viral infection on July 17, when 58 deaths were added to the toll. So far, almost 360,000 people have been affected and 6,312 have died of Covid-19 in the city. With the sudden increase in the number of deaths, the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) — proportion of deaths among those who test positive — rose beyond 1% after a break of four days. On average, 36 deaths were reported each day since mid-September when the number of cases and deaths went up in the city. After recording over 4,000 cases for three days in a row, the number of new cases dipped to 2,832 on Monday. This, however, was because fewer people were tested over the weekend. Only 34,411 tests were conducted on Sunday — reported in Monday’s health bulletin — as compared to an average of over 56,000 tests conducted each day during the week. Even with the fewer cases, the positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among those tested — remained over 8% for the second day in a row, according to the data. The positivity rate jumped this week to 7.18% from an average 5.99% last week. The transmission is said to be in control when a positivity rate of 5% sustained over two weeks. The number of hospitalisations have also started increasing, with 5,404 total hospital admissions on Monday, as compared to 5,171 hospitalisation on average each day the week before. “We have to wait and watch to see what happens next. But it is likely that the number of cases will go up, with transmission increasing as people interact during the festive season. Add to that the drop in temperature, and more people are likely to be affected,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor in the department of community medicine at AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-covid-deaths-in-delhi-since-mid-july/story-Gop6gMpNliFeRkGxafM0bI.html
27-10-2020||Pune||PMC puts brake on jumbo facility upgrade as city sees fall in virus cases||The 800-bed jumbo facility at College Of Engineering, Pune (COEP) grounds in Shivajinagar run by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will currently operate will 600 beds with the city seeing a dip in Covid cases. With limited critical care facility at its hospitals and the possibility of a second wave post Diwali, the civic body is not ready to release requisition of private hospitals.PMC has hired Medbro agency to run the facility which would be responsible to provide manpower to the facility, including expert doctors and other staff. The jumbo facility is a dedicated Covid-19 facility for critical patients and is equipped with ICU care. Although the facility has a total capacity of 800 beds, currently the civic body has allocated the tender for only 600 beds. When the city saw its peak of Covid cases in September, the administration had stated that the facility would run to its full capacity shortly and a tender for floated. With virus cases decreasing, the civic body has put a brake on upgrading the facility.PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal, who is incharge of the facility, said, “With the number of cases going down, we have allocated a tender to run only 600 beds though the facility can accommodate 800 beds. As per the contract, we need to give them a 24-hour window to increase the bed capacity to 800. The contract also states that we have to pay at least for a minimum of 50% of the beds which will be run even if they are empty. So, we have to pay for 300 beds no matter how many beds are vacant.”Agrawal said that even though the cases are going down the civic body does not intend to give up the requisition as of yet given that the possible second wave is just round the corner. She said, “It is a pandemic and we will need the help of private hospitals to fight it. At the start of the pandemic in March we did not have a dedicated Covid-19 centre and so we had to rely on private hospitals completely. We have critical care available at the jumbo facility now, but we are not yet ready to give up the requisition.”As of Sunday, PMC reported over 1.59 lakh cases in the city of which 1.48 lakh have recovered, 4,122 deaths were reported due to the infection and 6,706 are active cases. As of Monday evening, the jumbo facility had 600 allocated beds of which 155 were vacant, including 107 isolation beds with oxygen, 43 ICU beds and 5 ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-puts-brake-on-jumbo-facility-upgrade-as-city-sees-fall-in-virus-cases/story-rSQ6WKYATPqksnkiCOouUM.html

27-10-2020||Pune||Five days on, Pune businessman still missing; family launches parallel search||Gautam Pashankar (65), a city-based businessman, who has been missing since Wednesday, has remained untraceable over the past five days. While the police have formed multiple teams to investigate the matter, the family has also started making enquiries of their own.“We are getting impatient now. It has been six days since he disappeared. Few days ago someone had come to his office and threatened him and someone was following him on the day he disappeared too. I’m am finding these things out now and if I can find them, surely the police could have found them out too,” said his son Kapil Pashankar who claims to have started checking his father’s past correspondence and speaking with his staff members.Kapil, along with his sister Rinul Pashankar, who is a co-director of a company along with her father, approached the police with a complaint containing multiple suspects’ names.On Thursday, the family members had submitted a “note” to the police that is suspected to be written by Pashankar.“One other thing that the police have somehow overlooked is that he has finished the letter on the third page, signed it, and then wrote some more on the fourth page as if coaxed into writing it. On the fourth page, it again says that he blames himself for his decisions,” said the son. The family members have given a list of names to the police and are drafting a complaint for a case of abetment to suicide. The note mentioned that he intended to leave the city and had left two phones that he used in the car which had dropped him near his house in Modibaug before he disappeared. While the police claim that an ATM transaction had been made through his card, his family claimed that his bank cards were at home. “Two of his cards are inactive and the card which he is carrying, the account only has Rs 1,500 in it. So, I do not know on what basis the police are saying that there was a transaction at an ATM,” said Kapil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/five-days-on-businessman-still-missing-family-launches-parallel-search/story-XaZSsP0gLaeKaORczuQ0vM.html
27-10-2020||Pune||Gardens to reopen on November 1 in Pune: Mayor||The public gardens in Pune are set to reopen on November 1, seven months after the state government closed them in view of preventing coronavirus from spreading. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Monday announced to reopen the gardens in city even as the civic administration was clueless about it.“For the last seven months, public gardens in the city are closed. As the Covid situation in the city is improving, we have decided to reopen the public gardens from November 1. People need to take necessary precautions while visiting the gardens,” Mohol said.The mayor posted a series of tweets announcing the decision while adding that an official order will soon be issued.PMC officials from garden department were unaware of the proposed move to reopen gardens. “We have heard it from the media representatives,” said an official on condition of anonymity.One of the senior officers in garden department said that the public gardens in other corporations are closed yet, but if the PMC office-bearers have instructed the same, the administration needs to reopen these places. PMC has 196 gardens across the city. In June, PMC had briefly reopened the gardens though the civic body had to revoke its decision after people began crowding.“Mainly senior citizens and children visit public gardens. Both the categories fall in risk age group. Previously when PMC opened a few public gardens, it had to close down within a week as citizens were not following instructions,” said the PMC officer.Many of the public gardens managed by PMC have open gyms and jogging tracks. Administration has expressed concerns about citizens not following guidelines and seen visiting public places without masks. There are also cases of visitors to gardens having an heated argument with security guards who point out the mandatory mask rule. Public representatives said that in absence of gardens being closed, residents are crowding hills and open grounds. “It’s been eight months that many are confined to homes. Reopening of gardens will help us get fresh air and work out in gyms,” said Anand Kulkarni, a resident of Bibvewadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gardens-to-reopen-on-november-1-mayor/story-dpz2NjGMMIRv2nYkFVHTbJ.html
27-10-2020||City||Reopening of Swargate-Katraj BRTS line in Pune gets another deadline||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation said that the bus rapid transit corridor (BRTS) between Swargate and Katraj will resume after Diwali. The dedicated bus corridor, India’s first pilot project, has been closed for more than two years.PMC road department head VJ Kulkarni said, “Almost 90 per cent work of the corridor is complete. Installation of CCTV cameras and sliding doors at bus stops is left. These works will be carried out soon and the BRTS facility will be reopened after Diwali.”The official said that fitting of doors and CCTV cameras were not carried out as the facility was not operational because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Kulkarni admitted that anti-social elements damage glass doors and cameras.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) elected member Ashwini Kadam on Monday wrote to Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) seeking the resumption of BRTS facility on Satara road.Kadam said, “I have asked the administration to either restart BRTS or open the stretch for private vehicles. In the name of rectification, PMC delayed the work for two years.”According to a civic official, PMC has spent more than Rs100 crore for improving the corridor. As the corridor was India’s pilot plan, it also carried many flaws. PMC rectified the errors and decided to convert central lanes as dedicated lanes. Even bus stops were erected in the middle of the road at a cost of Rs1 crore per stop.PMC failed to meet seven deadlines to kick-start the corridor.Santosh Kale, a two-wheeler rider, said, “I used this stretch daily. PMC has closed the road for two years and it only leads to confusion. As BRTS is not operational, some vehicle users enter the corridor and speedily drive. Instead of spending money, PMC should demolish the barricades and allow private vehicles on this stretch.”Sanjana Pawar, a bus passenger, said, “I travel by bus daily. It is better to close BRTS permanently as I am seeing some or the other work going on the Swargate to Katraj lane for the past eight years. It is wastage of taxpayers’ money. Instead of wasting money, erect a divider and open all the lanes for vehicles. Then it wil be even easy to cross the roads.”Cost of the Swargate to Katraj BRTS projectIn 2016 : Rs 75 croreIn 2018: Rs 105 crore(Cost increased in 2018 by Rs 30 crore)Deadlines missedMay 31, 2018August 1, 2018December, 2018March, 2019||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reopening-of-swargate-katraj-brts-line-gets-another-deadline/story-5hkwbLeorjHUzCMf6ja7JP.html
27-10-2020||Chandigarh||From reporting on the pandemic to suffering from Covid||On October 2, Jammu and Kashmir’s Covid had tally crossed 77,000 and I submitted a report detailing how the pandemic was wrecking havoc in the Union Territory. Little did I know that two days later, I, too, would become part of the mounting statistics. I had been reporting about the disease from the ground since its outbreak. From the moment the first case was reported in Kashmir, I started taking precautions such as wearing a mask and using sanitisers. In no time, social distancing became my new normal. In fact, I was so cautious that friends would good-naturedly poke fun at me. In the course of work, I went into Covid centres to report about the disease and patients. I travelled to different parts of Kashmir to cover stories and managed to successfully evade the virus till the end of September. In the last week of September, I met many people and even attended a function. Though I took all precautions, on the night of September 29, I developed fever and body aches. On the recommendation of a doctor friend, I started taking Azithromycin and Paracetemol, which brought some relief. The doctor friend told me to continue the course for three to four days and to isolate myself. As my fever subsided, I continued to work from home. I remained isolated as I was worried about my aged parents contracting the infection. For three days my condition was stable and oxygen saturation was almost 94 to 95 but on the fourth day my health deteriorated and my temperature shot to 100°C-101°C. Assured of an ‘easy’ recovery On October 4, I went for a rapid antigen test, which returned positive. The doctor performed an x-ray and a series of other tests on me. The x-ray showed signs of pneumonia in both my lungs so I was put on FabiFlu tablets as well as injectables to treat the pneumonia.Doctors sent me home hoping that my condition would improve in three to four days. My oxygen saturation was now between 93 and 94 and doctors assured me I would ‘easily’ defeat Covid. Initially, I, too, was confident that I will be able to beat the virus. However, as the sickness stretched for three weeks, I went through bouts of depression where chances of recovery seemed bleak and I would worry about my young children, wife and aged parents. ‘Hospitalised in the middle of the night’On the night of October 7, my temperature rose to 103°C and oxygen saturation dropped from 90 to 84. Doctors suggested immediate hospitalisation. I was admitted to the Covid Centre of Government Medical College Baramulla, in the dead of the night. A paramedic hooked me to oxygen which helped with my uneasiness but the fever was consistent. In the morning a team of doctors examined me and put me on Remdesivir injections.Now a Covid patient myself, I was experiencing what I had been reporting. Inside the Covid ward, I noticed that doctors and paramedics were actively engaging with patients, which gave them relief and elevated their confidence. Five months ago, this was not the case, doctors were reluctant to touch Covid patients, fearing they would catch the deadly virus. The fear was tangible as in April, I had lost my 55-year-old cousin to the disease. He died alone in an isolated ward at Bemina SKIMS. His family was sitting in the hospital courtyard and only learnt of his death three hours later.On the first day of my hospitalisation, many friends advised me to shift to a hospital in Srinagar but I wanted to remain close to my family so I stayed put at my home town, which is 50 km from the city. At the hospital when the fever did not subside for the first three days, negative thoughts began to cloud my mind. ‘What if I didn’t get better despite the injections?’ My mind began to play negative thoughts in a loop. I couldn’t sleep and didn’t like to attend calls whenever my phone buzzed.Turning point However, after spending three days at the hospital my temperature came down and my cough subsided. Doctors told me this was the first step of my journey towards recovery, which gave me hope that I would survive. On the fifth day, doctors advised me to take off the oxygen for a few hours, which continued for the next two days. On the seventh day after my hospitalisation, I was discharged with the caveat that if my oxygen saturation dropped, I should rush to the hospital. I was again advised to stay isolated and follow a good diet to boost my immunity.At home, I recovered quickly and on October 22 my RTPCR test came negative. I was free of the deadly virus almost after almost three weeks.During my stint at the Covid hospital, I was impressed by the dedication of doctors and the hospital staff. I saw many patients recovering and going home. Only one patient, a 75-year-old man died in the hospital during my stay there. Recovery rate on the rise Today, I am back at work and reporting again reporting about Covid cases in the UT that have now crossed 91,800. However, it is heartening that the recovery rate is over 90%, which tells us about the nature of the disease and the dedication of the medical staff. National Health Mission (NHM) director and in-charge Covid mitigation Bhupinder Kumar said, “There is a definite reduction in the number of cases this month. Death is a very good indicator. The number of fatalities has also gone down.” Kumar said the testing rates in J&K have been one of the highest in the country, which allowed them to stop spread from those which would have remained undetected. “We test around 25,000 persons every day on an average,” he said. However, with winter approaching fast and the cases could see upward trend. “May be due to H1N1 and flu threat. the situation could be a problem,” said Dr Salim Khan, head of department of social and preventive medicine at GMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/from-reporting-on-the-pandemic-to-suffering-from-covid/story-d3o7YPPrlqt3ONJjNIfywJ.html

27-10-2020||Arts||Parampara Series goes digital: Archives of performances by maestros will enthral classical arts aficionados||An endeavour to promote Indian classical arts, which had become a tradition over the last two decades, faced a challenge by the pandemic. But, instead of bowing down, it took help of technology and is all set to make its debut on a new platform! The annual Parampara Series — National Festival of Music and Dance organised by Natya Tarangini and Kuchipudi exponents Raja Radha Reddy and Kaushalya Reddy, will be held online this year. Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia (flute), Vidushi Kishori Amonkar (vocals), Vyjayanthimala Bali (Bharatanatyam danseuse-actor), L Subramaniam (carnatic vocalist-violinist), Vikku Vinayakram (percussionist - ghatam) — and many other maestros are part of the stellar line-up of the 24th edition of this event. Memories of their ace performances will be re-lived by some, and witnessed for the first time by others, as archives of their previous performances at this festival will be telecast on the YouTube channels of United Nations India, and Raja Radha Reddy. “Parampara Series started in 1997, to bring the best of the best. It was our attempt to show that when a master is performing, you cannot stay untouched because a master knows how to captivate the audience, which often leaves after the hall after the show, crying or in awe. That is what we are trying to bring,” says Kaushalya Reddy. Venkaiah Naidu, Vice President of India, will inaugurate this month-long event on October 27, marking the World Day for Audiovisual Heritage celebrations by United Nations. And starting October 29, every weekend there will be a live telecast of recently recorded talks/discussions and archival, legendary performances of the classical doyens. Participating artistes, too, feel the challenges posed by the pandemic, and say it’s only right for classical concerts to take the digital route. Hindustani classical instrumentalist and Grammy Award winner Padma Bhushan, Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, says, “Corona has paused almost every classical arts concert in the country. And this situation is not going to normalise any time soon. So, it’s important to showcase our arts online. This way even the new generation will be able to see the artistes, who have been performing for years, and indulge in Indian classical arts.”Catch It Live What: Parampara Series Where: www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTfHH34fQgjwGZ44UZuGAQ and www.youtube.com/user/RajaRadhaReddy When: October 29 to November 22 (every weekend) Timing: 8pmAuthor tweets @HennaRakheja For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/parampara-series-goes-digital-archives-of-performances-by-maestros-will-enthral-classical-arts-aficionados/story-NG7nNOtnCcSqoLFAnC7a6M.html
27-10-2020||World||Iran building underground nuclear facility, says UN watchdog||Inspectors from the UN’s atomic watchdog have confirmed Iran has started building an underground centrifuge assembly plant after its previous one exploded in what Tehran called a sabotage attack over the summer, the agency’s head told The Associated Press on Tuesday.Iran also continues to stockpile greater amounts of low-enriched uranium, but does not appear to possess enough to produce a weapon, Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the AP in an interview in Berlin.Following the July explosion at the Natanz nuclear site, Tehran said it would build a new, more secure, structure in the mountains around the area. Satellite pictures of Natanz analysed by experts have yet to show any obvious signs of construction at the site in Iran’s central Isfahan province.Also Read | Iran’s foreign minister urges UN to unite against US unilateral actions“They have started, but it’s not completed,” Grossi said. “It’s a long process.” He would not give further details, saying it’s “confidential information”. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Natanz hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility. In its long underground halls, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium.Natanz became a flashpoint for Western fears about Iran’s nuclear programme in 2002, when satellite photos showed Iran building an underground facility at the site, some 200 km (125 miles) south of the capital, Tehran. In 2003, the IAEA visited Natanz, which Iran said would house centrifuges for its nuclear programme, buried under some 7.6 metres (25 feet) of concrete. That offers protection from potential airstrikes on the site, which also is guarded by anti-aircraft positions.Natanz had been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus previously, which was believed to be a creation of the US and Israel. Iran has yet to say who it suspects of carrying out the sabotage in the July incident. Suspicion has fallen on Israel as well, despite a claim of responsibility by a previously unheard-of group at the time.Under the provisions of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran is allowed to produce a certain amount of enriched uranium for non-military purposes.In return, Iran was offered economic incentives by the countries involved.Since President Donald Trump pulled the US unilaterally out of the deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, however, the other signatories — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep the deal alive.Meanwhile, Iran has been steadily exceeding the deal’s limits on how much uranium it can stockpile, the purity to which it can enrich uranium and other restrictions to pressure those countries to come up with a plan to offset US sanctions.Still though, Iran has continued to allow IAEA inspectors full access to its nuclear facilities, including Natanz, Grossi said.In the latest IAEA quarterly report, the agency reported Iran as of August 25 had stockpiled 2,105.4 kg (4,641.6 pounds) of low-enriched uranium, well above the 202.8 kg (447.1 pounds) allowed under the JCPOA. It was also enriching uranium to a purity of 4.5%, higher than the 3.67% allowed under the deal.In the next report, due in coming weeks, Grossi said: “We continue to see the same trend that we have seen so far.” According to a widely cited analysis by the Washington-based Arms Control Association, Iran would need roughly 1,050 kilograms (1.16 tons) of low-enriched uranium — under 5% purity — in gas form and would then need to enrich it further to weapons-grade, or more than 90% purity, to make a nuclear weapon.The IAEA’s current assessment is, however, that Iran does not at the moment possess a “significant quantity” of uranium — defined by the agency as enough to produce a bomb — according to Grossi.“At the moment, I’m not in contact with my inspectors, but by memory, I wouldn’t say so,” he said.“All of these are projections and the IAEA is not into speculation” he added. “What may happen? What could happen? We are inspectors, we say the amounts that we see.” Iran insists it has no interest in producing a bomb, and Grossi noted that before the JCPOA, Iran had enriched its uranium up to 20% purity, which is just a short technical step away from the weapons-grade level of 90%. And in 2013, Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was already more than 7,000 kg (7.72 tons) with higher enrichment, but it didn’t pursue a bomb.“The idea of a ‘significant quantity’ is a technical parameter...that applies in the context of the safeguards agreement to indicate amounts which could be theoretically used for the development of a nuclear weapon,” he said.“The fact that there could be such an amount would not indicate automatically that a nuclear weapon is being fabricated, so I think we have to be very careful when we use these terms.” Grossi personally visited Tehran in late August for meetings with top officials, and managed to break a months-long impasse over two locations thought to be from the early 2000s where Iran was suspected of having stored or used undeclared nuclear material and possibly conducted nuclear-related activities. Inspectors have now taken samples from both of those sites, and Grossi said they are still undergoing lab analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-building-at-underground-nuclear-facility-says-un-watchdog/story-zOylANsnqmTZzcT2IFwDIK.html
27-10-2020||World||Pfizer says no Covid-19 vaccine data yet, could be week or more before it reports||Drugmaker Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it does not yet have data from the late-stage trial of the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany’s BioNTech SE, and provided a timeline that makes its release unlikely ahead of the November 3 US presidential election.Pfizer said there had not yet been enough infections in the 44,000-volunteer trial to trigger an analysis of whether or not the vaccine works. An independent panel will conduct the first analysis when it reaches 32 infections.Chief Executive Albert Bourla said after it has enough data for the analysis, it typically takes 5 to 7 days before the company can publicly release the data, meaning it is likely to happen after the election.US President Donald Trump had said a vaccine could be available before the Nov. 3 election, but in recent weeks his administration has emphasized that one will be ready this year.Bourla has previously said the company could release data on whether or not the vaccine works as early as this month. “For us, the election is an artificial milestone,” Bourla said on a conference call for the company’s earnings. “This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democrat vaccine. It will be a vaccine for the citizens of the world.”Pfizer shares were flat at $37.92.Pfizer hopes to be the first US drugmaker to unveil successful data from a late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trial, ahead of rival Moderna Inc. Pfizer and BioNTech launched their phase 3 study in late July.The data monitoring board is scheduled to make its first assessment of the vaccine’s performance after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. Healthcare investor Brad Loncar said it was difficult to draw a positive or negative conclusion from the fact that the trial has not yet had its first interim analysis.“I think this means that the overall infection rate is a lot lower than Pfizer initially estimated,” Loncar said. Dr. David Boulware, professor of medicine at University of Minnesota, said the study’s participants may be more adherent to social distancing guidelines than the general population. “Who the vaccine trials really need are the people who don’t wear masks, who are going out to bars, who go to crowded events, who are singing in church choirs - those are the high risk people,” he said.Boulware said that a data monitoring board could still review the data relatively quickly - perhaps in less than a day - once the trial hits its first interim point.As the pandemic crimps demand for certain Pfizer therapies and damages global economies, investors are keenly focused on seeing the late-stage study data of the vaccine candidate being developed with BioNTech. The company also said that if the trial is successful, it still expects to file for emergency authorization of the vaccine candidate from US regulators shortly after it has enough safety data in late November. It expects to have manufacturing data ready to submit to those regulators before then.Pfizer reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates by one cent, helped by lower-than-expected costs. Sales fell 4.3% to $12.13 billion in the third quarter due to a sharp drop in revenue from its off-patent pain drug Lyrica, as well as a $500-million hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts estimates of 71 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-no-covid-19-vaccine-data-yet-could-be-week-or-more-before-it-reports/story-VRbdQrTQESqQ2JuSWhgvoN.html
27-10-2020||World||Eli Lilly strikes optimistic tone on Covid-19 therapy after trial failure||Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday aimed to ease investor concerns about its Covid-19 antibody treatment after a trial of the therapy failed to show a benefit in hospitalized patients.Lilly said it remains optimistic about ongoing trials for the experimental Covid-19 antibody therapy. The drugmaker also said issues raised by US regulators after an inspection of one of its manufacturing facilities do not effect the quality or safety of the treatment. Reuters reported earlier this month that US Food and Drug Administration inspectors found serious quality control problems at the plant preparing to manufacture the antibody therapies.The company said it remains confident in the ability of the single antibody treatment to prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of Covid-19.“While the results in hospitalized patients were disappointing, we don’t expect this to affect our chances of success in prophylaxis (prevention) or in early treatment,” Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said on a conference call.Lilly said it intends to request emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for its dual antibody therapy as soon as November. It has already applied for an EUA for the single antibody treatment for use in mild to moderate Covid-19 patients and for its arthritis drug baricitinib.US President Donald Trump has been touting the antibody therapies after receiving a similar treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc during his own recent bout with Covid-19.The Indianapolis-based drugmaker also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit in part due to pricing pressure on some of its major drugs, including diabetes treatment Trulicity, and its shares fell more than 5%.Third-quarter earnings of $1.54 per share missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.71, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv. The company pointed to higher rebates to insurers to ensure Trulicity’s market share and a larger portion of sales coming from the U.S. Medicaid program, which pays less than commercial insurers for the medicine. But Lilly maintained its earnings forecast for the full year.Trulicity sales of $1.11 billion for the quarter was below the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.27 billion, according to brokerage Mizuho. Lilly said it expects 2020 Covid-19 research and development expense to be roughly $400 million. Revenue rose 5% to $5.74 billion in the quarter, below analyst forecasts of $5.88 billion.Lilly said it still anticipates 2020 revenue of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion.It cautioned that achieving the higher end of the range would likely require moderate revenue from potential Covid-19 treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eli-lilly-strikes-optimistic-tone-on-covid-19-therapy-after-trial-failure/story-rekpkrOO3zasP93ucQeTXL.html

27-10-2020||World||‘We’re working on it:’ Pope’s Covid-19 advisers and the mask||Pope Francis’ decision to forgo wearing a mask has been noticed, with some concern, by the commission of Vatican experts he appointed to help chart the Catholic Church’s path through the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath.The Rev. Augusto Zampini, one of the key members of the pope’s Covid-19 commission, acknowledged Tuesday that at age 83 and with part of his lung removed after an illness in his youth, Francis would be at high risk for complications if he were to become infected with Covid-19.“He has started to use the mask now,” Zampini said in response to reporters’ questions. “And I hope he will use it in the general audiences, when he is close to the people. If you’re in an open space, we know that it’s different. But well, we are working on that.”Francis has courted some criticism for declining to wear a mask when indoors, even though Vatican regulations call for masks indoors and out when social distancing cannot be guaranteed. While Francis’ lung condition could help explain his decision to forego the mask, he donned one for more than two hours last week when he presided over an indoor and outdoor interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome.Yet the following day, Francis went maskless during his indoor general audience in the Vatican auditorium, including when he shook hands with a handful of similarly maskless bishops and leaned in to speak privately to each one. On Saturday, he met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who arrived wearing a mask only to take it off for the audience in the pope’s library.Photos of the maskless leaders caused a mild stir in Spain over the weekend, but the prime minister’s office dismissed it by saying the delegation was following Vatican protocol rules. Spain last week became the first country in Western Europe with more than 1 million confirmed virus cases.The Vatican has declined to respond to questions about Francis and masks.Zampini said the recent rise in infections in the tiny city state have commission members and the Vatican as a whole concerned. Thirteen Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have recently tested positive.“We are very worried,” Zampini said, noting that the Vatican has strong regulations about keeping social distancing and washing hands within the territory. “We have all protocols in place, but still we have cases.”He acknowledged, though, that the contagion within the Vatican has merely driven home the danger of the virus so that the Vatican itself can be witness to what the rest of the world is experiencing and help be part of the solution.The commission is working to address the current needs of the church around the world with concrete acts of assistance, while also developing policy recommendations for how governments and institutions can re-think global economic, environmental, social, health care and other structures to be more equitable and sustainable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-re-working-on-it-pope-s-covid-19-advisers-and-the-mask/story-lFrcdPU0tHJ4NSTUnLcGvN.html
27-10-2020||World||MIT names campus theatre after alumni Swraj Paul, son||The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has named a theatre in the dome-shaped Kresge auditorium on its campus after industrialist Swraj Paul and his late son, Angad Paul, both of whom gained qualifications there: the former in 1952 and latter in 1992.Paul, 89, who donated $5 million to MIT earlier this year, studied mechanical engineering at MIT and later went on to found the Caparo Group that straddles various sectors, including value-added steel products. Angad Paul, who studied economics at MIT, passed away in 2015 aged 45.In recognition of Paul’s gift, the large hall in the Kresge Auditorium has been named as the Lord Swraj Paul PC ’52 and Angad Paul ’92 Theatre; more generally known as the Swraj Paul Theatre at Kresge Auditorium, Paul’s office said on Tuesday.Designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, the Kresge Auditorium in the central area of the MIT campus is architecturally significant as a leading example of a minimalist thin-shell concrete structure. It was inaugurated in 1955 and has played an important role in the life of the MIT community.Paul, a member of the House of Lords, said, “I first came to MIT from India in 1949 at a time when there were very few Indian students in the United States, and the experience changed my life”.“Because of my time at MIT, I decided to expand my Caparo companies into the US, and for more than 30 years, we have made significant investments across the country in our Bull Moose Tube and XL Trailers businesses”.“I have always had a great respect for MIT as a world centre of technical excellence, and was delighted when my sons followed me there in the 1970s and 80s. MIT means a lot to our family, and I am honoured that we are able to support the continuation of its values and way of life through this iconic building,” he added.The Kresge auditorium also serves as a venue for a variety of community activities including MIT events, symposia, student activities, and performances by the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra and New England Philharmonic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mit-names-campus-theatre-after-alumni-swraj-paul-son/story-eq6JqLjJns62EaQDeyfzRM.html
27-10-2020||World||Trump, Biden blitz Pennsylvania, the state that ‘decides’ US presidents||President Donald Trump addressed three rallies in Pennsylvania on Monday and his Democratic rival Joe Biden chose the state for his solitary campaign event of the day.In America’s unique presidential election system based on electoral college numbers, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the state calls itself officially, has emerged as the “tipping-point” state for the 2020 White House race: whoever wins Pennsylvania wins the presidency.“We get Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” Trump said to cheering supporters in Allentown, at the first of the day’s three rallies, on a cold and rainy morning. Framing the election as a choice between his “super-recovery” and Biden’s “depression”, Trump went on to say he was confident he will be re-elected “almost easily”.An hour’s drive south in Chester, Biden told reporters later in the afternoon at an election centre that he hoped to carry Pennsylvania “by the grace of god”.Here is how FiveThirtyEight, one of the most trusted poll-forecasters, saw Pennsylvania’s centrality to the 2020 race way back in September, which has now been affirmed and reaffirmed by others: “Pennsylvania is so important that our model gives Trump an 84% chance of winning the presidency if he carries the state — and it gives Biden a 96% chance of winning if Pennsylvania goes blue.”Biden is leading Trump by 5.1 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls in Pennsylvania now, and by 4.8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls.With just eight days to the close of polling on November 3, FiveThirtyEight has Biden in the lead by 9.4 percentage points (52.3% to Trump’s 42.9%) nationally; and RealClearPolitics has the former vice-president also in the lead but at 7.8 percentage points (50.8%-43%). More than 63 million Americans have already cast their votes through early in-person and mail balloting.“It’s good, it’s good to be part of the big, big pitch,” said Louise Pyle, a Trump supporter at the president’s Allentown rally, when asked how it felt to be in the state that everyone says will decide the 2020 race. “Yeah, I think, Pennsylvania’s going to come right up to the end to be the one that makes the final decision.” Does she feel weighed down by the responsibility? She shook her head.Ian Chapman, another Pennsylvanian, is not very impressed by this talk of the state being a tipping point. “I don’t think so,” he said, dismissively, “Every election that’s the political verbiage — toss-up states, tipping point, every election is the election of the century. I don’t buy into it. Issues are important and that’s what matters.” He is an independent who voted for Trump in 2016 and will vote for him again based “on my gut”.Trump beat Hillary Clinton narrowly in 2016 to pick up all 20 electoral college votes of Pennsylvania in the winner-takes-all system. Together with even narrower victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, also battleground states, Pennsylvania put Trump in the White House in an upset victory.Over the remaining days to the end of polling, the two candidates and their surrogates will be in jetting in and out and across battleground states that will decide the electoral college math such as Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan essentially, and Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and others.Biden, who says he is too superstitious to pre-judge the race, is seeking to expand the battle ground with two rallies at this late stage in the race in solidly Republican Georgia on Tuesday. This state has not voted Democratic in a presidential election since 1992, President Bill Clinton’s first term win.“I’m going to Iowa, I’m going to Wisconsin, I’m going to Georgia, I am going to Florida and may be other places as well,” said Biden in Chester, previewing a packed schedule for the next few days. Pennsylvania? Biden was born there — Scranton city — and has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia, the capital.And Trump is sending his wife Melania Trump to Chester, where Biden was on Monday, later in the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-blitz-pennsylvania-the-state-that-decides-us-presidents/story-YXa9yXoie6hIMEGt5vlZiO.html
27-10-2020||World||Covid-19 antibody response wanes over time: UK study||The antibody response to Covid-19 virus wanes over time, said a new analysis released on Tuesday based on finger-prick tests on more than 365,000 randomly selected people in England. The tests carried out at home between June 20 and September 28 found that the number of people testing positive dropped by 26.5% across the study period, said the researchers led by Imperial College London.The downward trend was observed in all areas and age groups, but not in health workers, which could indicate repeated or higher initial exposure to the virus, the authors suggested.The decline was largest in people aged 75 and above compared to younger people, and also in people with suspected rather than confirmed infection, indicating that the antibody response varies by age and with the severity of illness, the college said.Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial College, said: “Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies. Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19.” “It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab test if they have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required,” he added.The study used finger-prick testing to detect coronavirus antibodies in the blood. When present, they indicate that a person has been previously infected with the virus. The testing kits, called Lateral Flow Tests, detect antibodies above a particular concentration in the blood, and do not measure the amount of antibodies in a particular person.The conclusions include findings from three rounds of testing carried out over a three-month period. There were 17,576 positive results across all three rounds, around 30% of whom did not report any symptoms.After accounting for the accuracy of the test, confirmed by laboratory evaluation, and England’s population characteristics, the study found that antibody prevalence declined from 6.0% to 4.8% and then 4.4% over the three months.This was found across all ages but the smallest drop was found in the youngest age group, aged 18-24, falling from 7.9% to 6.7% (14.9%), while the largest was found in the oldest group, aged 75 and above, declining from 3.3% to 2.0% (39%).Helen Ward, one of the lead authors of the research report, said: “This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes Covid-19, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-antibody-response-wanes-over-time-uk-study/story-GGO7leQKyDsZScZRyuMDyM.html
27-10-2020||World||Thousands in Bangladesh protest against French president’s comments||Around 10,000 people in Bangladesh rallied in the South Asian nation’s capital on Tuesday to protest France’s president and his staunch support of secular laws that deem caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad as protected under freedom of speech.Protesters from the conservative Islami Andolon Bangladesh group, which supports the introduction of Islamic law in the Muslim-majority country, carried banners and placards reading: “All Muslims of the world, unite” and “Boycott France.” It was the largest protest yet against the cartoons in recent days.Some carried portraits of French President Emmanuel Macron with an “X” on his face. One protester carried a cutout image of the French president with shoes around his neck as a sign of insult.The issue has once again come to light in recent days following a gruesome beheading near Paris of a French teacher who showed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class. The 18-year-old Chechen refugee who carried out the attack was later shot dead by police.The teacher, Samuel Paty, has been heralded as a symbol of France’s staunch secular ideals and its rejection of religious intrusion in public spheres. Macron and members of his government have vowed to continue supporting such caricatures as protected under freedom of expression.Muslim politicians, religious scholars and everyday people have condemned such depictions as a form of hate speech and view them as sacrilegious and insulting to Islam. Muslims have been calling for both protests and a boycott of French goods in response to France’s stance on caricatures of Islam’s most revered prophet.Five years ago, French-born al-Qaida extremists killed 12 employees of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in response to its publication of caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Those cartoons also sparked mass protests in Muslim-majority countries, with some turning deadly.Elsewhere, Iran summoned a French diplomat to protest France’s stance on the caricatures. A report by state TV on Tuesday said an Iranian official in the country’s Foreign Ministry told the French diplomat that Paris’ response in the aftermath of Paty’s killing was “unwise” and that France was permitting hatred against Islam under the guise of support for freedom of expression.A powerful association of clerics in the Iranian city of Qom also urged the government to condemn Macron. Iranian hard-line newspaper Vatan-e Emrooz depicted Macron as the devil and called him Satan in a cartoon on its front page Tuesday.Pakistan’s parliament passed a resolution condemning the publication of cartoons of the prophet.In Saudi Arabia, the country’s state-run Saudi Press Agency on Tuesday put out a statement from the Foreign Ministry saying the kingdom “rejects any attempt to link Islam and terrorism, and denounces the offensive cartoons of the prophet.” Saudi clerics have too condemned the caricatures, but have also cited the prophet’s “mercy, justice, tolerance”. Another prominent sheikh called on Muslims not to overreact.The Arab Gulf state of Qatar also condemned what it described as “the dramatic escalation of populist rhetoric” inciting religious abuse. In a statement, the government said inflammatory speech is fueling calls for the repeated targeting of nearly 2 billion Muslims around the world through the deliberate offending of the Prophet Muhammad and has led to an increase in hostility toward Muslims.Bangladeshi protesters gathered in front of the main Baitul Mokarram Mosque in downtown Dhaka Tuesday morning. The group walked toward the French Embassy, but police intercepted the march, which ended without violence.Protests have also been held recently in Iraq, Turkey the Gaza Strip and in opposition areas of northwestern Syria controlled by Turkey-backed rebels.Rezaul Karim, the head of the Islami Andolon group in Bangladesh, called on France to refrain from displaying caricatures of the prophet.“We, the Muslims, never did caricatures of other religious leaders,” he said.“Allah sent the Prophet Muhammad as an ambassador of peace ... Macron and his associates did not learn anything from history,” he added, before calling on Muslims to boycott French goods.Karim also said Macron should be treated for his “mental illness,” remarks similar to those made days earlier by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who’s been the most vociferous in his criticism among political leaders in saying Macron needed his head examined and had lost his way. France has since recalled its ambassador to Turkey and other European nations have defended Macron.Bangladesh’s leadership, however, has not come out in criticism of France, as Turkey, Pakistan and other Muslim-majority nations have done. Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million mostly Muslim people, is governed by a secular constitution.In the Middle East, Kuwaiti stores have pulled French yogurts, cheese and bottles of sparkling water from their shelves, Qatar University canceled a French culture week, and calls to stay away from the French-owned Carrefour grocery store chain were trending on social media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-bangladesh-protest-against-french-president-s-comments/story-0jh9eCwHFkEVo73X9ZpWXN.html
27-10-2020||World||Philadelphia police shooting of Black man sparks unrest||Police shot and killed a 27-year-old Black man on a Philadelphia street after yelling at him to drop his knife, sparking violent protests that police said injured 30 officers and led to dozens of arrests.The shooting occurred before 4 p.m. Monday as officers responded to a report of a person with a weapon, police spokesperson Tanya Little said.Officers were called to the Cobbs Creek neighborhood and encountered the man, later identified as Walter Wallace, who was holding a knife, Little said. Officers ordered Wallace to drop the knife, but he instead “advanced towards” them. Both officers then fired “several times,” Little said.Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest. One of the officers then put him in a police vehicle and drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, Little said.Hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the shooting late Monday into early Tuesday, with interactions between protesters and police turning violent at times, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Video showed many yelling at officers and crying.Police cars and dumpsters were set on fire as police struggled to contain the crowds. More than a dozen officers, many with batons in hand, formed a line as they ran down 52nd Street chasing protesters away from the main thoroughfare. The crowd largely dispersed then.Thirty officers were injured, most of them from being struck by projectiles such as bricks and rocks, according to preliminary information from police. One officer was hospitalized in stable condition with a broken leg and other injuries after she was struck by a pickup truck, police said, while the other injured officers were treated and released.Video of the fatal confrontation recorded by a bystander and posted on social media shows officers pointing their guns at Wallace as he walks in the street and around a car. He walks toward the officers as they back away from him in the street, guns still aimed at him. They yell at him to put his knife down.Both then fire several shots and Wallace collapses in the street. A woman runs up to him screaming. Several bystanders then approach him.It is unclear in the video if he had a knife. Witnesses said he was holding one.No officers or bystanders were injured in the confrontation, Little said. The names of the officers who fired the shots were not immediately disclosed. Both were wearing body cameras and were taken of street duty pending the investigation.Some people spoke with city Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, who arrived at the scene a short time after the shooting occurred.“I heard and felt the anger of the community,” Outlaw said in a statement, adding that the video “raises many questions” and that “those questions will be fully addressed by the investigation.”Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr., told the Inquirer that his son was also a father, was on medication and struggled with mental health issues.“Why didn’t they use a taser?” he asked.The races of the police officers weren’t immediately confirmed. The shooting occurred in a predominantly Black neighborhood in west Philadelphia. The Inquirer reported that dozens of protesters gathered at a nearby park and chanted “Black lives matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philadelphia-police-shooting-of-black-man-sparks-unrest/story-zAB0IYWjjtQ70cARkWpuqI.html
27-10-2020||World||Indian-origin man convicted of murder in UK spitting row||Gurjeet Singh Lall, who stabbed to death a man during a row over Lall’s spitting on the street in Southall, was convicted of manslaughter on Monday and is due to be sentenced on December 14.Lall, 36, stabbed 69-year-old ex-rugby player and builder Allan Isichei several times after a brief verbal row over Lall’s spitting on the street on August 24 last year.Recalling the incident, Scotland Yard said that Isichei went to a pub before 6 pm on the day, and left around 6.30 pm. Moments later he encountered Lall as he walked towards his home on St Mary’s Avenue South.Lall was leaning against a wall and the two had a brief verbal disagreement over Lall’s spitting in the street. Words were exchanged and as Isichei walked away, Lall spat on the ground again, at which point Isichei turned. More words were exchanged.Lall produced a knife and used it to stab Isichei in a struggle in which the latter managed to disarm him. Apparently not realising how badly he was injured, Isichei got up and walked down the street before stopping. He then staggered to a neighbour’s address and rang the doorbell, pleading for help.Police and paramedics treated him at the scene before being placed in an ambulance that was forced to stop shortly after it left as his condition deteriorated; he was pronounced dead around 8pm.The police traced Lall to his home address after following a blood trail from injuries he sustained in the incident. A post-mortem found that Isichei had suffered multiple knife injuries. A cause of death was given as an incised wound to the abdomen.During police interview, Lall claimed in a prepared statement that he had been acting in self-defence. Following a review of Lall’s mental health, he was deemed fit to stand trial and he was subsequently convicted of manslaughter by the Inner London Crown Court.Detective inspector Jamie Stevenson said: “It beggars belief that a man could go to his local pub for a quick drink on a Saturday evening and not return home, but that is the terrible reality that Allan’s family have been left with.”“Allan was a creative and constructive man, living a full and active life through his sport and music. His loss is immeasurable, and is of course most felt by his loving family, who still grieve for him and will do so for a very long time to come”.“There was no good reason for Lall to have had a knife in his possession that day, and no good reason for him to use it. I am glad that he has been convicted and the jury rejected his claim that he was acting in self-defence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-man-convicted-of-murder-in-uk-spitting-row/story-QHgpVDK4FgMjr4y0C51r5H.html
27-10-2020||World||Stop sowing discord between China, regional countries: Beijing on Pompeo’s India trip||China on Tuesday accused the US of sowing discord between Beijing and regional countries as the US secretary of state of Mike Pompeo held high-level talks in New Delhi with a focus on strengthening bilateral defence and strategic ties.Pompeo arrived in India on Monday along with defence secretary Mark T Esper for the third edition of the US-India 2+2 dialogue with their counterparts, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh.Pompeo is due to visit Sri Lanka and the Maldives after his India trip.Pompeo offered his support to India and mentioned the killing of Indian Army soldiers in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley after a clash with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in June.“We visited the National War Memorial to honour brave men and women of Indian armed forces who sacrificed for the world’s largest democracy, including 20 killed by PLA in Galwan Valley. The US will stand with India as they confront threats to their sovereignty, liberty,” Pompeo said in a joint statement after the 2+2 India-US Ministerial Dialogue.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry was specifically asked to comment on Pompeo’s visit, given that he had said earlier that it will focus on threats posed by China.In his response, ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin did not specifically mention India, but attacked Pompeo’s anti-China statements.“Pompeo’s attacks and accusations against China are nothing new,” Wang said.“These are groundless accusations which reflect that he is clinging to the Cold War mentality and ideological biases. We urge him to abandon the Cold War and the zero-sum game mentality and stop sowing discord between China and regional countries as well as undermining the regional peace and stability.”Wang’s remarks were made in the backdrop of India and the US signing the landmark Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information between the two countries.Pompeo further said in New Delhi on Tuesday: “The US and India are taking steps to strengthen our cooperation against all manner of threats and not just those posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Last year, we expanded our cooperation on cyber issues, our navies have held joint exercises in the Indian Ocean.”China will be closely monitoring the Malabar naval exercise among the navies of the US, Japan, India and Australia in November – the thinking in Beijing is that an anti-China Indo-Pacific maritime security structure is gradually taking shape.In July, Pompeo had criticised China for its aggressive moves against its neighbours, including “instigating” a deadly confrontation with India in eastern Ladakh.“The recent clashes initiated by the PLA are just the latest examples of the Chinese Communist Party’s unacceptable behaviour. It is important that democracies like ours work together, especially as we see more clearer than ever the true scope of the challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-sowing-discord-between-china-regional-countries-beijing-on-pompeo-s-india-trip/story-GsHmBsd4s16VCO0rbrSr2O.html
27-10-2020||World||Long-term immunity in doubt as UK study finds Covid-19 antibodies fall rapidly||The hope for long-term immunity from Covid-19 was thrown into doubt on Tuesday as a large UK study concluded that protective antibodies in people fall “quite rapidly” after a coronavirus infection.Imperial College London’s research, which tested more than 365,000 people in England, found that antibody response to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 wanes over time, which indicates that any level of immunity could last only a few months.“Seasonal coronaviruses that circulate every winter and cause common colds can re-infect people after six to 12 months,” said professor Wendy Barclay, a virologist who was one of the researchers on the study.“We suspect that the way the body reacts to infection with this new coronavirus is similar to that,” she said.Antibodies are a key part of the body’s immune defences and stop viruses from getting inside the body’s cells. The Imperial College London team found the number of people testing positive with a finger-prick test for antibodies has fallen by 26 per cent between June and September.“Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies,” said professor Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial College London.“Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19. It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab test if they have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required,” he said.The downward trend was observed in all areas of England and age groups, but not in health workers, which could indicate repeated or higher initial exposure to the virus, the authors suggest.“This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes Covdi-19, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others,” said professor Helen Ward, one of the lead authors.The decline was largest in people aged 75 and above compared to younger people, and also in people with suspected rather than confirmed infection, indicating that the antibody response varies by age and with the severity of illness.The decline was largest in people who didn’t report a history of Covid-19, dropping by almost two-thirds (64 per cent) between rounds one and three, compared to a decrease of 22.3 per cent in people who had an infection confirmed by lab testing.UK Health Minister Lord Bethell said the research would help inform the government’s continued response to the disease.“It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them – this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19,” said Lord James Bethell.“Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a test if you have symptoms and always remember Hands, Face, Space,” he said.People in London had the highest proportion of positive tests across the country, at around twice the national average. Health and care workers, ethnic minority groups, and those living in deprived areas and large households also had the greatest burden of past infection.The latest findings, part of the government-backed Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) studies, suggest a decline in the level of immunity in the population in the months following the first wave of the pandemic, leading to the second wave currently underway across the UK.However, experts believe more work is still needed before any conclusive evidence on long-term immunity and also how the novel coronavirus would react to a viable vaccine that clears clinical trials to be rolled out against Covid-19. Some high-risk sections of the population may require additional follow-up booster doses to boost levels of immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-term-immunity-in-doubt-as-uk-study-finds-covid-19-antibodies-fall-rapidly/story-KK7nApDI74BKMK6RdgQAEI.html
27-10-2020||World||Hindu-American women root for Republicans, Trump||Donald Trump’s market-friendly policies, tough stance against China and acknowledgement of the contributions of the Hindu community in the US have struck a chord with a group of Hindu-American women who are rooting for the Republicans to ensure that he wins the November 3 presidential election.Participating in an online session, a panel of Hindu-American women, from different walks of life, expressed their strong views in favour of President Trump.Karishma Himatsinghani, a media entrepreneur from Dallas, said that she is neither a Leftist, nor a Rightist, but a moderate centrist who finds Trump treading a centrist path in programmes and policies.It is the Leftist media that has affixed an image of Right-wing on Trump as a matter of political expediency. Trump’s focus is on keeping the economy going during the uncertain Covid-19 crisis. The president’s commitment is reflected in tax-cuts for businesses and removal of regressive government regulations that impeded economic activity, she said.“Look at the way the Democrats have responded to the recent riots in Oakland, Seattle and elsewhere, where they are seen as endorsing the rioters, which should ring alarm bells for all voters. How are we supposed to survive with lawlessness on the streets, where law enforcement agencies are undermined and attacked by a certain political class?” she asked.The Democrats were brainwashing the youth in subscribing to anarchy and violence as a solution to the social justice issues, Himatsinghani claimed, asserting that it will further exacerbate the depravity of the affected, instead of providing relief and resolution.“Trump is the only President in US history to have openly acknowledged the Hindu community and appreciate their contributions at the ‘Howdy Modi’ event. Democrats have always vilified the Hindu community and religion with pejorative terms, and have even excluded them this time from the election manifesto completely,” she claimed.Srilekha Palle, a healthcare administrator, took a dig at the Democratic Party’s ideology.“Do you want education for your children dictated by the big government, or by you as a parent; do you want healthcare to be decided by doctors and healthcare professionals and costs driven by the market, or to be decided by the unaccountable big government; if you want your lives to be governed by government bureaucrats vote for Democrats, but if you want to live in a free society, vote for Republicans,” she asked the panelists.Palle said President Trump had strengthened Indo-US relations where he has taken unprecedented steps to recognise India’s concerns on terrorism and the threat posed by China.By renaming the whole region as Indo-Pacific, the US President has finally recognised India’s stabilising role in global affairs, she said.In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Trump administration in 2018 renamed the US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command. The move is reflective of the growing importance of the Indian Ocean in US strategic thinking.Vandana Mangalick, a lifelong Democrat from Minneapolis who voted five times for that party, highlighted the Democrats stance on Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).“The Democrats are supposed to stand for human rights for the persecuted. But why have six Democrat-controlled city councils, passed anti-India resolutions, opposed CAA? What business do city councils have meddling in a sovereign country’s affairs?” she asked.Raman Bhaumik, an entrepreneur in Dallas said, “The Republicans have always supported small businesses and reduced government regulations to manageable levels. Their policies reflect in the way businesses have gotten quick loan approvals even during challenging Covid-19 times. We would not have survived Covid-19 without the support of Republicans”.“I am a product of a stereotypical Bengali intellectual family environment, where social welfare, social reform, and liberal thought is worshipped, but what is going on in the US today is that a noble purpose of social justice, has been hijacked to serve a partisan political purpose, and extremists are masquerading behind social justice to spread mayhem in the society,” said Dr Paramita Sarkar, a scientist.Radhika Garimella, another recent Democrat, said there was a vast gap between what the Democrats promise and what they actually deliver.Democrats have been a big failure in checking the growth of extremism in their party, reflecting how governments are run under their administration. The Democrats have decided to harbour and nurture socialists like Bernie Sanders, she claimed, adding that there is no choice but to leave the party and join the Republicans to ensure a massive victory for Trump.Sangeeta Dua, Chairperson Indo- American Republicans of Greater Houston, moved a resolution in favour of the Republicans and President Trump on account of strong defence, law and order on the streets, free-market based healthcare, jobs for Americans, rebuilding American Industry, and a strong presence of America in global affairs to maintain peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-american-women-root-for-republicans-trump/story-wxbSiwvo4snAscdurK3eEN.html
27-10-2020||World||Pak to strengthen ties with Afghanistan: PM Imran||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said his government has decided to strengthen relations with Afghanistan “no matter who is in power” in Kabul.Inaugurating a two-day seminar titled ‘Pakistan-Afghanistan Trade and Investment Forum’ here on Monday, Khan reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong resolve to continue to play its role for peace and stability in Afghanistan.Khan said his government was making efforts to enhance connections with the business community of Afghanistan in order to benefit from each other’s experience and give impetus to trade and economic relations.The prime minister said his government has decided to strengthen relations with Afghanistan “no matter who is in power” in the neighbouring country. “Future of both countries is dependent upon their unity, mutual trade, and enhanced economic interlinks,” Khan said while highlighting the need to support Afghan traders and investors. He said both the Muslim countries had vast potential for investment and economic activities, which would bring regional prosperity and development.Both Afghanistan and Pakistan could benefit from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and become hubs of trade and business, he remarked.Khan made it clear that the Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process was the chief concern of his government and no other country in the world could take credit equal to Pakistan in its efforts to maintain peace in Afghanistan.Speaker of Afghan Wolesi Jirga Mir Rahman Rahmani said Afghanistan valued Pakistan’s contributions to the Afghan peace process.He said the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan was deep-rooted in common culture, faith, and values. He also stressed the need for enhancing parliamentary contacts between the two countries.While appreciating the steps taken by Pakistan to facilitate Afghan transit trade, which had reduced the time of shipment clearance on the border, Rahmani said opening new border points for trade would facilitate the trade further.Pakistan’s Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaisar said that 2,640 kilometres Pak-Afghan border was not only the longest border that Pakistan shared with any of its neighbours, but it was also the thread that weaves the two nations into a historic tapestry of “social, cultural, linguistic, economic, religious and fraternal ties”.He proposed the formation of a task force to oversee the terms of negotiation of Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), which was going to expire next year and needed input from parliamentarians and institutional stakeholders from both sides of borders for a comprehensive future trade agreement.The two-day seminar was organised by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser at a time when trade and political relations between the neighbouring countries have improved lately. Wolesi Jirga (Afghan Parliament) Speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani, heading an Afghan delegation, arrived here on Qaiser’s invitation to attend the seminar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-strengthen-ties-with-afghanistan-pm-imran/story-Ad101VeknrTtmUyaAjYIfK.html
27-10-2020||World||Barrett swearing-in differs markedly from ‘superspreader’||It’s been only a month since President Donald Trump’s Rose Garden event to announce he was nominating Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the Supreme Court. That packed celebration for friends and allies of the president and his high court nominee turned into a coronavirus superspreader event.When the just-confirmed Barrett returned to the White House on Monday to take her constitutional oath, the celebration was moved to the broader South Lawn, chairs for more than 200 guests were spread about six feet apart, and the mask-wearers greatly outnumbered those who declined to cover their faces.Some participants — including Trump and Barrett — were unmasked.But the event had a markedly different feel than the September 26 Rose Garden gathering. More than two dozen attendees — including Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Thom Tillis — tested positive after attending the earlier White House celebration.Back then, the attendees showed a measure of ease — exchanging handshakes and hugs and standing close together as they conversed — that belied the reality that the nation was in the midst of a pandemic. The crowd was then ushered indoors for a reception.Hours before Monday’s ceremony, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser questioned the wisdom of holding another large gathering at a moment when coronavirus cases were spiking in the U.S. She accused the president of flouting “scientific evidence and common sense.” “I know that there were a number of people who attended that Rose Garden event who became sick, who are quite embarrassed by their participation, who had to go back to their constituencies and communities and explain their behavior,” Bowser said. “And so we don’t want any folks, our residents, certainly from D.C. or in our surrounding region, to be in that situation.” After Barrett was administered the oath by Justice Clarence Thomas and delivered brief remarks, the assembled crowd stood to cheer and take photos from afar as the new justice posed with Trump, their spouses and Thomas.Many guests stood for a few minutes in small groups, chatting with their masks secure before heading for the exits minutes after the guest of honor departed.Some Republican senators invited to attend to the event decided it was better to watch from afar.Indiana Sen. Todd Young told reporters that he had told the White House he would attend, but was reconsidering. Asked why, he said “no reason” and that it “had to do with a lot of factors.” Sen.

27-10-2020||World||Taiwan says new arms purchases to boost credible defense||Taiwan said Tuesday that the recent proposal of U.S. sale of missiles and other arms systems will boost the island’s ability to credibly defend itself, amid rising threats from China.The comments from defense ministry spokesperson Shih Shun-wen came a day after China said it would exact unspecified retaliation against companies that make the weapons systems, including Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Boeing Co.’s defense division, the lead contractor on a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan.Facing a potential Chinese foe with overwhelming superiority in missiles, soldiers, ships and planes, Taiwan has struggled to assure its own people and key ally the U.S. that it is capable of and willing to see to its own defense. The sides split amid a civil war in 1949 and China considers Taiwan its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.“The purchase of these weapons will enhance Taiwan’s credible combat capabilities and asymmetric combat capabilities,” Shih told reporters at a briefing, using a term for countering a much stronger foe with precision weapons and advanced tactics. “This will also enhance our overall combat capabilities to contribute to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”The Trump administration on Monday notified Congress of plans for the Harpoon system, whose missiles are capable of striking ships and land targets. Boeing says the missile uses GPS-aided inertial navigation and delivers a 500-pound blast warhead. It can target coastal defense sites, surface-to-air missile sites, exposed aircraft, ships in port, and port and industrial facilities.That followed another proposed sale announced Oct. 21 to provide $1.8 billion worth of weaponry, including missile and rocket systems, and upgraded equipment for Taiwan’s F-16 jet fighters.Taiwan has long been an irritant in U.S.-China relations. Washington has no formal relations with the island’s democratically elected government but is its main ally. U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can defend itself. In recent years, weapons sales to the island have increased in quantity and quality, as China builds the world’s second most powerful military dedicated largely to defeating Taiwan and achieving its goal of annexation.Stepped-up patrols by Chinese warplanes this year have put Taiwan’s forces under increasingly strain, increasing the importance of developing new weapons systems or buying them from abroad.Beijing regularly pressures American companies including Boeing in an effort to influence U.S. policy. China is one of Boeing’s biggest markets for commercial aircraft, which might make it vulnerable to a boycott, but China’s defense ministry mentioned only Boeing’s military arm, Boeing Defense, not its civilian jetliner business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-new-arms-purchases-to-boost-credible-defense/story-QdP7v7lfyCSODokwXxbiDO.html
27-10-2020||World||Pompeo says US, India must focus on threat posed by China||The United States and China must work together to confront the threat posed by China to security and freedom, US Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday as he prepared for talks with Indian leaders.Pompeo arrived in New Delhi on Monday along with Defense Secretary Mark Esper for an annual strategic dialogue at a time of heightened tension in the region, with Indian troops confronting Chinese forces on their disputed Himalayan border.“Today is a new opportunity for two great democracies like ours to grow closer,” Pompeo said before the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh,“There is much more work to do for sure. We have a lot to discuss today: Our cooperation on the pandemic that originated in Wuhan, to confronting the Chinese Communist Party’s threats to security and freedom to promoting peace and stability throughout the region.”US President Donald Trump has made being tough on China a key part of his campaign to secure a second term in next week’s presidential election and Pompeo has been trying to bolster allies to counter China’s growing influence in the region.India has its own problems with a more assertive China.In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops on their high-altitude border, hardening the mood in India against China and driving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to seek closer military ties with the United States.This month, India invited Australia to join naval drills it holds each year with the United States and Japan, brushing off Chinese concerns that the exercises destabilise the region.“Our focus now must be on institutionalising and regularising our cooperation to meet the challenges of the day and uphold the principles of a free and open Indo-Pacific well into the future,” Esper said.The two sides will later on Tuesday sign a military agreement that will give India access to advanced U.S. satellite and map data for better accuracy of its missiles and drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-says-us-india-must-focus-on-threat-posed-by-china/story-oHEm5u90F4Kfeag8QM2QUI.html

Huawei’s browser unit said in a statement on Tuesday it would conduct a comprehensive self-examination and clean-up in line with the regulator’s requests, and would also place strict controls over ‘self media’ accounts. Xiaomi and UCWeb declined to comment, while Tencent, Oppo, Sogou and 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Legislation introduced in recent years by China include measures to restrict media outlets, surveillance measures for media sites and rolling campaigns to remove content deemed unacceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-regulate-chaos-of-information-available-in-mobile-browsers/story-pLLzvw1tvB9YopkSPlYO7M.html
27-10-2020||World||Dalai Lama hails UN treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons||Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Monday welcomed the ratification of the United Nations’ Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, saying that the ‘historic’ treaty would contribute to even more concerted efforts to do away with dreadful weapons and secure genuine and lasting peace in the world. In a statement, Dalai Lama deemed the treaty ratification as the first positive step towards a more peaceful future by calling it a “historic” step in the right direction to find more enlightened and civilised arrangements for resolving conflicts.Fifty countries have ratified an international treaty to ban nuclear weapons, the United Nations (UN) has announced, allowing the “historic” text to enter into force in 90 days.Honduras became the 50th country to ratify the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), the UN said on Saturday, in a move hailed by anti-nuclear activists but strongly opposed by the United States and the other major nuclear powers.“I welcome the fact that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has now been ratified by fifty countries and will come into force from January next year. This is indeed historic and augurs well for the future of humanity. It is a step in the right direction to finding more enlightened and civilised arrangements for resolving conflicts,” Dalai Lama said.“I have no doubt that this treaty’s coming into force will contribute to even more concerted efforts to do away with these dreadful weapons and secure genuine and lasting peace in our world. The world has now taken the first positive step towards a more peaceful future, but our ultimate goal should be the demilitarisation of the entire planet,” he added. The spiritual leader said that the nuclear-free world is in everyone’s interest.“The reality today is we need to rely on mutual understanding and dialogue to resolve conflicts. Therefore, I take the opportunity to urge all governments to work to implement this treaty, so that the world becomes a safer place for us all,” he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commended the 50 states and saluted “the instrumental work” of civil society in facilitating negotiations and pushing for ratification, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric had said on Saturday.The UN chief said the treaty’s entry into force on January 22, 2021, crowns a worldwide movement “to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons” and “is a tribute to the survivors of nuclear explosions and tests, many of whom advocated for this treaty”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-hails-un-treaty-to-prohibit-nuclear-weapons/story-pBMOdtFLG6S8HTeW4t1GbL.html

Western governments and international human rights groups have expressed concern the law will crush freedoms in Hong Kong. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have said the law is necessary to bring stability to the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-chief-executive-carrie-lam-to-visit-beijing-to-discuss-plans-to-revive-economy/story-YTuUALMCjPOlS8BYYQtqTO.html

Since these patients are at an early stage of infection, they exhibit no symptoms,” Wang Xijiang, deputy director of Kashgar’s disease control and prevention centre was quoted by state-controlled China Daily newspaper as saying.China does not count asymptomatic cases as confirmed cases of Covid-19. Even though the infected – who do not show symptoms – can spread the disease, asymptomatic patients are counted separately.Local authorities, meanwhile, have imposed travel restrictions including the cancellation of some flights.Schools have been ordered shut to avoid cross-infection and residents have been asked to stay in their neighbourhoods to allow medical staff to carry out nucleic acid tests.In July, the Chinese government had declared a “wartime state” in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, after a spike in locally transmitted cases of coronavirus.Separately, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Tuesday that 50 new asymptomatic cases, including 24 arriving from outside the mainland, were reported for Monday. The commission said in its daily report that 16 confirmed cases arriving from outside the mainland were also reported on the same day.Of the new imported cases, three each were reported in Shanghai and Shaanxi, two each in Hebei and Sichuan, and one each in Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Fujian, Shandong and Guangdong, official news agency Xinhua quoted the NHC as saying.“As of Monday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 85,826. Of them, 264 patients were still being treated, including four in severe condition,” the report said.The commission said 4,634 people had died of the disease on the mainland..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-curbs-in-china-s-xinjiang-after-spike-in-symptomless-covid-19-cases/story-Z7fXHYkRgFVp6SmMXZZswK.html
27-10-2020||World||US speaker Pelosi ‘optimistic’ on Covid-19 relief before November 3 elections, says spokesman||US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hopeful that congressional Democrats and the Trump administration can reach agreement on a coronavirus relief bill before the Nov. 3 elections, her spokesman said on Monday, adding that major issues still must be ironed out.“The speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,” Pelosi Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill said in a tweet following a 52-minute conversation she held with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Hammill added that Democrats were awaiting the administration’s acceptance of a national plan on coronavirus testing and tracing and that heads of congressional committees were still holding discussions.Many Senate Republicans have resisted legislation of a scope that Pelosi and Mnuchin have discussed, totaling around $2 trillion, and Hammill said that progress depends on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreeing to a comprehensive bill. Earlier on Monday, Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues: “Ten days after Secretary Mnuchin went on CNBC to declare that he was accepting our testing plan, the administration still refuses to do so.” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House that talks have slowed but were continuing on Monday. “There are still a number of areas in her plan that the president cannot accept, just can’t accept it,” Kudlow said of Pelosi. “I will also say, there are a number of targeted areas that we really think would help the economy.” Pelosi and President Donald Trump have been trading accusations for days about who needed to act in order to cement another round of Covid-19 aid before Election Day, with Trump’s fellow Senate Republicans off to the sidelines.Sticking points remain around aid for state and local governments grappling with the devastating economic fallout of the pandemic and provisions around immigration and healthcare, Kudlow said.Kudlow would not speculate on chances for a deal before the election. “I am not here to be either optimistic or pessimistic,” he said.

The disclaimer included a link to a page highlighting how mail voting was legal and safe.Many states have expanded early voting and the use of mail-in ballots ahead of the Nov. 3 election, as some Americans try to avoid crowded polls during the coronavirus pandemic.Trump has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting, claiming without evidence that it will lead to widespread fraud. Democrats have argued it is a safe and reliable alternative to in-person voting. Twitter has also previously flagged posts from Trump, including a tweet earlier this month in which Trump claimed he was immune to the coronavirus, with the social media company saying the tweet had made “misleading health claims”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-flags-donald-trump-s-tweet-on-mail-in-ballots-over-disputed-content/story-Mr7lVhG1qELT8qUyb5xieO.html

27-10-2020||World||Not doing many rallies to prevent spread of Covid-19, says Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has justified his decision not to hold public rallies and restrict his travel, arguing that he does not want to be a Covid-19 super spreader.The US had more than 481,372 new cases of Covid-19 last week, setting a record for the most new infections reported in a week since the pandemic began. Nearly half the country set records for new Covid-19 cases in a week while five states had a record number of deaths in a week: Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The US reports a new Covid-19 case every 1.26 seconds, according to a USA Today analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Worldwide, there have been more than 43 million coronavirus infections. “The big difference between us - and reason why it looks like we’re not traveling -we’re not putting on super spreaders. We are doing what we’re doing here,” Biden, 77, told reporters in his home State of Delaware on Monday. “Everybody’s wearing a mask and trying as best we can to be socially distanced. And that’s what we’re doing. You’ve attended a number of our press conferences as well. It’s important to be responsible,” Biden said. The former vice president, who is leading in national polls against his Republican rival incumbent President Donald Trump, exuded confidence of winning the November 3 election. “You know me. I am not overconfident about anything. I just wanna make sure we can earn every vote possible. That’s why we’re here. And you know that- that blue wall has to be re-established. With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbours, I’m gonna win Pennsylvania. It’s a matter of a great deal to me personally as well as politically,” he said. “I think we’re gonna win Michigan. I think we’re gonna win Wisconsin. I think we’re gonna win Minnesota. I think we have a fighting chance in Ohio. I think we have a fighting chance in North Carolina. We have a fighting chance in Georgia. A fighting chance in Iowa. So fortunately because of over six million individual voters average contributors - average contribution USD 49 we’re able to compete. Like we haven’t been able to compete before in all these different states,” he said. Biden said he will trave to Iowa, Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida and maybe other places as well. “There’s a lot we’ve been doing as well in terms of being online and social ..everything from fundraising efforts to making sure we meet. I met today with a group of leaders in the Democratic Party laying out where we’re gonna go. Getting their input and the like,” he asserted. Biden slammed Trump for his alleged failure to control coronavirus. “The bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to try to lead us through this pandemic. He either doesn’t have any idea what to do or he just doesn’t care. On Friday, Dr. Tony Fauci, the nation’s most respected infectious disease expert, publicly acknowledged that the president has not even met with his Covid-19 team for months,” he said. On Monday evening, his campaign announced that Biden would be travelling to the battleground state of Michigan later this week to “discuss bringing Americans together to address the crises facing the country.” Trump had won the 2016 elections in Michigan by just 10,000 votes, the lowest in presidential elections. Both Trump and his vice president Mike Pence are campaigning in Michigan this week. Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris was in Michigan over the weekend. Jill Biden is also planning to campaign in Michigan on behalf of her husband this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-doing-many-rallies-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19-says-joe-biden/story-Gw1sjv8QniUsvhUhSKV9qN.html
27-10-2020||World||India calls for Middle East countries to stop support for terrorist forces||Underlining that political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the Middle East, India on Monday called on concerned parties in the region to completely stop support to terrorist forces like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others.In a statement during the United Nations Security Council Open Debate on ‘The Situation in the Middle East’, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative at the UN, highlighted New Delhi’s stand on “interlinked and mutually reinforcing challenges” faced by the people of the Middle East and noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has only “exacerbated the threats posed by these challenges”.India has invested much in the peace and stability of the region by deploying its personnel as part of UN peacekeeping forces, through humanitarian assistance, development cooperation and capacity building, and will continue its contribution towards peace-building in the Middle East, Tirumurti said.“It is an unfortunate reality that the interlinked and mutually reinforcing challenges faced by the people of the Middle East have not yet been resolved. Political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the region. The covid-pandemic has only exacerbated the threats posed by these challenges,” the statement read.“India calls on concerned parties to completely stop support to terrorist forces like ISIL and others. India also urges all parties in the region to work constructively and in good faith to promote peace, stability and development for the benefit of all people in the Middle East,” it added.Stressing that Palestinian aspirations for a sovereign and independent state are yet to be fulfilled, Tirumurti said India urges Israel and Palestine to resume direct negotiations at the earliest and asked the international community to take concrete steps towards resuming and facilitating these negotiations quickly.“India has been unwavering in its commitment to the Palestinian cause and continues to remain supportive of a peaceful negotiated resolution of the Palestinian issue. India has supported the two-State solution as a just and acceptable solution to the conflict. Establishment of a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel, within mutually agreed borders should be achieved through negotiations directly by the two parties,” the statement read.Tirumurti asserted that any “stalemate could strengthen the hands of extremists and shut the door to cooperation thereby jeopardising the security, stability and prosperity of the people on both sides and the region”.He noted that India supports Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s call for an international conference organised by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to engage all concerned parties in a meaningful peace process.New Delhi also appreciated the agreement between the two main Palestinian political parties--Fatah and Hamas--for holding Parliamentary and Presidential elections and also elections for the Palestinian National Council, which will help fulfil the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people“Similarly, the truce between Israel and Hamas has eased the humanitarian situation in Gaza. India hopes that the temporary truce is converted into a permanent ceasefire, which can save precious human lives on both sides and create a conducive environment for talks,” the statement read.India also welcomed the agreements for normalisation of relations between Israel and UAE and Bahrain. Tirumurti said that India has always supported peace and stability in West Asia, which is its extended neighbourhood.On the armed conflict in Syria, India said that surging inflation, near halt in economic activities and severe sanctions, have accentuated the humanitarian crisis in the country marred by decade long conflict which has claimed over 400,000 lives, displaced 6.2 million people internally and compelled another 6.3 million people to seek shelter in neighbouring countries.“2.5 million children have been deprived of schooling and 50 per cent of infrastructure has been destroyed. Surging inflation, near halt in economic activities and severe sanctions, have accentuated the humanitarian crisis. While we are heartened to see a return of normalcy to major parts of the country, we are also reminded of the enormous resources that would be required to provide urgent humanitarian aid, rebuild infrastructure, enable the return of the refugees and restore a normal and dignified life of all Syrians,” the statement read.New Delhi said it is not only contributing to the return of normalcy and rebuilding of Syria but has also consistently called for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict through a Syrian-led dialogue.“India is not only contributing to the return of normalcy and rebuilding of Syria but has also consistently called for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict through a Syrian-led dialogue, taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria. In that context, we remain supportive of both the Geneva and Astana processes,” it added.The envoy stated that India remains concerned about the security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and encourages all parties to engage constructively with the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for early finalisation of the Joint Declaration paving the way for a peaceful political transition in Yemen.“The recent exchange of prisoners by the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah, who had been detained in connection with the conflict, is a welcome development. India hopes that the parties will take more confidence-building measures to provide the necessary impetus for the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. India also encourages all parties to engage constructively with the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for early finalisation of the Joint Declaration paving the way for a peaceful political transition in Yemen. India also hopes for peace and stability in Iraq with full respect for Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the envoy noted.In the aftermath of the August 4 blast that brought destruction to vast swathes of Beirut and inflicted heavy loss of lives, Tirumurti said India stood in solidarity with Lebanon.“We sent emergency humanitarian aid of over 58 MT to Beirut. We look forward to the swift formation of a new government that can offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN said.“The commencement of discussions on the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon is a significant development. I am hopeful that this will provide an opportunity to resolve the longstanding issue between the two countries,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-for-middle-east-countries-to-stop-support-for-terrorist-forces/story-tbSzlL5DmIKe6G8ohv42VL.html

He has been raising false alarms about large-scale fraud in anticipation of an adverse outcome and he has refused to commit himself to accepting the verdict.At the swearing-in ceremony, President Trump said, “It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth woman to serve on our nation’s highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice.”Barrett is the mother of seven children, many of them still in school. At 48, she will be the youngest justice on the court and has been a judge on the seventh circuit court of appeals since 2017, also as a Trump nominee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barrett-sworn-in-becoming-youngest-justice-of-us-surpreme-court/story-Nr0ANqpSoQkmnpzzsRxxpO.html

It will be absolutely EPIC, and the only thing that could make it better is having YOU there,” Trump said in a fundraising solicitation.(Read: Donald Trump, Joe Biden hit battleground Pennsylvania amid Covid crisis)For Trump, an election night party at his own hotel is symbolic for a businessman who leveraged his celebrity as a reality star and New York real estate magnate to win the nation’s highest office.Critics see it as one more reminder of how the president has used his office to personally profit as foreign leaders, conservative supporters and administration officials use the lobby of Washington’s Trump International Hotel as an unofficial clubhouse for the Trump presidency.Since 2017, the president and Republican National Committee have held several fundraisers at the president’s Washington hotel in the historic Old Post Office building, which the president’s company leases from the federal government.Over the course of his presidency, the Trump campaign, the RNC and their joint-fundraising committees have spent over $7.4 million at Trump-branded properties.The Washington hotel, which is blocks from the White House, has been sold out for weeks for Election Day as well as the days before and after Nov. 3. A basic room then is going for $1,200 a night, nearly triple the $476 room rate on Monday.“Donald Trump has spent his entire presidency funneling taxpayer, campaign, special interest and foreign government money into the business that he still owns,” said Donald Sherman, deputy director of the nonprofit government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “In some ways, election night is going to be the pinnacle of his self dealing.”The White House referred questions on the president’s election night plans to the Trump campaign, which did not respond to requests for comment.It’s unclear how big Trump’s election night party will be. The District of Columbia, under coronavirus protocols, has capped mass gatherings at 50 people.The president has sidestepped the district’s rules, which hold no weight on federal property, at other recent events. The president hosted hundreds of people on the White House grounds for an Independence Day weekend celebration, for his Republican National Convention speech in August and again at last month’s Rose Garden announcement of the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.Several attendees, including Trump, tested positive for the coronavirus in the days following Barrett’s event. Few guests wore masks.District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters on Monday that she had heard of plans for an election night party and added, “We will be in touch with our licensee, which is the hotel.”Bowser also more broadly questioned Trump’s wisdom in holding large gatherings at a moment when cases are spiking in the U.S. Shortly after Barrett won Senate confirmation, Trump hosted a ceremony Monday evening on the South Lawn of the White House during which Barrett took the oath of office.“You can believe that you can go to the White House and get Covid and that nothing’s going to happen to you. Perhaps,” Bowser said. “Or you can die from it.”Trump held his 2016 election party in his then-hometown of New York. But he booked his victory party at New York’s Hilton in Midtown Manhattan because his own nearby Trump International Hotel & Tower didn’t have a big enough room.It’s unclear how much of a presence Trump himself will be in the election night festivities this time. With a significant portion of the electorate opting to mail in their ballots, that could delay tabulation of results.Sherman noted that Trump, whenever he leaves office, will have a Secret Service detail for the rest of his life like other past presidents. With every Trump trip to one of his properties, taxpayers will cover the tab of agents protecting the 45th president.“I have a high level of confidence that Donald Trump will find a way to have government or special interest money go to his hotels regardless of the outcome of next week’s election,” Sherman said.___Associated Press writer Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-eyes-hosting-election-night-party-at-his-hotel-in-washington-dc/story-EdkmWyjj65kkLyJwThjI1M.html

27-10-2020||World||More English cities face tightest Covid-19 lockdown rules||Britain announced wider coronavirus restrictions on Monday which will take the number of people under England’s highest category of alert to nearly 8 million, as the government battles a sharp rise in cases.The number of new Covid cases has risen by almost a quarter over the past week to 153,483, and new Covid deaths were 50% higher than the week before at 1,272, taking fatalities over the course of the pandemic to 44,998, the highest in Europe.From 0001 GMT on Tuesday Warrington in northwest England will be classified as the highest Tier 3 alert level, Britain’s health ministry said.Local authorities in Nottingham in central England and three nearby towns said they would have similar restrictions from Thursday, the first areas outside northern England to do this.Under these curbs, people from different households are no longer allowed to socialise outdoors, adding to an existing ban on indoor socialising in much of England, while pubs and bars that do not serve food must shut.More than 7 million people across northern England, including major cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, are already under these restrictions.Schools, shops and restaurants in England are allowed to stay open, unlike the first lockdown in March and April.Other parts of the United Kingdom have imposed stricter curbs than Britain’s central government, which only has direct control over health policy in England.Wales has shut all non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants in a 17-day lockdown which began on Friday, and Scotland has severe curbs on hospitality across most of the country.Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers are also closed in Northern Ireland until Nov. 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-english-cities-face-tightest-covid-19-lockdown-rules/story-kdOR9S8SJiXCunn8Opcd3K.html
27-10-2020||World||Thai protesters shun parliament, ask Germany to probe king||Pro-democracy demonstrators in Thailand have expanded their protests internationally, marching to the German Embassy to appeal to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to investigate whether Thailand’s king has exercised political power during his extended stays in Bavaria.The protesters acted while criticizing their own Parliament, which began a special two-day session earlier Monday to address political tensions resulting from the near-daily pro-democracy protests demanding the prime minister’s resignation, constitutional changes and reforms to the monarchy.They believe the king wields an inordinate amount of power in what is nominally a democracy under a constitutional monarchy.The scrutiny and public criticism of the monarchy displayed by some of the protesters is unprecedented in a country where the royal institution has been considered sacrosanct. It has also led royalists to stage counter-rallies and to denounce the protesters for raising the issue, increasing the risk of confrontation.The protesters, estimated by an Associated Press journalist to number between 5,000 and 10,000, defied police warnings that they constituted an illegal assembly and marched to the embassy in an effort to bring attention to the time King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends in Germany. The king in recent weeks has been in Thailand with a busy schedule of ceremonial events.A statement from the protest group said they presented a letter to embassy officials asking that Germany investigate whether the king “has conducted Thai politics using his royal prerogative from German soil or not.”It said such action could be considered a violation of Germany’s territorial sovereignty, and suggested that its government consider the protesters’ request with the aim of bringing the king back to Thailand to restore the country “to the path of the truthful constitutional monarchy.”In addition to asking whether the king is carrying out his official royal duties in Germany, the letter provocatively echoed points on which the protesters have previously criticized the king.Germany is seen as receptive to their entreaties.The German government already brought up the issue in early October, when Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, responding to a question in Parliament, expressed concern over any political activities the king might be conducting in the country.On Monday in Berlin, Maas spoke again, telling reporters the government was following developments in Thailand and was aware of the demonstrations and “people taking to the streets for their rights.” He added that he also was watching the king’s activities in Germany.“We have been examining this not only in recent weeks, but we are continuing to examine it in the long term, and if there are things we feel to be unlawful, then that will have immediate consequences,” Maas said.Vajiralongkorn has for years spent significant time in Germany, but it only became an issue after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016.Bhumibol was king for seven decades, and though he traveled extensively on state visits in the early years of his reign — including being welcomed with a ticker tape parade in New York City — he left the country only once after the 1960s, and that was an overnight stay in neighboring Laos.Vajiralongkorn’s ability to spend time abroad has been made easier by changes his office sought and received to the current constitution that no longer require him to appoint a regent when away from the kingdom.Defaming the monarchy can be punished by up to 15 years in prison under Thailand’s tough lese majeste law.Speaker of the House Chuan Leekpai cautioned at Monday’s special Parliament session that it was not to discuss the role of the monarchy.In his opening speech, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said he and his government are aware that this is an era of change, pushed by technology.“But we have to admit that in Thailand, millions, tens of millions of people do not want to see change through chaos,” he said, referring to different points of view toward the protesters and their demands. “Everyone has their own beliefs.”He called for Parliament to “creatively find a balance” between competing views.The protesters believe Prayuth, who led a coup ousting an elected government in 2014 when he was army chief, retained power unfairly in last year’s election because laws were changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters also say the constitution, written and enacted under military rule, is undemocratic.The protesters consider the government’s response insincere, noting the agenda for the non-voting session of Parliament does not include the protesters’ concerns but instead has thinly disguised criticism of the protests themselves.The points of discussion released by Prayuth’s government concern the risk of the coronavirus spreading at rallies, alleged interference with a royal motorcade by a small crowd earlier this month, illegal gatherings, and the destruction of images of the royal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-shun-parliament-ask-germany-to-probe-king/story-yU4KZIDROH4XOSLpKEM6sL.html
27-10-2020||World||Southern California: Growing wildfires force evacuation orders for over 100,000||Fast-moving wildfires forced evacuation orders for more than 100,000 people and seriously injured two firefighters in Southern California on Monday as powerful winds across the state prompted power to be cut to hundreds of thousands to prevent utility equipment from sparking new blazes.A smoky fire exploded in size to over 11 square miles (29 square kilometers) after breaking out around dawn in Orange County, south of Los Angeles. Gusts pushed flames along brushy ridges in Silverado Canyon and near houses in the sprawling city of Irvine, home to about 280,000 residents. There was no containment.Two firefighters, one 26 and the other 31 years old, were critically injured while battling the blaze, according to the county’s Fire Authority, which didn’t provide details on how the injuries occurred. They each suffered second- and third-degree burns over large portions of their bodies and were intubated at a hospital, officials said.Nearby, a much smaller fire in the Yorba Linda area prompted the evacuation of at least 10,000 people, officials said.At the Irvine-area fire, Kelsey Brewer and her three roommates decided to leave their townhouse before the evacuation order came in. The question was where to go in the pandemic. They decided on the home of her girlfriend’s mother, who has ample space and lives alone.“We literally talked about it this morning,” Brewer said, adding that she feels lucky to have a safe place to go. “We can only imagine how screwed everyone else feels. There’s nowhere you can go to feel safe.”Helicopters dropping water and fire retardant were grounded for much of the afternoon because strong winds made it unsafe to fly. However, a large air tanker and other aircraft began making drops again several hours before sunset.Officials didn’t immediately know the cause of the fires.Southern California Edison shut off power to nearly 40,000 customers in six counties — which includes the wildfire areas — as a precaution against the gusts knocking down equipment or tossing tree branches into power lines and sparking blazes.In the northern part of the state, Pacific Gas & Electric began restoring power to some of the 350,000 customers — an estimated 1 million people — in 34 counties that were left in the dark Sunday because of some of the fiercest winds of the fire season.PG&E said it had restored power to nearly 100,000 customers as winds eased in some areas, with electricity to be back on at the other homes and buildings by Tuesday night after crews make air and ground inspections to make repairs and ensure it’s safe.A dozen reports of damage had been received, PG&E said.However, the fire threat was far from over in many parts of PG&E’s vast service area.“We’re already starting to see winds pick back up,” hitting 50 mph (80.4 kph) in some regions with bone-dry humidity leading to extreme fire danger Monday evening, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E’s head of meteorology.The winds were expected to calm Monday night before renewing again Tuesday, the National Weather Service warned. Officials extended a red flag extreme fire danger warning through 5 p.m. Tuesday for the region’s eastern and northern mountainous areas.The safety shut-offs “probably did prevent dangerous fires last night. It’s almost impossible to imagine that winds of this magnitude would not have sparked major conflagrations in years past,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said on Twitter.A second round of gusts is predicted to sweep through the same areas Monday night,Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable. October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires, but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles (16,600 square kilometers) and destroyed about 9,200 homes, businesses and other buildings. There have been 31 deaths.The electricity shutdowns marked the fifth time this year that Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation’s largest utility, has cut power to customers to reduce the risk of downed or fouled power lines or other equipment that could ignite blazes amid bone-dry weather conditions and gusty winds.The conditions could equal those during devastating fires in California’s wine country in 2017 and last year’s Kincade Fire that devastated Sonoma County north of San Francisco last October, the National Weather Service said. Fire officials said PG&E transmission lines sparked that fire, which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly 100,000 people to flee.Many of this year’s devastating fires were started by thousands of dry lightning strikes, but some remain under investigation for potential electrical causes. While the biggest fires in California have been fully or significantly contained, more than 5,000 firefighters remain committed to 20 blazes, state fire officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/southern-california-growing-wildfires-force-evacuation-orders-for-over-100-000/story-iUurXdPx2bIrdHKUtc60cJ.html
27-10-2020||World||Protests in Italy over new coronavirus crackdown turn violent||Protesters turned out by the hundreds in Turin, Milan and other Italian cities and towns Monday to vent their anger, sometimes violently, at the latest pandemic restrictions that force restaurants and cafes to close early and shutter cinemas, gyms and other leisure venues.In the northern city of Turin, some demonstrators broke off from a peaceful protest, smashing store windows on an elegant shopping street, setting smoke bombs and hurling bottles at police in a main city square where the Piedmont regional government is headquartered, RAI state TV said.A photographer was injured by a hurled bottle, RAI said. Police fired tear gas to clear the protesters in Piazza del Castello.In that same square, hours earlier, some 300 taxis peacefully lined up in neat rows to draw attention to their economic losses from the implosion of tourism and disappearance of workers from the city center as they do their jobs remotely during the pandemic.Triggering the violence in Turin were a group of “ultras,” as violent soccer fans are known, the LaPresse news agency said. It said five of the protesters were detained by authorities.In Italy’s business capital, Milan, police used tear gas to scatter protesters Monday night, and an Associated Press journalist saw at least two people detained.The protests began shortly after the national government’s order took effect requiring bars, cafes and restaurants to close their doors at 6 pm for the next 30 days as Italy tries to rein the resurgence of coronavirus infections in recent weeks.Since most Italians don’t dine out before 7:30 pm at the earliest, the decree effectively wiped out most of the restaurants’ already reduced revenue in the pandemic, although takeout and delivery can continue until midnight.The crackdown was announced Sunday, a day after Italy registered more than a half million confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic’s outbreak.Last week, a peaceful march by shopkeepers and other business owners in Naples, upset about a regional curfew that orders citizens off the streets at 11 pm, turned violent near the Campania region’s headquarters. Investigators were quoted in Italian media as saying the violence, in which police officers were injured, bore the hand of the Camorra, the local organized crime group.A day later, an extreme right political group staged a violent demonstration in downtown Rome.Smaller cities, including Catania in Sicily, and towns also saw protests Monday. In Cremona, a town in northern Lombardy, restaurant owners turned out in front of the local interior ministry’s office. After banging pots and bans, they left them piled up in the street to highlight their economic woes worsened by the latest early-shutdown decree, the ANSA news agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-in-italy-over-new-coronavirus-crackdown-turn-violent/story-eox1Iu17v6cE9AM1bezYqO.html
27-10-2020||World||Iran’s foreign minister urges UN to unite against US unilateral actions||Iran’s foreign minister used his speech for the 75th anniversary of the United Nations to accuse the United States of initiating or joining eight wars since 200 that displaced 37 million people and resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives and “unprecedented extremism.”Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a virtual speech to the UN General Assembly that it was time for the 193-member world body “to recommit itself to stand up -- united -- against unilateralism and war” promoted by the United States.Zarif’s speech had scheduled to be broadcast on Sept. 21 when world leaders commemorated the UN’s 75th anniversary. But there were so many speakers that the speeches of 58 leaders and ministers were carried over and only shown Monday, two days after UN Day, which commemorates the entry into force of the UN Charter that officially established the United Nations on Oct. 24, 1945.Zarif quoted a study released last month by Brown University’s Costs of War project that estimated the United States’ wars since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 have forced at least 37 million people to flee their homes in the eight most violent conflicts -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and the Philippines.“How can we counter the unilateralism and disdain for international law by a bully that only knows wielding a big stick and speaking arrogantly?” Zarif asked, also citing US with battles American Indian tribes, the Civil War that ended slavery, and what he called “economic wars” resulting from US sanctions.“In fact, no one wins in a war,” the Iranian minister said. “It’s time to change tack -- saving American blood and treasure and sparing the world from further misery.”Zarif’s speech was shown on a screen in the General Assembly Hall as the Security Council was holding a virtual meeting on the Middle East at which Israel’s new UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, said “Iran and its terrorist proxies remain the biggest threats to peace and security in the region.”Ironically, he said, “Iran’s extreme and murderous ways” have brought moderate forces in the Middle East closer together, leading to Israel’s recent peace agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and new ties with Sudan. “It’s surprising, but I actually want to thank Iran” for the role it played in those agreements, he said.Erdan called on the Security Council to prevent Iran from continuing to develop its nuclear capabilities, obtaining advanced weapons and violating human rights. He called Iran “one of the biggest human rights violators in the world,” citing 4,300 executions during President Hassan Rouhani’s tenure, including minors, women, gays, journalists and anti-government protesters.Iran was also the agenda of the General Assembly’s human rights committee Monday where the UN independent investigator on the country’s human rights, Javaid Rehman, said the Iranian government must conduct an independent and transparent investigation into the crackdown on protests in November 2019 and January 2020 and bring violators to justice.Rehman, a professor of human rights and Islamic law at London’s Brunel University, said Iran has failed to conduct an investigation meeting international standards “despite clear evidence that Iranian security forces used excessive and lethal force, which caused the deaths of over 300 people, including women and children.”“The government and judiciary appear to be implementing death sentences against protesters to prevent peaceful dissent and restrict civic space,” he said. “The recent arbitrary execution of Navid Afkari for his participation in August 2018 protests is emblematic of this concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-foreign-minister-urges-un-to-unite-against-us-unilateral-actions/story-u8DhtPv0KJesFLSZvu0qXN.html
27-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden hit battleground Pennsylvania amid Covid crisis||President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden zeroed in on the critical battleground of Pennsylvania on Monday, demonstrating starkly different approaches to rallying voters just eight days before polls close during the worst public health crisis in a century.Trump drew thousands of largely mask-less supporters as he began a final-week charge through nearly a dozen states ahead of the election. Biden, taking a more cautious approach in effort to show that he’s taking the pandemic seriously, greeted a few dozen supporters outside a Chester, Pennsylvania, campaign field office.“Bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this pandemic,” Biden said as he sharpened his closing message into an indictment of Trump’s handling of the virus. Trump, meanwhile, stoked fears about Biden’s plans to address the outbreak.“It’s a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown,” Trump claimed at a rally in Allentown, focusing on the economy and the possibility of lost jobs.Trump was returning to the White House later to celebrate the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, expected Monday evening. Trump has sought to use the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month to animate conservative evangelical and Catholic voters to his candidacy, but the high court fight has been overshadowed by virus concerns.In Pennsylvania, Trump also touted the appointment of another conservative justice as potentially giving him an edge in election-related litigation surrounding a surge in absentee and mail ballots due to the pandemic.For each candidate, the differing campaign approaches carry risks.For Trump, the full-speed-ahead strategy could spread the virus in places that are already setting new records and leave him appearing aloof to the consequences. And if Biden comes up short in the election, his lower-key travel schedule will surely come under scrutiny as a missed opportunity.Trump’s campaign schedule suggested he’s on the defensive in Pennsylvania, viewed by his aides as critical to his path to 270 electoral votes. Biden, meanwhile, is demonstrating more confidence with signals that he’s hoping to expand his campaign map.In the closing days Biden plans to visit Georgia, a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, and Iowa, which Trump carried by more than 9 percentage points in 2016. He’s dispatching his running mate, Kamala Harris, later this week to Texas, which hasn’t backed a Democrat for the White House since Jimmy Carter in 1976.With more than a third of the expected ballots in the election already cast, it could become increasingly challenging for Trump and Biden to reshape the contours of the race. But both men are fighting for any endgame advantage. Biden is leading Trump in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many key battlegrounds.While the final week of the campaign is colliding with deepening concerns about the Covid crisis in far-flung parts of the US, Trump is anxious for voters to focus on almost anything else. He’s worried that he will lose if the election becomes a referendum on his handling of the pandemic. Biden, meanwhile, is working to ensure the race is just that, hitting Trump on the virus and presenting himself as a safer, more stable alternative.The stakes were clear this past weekend as the White House became the locus for a second outbreak of the virus in a month. Several close aides to Vice President Mike Pence tested positive, including his chief of staff, Marc Short. Pence, though, was insistent on maintaining his aggressive political calendar, even though he was deemed a “close contact,” claiming the status of an “essential employee.”Pence arrived at a rally in Hibbing, Minnesota, wearing a mask Monday but removed it as he reached the podium to speak to a crowd of supporters who were largely not wearing face coverings or social distancing. Hibbing police confirmed more than 650 people in attendance, exceeding Minnesota health guidelines to restrict crowds to 250 people.With Election Day just over a week away, average deaths per day across the country are up 10% over the past two weeks, from 721 to nearly 794 as of Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections per day are rising in 47 states, and deaths are up in 34.The latest national outbreak has provided a potent sign of the divergent approaches the Trump and Biden campaigns have taken to the virus. On Sunday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that “we’re not going to control the pandemic” and the focus should be on containment and treatment.Biden, in a statement, said Meadows’ comments continued with the Trump administration waving “the white flag of defeat” in the face of the virus.Trump fired back Monday as he arrived in Pennsylvania, saying Biden, with his concerns about the virus spread, has “waved a white flag on life.”He rejected Biden’s comments that the nation is facing a “dark winter,” saying, “No it’s not going to be a dark winter. It’s going to be a great winter. It’s going to be a great spring.”Biden’s team argues the coronavirus is likely to blot out any other issues that might come up in the final days of the campaign — including his recent debate-stage comment in which he affirmed he’d transition away from oil, later walking that back as a transition away from federal subsidies. That strategy appeared to pay off as the outbreak in Pence’s staff refocused the national conversation once again on the pandemic.Trump and his team, meanwhile, have struggled to settle on a closing message, with the undisciplined candidate increasingly trusting his instincts over his advisers. He’s grasped for dirt on his Democratic rival and used apocalyptic terms to describe a Biden presidency, but Biden has thus far proven more resistant to such attacks than Trump’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.Anticipating a razor-thin Electoral College margin, Trump has an aggressive schedule including a visit Omaha, Nebraska, Tuesday after a Sunday visit to Maine, aiming to lock up one electoral vote in each of the states that award them by congressional district. Trump is scheduled hold a dizzying 11 rallies in the final 48 hours before polls close.Biden is sitting on more campaign cash than Trump and is putting it to use, blanketing airwaves with a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over the final two weeks. The incessant campaign ads feature both upbeat messages and blistering criticism of Trump’s handling of the pandemic.Democrats have been heartened by their lead in the record numbers of early votes that have been cast across a number of battleground states — though they caution that Republicans are more likely to turn out on Election Day and certain to make up ground.Four years ago, Clinton also enjoyed a lead in national and some state polls, and Democrats say their complacency doomed their candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-hit-battleground-pennsylvania-amid-covid-crisis/story-uMPtKFy4gXPZpYXv8M00gM.html
27-10-2020||World||Senate confirms Amy Coney Barrett to US Supreme Court||The Senate voted 52-48 Monday to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court, giving the court a 6-3 conservative majority that could determine the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights.All Democrats in the chamber voted against Barrett’s confirmation, as did Republican Susan Collins of Maine, who agreed with Democratic objections to confirming a justice so close to the Nov. 3 election.President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in the Senate pushed for a quick confirmation of Barrett, and it came just 38 days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who for 27 years anchored the court’s liberal wing. Trump had said he wanted his replacement for Ginsburg in place to avoid a deadlocked court should the outcome of the presidential election depend on a ruling, as was the case in 2000.A White House swearing-in ceremony for Barrett is being planned for Monday evening with Justice Clarence Thomas set to administer the oath of office.The highly partisan vote on the confirmation mirrors the divisions in the country leading up to the election and on some of the issues that will be before the high court in the near future. Those issues include the validity of the Affordable Care Act and the status of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion rights nationwide, as well as voting and civil rights.The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the ACA, the law known as Obamacare, a week after the election. The Trump administration is urging the court to declare the law invalid, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.The Mississippi attorney general, meanwhile, has pitched the court to take up her state’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks in a case that could sharply limit Roe and for the first time let states outlaw the procedure before a fetus becomes viable.Trump has said he wants the justices he’s selected for the court -- there are now three of them -- to invalidate Obamacare and overturn Roe v. Wade.The court is already addressing pre-election skirmishes over the rules for casting and counting ballots in the contest between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.Just last week, the court deadlocked 4-4 on how many days Pennsylvania could wait after Election Eay for mail-in votes to arrive, leaving in force a three-day extension for the receipt of absentee ballots in the pivotal state. Barrett could provide the fifth vote to overturn any state court ruling that expands voting, or otherwise favors Democrats.The court also is scheduled to hear arguments Nov. 30 on Trump’s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 census, a case that could determine the allocation of House seats and federal dollars.Barrett, 48, has served on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals since 2017 and taught at Notre Dame Law School. In three days of testimony during her confirmation hearings, Barrett stressed she would be independent, while asserting she had no agenda but to follow the Constitution and the law. She deflected questions on how she might rule on issues such as abortion, despite having the clearest anti-abortion record of any nominee in decades.Barrett’s nomination so close to the election and the rapid confirmation process drew an angry response from Democrats, who pointed to the refusal of Senate Republicans to even give a hearing to President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill a vacancy that arose in February 2016 because it was an election year.While the number of justices has been set at nine since 1869, that experience and the Barrett nomination has ignited a campaign by Democratic activists to expand the court in retaliation, though that idea hasn’t been embraced by Biden or Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.Biden has said he would appoint a commission to consider court reform, while Schumer has said everything would be on the table next year if Democrats take back the Senate.Republicans have long seen court battles as a key motivator for turning out their base, and Republican senators including Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are pinning their re-election hopes in large part on their successful efforts to shift to the courts to the right.They won’t have to wait long see whether their efforts bear fruit at the ballot box.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-confirms-amy-coney-barrett-to-us-supreme-court/story-yW5s4Ny0ciHVQ7LBIY0K6K.html
27-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett to seal SC confirmation||The Republican-controlled US Senate is poised to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, as the next justice to the Supreme Court on Monday, a move that will tilt the country’s highest court further to the right for years to come.No nominee to the Supreme Court has ever been confirmed by the Senate this close to a presidential election.The rush to confirm Barrett, 48, has bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans, who are expected to split along party lines on the final vote. Trump has said repeatedly he wants her in place to vote on any election-related cases that go to the court.With Republicans controlling the chamber 53-47 and no indication of an internal revolt against the conservative appeals court judge succeeding liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett looks almost certain to take up a lifetime appointment on the bench over universal Democratic opposition.Several Republicans who previously expressed concerns about rushing the process, including Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, are expected to approve Barrett’s nomination.With Barrett confirmed, the Supreme Court will have a solid 6-3 conservative majority.The White House planned a Monday night celebration of the expected confirmation, a month after a similar event was linked to a Covid-19 outbreak that preceded President Donald Trump’s own infection.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters the event planned for Monday evening likely would be held outdoors. “Tonight, we’ll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible,” Meadows said.Barrett is expected to participate in a crucial hearing on November 10, where Trump and his fellow Republicans will ask the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act. The 2010 healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare, has helped millions of Americans obtain medical insurance and protected those with pre-existing conditions.During her confirmation hearing before the Senate judiciary committee this month, Barrett, a favourite of Christian conservatives, sidestepped questions on abortion, presidential powers, climate change, voting rights, Obamacare and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-to-seal-sc-confirmation/story-bu2EUnXUoXRNpTvVNbQ40M.html
27-10-2020||World||‘Facebook gearing for post-poll unrest in US’||Facebook is preparing for possible unrest after polls close on the November 3 presidential elections, with its internal tools used for “at-risk” countries likely to be deployed for the US, The Wall Street Journal reported.The measures include slowing the spread of viral content and lowering the bar for suppressing potentially inflammatory posts, WSJ quoted people familiar with the developments as saying.These tools were used in the past for Sri Lanka and Myanmar and are part of a larger tool kit developed by Facebook to prepare for the US election, it said.“We’ve spent years building for safer, more secure elections,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone was quoted as saying. “We’ve applied lessons from previous elections, hired experts, and built new teams with experience across different areas to prepare for various scenarios.”The tools will be deployed only in dire circumstances such as election-related violence. The likely steps include tweaking the news feed to change what types of content users see, the report said. The Kremlin said on Monday that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s assessment of Russia as the biggest threat to US national security was wrong and encouraged hatred of Russia.“We absolutely do not agree,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call, when asked to comment on Biden’s assessment. “We can only regret that absolute hatred of the Russian Federation is spread in this way.” On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he saw nothing criminal in Hunter Biden’s past business ties with Ukraine or Russia, marking out his disagreement with one of Donald Trump’s attack lines in the presidential election. He was responding to comments made by Trump during televised debates. Trump has used the debates to make accusations that Biden and his son Hunter engaged in unethical practices in Ukraine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-gearing-for-post-poll-unrest-in-us/story-Z3lVs2JBpZOKTRtiFcJlXP.html
27-10-2020||World||Oxford vaccine tests raise hopes||One of the world’s leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces an immune response in both young and old adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus.The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people. The global cases have crossed 43 million.“It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher,” an AstraZeneca spokesman said. “The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,” the spokesman said, referring to the vaccine’s technical name.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate.The news that older people get an immune response is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus. If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.British health secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll-out mostly in the first half of 2021.Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: “I don’t rule that out but that is not my central expectation.”“The programme is progressing well, (but) we’re not there yet,” Hancock said.Meanwhile, The Sun newspaper reported that staff at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in London have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford vaccine. The hospital was told to prepare for the vaccine from the “week commencing the November 2”, it said.The newspaper said clinical trials at the hospital have been paused as all resources have been diverted to prepare vaccination of thousands of doctors, nurses and other front-line staff.China is testing millions of people in Xinjiang region, with 137 asymptomatic cases detected so far, the highest number of such infections in seven months. The tests followed the discovery of a cluster linked to a garment factory.The new cases were found on Sunday during a drive to test 4.75 million people in the Kashgar area triggered by an asymptomatic infection in a 17-year-old female factory worker.France has “lost control of the epidemic,” said Prof Jean-François Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council that advises the government, a day after health authorities reported more than 52,000 new cases in the country.Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her party colleagues that Germany is on the verge of losing control of its fight against the virus. With 12,500 cases per week, Belgium’s intensive care units are at risk of being overrun.Meanwhile, Australia’s second-biggest city Melbourne will exit its coronavirus lockdown after nearly four months, with no new daily cases or deaths recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-vaccine-tests-raise-hopes/story-p58aMuoSi7ppYL6PGQgAcJ.html

The operator told PTI, “This step has been taken by the NMRC for the inclusion and meaningful participation of the members of the transgender community. As per Census 2011, there are 4.9 lakh transgenders in India, out of whom around 35,000 are staying in NCR. These numbers may have increased manifold in the present scenario”.Gautam Buddh Nagar lawmaker Mahesh Sharma, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and NMRC managing director Ritu Maheshwari unveiled the new name of the station in the presence of six members of the transgender community, who have been recruited by NMRC through contractors for services at the Metro station. The artwork and look of the Pride Station have also been changed to signify the essence and spirit of the members of the transgender community.NMRC had called for suggestions online for the new name of the station and maximum people suggested the name “Pride”. “The station has been named ‘Pride’ as the NMRC feels extremely proud and privileged to have qualified members of the transgender community as part of the NMRC family. It also instils a sense of pride among the community and this step by NMRC is bound to be a ray of hope to uplift the members of this community and help in breaking stereotypes about them so that they too can live a dignified life with their head held high,” NMRC said in a statement.The Pride Station, though dedicated to the transgenders, will be open for all passengers and will also provide employment opportunities for the transgender community.In 2017, the Kochi Metro Rail Limited in Kerala had taken a similar step by employing 23 transgenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pride-station-north-india-s-first-metro-station-dedicated-to-transgenders-in-noida/story-SYuCwRuTBV8VsuhVePyHbJ.html

27-10-2020||India||Chhattisgarh passes amendment bill to counter centre’s farm bills||The Chhattisgarh assembly on Tuesday approved the Chhattisgarh Krishi Upaj Mandi (Amendment) Bill 2020 that declared the entire state as a market for selling agriculture produce to negate the Centre’s farm laws that allowed private players to directly buy produce from farmers.Introducing the amendment bill in the House, state’s agriculture minister Ravindra Choubey said it is aimed at protecting farmers of the state from fluctuating market prices and payment risks.Amendments have been made in the Mandi Act so that farmers can get better prices against their produce. The bill has provision to safeguard the interests of the farmers and at the same time it doesn’t violate any Central laws, thus avoiding confrontation with the Centre, he said.The minister said the state government could have brought an ordinance and enforce the law but looking at the present scenario across the country, the state decided to call this special session for the purpose, he added.Speaking over the objective of the bill, Choubey said, “There are 80 percent small and marginal farmers in the state. Since these marginal and small farmers neither have the capacity to store food grains nor to bargain on its prices in the market, it has become necessary to establish ‘Deemed Mandi (Market)’ and electronic trading platform in their benefit so that they can get the right price for their produce without being impacted by market fluctuations”.Also read: Covid-19 fear looms large among officials as Bihar readies to go to pollsChoubey said in this bill, an amendment Deemed Mandi has been added with Mandi and the state has defined Deemed Mandi as private markets.The state government may, by another notification, declare/establish deemed market which shall be known as deemed market of the market established under sub-section (l) for the purpose of this Act, sale-purchase, processing and manufacturing, cold storage, silos, warehouse, electronic trading and transaction platform and other such places or structures, in respect of the agricultural produce specified in the schedule.The amendment bill also has the provision to ensure power to the secretary or any employee of the market committee or the board, who is empowered by the competent authority or notified officers to order production of accounts relating to the purchase and sale of the notified agricultural produce from any person.Provisions have been added wherein state government departments/officials have been given right to inspection and, if required, seizure as well. They also have the right to inspect storage (godowns) and vehicles and seize if required. The bill has also defined the rights of courts.The state government may establish an electronic trading platform for the sale of notified agriculture produce. Farmer/seller should sell his produce to the local market as well as other markets of the state and traders of other states through a transparent auction process on the basis of quality to get better price and timely online payment, Chaubey said.Meanwhile, while discussing the Chhattisgarh Agricultural Produce Market (Amendment) Bill 2020 in the special session of the legislative assembly, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said that the new agricultural law introduced by the central government is not for the farmers but for the capitalists.Baghel criticised the three agricultural laws passed by the central government and while underlining the shortcomings of these laws said that the Chattisgarh government wants to protect the interests of farmers and also the business sector of Chhattisgarh.“People of Chhattisgarh are innocent. Hence, we take it as our responsibility to protect the interests of farmers and general consumers by amending the Mandi Act,” the CM said.Expressing disagreement towards the idea of opening private markets under the new law of central government, CM said that this seems like a conspiracy to abolish government mandis. “This law would gradually destroy the mandis,” the chief minister said, adding, “the way chit fund companies looted people, similarly, the farmers and the common consumers will be looted through these new laws passed by the central government”.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-passes-amendment-bill-to-counter-centre-s-farm-bills/story-9V5SdvuQmYMiLf9EnU2QcM.html
27-10-2020||India||Role of elusive businessman in Kerala smuggling racket baffles probe team||The multi-agency team probing the Kerala gold smuggling case has come across a Middle East-based elusive businessman Dawood al Arabi after interrogating some of the accused. They reportedly told the agencies that he invested heavily in the smuggling network and runs a thriving hawala racket also, a senior officer part of the investigation team said. Officials suspect that he may be an Indian but took a fictitious name to confuse authorities. One of the main accused K T Ramees was the first to take his name and later others also named him. Now agencies are trying to ascertain whether this is a real name or a fake one. During investigation they also found that the accused were using code names in WhatasApp and Telegram chats. They expect after interrogating Rabin Hameed, who was extradited from the UAE on Monday, they will get more information on this kingpin. Usually in smuggling cases carriers and their immediate contacts are arrested and funders and end- users always slip out. This time central agencies have been given clear instructions to get to the bottom of the racket that is posing a serious threat to the economy of the country. Despite the high-profile case smuggling continues unabated-- the in last one week 25 kg of gold was seized from four international airports in different cases. In the remand report of Hameed, the NIA said he played an important role in the network and suspected to have links with subversive elements. He was later remanded to the custody of NIA for five days. He is 10th accused in the NIA’s probe. A senior official said third accused Faizal Fareed will also be extradited from Dubai in a couple of days. Both were reportedly arrested by Dubai police after the NIA alerted it. Earlier it had issued a blue corner notice against them after securing arrest warrants from a local court. “We are at the fag end of our investigation and we will not spare anyone involved in the crime,” said the official. The sensational smuggling case surfaced on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized by the customs from a package camouflaged as a diplomatic consignment addressed to the UAE consulate. Later PS Sarith Kumar, a former public relations officer of the consulate who came to receive the luggage, was arrested. Two other suspects, Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. CM’s former secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced. The High Court had stayed his arrest till Oct 28.A multi-agency team comprising the National Investigation Agency, Enforcement Directorate, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Customs and Income Tax is probing the case and 31 people have been arrested so far. There are reports that smuggling was going on for more than a year through the UAE consulate and they smuggled at least 400 kg of gold in several consignments. Kerala higher education minister K T Jaleel was also investigated in connection with one of the consignments that came last March. But the minister said the consignment carried only religious books. Interrogated twice, central agencies are yet to give him a clean chit. In a related development, the statement of wife of accused Sandip Nair was leaked out to the media. In her statement to the ED she reportedly said her husband was working for a smugglers’ gang in Koduvally, a small town in Kozhikode known for its gold ornaments and designs, and it was controlled by legislator Karat Razak, CPI (M)-backed independent. But the MLA denied this and said it was part of a conspiracy to implicate him in the case. Earlier another CPI (M) leader from the area Karat Faizal was also questioned by the Customs and ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/role-of-elusive-businessman-in-kerala-smuggling-racket-baffles-probe-team/story-Mv9tJvXEb5fFdCjDV1fKxO.html

Some patients’ brains may age 10 years||People recovering from Covid-19 may suffer significant brain function impacts, with the worst cases of the infection linked to mental decline equivalent to the brain ageing by 10 years, researchers warned on Tuesday. A non-peer-reviewed study of more than 84,000 people, led by Adam Hampshire, a doctor at Imperial College London, found that in some severe cases, coronavirus infection is linked to substantial cognitive deficits for months.“Our analyses ... align with the view that there are chronic cognitive consequences of having Covid-19,” the researchers wrote in a report of their findings. “People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits.” Cognitive tests measure how well the brain performs tasks –- such as remembering words or joining dots on a puzzle. Such tests are widely used to assess brain performance in diseases like Alzheimer’s, and can also help doctors assess temporary brain impairments.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHampshire’s team analysed results from 84,285 people who completed a study called the Great British Intelligence Test. The findings, which have yet to be reviewed by other experts, were published online on the MedRxiv website The cognitive deficits were “of substantial effect size”, particularly among people who had been hospitalised with Covid-19, the researchers said, with the worst cases showing impacts “equivalent to the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70”.Scientists not directly involved with the study, however, said its results should be viewed with some caution. “The cognitive function of the participants was not known pre-Covid, and the results also do not reflect long-term recovery - so any effects on cognition may be short term,” said Joanna Wardlaw, a professor of applied neuroimaging at Edinburgh University.Derek Hill, a professor of medical imaging science at University College London, also noted that the study’s findings could not be entirely reliable, since they did not compare before and after scores, and involved a large number of people who self-reported having had Covid-19, who had no positive test. “Overall (this is) an intriguing but inconclusive piece of research into the effect of Covid on the brain,” Hill said. “As researchers seek to better understand the long term impact of Covid, it will be important to further investigate the extent to which cognition is impacted in the weeks and months after the infection, and whether permanent damage to brain function results in some people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-s-cognitive-costs-some-patients-brains-may-age-10-years/story-o3SxdfVanfpS9zzMvXyQMP.html

27-10-2020||India||India reached 1 million Covid-19 recoveries in 13 days: Health ministry||India took 13 days to reach one million recoveries, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to see a downward trend in the country. On Tuesday, India registered a sharp fall in its daily cases as the country logged a total of 36,470 new infections in the last 24 hours, taking the overall caseload closer to the eight million mark to 7,946,429.“It took us 57 days to register a recovery of 10 lakhs from 1 lakh. However, the latest 10 lakh recoveries have been achieved in 13 days which is a satisfactory sign,” Rajesh Bhushan, health secretary, said during a media briefing on the Covid-19 situation in India.Bhushan informed that Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka are five states that reported 58% of new Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours. He said that 78% of active cases are present in 10 states and Union territories. These include Maharashtra, which is accounting for 21.52% of total cases, followed by Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 15%, 12.05%, 5.94%, 4.68%, 4.6% respectively. “During the festival season, cases have increased in Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi,” Bhushan also said.In a positive sign, the recovery rate has reached 90.62% in the country and it is constantly increasing further, he said. The health ministry official further noted that the decline in daily Covid-19 cases in the country is “particularly noteworthy” even as the countries of the northern hemisphere are witnessing a severe increase in the intensity of pandemic.“We are very fortunate that our trend is in the opposite direction. We are fortunate that today we are showing a decline of the pandemic, except in two or three states. This decline is particularly noteworthy because in other countries of the northern hemisphere there is a severe increase in the intensity of pandemic,” said VK Paul, chairperson of the national task force for Covid-19, who was also part of the briefing.Speaking on Covid-19 vaccine development in India, Balram Bhargava of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said three candidates are in different stages of the clinical testing. “Covaxin has got approval for Phase 3 trials, Cadila also progressing with Phase 2 trials and Serum is completing Phase 2 trial and has an ongoing trial in Brazil, South Africa and the US,” the ICMR director general said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reached-1-million-covid-19-recoveries-in-13-days-health-ministry/story-rclKErKXMJ9eJHZjI458XN.html
27-10-2020||India||BECA done, fighters and armed drones next as India turns US positive||US secretary of state Micheal R Pompeo on Tuesday wrapped up the India leg of his four-nation tour to power an alliance against Chinese aggression that he underlined not only impacts India but other countries as well. Pompeo arrived along with defense secretary Mark Esper on Monday for the annual US-India 2+2 strategic dialogue.As he ended his meetings in New Delhi, Pompeo promised at a media briefing on Monday that the United States would stand with the people of India as they confront threats to their sovereignty and to their liberty, a not-so-oblique reference to Indian soldiers standing up to China’s People’s Liberation Army for more than five months in the East Ladakh sector.Pompeo and Esper also indicated that the Chinese actions in Ladakh, South China Sea, Senkaku Islands and trade wars with Australia were discussed and assessment shared on how to counter them.The two sides also signed a bunch of five pacts including BECA, or Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement, to share sensitive satellite and map data. This agreement - Esper called it a “significant milestone” - will give India access to topographical, nautical and aeronautical data vital for pinpointed attacks using missiles and armed drones.BECA clears the path for India acquiring armed drones in the first instance and at a later date, fighter aircraft. Esper alluded to the discussions around this topic when he announced that the US planned to sell more fighter planes and drones to India. He did not elaborate.India has been looking at buying medium-altitude long-endurance armed Predator-B drones from the US instead of the unarmed drones that it had planned earlier. An Indian official said New Delhi had been earlier offered F-16 and F-18 fighters but India was looking at Boeing’s F-15EX fighters that the aircraft manufacturer hasn’t yet been licensed to sell abroad.“There is a possibility that the F-15EX could be sold on a government-to-government basis,” a top government official familiar with the discussions told Hindustan Times. “Never before have we achieved so much in so little time,” a second official said, underscoring that he had never seen “such a positive attitude” on either side of the talks table.He also suggested that there was a slow, but gradual change in New Delhi’s approach to dealing with China that has been a hush word in India diplomacy.A decision to place an Indian liaison officer in the US 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain has been taken. The United States would also depute a liaison officer at the Indian Information Fusion Centre (IFC) of Indian Navy that monitors the Indian Ocean region.A second official said the Indian linkup with the US central command and African command indicates that the two countries have bonded on hard security issues. “It is quite evident from the 2+2 dialogue today that India has completely integrated with other members of the four-nation QUAD - Australia and Japan are the other two members - to monitor the Indian Pacific region,” he said.The participation of Australian Navy in the Malabar exercises in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea later this month will add to maritime heft of the QUAD that is expected to undertake more complex naval maneuvers.Esper told reporters that the two countries’ focus must now “be on institutionalising and regularising our cooperation to meet the challenges of the day and uphold the principles of a free and open Indo-Pacific well into the future.”That, he said, is particularly important ”in light of increasing aggression and destabilising actions by China.”Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh didn’t name China but left no one in doubt when they spoke about the importance of peace, stability and prosperity for all countries in the region. The Indo-Pacific region was a “particular focus of our talks”, Jaishankar told reporters, and made it clear that China’s effort to dominate Asia was not acceptable to India when he underlined that a “multi-polar world must have a multi-polar Asia as its basis”.Jaishankar had set the tone right at the start of Tuesday morning’s 2+2 strategic dialogue when he also pushed hard for closer India-US cooperation in defence and foreign policy. “The ability of India and the US to work closely in defence and foreign policy has a larger resonance. Together, we can make a real difference when it comes to regional and global challenges, whether it is in respecting territorial integrity, promoting maritime domain awareness, countering terrorism or ensuring prosperity,” the minister said as he laid stress on the importance of upholding a rules-based international order.It seems that the hesitation on India’s part to embrace the US for its national interest is finally gone. The die has been cast and it doesn’t matter who wins the presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-china/story-m0lDncNIZ8biYci35G6O6K.html

27-10-2020||India||I don’t have insane expectations, says Kangan||Hailing from Margherita, Assam, actor Kangan Baruah Nangia says that coming from a non-film background and a small town, her set of struggles are very different but she feels content.After wrapping shoot for OTT series ‘Jackson’ in Lucknow, the actor said, “Since I come from a small town, my expectations are also not very crazy and insane. I feel content with whatever I am doing.”Talking about her journey, she said, “My struggles are very different. For us, who come from nowhere, getting a project is very difficult. Even after I did ‘Beyhad-2’, I did not have anything for 4-5 months and now even if I am playing a lead in ‘Jackson’ I don’t know what I will get next! We need to prove again and again so it’s an ongoing struggle for us.” Kangan’s father wanted to become an actor and she grew up as a movie buff. “I also sing, so it was in Class XI when I did my first musical-play ‘Oliver Twist’ as lead. While graduating from Miranda House I did a lot of plays and joined a professional theatre group DramaTech. Then I moved to Mumbai and started with ads and did a web show ‘Hawa Badle Hassu’, few short films and then did TV show ‘Beyhad-2’ which ended with lockdown.” The actor got the role while under quarantine in Assam. “For 10 years — first schooling in boarding, then three years in college and finally Mumbai — I have been away from home. From my hometown I sent my audition and within eight hours I was on a video call with Saurabh sir and I was in! And, here I am shooting as a LU student.” This is her second visit to UP. “Since I was doing History (Hon), I once visited Agra for an educational trip from college. Best thing I like, as in my hometown Assam, the sun here rises so early unlike in Mumbai. We shot at Rumi Darwaza, Lucknow University, Residency, around both Imambaras which have a beautiful past. I even love the Hazratganj architecture. Being a history student, I feel a special connection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-don-t-have-insane-expectations-says-kangan/story-aaBODVpS1etcwhkuOx8LIK.html

The demand for action by Pakistan to counter terrorism, which figured in a joint statement issued after the 2+2 ministerial dialogue, was similar to calls made by India and the US in recent years. The joint statement also called for “concerted action” against terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Besides China’s aggressive actions across the region and beyond, counter-terrorism was part of the discussions between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh and their US counterparts Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper.

The 2016 Uri attack and the Pathankot attack in 2016 were blamed on Pakistan-based JeM. The joint statement said the two sides are committed to continued exchange of information about sanctions and designations of terror groups and individuals, particularly in light of recent legislative changes in India, and countering the financing and operations of terror organisations, countering radicalism and terrorist use of the internet. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India-US counter-terrorism cooperation has made considerable progress with enhanced information-sharing and operational cooperation. The joint working groups on counter-terrorism and designation dialogue meet regularly to enable cooperation in pursuing sanctions and designations of terror groups and individuals, the people said. The joint statement further said the two sides are committed to countering “cross-border movement of terrorists, and prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating returning terrorist fighters and family members”. While enhancing cooperation in multilateral forums such as the UN, the two sides reaffirmed their support for early adoption of a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism to strengthen global cooperation.

The US side “applauded India’s development assistance and efforts to build trade linkages and multi-modal connectivity infrastructure for Afghanistan to enhance its regional connectivity to sustain growth and development”. Jaishankar told the media interaction: “On Afghanistan, India’s stakes in its security and stability are evident, as is our willingness to contribute to international efforts to that end.” Pompeo said the “US values India as a multilateral partner, whether it’s through the Quad [or] making the Afghan peace negotiations successful...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-call-on-pakistan-to-take-immediate-and-irreversible-action-against-terrorism/story-KqlOXxZpUoInRcOaVjmWSN.html

Based on a rigorous and successful pilot project, the government gave its nod for the Hyderabad International Airport to roll out its e-boarding services for international flights. “The service is currently available for select international flights of IndiGo Airlines,” an official release from GMR said. Other scheduled international carriers operating out of Hyderabad are in the process of integration with the airport’s e-boarding system, which will be rolled out soon, the release said. As a process, any passenger boarding an international flight using e-boarding service will have to book the ticket online and do a web check-in. At the airport, the passenger has to display the digital/printed boarding card at the e-boarding scanner. The CISF personnel will validate the documents and allow the passenger to enter. At the check-in counter, the check-in agent scans the boarding card and the passenger has to drop the luggage off at the counter. At the immigration, the authorities verify the passport. At the security screening zone, the passenger puts his or her hand baggage on the Automatic Tray Retrieval System (ATRS), moves for security check. Scans the boarding card on an e-boarding scanner and moves on. At the boarding gate, the passenger scans the boarding card on an e-boarding scanner and moves towards the gates for boarding the aircraft, the official release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-airport-introduces-e-boarding-for-international-passengers/story-6KTP3EgYBaxGo8oFOotZyH.html

Ray, 66, was part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government that was acting as a caretaker government when this particular allocation was approved by Ray.Besides Ray, two former senior officials of the coal ministry, Pradip Kumar Banerjee and Nitya Nand Gautam, as well as Mahendra Aggarwalla of Castron Technologies Ltd were sentenced to three-year jail terms and fined Rs 10 lakh each. The judge also imposed fines of Rs 60 lakh on CTL and Rs 10 lakh on Castron Mining Ltd (CML). The accused were convicted on October 6 for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and prevention of corruption act.The case pertains to allocation of 105.153 hectares (ha) of an abandoned coal mining area in Giridih district in favour of Castron Technologies Limited by the 14th screening committee of the Union coal ministry in 1999. It is different from the investigative agency’s probe into improper allocation of captive coal blocks between 2004 and 2009 -- a scandal that roiled the United Progressive Alliance headed by Manmohan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-suspends-3-year-jail-term-of-former-union-minister-of-state-for-coal-dilip-ray-in-coal-scam/story-LmoNCsAA1AP9JWDvOyxJlO.html

The chats revealed the hand of the former Principal Secretary. After Kerala CMO’s close connection of Ministers KT Jaleel and Kadakampally Surendran came out and both Ministers visited the UAE consulate many times. They should make clear why they visited a foreign consulate,” he said.The Congress leader said now Koduvally Left MLA Karat Rasak’s involvement has come out and it is a serious matter.“The involvement of more and more CPI(M) leaders are being revealed. Sivasankar was the kingpin in the gold smuggling. Now, it has come to light that he was using Kerala CMO to help the gold smuggling accused. Pinarayi Vijayan has no moral authority to continue in the post,” he said.Reacting to Pinarayi Vijayan’s remark regarding the Opposition Leader rejecting the stand taken by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Centre of Centre using investigation agencies pin down political opponents, he said, “Rahul Gandhi is my leader.

In a gazette notification, the Centre has omitted the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of the land in the union territory. Before repeal of Article 370 and Article 35-A in August last year, non-residents could not buy any immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the fresh changes have paved the way for non-residents to buy land in the union territory.Also Read | Centre designates 18 Pakistan-based terrorists as ‘individual terrorists’ Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha told reporters that the amendments did not allow transfer of agricultural land to non-agriculturists. However, there are several exemptions in the Act which enable transfer of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes, including setting up of educational or health care facilities. Former Advocate General Mohammad Ishaq Qadri said the amendments have opened floodgates for people from outside Jammu and Kashmir to buy lands. “Now there is no legal bar on purchase of land here by outsiders,” he said. National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said the amendments were “unacceptable”. “Unacceptable amendments to the land ownership laws of J&K. Even the tokenism of domicile has been done away with when purchasing non-agricultural land & transfer of agricultural land has been made easier. J&K is now up for sale & the poorer small land holding owners will suffer,” Omar tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-amends-laws-to-allow-people-from-outside-j-k-to-buy-land-there/story-zsrkHYZOUUwcowhkZCpXNL.html

27-10-2020||India||Centre asks 14 states to increase RT-PCR tests, bring positivity rate below 5||The Union health ministry has asked 14 states to control the Covid-19 pandemic by reducing the test positivity rate (TPR) below 5% and keep a close watch on ‘evolving situation’ in view of the festive season.In a communication to these states having high Covid numbers, the Centre stressed on the need to increase the number of RT-PCR (reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction) tests to identify Covid patients in a bid to reduce TPR and fatality rates. The Centre’s directive came during a review meeting held with representatives of various states through a video conferencing earlier this month.The Centre’s report containing challenges and action plan for 14 states say , “The high caseload districts including Hyderabad (Telangana), Chennai & Salem (Tamil Nadu), Alwar & Kota (Rajasthan), Nagpur (Maharashtra), East Godavari & Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh) and Kamrup district (Assam) need high degree of alertness to be maintained.” All the states were asked to have an intensive IEC (information, education and communication) campaign under a Jan-Andolan to create mass awareness among people against Covid-19 and plan, install and operationalize PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen generation plants in government hospitals. “Delhi has seen a drop in number of tests. The split of tests is heavily skewed towards antigen tests. Delhi should follow the ICMR protocol and ramp up testing by RT-PCR. Despite a decrease in absolute number of deaths, Delhi needs to ensure decline in fatality rate. It also needs to restart monitoring of hospital wise fatalities,” the report said. In regard with Maharashtra which has the highest Covid numbers, it said, “Though the average daily new cases are showing a declining trend, Maharashtra’s week on week average number of tests done is declining. The state is also witnessing a high positivity rate. The week on week case fatality rate is also increasing which is an area of concern.” The report further says, “The death in the first 48 hours is very high among hospitalised patients. The state needs to ensure effective surveillance for early case detection and an ambulance system that would promptly shift the patients to hospital.” On Kerala which was once hailed as a role model for its fight against the pandemic the report states, “The weekly new cases have increased manifold which is a matter of concern. The testing has gone down and the positivity rate has gone up.” Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were asked to ramp up testing particularly through RT-PCR. About Telangana, the report says, “As compared to mid-September there is a reversal of testing strategy from RT-PCR (90% in mid-September) to RAT (rapid antigen test) (89% in October). If this is due to data discrepancy the same needs to be corrected with ICMR.” The report warns Tamil Nadu stating that the state is witnessing a migration in hotspot areas to newer districts. On infection and deaths among health care workers (HCWs) the centre asked Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Odisha to work on it by training and re-training HCWs on infection, prevention and control practices. The report also said high death rate in the first 24 to 72 hours in the states like Madhya Pradesh (26% of Covid deaths in first 24 hours), West Bengal (20% of Covid deaths in first 24 hours) and Rajasthan (25.6% of Covid deaths in first 24 hours) was an issue of concern.The report said these states with Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have a positivity rate of 12% or more. Besides these states, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh too were asked to reduce the fatality rate among Covid patients. Madhya Pradesh Health Commissioner Dr Sanjay Goyal said, “We are working on the action plan including PSA oxygen generation plants. The situation is much under control in the state which is far better than that in many other states. We are constantly working on strengthening our health system.”Principal secretary, department of Medical and Health, Rajasthan Akhil Arora said, “Concerns raised by GoI were suitably addressed. However, the kind of information available with them had certain gaps. We apprised them with the action plan and steps taken by the state, the union secretary and DG ICMR, appreciated five things Rajasthan is practicing – pre-Covid suspect treatment; post-Covid treatment; overall arrangement of oxygen; testing strategy and Jan Andolan for awareness, which we started prior to GoI.” He said, “Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the only two states, which are conducting 100% RT-PCR tests. Our confirmation percentage is around 5% as compared to the national average, which is over 7%. Less than 10% of patients are dying within 24 hours due to Covid-19.” Odisha health secretary Pradipta Mohapatra said, “Currently Odisha has less than 3,000 patients in hospitals and oxygen supply is not an issue. Besides, since last 8 days Odisha has continued to report less than 2,000 new Covid-19 cases bringing down the daily positivity rate to 4%.” Managing director of National Health Mission, Odisha, Shalini Pandit, who is looking after the Covid tests, however, did not comment on the declining number of tests as well as RT-PCR tests. As per Kerala health officials the test positivity rate (TPR) is almost triple the national average (14.19% against 5%) and in active caseload it is on third spot. Officials said a Union health ministry expert team that visited Kerala two weeks back was satisfied with the state government’s initiatives.

Several doctors in hospitals run by the North MCD have claimed they have not been paid in three months and have been protesting for the last two weeks. Kejriwal also alleged gross mismanagement and corruption in the functioning of the MCDs and said it was time things were set right. There was no immediate reaction available from the North MCD. “It pains me that our doctors have to protest for their salaries. These doctors risked their lives to serve us during the pandemic. This is shameful,” the CM said while inaugurating a waste-to-energy plant at the Ghazipur poultry and fish market. “We have been witnessing that civic bodies have not been able to pay salaries of teachers, sanitation workers and doctors over the years. Why is there such an acute shortage of funds in MCDs?” he asked. “We have released more funds to the MCDs as compared to previous governments. We have given them more than their due,” he said. Kejriwal said there should be no politics over the issue of doctors’ salaries and everybody should make efforts to ensure they get their paychecks. He claimed that the Centre has been “providing grants to municipal corporations across the country, barring Delhi”. “I request the Centre to give funds to MCDs so that they release salaries of doctors,” the CM said.  The pandemic has hit the tax collection of the Delhi government. Still, it has been managing affairs properly and releasing salaries of its doctors and teachers, he said. “If we had the funds, I would have given the salaries of doctors of MCD-run hospitals today itself… doesn’t matter if it was as per the Constitution or not,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mcds-not-releasing-salaries-of-doctors-shameful-centre-must-grant-funds-to-civic-bodies-kejriwal/story-hR0JPTDsZ5xdrG8ArfpElN.html

Patel said that a senior minister from the Maharashtra government will be in charge of Goa affairs so that the party could reach every constituency effectively in the next 18 months.Goa is scheduled to go to the polls in early 2022.The NCP is currently represented by a lone MLA -- Churchill Alemao in the Goa Legislative Assembly who has chosen to remain ‘neutral’ while supporting the government on some issues, opposing them on others but choosing to remain seated when issues are put to vote in the legislative assembly. Political developments in the state have been picking up pace with an eye on the elections now barely 18 months away with a former BJP MLA joining the Goa Forward Party along with a few other people including former BJP MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-looking-for-non-congress-non-bjp-partners-for-goa-polls-praful-patel/story-6UaSMh3njGpSPnXunq3C4H.html

The CBI, which started the probe into the case on October 10, will now report its progress to the HC. The HC will also determine the transfer of the trial and security to witnesses and the victim’s kin.Also read | UP cops gather evidence of Kerala scribe’s role in Hathras violence incitement plotThe order was passed by a SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, which had reserved its orders in the case on October 15.The order came following a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a court-monitored probe by Satyama Dubey, a social activist . Several women lawyers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have also joined in with the demand to shift the trial outside UP and provide safety to witnesses in the case. At present, the UP Police authorities are providing round-the-clock protection to the witnesses and family members of the victim. The petitioners demanded Central forces to take over the security duties from UP Police. The apex court has also directed the HC to delete the name of the victim and her family members from the order sheet while taking a suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the proceeding.The HC’s lapse was pointed out to the SC by Solicitor-General (S-G) Tushar Mehta during the last hearing on October 15 . Advocate Seema Kushwaha, who represented the victim’s family, prayed before the apex court to shift the trial to Delhi after the CBI probe is over. S-G Tushar Mehta, who represented the UP government, had submitted before the SC that it had no objection if the probe is court-monitored or security is handed to some other agency. The UP Police maintained that any such order would not reflect the authorities concerned in poor light. The gang-rape rape and murder of a Dalit teenager (19) had occurred in UP’s Hathras district had occurred on September 14. She had succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Delhi a fortnight later.UP government authorities had performed her last rites at the dead of night the following day under UP Police’s protection.The HC had taken note on its own about the hurried cremation of the victim without showing her face to her family members.The matter is still pending before the HC.So far, UP Police has arrested four upper caste men -- Sandeep Singh, Ravi, Ramu and Luvkush Sikarwar – for their alleged role in the gang-rape and murder of the Hathras victim.

For most countries, that means giving security a greater salience in their foreign policy. As major powers, this is even more so in our case,” he said.Second, over the last two decades, the bilateral relationship between India and the US has grown in its substance, facets and significance and the accompanying comfort level today enables the two countries to engage much more intensively on matters of national security, he said, adding that this format is clearly tailored to that purpose.“Third, at a time when it is particularly important to uphold a rules-based international order, the ability of India and the US to work closely in defence and foreign policy has a larger resonance. Together, we can make a real difference when it comes to regional and global challenges, whether it is in respecting territorial integrity, promoting maritime domain awareness, countering terrorism or ensuring prosperity,” he said.“I am therefore looking forward to our discussions today. I am sure that they will be very productive and fruitful,” he said while concluding his opening remark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-and-us-have-to-give-security-a-greater-salience-in-foreign-policies-s-jaishankar/story-EHp6Qigv0sqJdz51cMAzNJ.html

27-10-2020||India||Less than 0.5% households in Maharashtra have solar home system: Report||Only 41% households in Maharashtra are aware of the solar home system while only 0.43% have installed it in their homes, a survey by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) reveals.The report - State of Electricity Access in India: Insights from the India Residential Energy consumption Survey (IRES) 2020, looks at household energy consumption patterns across 21 states in the country.In Maharashtra, the CEEW surveyed 1,400 households in the state and 96 households in Mumbai. The report also stated that only 7.29% households have considered buying a solar home system. Sunil Mani, programme associate at the CEEW said, “Most of the households who are aware of the system said that it is expensive and also requires more space which is not feasible. Plus, Maharashtra and particularly, Mumbai also has good power supply, which is why many households have not considered the solar system though it is the best option from a sustainability point of view.”Mani said that financially viable products and more awareness of the solar home system could help people switch to it.The survey reveals that 91% of the households use liquified petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking and 5% of the households utilise electricity for cooking. A large number of rural households - 36% - still use traditional cooking fuel. “People in rural households still have a preference for the traditional cooking fuel as it is available cheap. Many urban households also do not switch to using electricity for cooking for cultural reasons,” Mani said.The report states that 99% of the households in Maharashtra are electrified with 22 hours of supply on an average everyday. Ninety eight per cent of the households also have functional meters and 99% are regularly billed while 88% of those surveyed said that they are also satisfied with the services. “Though a high number of consumers are satisfied with the services, many also feel that they need to be informed about power cuts in advance,” Mani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/less-than-0-5-households-in-maharashtra-have-solar-home-system-report/story-cXN5T82JMtwLbpEcXVhgJI.html
27-10-2020||India||Bombay HC refuses bail to man found travelling in SUV with 500 kg ganja in 2018||Non-compliance of search related provision of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 cannot be considered for granting bail to an accused, the Bombay high court said last week while refusing bail to a Malegaon resident arrested after 500 kg ganja was seized from a SUV in which he was travelling. The accused, Kalu Mohite, was arrested by the Azad Maidan unit of the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of the Mumbai police on March 13, 2018 while traveling in a SUV in which the narcotic was found. Acting on a specific tip off, the ANC had intercepted the vehicle at Mulund check post and apprehended three persons, including Kalu and driver Sanjay Mohite. The drug material was allegedly kept in 13 gunny bags in the vehicle.After failing to secure bail on the ground of Covid-19 pandemic from special NDPS court, Kalu had moved HC contending that he was falsely implicated in the case. He claimed to be a gratuitous passenger and did not know that the contraband material was being transported in the vehicle.The claim, however, failed to impress justice Bharati Dangre after additional public prosecutor AA Takalkar pointed out that Kalu knew the driver of the vehicle Sajay Mohite and Kalu’s call data record showed that he was in touch with him.Kalu’s counsel, advocate Pritam Runway also contended that the ANC had failed to comply with certain mandatory provisions, like section 50 of the NDPS Act,which confers right on the accused to get himself searched in presence of a gazetted officer or a magistrate.Runway relied on the Constitution bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Baldev Singh’s case to support his contention that failure to comply with section 50 vitiates the trial and Kalu was entitled to bail on the ground of non-compliance of the mandatory provision.Justice Dangre, however, refused to accept that the non-compliance by itself would be a ground to release the accused on bail.The judge said the compliance of section 50 has been held to bemandatory by the Constitution bench, obliging the officer concerned to inform the suspect of his right to be searched in presence of the nearest gazetted officer or magistrate. “However, it has also been held that after being informed,whether such a person opted for such a course or not would bequestion of fact,” the judge said, adding that the safeguard contained in section 50 is to ensure that the persons are only searched with a good cause and also to maintain the veracity of evidence derived from such search.The HC clarified that “this, however, would be required to be established at the trial” and “at the stage of bail the said factor cannot be taken into account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-man-found-travelling-in-suv-with-500-kg-ganja/story-uUHFtgar2oD0CZi3fwHTPK.html
27-10-2020||India||Supreme Court asks Allahabad high court to monitor Hathras case investigation||The Supreme Court on Tuesday has ordered the Allahabad high court to monitor the ongoing investigation into the Hathras gang-rape case. The order came on a PIL filed by social activist Satyama Dubey demanding a court-monitored probe into the alleged gang-rape of a 19-year Dalit woman, who died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital. All aspects of the investigation will be examined by the Allahabad high court, the apex court has said. At present, the case rests with the Central Bureau of Investigaion (CBI), which may approach the high court with its investigation status report.A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde felt it appropriate that the high court should monitor the case, considering the fact that the court is already examining a suo moto proceeding on the “hurried cremation” of the victim.The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas which also sought a transfer of the trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi as several lawyers, including lawyer-activist Indira Jaising, expressed their apprehension that a fair probe was not possible in Uttar Pradesh. On the question of transferring trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, there has been no ruling as the investigation is still going on.The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad high court expressed dismay over reports describing how the victim was cremated in a hurried way allegedly without the consent of the family members. It took suo moto cognisance of the case and summoned top government and police officers of Uttar Pradesh. It has also heard the family members of the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-directs-allahabad-high-court-to-monitor-hathras-case-investigation/story-e0D53zn2SXIep8wCKsSM7I.html

27-10-2020||India||Bengal tries out greener measures for idol immersion post Durga puja||Authorities in West Bengal are trying out greener methods for idol immersion this Durga Puja, the biggest festival in the state, to keep the water bodies and the Hooghly river cleaner and less polluted. In south-Dum Dum, in the northern fringes of Kolkata, authorities have earmarked and barricaded portions of two large water bodies to try out an immersion model. Synthetic liners have been spread out below and on the sides of the earmarked portion, which authorities said will help to check the pollution from spreading to the rest of the water body. “We are also planning to come up with mobile treatment plants so that the polluted water in the earmarked zone of the pond could be treated. The sludge deposited in the synthetic liner would be scraped out. This would help the water body to stay cleaner and less polluted,” said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. Around 1000 idols, both big and small, are expected to be immersed in the two ponds. The immersion process started on Monday and around 200 have already been immersed. The immersions will end on Thursday.“Our machineries are parked on the banks of the water body and as soon as any idol is immersed the structure is being fished out. We have tied up with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board for this initiative,” said a senior official of South Dum Dum municipality. While authorities in Delhi, had started immersion of idols in artificial ponds created solely for the purpose since 2019 to keep post-immersion pollution in the Yamuna river low, Mumbai has been doing it for the past few years for now to keep the sea clean. In Kolkata a few hundred idols are immersed in the Hooghly river after Durga Puja. In yet another initiative, a puja committee in south Kolkata used water jets to melt down the idols. A small water body using bags and synthetic liner was created for the purpose. “It served two objectives. First, we wanted to avoid going to the river bank because of the pandemic. Loading the idols on a truck and unloading it, would require more than a dozen men without maintaining any physical distance. Secondly, it also helped to keep the pollution down in the river as the idol was not immersed in the river,” said a member of the Tridhara Sammilani in south Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-tries-out-greener-measures-for-idol-immersion-post-durga-puja/story-6STBboJOkdUrzPw0gBcEfM.html

I have no intention to hurt anyone, particularly women.”Thirumavalavan had also demanded the ban of the Manusmriti, saying, “Periyar saw that the Manusmriti had made women slaves, which is why I believe that it should be thrown away.

All these cities – Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Baghpat, Agra and Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar and Kanpur – belong to West UP. The state capital also recorded an average AQI of more than 360 in the past couple of days.In Lucknow, the industrial area in Talkatora region recorded the worst AQI followed by Gomti Nagar area. PM (Particulate Matter) 2.5 and PM 10 were the major pollutants in the area.According to the CPCB classification of air quality above 401 is considered severe while that between 301 to 400 and 201 to 300 are considered very poor and poor, respectively. Severe air quality impacts the health of even normal individuals, while it is particularly harmful for people with pre-existing health conditions, and that of senior citizens.CPCB officials said that the poor air quality is primarily due to three factors - rise in human activities which leads to increased vehicular emission, construction work etc; drop in average day temperatures and burning of farm waste/stubble by farmers.Officials said the UPPCB is striving to contain stubble burning. Along with respective district administrations the board officials are persuading farmers in west UP districts to not burn stubble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-in-up-cities-very-poor-to-worsen-in-coming-days/story-IreOnPBvnYZ9EsTYZg8AjM.html

Pressure is being built on gram pradhans. Police are being misused to threaten people. The Election Commission should take cognizance of all this and intervene,” said Akhilesh in a statement.He also said: “gram pradhans,The SP is contesting six seats and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) the Bulandshahar seat. The BJP is set for a defeat and SP-RLD are headed for big victories. The tactics to mislead the people won’t work. The people’s verdict in the bypolls would indicate the possible results in the 2022 UP assembly polls,” he said.The SP candidates were getting strong support of the people because of their clean image, Akhilesh Yadav said.The SP’s Syed Javed Abdi is contesting Naugawan Sadat. The other party candidates are: Maharaj Singh Dhangar (Tundla), Indrajeet Kori (Ghatampur), Lucky Yadav (Malhani), Brahmashankar Tiwari (Deoria) and Suresh Kumar Pal (Bangarmau).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-misusing-power-for-up-assembly-bypolls-says-akhilesh-yadav/story-GWyFHtkQA0bL7BWxE8WTqL.html
27-10-2020||India||BJP fields 8 candidates for Rajya Sabha polls in UP, avoids replay of 2018||In a surprising move, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced only eight candidates for the November 9 Rajya Sabha (RS) polls from Uttar Pradesh. The decision went against the popular perception that the party would make a bid for a ninth seat also as it did in 2018. The biennial elections will be held for a total of 10 seats from the state.Two years ago, despite not having the numbers, the party had succeeded in ensuring the win of its ninth Rajya Sabha candidate and stopped the Bahujan Samaj Party nominee from winning. This time, unless the BJP springs a last-minute surprise by fielding a ninth candidate, its decision would help the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which has fielded a candidate despite not having enough numbers on its own to ensure its victory, political experts said. Tuesday is the last date for filing nominations for the Rajya Sabha election. The BJP retained its three sitting Rajya Sabha members from UP – Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, former Ballia MP Neeraj Shekhar, son of late Prime Minister Chandrashekhar and party general secretary Arun Singh – whose term would expire on November 25. Among others, the BJP settled for former UP minister Haridwar Dubey, three-time MLA Seema Dwivedi, both Brahmins and former director general of police Brij Lal, a Dalit. The line-up includes two OBCs — former Auraiya district chief of BJP Geeta Shakya as well as BL Verma, the current UP BJP vice president and chairman of state construction and infrastructure development corporation limited.For an outright win, each candidate requires 36 votes. The BJP with 305 lawmakers in the UP assembly is set to ensure the win of eight candidates. It would still have 16 surplus votes left to make a possible bid for the ninth RS seat. “As of now, there are just 10 candidates in the fray for as many vacancies from UP and unless there is a contest, all 10 would win,” a BJP leader admitted. “If the BJP does field a ninth candidate, it would mean that the BSP would have to depend on the Congress, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and possibly the Samajwadi Party too for helping its candidate win. Maybe, the party’s move might be aimed at foiling any chance of opposition unity,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist.The BSP has 16 MLAs in the UP assembly against arch rival Samajwadi Party’s 48 MLAs.“Each candidate would require 36 votes for an outright win,” said an official of the UP assembly secretariat. Thus, apart from BJP that has 305 MLAs in the state assembly and can easily get eight candidates elected, only the SP is poised to ensure the victory of its candidate. The current strength of the UP assembly is 395. Eight seats are lying vacant. Bypolls are scheduled on November 3 for seven of these seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-fields-8-candidates-for-rajya-sabha-polls-in-up-avoids-replay-of-2018/story-0PzfM9sCQrWAnB2Mp1NoVP.html

The projects will enhance socio-economic conditions of the locality, it said. “Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Nitin Gadkari will lay the foundation stones of nine national highway projects with a total length of nearly 262 km worth over Rs 2,752 crore in Tripura tomorrow (Tuesday),” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a statement. The projects, on completion, will provide faster and hassle-free inter-state and international connectivity to Bangladesh, and will be a major stride towards strengthening the tourism sector of the state, the statement said. The new projects will provide better connectivity, fast and safe movement of traffic to various tourist places, historical places and religious places in the entire state, it added. “They are likely to generate a large number of employment and self-employment opportunities to the unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled manpower of the region. The projects will reduce travel time and maintenance cost of the vehicles and saving of fuel,” the statement said. Implementation of the project would result in enhanced socio-economic conditions of the locality, it said adding that these will improve transport of agricultural goods and access to greater markets, thereby reducing the cost of goods and services. These will also create easy and speedy access to health care and emergency services. “In a nut shell, after completion of the above projects, there will be a quantum jump in the development of tourism, economic and international connectivity of this region. Finally, it will give impetus to the GDP (gross domestic product) of Tripura,” the ministry said.

27-10-2020||India||West Bengal Assembly Election: CPI(M) mulls seat-sharing proposal with Congress||The Communist Party of India’s (Marxist) Central Committee (CC), its highest executive body, will discuss a proposal for a seat pact with the Congress for the next year’s West Bengal assembly elections amid mounting pressure from its state unit about such a tie-up. The 94-member CC will meet on Friday and Saturday (October 30 and 31) to discuss the proposal for a seat-sharing agreement. The move comes after the CPI(M) and other Left parties have been a part of a similar pact with the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in the upcoming Bihar polls. Two senior Left leaders said the CPI(M) politburo, the party’s highest body that met on Sunday, held a preliminary discussion on the issue and the matter was referred to the CC. Meanwhile, the central leadership of the Congress is yet to receive any formal proposal from the Bengal unit on the alliance with the CPI(M), a party functionary said. Also Read: CPI(M) criticises Bengal governor for sharing photos of ailing ex-CM on social mediaHe said the talks are in progress at the state level and the central leadership would take up the alliance issue after the Bihar polls, which end on November 7. The state unit, especially its chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, is keen on an alliance with the Left parties in the next year’s assembly elections. The CPI(M) and the Congress have joined hands for several protests and public programmes against the Mamata Banerjee-led government in Bengal. Chowdhury’s appointment as the state unit chief of the Congress also strengthened the prospects of an electoral tie-up between the Left and the Congress. Chowdhury is a staunch critic of Banerjee and nurtures an agenda against her party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC). However, the CPI(M) leadership will wait for a green signal from the Congress after its bitter experience in last year’s parliamentary elections. The CPI(M) had unilaterally announced its willingness for a seat pact, but the Congress didn’t settle for an alliance in last year’s Lok Sabha elections. The parties fought the elections separately, and the Left parties failed to win a single seat from Bengal, once its political fortress. A CPI(M) leader said, “Let us see if the Congress camp is interested in a pact. We will discuss a proposal for a pact as we can’t enter into a full-fledged alliance on ideological grounds.” The last party Congress of the CPI(M) had barred any alliance with the Congress or any such party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-to-mull-seat-sharing-proposal-with-congress-for-next-year-s-west-bengal-assembly-election/story-CYSW4gSme8eWD2VrAB78fM.html

27-10-2020||India||India to get 5 military theatre commands, one each for China and Pak||The Indian military is expected to be reorganised under five theatre commands by 2022 with defined areas of operation and a seamless command structure for synchronised operations.With the department of military affairs soon to have additional and joint secretaries after Cabinet clearance, the task of reorganisation of the three services under theatre commands has begun with a China specific Northern Command and Pakistan specific Western command under serious consideration. India’s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has been given the mandate by the Narendra Modi government to create theatre commands much like the ones China and the US currently have.Also Watch | 2+2 Meeting: India to get US military satellite data; will China heed warning? Also Read: China has ramped up military presence across LAC. Ladakh isn’t only targetAccording to military and national security planners, the northern command’s remit will begin from the Karakoram Pass in Ladakh and continue up to the last outpost Kibithu in Arunachal Pradesh , with the military mandate of guarding the 3,488 kilometre of Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. The HQ of this command could be Lucknow. The western command’s remit will be from Indira Col on Saltoro Ridge in the Siachen Glacier region to the tip of Gujarat with its HQ likely in Jaipur. The third theatre command will be the Peninsular Command; the fourth, a full-fledged air defence command; and the fifth, a maritime command. The likely HQ of the Peninsular command could be Thiruvananthapuram. The air defence command will not only spearhead the country’s aerial attack but also be responsible for defending Indian airspace through multi-role fighters with all anti aircraft missiles under its control. Currently, the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy all defend Indian airspace on separate communication frequencies and without synergy. This is despite the fact that all Indian Army Corps Headquarters are located next to an air base as a result of which there is duplication of effort and wasteful expenditure. The planners said there is option of extending this to an aerospace command as per future requirements.India will have only one maritime command with a possibility that the tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Islands Command being merged with this . The task of the maritime command will be to protect the Indian Ocean and India’s Island territories as well as keep the sea lanes free and open from any outside pressure. Although in a nascent stage, the Indian Navy’s maritime assets will be placed in Karwar on the western seaboard, Vishakhapatnam on the eastern seaboard and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. With China emerging as a threat, the possible headquarters of the Maritime Command could be Andhra Pradesh’s new capital with Port Blair emerging as another major base for naval operations.Also Read: Gen Rawat asks tri-services to curb peace-time activities in deference to deployed troops in LadakhTheaterisation refers to placing units of the army, air force, and navy under a single Theatre Commander. The operational command of such combinations will be under one officer drawn from one of the three services. “Theaterisation of commands is imperative to integrate resources of the three services for maximising impact in any war. The geographical expanse of theatres in India demands unified commands for strategic decisions and critical outcomes that will be possible in concentrated employment of resources,” said former amry vice chief Lt Gen AS Lamba (retd). According to senior officials familiar with the matter, all five commands will be headed by Lt General or equivalent rank commanders, who will be the first among equals with the heads of the present commands reporting to them. The task of the Chief of Staff of Army, Chief of Air Staff and Chief of Naval Staff will not be operational but involve mobilising resources to the theatre commanders as it is in the US military.If the Andamans and Nicobar Command goes under the maritime command as is being visualised, then the CDS will have the Armed Forces Special Operation Division, Cyber Command and the Defence Intelligence Agency under him with manpower drawn from all the three services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-get-5-military-theatre-commands-one-each-for-china-and-pak/story-UzFJNollsvpj3tcUetWVNM.html
27-10-2020||India||Supreme Court to decide today whether Hathras trial should be shifted out of UP||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its judgment on Tuesday on a batch of pleas which have sought a transfer of the trial to Delhi along with a court-monitored probe as senior lawyers, including lawyer-activist Indira Jaising, expressed their apprehension that a fair probe was not possible in Uttar Pradesh. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. The body was cremated at the dead of night allegedly without the presence of her family members. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.The Uttar Pradesh government had set up a Special Investigation Team, which has completed its probe. It was supposed to submit its report to the government, which had extended the deadline. Meanwhile, the SIT came into news after the wife of a senior police officer who is part of the SIT died of suicide.A public interest litigation (PIL) and several intervention pleas have been filed demanding a court-monitored probe into the Hathras case. Demand to shift the trial out of Uttar Pradesh is also gaining ground. At present, CBI is investigating the case.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde, Justice A S Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian is hearing the case. The lawyer, appearing for the victim’s family, had told the apex court that trial in the case be shifted out of Uttar Pradesh to a court in the national capital after completion of investigation.As the security of the family members of the victim is paramount in this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had referred to the affidavit filed in the apex court by the Uttar Pradesh government which gave details about the security and protection provided to the victim’s family and witnesses in the case.Mehta said that victim’s family has informed that they have engaged lawyer and they have also requested that government advocate should also pursue the case on their behalf.

27-10-2020||India||PM Modi didn’t accept tea during 9-hour questioning by Gujarat riots SIT: Probe chief||Without parrying a single question out of the 100-odd ones put to him by the 2002 Gujarat riots SIT, Narendra Modi as the then Gujarat chief minister “kept his cool” throughout the marathon 9-hour questioning and did not accept even a cup of tea from investigators, the probe team’s chief at that time R K Raghavan has said in a new book. Modi had also readily agreed to come to the SIT office in Gandhinagar for the questioning and brought his own bottle of water, Raghavan has written in his autobiography, ‘A Road Well Travelled’. Before being asked to head the Supreme Court-appointed SIT that probed the 2002 Gujarat riots, Raghavan had also served as head of premier probe agency CBI. He was also involved in several other high-profile investigations over years, including those relating to the Bofors scam, the 2000 South Africa cricket-match fixing case and the fodder scam. Talking about the time the SIT had called Modi for questioning as the then Gujarat chief minister, Raghavan writes in the book, “We had it conveyed to his staff that he had to come in person to the SIT office for this purpose and that meeting him elsewhere would be misconstrued as a favour.” “He (Modi) understood the spirit of our stand and readily agreed to come to the SIT office within the government complex in Gandhinagar,” Raghvan said. The former police officer further said he took the “unusual step” of asking Ashok Malhotra, an SIT member, to do the questioning, mainly to avoid any “mischievous allegation” later that Modi and he had struck a deal. “This stand was endorsed months later by no less a person than amicus curiae Harish Salve. He told me that my presence would have vitiated Modi’s statement and would have robbed it of its credibility,” Raghavan said, adding that he had never consulted Salve prior to the event. It was my personal decision flowing from sheer intuition, said the retired IPS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, who was also appointed as High Commissioner to Cyprus in 2017. “Modi’s questioning lasted nine hours in my own chamber at the SIT office. Malhotra told me later that Modi kept his cool right through the marathon session which ended late at night,” Raghavan said. “He (Modi) never parried questions. Nor did he give the impression of padding up his responses. When Malhotra asked him whether he would like to break for lunch, he initially turned down the offer. He brought his own bottle of water and did not accept even a cup of tea from the SIT during the marathon questioning comprising a hundred- odd questions,” he said. Raghavan said it required “tremendous persuasion” to make Modi agree to a short recess. “This was possibly Modi’s concession to the need for a respite for Malhotra rather than for himself. Such was the energy of the man.” In February 2012, the SIT filed a closure report, giving a clean chit to Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was “no prosecutable evidence” against them. In the book, the former CBI Director also asserted that the probe into the Gujarat riots by the Supreme Court-mandated SIT under him was “clinical and professional” and the SIT’s “unequivocal stand” on the chief minister’s role was “unpalatable to his (Modi’s) adversaries” in the state and in Delhi. “They engineered petitions against me, accusing me of favouring the chief minister. The grapevine had it that they misused central agencies to monitor my telephonic conversations. They were, however, disappointed not to find anything incriminating,” he said. Raghavan said false charges were aired against him on the sly to start with, and later openly. “Fortunately, the apex court stood by me and backed me to the hilt. I was found inconvenient because I refused to buy the argument that the state administration connived with the rioters who were targeting the Muslim community. Our investigation was clinical and professional,” he asserted. “If I displayed a measure of professional acumen and objectivity, it was not a little due to the sterling assistance of Ashok Kumar Malhotra, whom I inducted into the SIT in 2009,” said Raghvan praising Malhotra, who was asked to oversee the team’s work after the apex court allowed Raghavan to be relieved from the duty in 2017. Without naming anyone, Raghavan said it was unfortunate that he was the target of attack by those instigated by “highly placed persons at the helm of affairs in Delhi”. Talking about the Ehsan Jafri case, he said there was no record to establish that the Congress MP had tried to reach the chief minister by phone. “A few others, including Sanjeev Bhat, had also alleged that the chief minister, at a late-night official meeting on 28 February 2002, had directed senior police officers present at the meeting not to intervene if Hindu emotions overflowed. Here again, there was no corroboration to the charge,” Raghvan asserted. None whose presence at the meeting was established beyond doubt told SIT that they saw Sanjeev Bhat at the meeting, held essentially to review the law and order situation arising from the Godhra train attack, he said. “In our report to the apex court we absolved the chief minister of the alleged illegal direction to the police,” he said. Raghavan assumed office as head of SIT in early 2008 and carried on for nine years, until April 30, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-didn-t-accept-tea-during-9-hour-questioning-by-gujarat-riots-sit-probe-chief/story-Cc61UEAiStF47GikrCRkeK.html

27-10-2020||India||RS polls: BJP announces 8 candidates from UP, one from U’khand||Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri and MP Neeraj Shekhar are among eight candidates nominated by the BJP for the November 9 Rajya Sabha polls from Uttar Pradesh. The party also announced Naresh Bansal as its Rajya Sabha nominee from Uttarakhand. Puri, Shekhar and party general secretary Arun Singh are all sitting MPs who have been renominated. Besides them, Geeta Shakya, Haridwar Dubey, Brijlal, BL Varma and Seema Dwivedi have been nominated. Earlier this month the Election Commission had announced elections to 10 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and one in Uttarakhand, falling vacant on November 25. With the BJP having 304 members in the Uttar Pradesh assembly, the election for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from the state may turn out to be a nearly one-sided affair for the party, feel poll analysts. The BJP’s all eight nominees for Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh are likely to win as the party has the three-fourth majority in the state assembly. Similarly, party’s nominee for Rajya Sabha from Uttarakhand is also expected to win. With these nine new possible members, the BJP’s own tally in Rajya Sabha will cross 90 in the 245-member house. The ten Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant are three of the BJP, four of the Samajwadi party, two of the Bahujan Samaj Party and one of the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-polls-bjp-announces-8-candidates-from-up-one-from-u-khand/story-FjwX5MgFnwUBvemLcjqQqM.html
27-10-2020||India||Central law in works to curb air pollution||The Union government will bring in a new law for a permanent authority to oversee matters relating to air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday, prompting the judges to suspend an order that authorised former top court judge Madan Lokur to tackle the issue.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the new authority will have a statutory role and have members from all states that contribute to the pollution problem in NCR, assuring the bench that a draft of the law will be shared in four days. “The Centre has taken a holistic view of the matter and found that several ad hoc measures taken in the past have not achieved any results. Now a comprehensive law is being planned with a permanent body having participation of neighbouring states,” he said. The submission came on a day when farm fires in Punjab and Haryana hit a new peak and the Capital’s air quality index (AQI) continued to linger in the “very poor” category for the fourth consecutive day, threatening to plunge into the “severe” zone as it has inevitably done at this time of the year for every year since 2016.Mehta indicated the new law is likely to be brought in as an ordinance and, while he did not give more details, a top environment ministry official told HT it will focus on the Delhi-NCR region. “I will not share any details of the law or what penalties are involved but this is a comprehensive law focused only on the Delhi-NCR region to curb the air pollution menace here from various sources. It is not an amendment of existing laws,” said RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry. The solicitor general also repeated a request for the top court to suspend an October 16 order designating retired justice Lokur to oversee the farm fire problem, claiming there could be points of conflict between the new authority and the former judge’s single-member panel.Farmland fires contribute heavily to the annual air pollution crisis. Smoke from smouldering paddy fields, which are set alight as a way to prepare for sowing the next crop, rises up and settles over much of north and northwest India. Coupled with local emissions and dust, it has in recent years turned cities into what the Supreme Court once described as gas chambers.The top court accepted the Centre’s request till the next date of hearing. “People are choking in this city. This is something that the government should have curbed and not a matter to be decided in a public interest litigation (PIL). We will welcome your decision if it is appropriate,” said chief justice SA Bobde, who headed a bench that also comprised AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who has been assisting the SC on environment-related issues, supported the Centre’s stand. “Attempts made by the Court in the past are not working out. Union government may require to write to states to take effective steps [to curb stubble burning],” Salve said.The lawyer of the petitioner whose plea triggered the hearing had opposed the decision to put the October 16 order “in abeyance”. “For this year, justice Lokur Committee should continue. The law can be made operational from next year. On Thursday, the stubble burning cases in the MC Mehta case are listed. By then, justice Lokur’s report will also be ready,” said Vikas Singh. The October 16 order required the Lokur Committee to submit periodic reports. It was Singh who had suggested appointing an expert committee led by justice Lokur, who has past experience in hearing matters related to stubble burning and Delhi’s pollution.Experts said that while the Union government has the constitutional right to bring in a law since environment is a central subject, its implementation will need focus. “Though I have not seen the draft and heard only what solicitor general said in the Supreme Court, I believe such a law could be binding on state governments. But orders by the authority to be created under the law would have to be implemented by the state government. In the past, we have seen statutory orders under the Air Act by CPCB were also not implemented by state governments. So, the question would remain that what action Centre can take if the state fails to follow the directions,” said Vijay Panjwani, former counsel for Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in the Supreme Court.Environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta too said the focus should be on enforcing existing mechanisms instead of creating new ones. “Air pollution has been an issue for a fairly long time. Why do you need an ordinance now? The Centre has powers to issue directions under Section 5 of the environment protection act. Why is this coming in the pre-pollution season? It’s a distraction as drafting a law will take time,” he said. Dutta added that the new law will also create multiple authorities. A third expert said the new law and the mechanism will need to look beyond NCR. “What we need is legal compliance and deterrence strategy for the entire country. The Graded Response Action Plan and the comprehensive action plan are both notified under the environment protection act. There is no dearth of power under the law. The question is of adherence,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment. “There is always a need to review and refresh laws to keep pace with current requirements. However, this should not be used to evade or dodge the regulatory failures to curb air pollution that have been in and out of courts since the 1980s. At the same time, the socio-political dimensions of the air pollution crisis need to be called out and addressed. This will happen when we get a closer understanding on who bears the heaviest burden of compliance. Even today, the biggest contributors to air pollution like thermal power plants and real estate continue to receive concessions and subsidies,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-law-in-works-to-curb-air-pollution/story-D0LoR08IuarqrFlgtosfzN.html
27-10-2020||India||Gujarat HC starts live streaming of proceedings||The Gujarat high court on Monday became the first in the country to start live streaming proceedings on a YouTube channel, with the court of chief justice Vikram Nath accessible to the public through a link on the court’s official website. Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said on Monday that in practice though, live streaming could be misused as already he was facing several complaints over the virtual hearings taking place over the videoconferencing app Vidyo.According to an administrative order issued by justice Nath, the live telecast from Court No. 1 was purely on an experimental basis, and the “aspect of continuing with or adapting the modality of live court proceedings will be decided based on the outcome of this trial”.The first hearing that was live streamed on Monday was a plea seeking relief for admission to medical colleges through NEET for students who had not taken the Class 12 exam from Gujarat. The court issued a notice to the state government and reserved its order in the case. Proceedings were live on the YouTube link — provided on the Gujarat HC website — for over five hours and about half-a-dozen cases were heard. Around 68,324 viewers watched the channel on Monday. All high court benches have been functioning through video conferencing since March 24 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, in which advocates, parties, victims and witnesses are made to participate in a video hearing.In a statement, the high court referred to a Supreme Court judgment which ruled that the public should be allowed to view hearings conducted through video conferencing. The communication referenced a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Nirma University School of Law student Pruthviraj Sinh Zala that sought the court to issue directions for live streaming to keep with the principles of access to justice. Hearing the PIL, the Supreme Court, on April 6, 2020, issued seven guidelines for web-based hearings and live streaming of court proceedings, saying that the “successful implementation will ensure that the judiciary rises to face the unique challenge presented by the outbreak of Covid-19”. “In the Model Video Conferencing Rules as prescribed by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India, it has been provided that the public will be allowed to view the court hearing conducted through video conferencing,” the Gujarat HC’s chief justice said in his order.Welcoming the order, Aaditya Bhatt, a high court lawyer in Ahmedabad, said: “It will usher in a new era of transparency in the judicial system. It will also make the lawyers accountable to their clients...” Aseem Pandya, former president of Gujarat High Court Advocates Association, said, “This is one of the remarkable and great moments for judiciary in our country.” “Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” the SC had observed in September 2018 in a judgment that paved the way for live streaming of court proceedings. Two years down the line, CJI Bobde said on Monday that in practice, live streaming could be misused. Sharing his thoughts on live streaming as part of suo motu proceedings on court functioning during the pandemic, CJI Bobde, heading a three-judge bench, said, “In principle, I agree that there should be live streaming but in practice, you must hear me. As CJI, I have to deal with so many complaints over the virtual court proceedings.”The observation followed a suggestion by Attorney General KK Venugopal who suggested that since the Gujarat high court had taken the lead in live streaming the proceedings, the Supreme Court could follow suit. The bench, also comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and LN Rao, said, “There can be some negative use or abuse of live streaming.” Justice Chandrachud, who heads the e-committee of the SC responsible for enhancing virtual court proceedings, told Venugopal that a delay of 20 seconds occurs between the live streaming and actual proceedings in the Gujarat high court. This ensures a check on anything untoward going live.Justice Chandrachud said at present the SC was focusing on enhancing the video conferencing facility. “The idea is to have one video conferencing facility for all high courts and district courts and a separate facility for the Supreme Court. Bids have been invited to manage the entire videoconferencing facility,” Justice Chandrachud said.For better connectivity, the CJI sought the Centre’s help to enhance the optical fibre network. “In states which do not have fibre optics coverage, we have to rely on satellites,” CJI Bobde said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-hc-starts-live-streaming-of-proceedings/story-ZfdJv5uE3Bi7q8luSwtrCK.html
27-10-2020||India||Mercury set to dip this week as winter sets in||Night and day temperatures are likely to fall over the next seven days in northwest India, including in the national capital, as winter conditions set in and due to a feeble western disturbance that led to snowfall in the upper reaches of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, from where colder winds are forecast to enter the northern plains, weather scientists said. According to the forecast by the India Meteorological Department’s regional meteorological centre, Delhi, the weather will largely remain dry, and there will be a gradual decline in maximum and minimum temperatures by 2°-3° C in the next three to four days.Delhi has been recording below normal night time temperatures for at least a week now. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius, two degrees below normal on early Monday morning, and this is likely to dip as the month of November approaches. On Sunday, the minimum temperature in Delhi was only 13.8 degree C, three degrees below normal. It was also the lowest for the month of October since 2009, when 13.5 degree C was recorded. The lowest-ever temperature recorded in October was 9.4 degree C on October 31, 1937. “As we approach November, minimum temperature starts falling. The sky is clear now [less cloud cover] so the heat radiates back at night [leading to a cooling effect]. There was snowfall in the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh on Sunday and Monday... northwesterly winds blowing from the direction of Himalayas bringing cold air but wind speed is low. We will see a fall in temperatures across northwest India,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“For nearly a fortnight, Delhi has been recording minimum temperatures that are at least 1 to 2 degree C below normal. On October 26 and 27, the normal minimum temperature expected is 16.7 degree C and after than 15.9 degree C till November 1. But we expect minimum temperatures to be around 13 to 14 degree C,” Shrivastava added. “There is smoke in the air which is why there are haze-like conditions during the day time.Wind direction will continue to remain northwesterly but there may be some improvement in wind speed Tuesday onwards,” he said, referring to the air pollution levels in the capital city. Air quality in most parts of northwest India including Delhi, Faridabad, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Bhiwadi, Bulandshahr remained in the ’very poor’ category air on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-set-to-dip-this-week-as-winter-sets-in/story-zmKtHO7HvHjmxH87TEomyK.html
27-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I skipped four instalments of this column because I decided to take a short break — part birding trip, part R&R, but all safe, masked, and socially distanced. It involved driving through rural and semi-urban Uttar Pradesh, where no one appears to be wearing masks (and there is no social distancing), and Uttarakhand, where most people sport them, and there is some adherence to social distancing norms.That India’s largest state has managed to keep its Covid-19 numbers where they are (470,270 cases till the evening of October 25; 6,882 deaths; a mere 2,032 cases on October 25 itself; and only 27,317 active cases) despite a dependence on rapid antigen tests (which are unreliable) and lax enforcement of both mask discipline and social distancing is truly impressive — and also surprising.Uttarakhand, at least the part I went to, wasn’t crowded. The state insists that all inbound tourists register themselves, and there was a check at the point of entry to ensure this. A test isn’t required, although I did take a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) one a few days before I travelled (it was negative). According to the HT dashboard (which is also the source of the Uttar Pradesh numbers), Uttarakhand saw 221 cases on October 25, has seen 60,376 in all, and has had 993 deaths. That means it has fewer than 5,000 active cases.To digress, it felt good to get out of Delhi after nearly eight months. I think, when this is all over (which must be one of the most commonly used phrases these days), it will take me some time to get used to not wearing masks; it felt strange to walk even on jungle trails without a mask despite there being no one else around. The sense of normalcy in both Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand isn’t surprising given their current caseloads. India itself has just around 650,000 active cases at this point. And on Sunday, India registered a mere 46,011 cases, half the number of cases it was registering per day in the third week of September. The last time it registered such numbers was in late July. As Dispatch 176 on October 7 first pointed out, the first wave of the coronavirus disease in India is over. It lasted roughly seven months.There’s no telling how long the lull will last, and how low the daily case numbers could go. Yet, based on what’s happening in Europe — Dispatch 155, on September 11, referred to the emergence of the second wave in Europe that is now raging through that continent — and the US (the same column mentioned the likelihood of a third wave in the US), the respite will likely be temporary. And based on the trajectory of the second and third waves in the US and the second in Europe, there is a high probability that the intensity of the second wave in India will be stronger than the first. The second wave in Europe is following the same trend seen in the second wave in the US: it is leading to fewer deaths, and it will be interesting to see if the number of deaths in the ongoing third wave in the US is lower even than that seen in the second. Still, lower deaths haven’t meant fewer hospitalisations. Hospitals in many European countries have been overwhelmed by the sheer number of people needing treatment for Covid-19, and the same thing is beginning to happen in several US states.Part of the reason for the higher intensity of subsequent waves of the coronavirus disease is obvious — they coincide with progressive easing of restrictions on movement and activities, often encouraging people, usually the young, to indulge in irresponsible behaviour. In many European countries, the median age of people infected in the second wave is lower than that in the first.The result isn’t just a spike in infection numbers but severe illnesses, and may be even deaths in vulnerable populations. Research by Paraic Kenny of the Gundersen Medical Foundation, Wisconsin, and others, published on pre-print server medRxiv and reported in Nature, shows a strong correlation between the reopening of in-person education in colleges in one of the state’s counties and an increase in coronavirus disease infections, with one of the strains (the researchers carried out a genomic investigation) spreading to old-age homes where it infected eight and killed two.That is what countries, including India, have to guard against.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-3SJSLwHfGGPO6ZHaC4KpXL.html
27-10-2020||India||S-I dismissed for stalking, harassing women, minor||A 35-year-old Delhi Police sub-inspector, who was arrested on Saturday for sexually harassing and stalking three women and a minor girl, was on Monday dismissed from service. The man had flashed, passed indecent remarks and stalked three women and a minor girl on a road in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka between October 17 and 20. He is currently in prison.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav confirmed sub-inspector Puneet Grewal was dismissed on Monday. Grewal was posted with the special cell -- the police’s anti-terror cell.Three incidents took place on October 17, at different places under the jurisdiction of Dwarka South police station while another took place on October 20, under the limits of Dwarka North police station. Grewal, who was arrested from Janakpuri, has been booked in cases registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 354-D (Stalking), 354 (molestation), 354 A and 509 (sexual harassment) and sections 8 and 10 of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.While the minor girl and two women gave their complaints, one woman refused to file her complaint. The police spoke to her about the incident, took suo motu cognizance and filed a case.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said Grewal was arrested following a week-long investigation during which they scanned CCTV footage from several points in Dwarka and examined more than 100 grey Baleno cars, similar to the one that Grewal was driving at the time of incidents.“Our teams scanned through over 150 CCTV footage clips showing more than 100 cars, similar to those which Grewal was driving, that were spotted on those stretches from where the incidents were reported. He was arrested soon after it was confirmed that he was in the car at the time of incident,” said a senior officer.The officer also said that Grewal has claimed that he was drunk at the time of all four incidents.Another senior officer said that the woman who did not file her complaint posted a video on October 21, on social media narrating the sexual harassment she faced from a man in grey car, while cycling in Dwarka on October 17. The woman alleged that she was cycling near Dusshera Ground close to the DDA Sports Complex in Dwarka when she noticed a car following her.“While cycling I noticed a small grey car the rear glass of which was shattered and it was noticeable. As I was cycling near along the footpath, the car driver started driving parallel to me. Since I ignored it and did not look towards the driver, he honked. At this, I signalled the driver to drive ahead. But the driver did not leave and he continued driving parallel to me,” the woman said in the video.She added, “When I realised that something was not right, the man started greeting me by saying Hello. As I stopped and looked at him, the man asked for directions to reach Dwarka Sector-14. Before I could reply, I saw that he had unzipped his pants and was flashing me. I screamed at him and asked him to leave. At this, he started saying nasty things...I realised there was nobody there, cars were passing by...I was thinking whether I should start recording his acts on my cellphone or leave the place...”According to the officer cited above, two more incidents had taken place on that day. One of the victims, a 17-year-old girl, had reported the incident to the police by calling the control room and filing a written complaint as well. “The woman in the video refused to file a complaint, even after we spoke to her on phone and counselled her. The other woman filed her complaint and we converted into an FIR on October 22, the day two more cases were registered. Apart from the three incidents on October 17, a similar incident took place on October 20,” said the officer.Since the three women and the minor girl gave similar descriptions, the police suspected that the same person was involved in all the crimes. The incidents were also almost identical – a man in grey car stalking, passing lewd remarks, touching the women and the girl inappropriately and making indecent gestures. Several teams were formed to investigate the cases, identify the suspect and bring him to justice.“We scanned footage from CCTV cameras installed around the crime scenes. The car was spotted. Our teams followed the routes the car took after the crimes and scanned footage from over 200 cameras. This exercise led us to the place where the car was parked. The suspect turned out to be a Delhi Police sub-inspector. We arrested him after collecting evidence. Till his arrest, we did not know that the suspect was a policeman as he was not in uniform during the crimes,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-i-dismissed-for-stalking-harassing-women-minor/story-3I0oGi75A8s5cPsx71zoTM.html
27-10-2020||India||Fresh row between govt, corporations||The Delhi government on Monday said that it is the Centre that owes money to the municipal bodies and not the AAP dispensation as the mayors of three corporations squatted outside the chief minister’s house to demand Rs 13,500 crore for paying salaries to striking doctors and other medical staff. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash along with South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh and East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain sat outside the main gate of CM’s residence from 11.30am till 8.30pm. The mayors called off the protest in the evening after health minister Satyendar Jain, who earlier in the day said that the mayors didn’t turn up for a meeting called by him at 2pm, came down to meet them outside the CM’s house. Hundreds of doctors from North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run hospitals and dispensaries are on a strike, protesting over non-payment of salaries for three months. Asserting that the mayors were politicising the issue, Jain said the BJP should resign and hand over the three civic bodies to the Delhi government to resolve all these issues. “I met the three mayors on Monday evening and told them that the central government is supposed to give ₹12,000 crore to the MCDs. The central government is supposed to give Rs 488 per resident as a grant to the MCDs but they have not paid this money for years,” he told reporters.“I have requested them to urge the central government to pay this money. But they have not shown any interest in this suggestion which clearly shows that the BJP ruled MCD just wants to politicise the issue. I have also raised the issue of corruption in the BJP-ruled MCDs but they have rejected the claims. Everybody is aware of the corruption in MCD but they [the mayors] are silent on this,” he said.“In Delhi, to build a new house a person needs to pay lakhs of rupees to the MCDs. Today the MCDs are unable to pay the doctors and nurses along with other employees because of this corruption. I will again say that if they are unable to run the MCDs then the BJP must resign and we will run the MCDs with the same budget,” Jain said, adding that they would run the civic bodies openly and effectively while paying the salaries of the “heroes” on time. Earlier, North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said, “We have been sitting outside the CM’s residence for over seven hours and they have not contacted us. Satyendar Jain left a message on Twitter. Is this how the government functions? This just shows their seriousness about the issue.”According to the mayors, the government owes ₹3,000 crore to the East corporation, ₹4,000 crore to the South corporation and ₹6,500 crore to North Corporation. In the current financial year, the government has not released the entire payment till the second quarter, they alleged. Nirmal Jain and Mithilesh said, “How do they expect us to pay salaries to our employees. With the implementation of 7th pay commission, our expenditures have increased and the Delhi government is not releasing funds.”Accusing the BJP of politicising the issue, the AAP alleged that the Centre owes the municipal corporations ₹12,000 crore but the BJP leaders are not demanding the Centre to release the funds.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said as per the 14th finance commission report, the Centre has to provide grants to the municipal corporations. “In the last 10 years, the Centre should pay the civic bodies in Delhi around ₹12,000 crore…The Delhi CM and the finance minister have repeatedly written to the Centre asking them to release this fund. The Delhi BJP leaders have never asked the Centre to release this fund. We demand that this should be released immediately,” said Pathak.While Pathak urged Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to intervene and release the funds, the health minister said that the government will support the mayors if they go and ask the centre for pending funds.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said this is just a tactic by the AAP to shrug off its responsibility and indulge in blame game. He said that the ₹13,500 crore demand is as per the recommendations of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Delhi Finance Commission.Gupta said the government is doing all this at a time when the city is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. “The government has a ₹60,000 crore budget and it is not paying the funds which it is supposed to pay as per the finance commission recommendations. They are only inconveniencing the people of Delhi. It has not even paid ₹9 crore spent by the North corporation to make Hindu Rao a Covid-only facility. They are doing politics in this hour of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-row-between-govt-corporations/story-BfN2DZEaMiHUccusNkdg8N.html
27-10-2020||India||Man arrested from Bihar for raping woman in SE Delhi park last week||Delhi police on Sunday arrested a man who had raped a 25-year-old in a park in south east Delhi’s Harkesh Nagar last week. Police have identified the man, who is 27-years-old, and worked at a hardware shop and lived in the same neighbourhood as the woman. Police said they had received a call at Govindpuri police station on October 18, reporting that an injured woman was lying under a foot-overbridge in Harkesh Nagar.A police team reached the spot and took the woman to AIIMS where her medical examination revealed that she was raped. Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said a case of rape was registered to probe the crime. Local enquiry helped police identify the woman. Police then met her husband, he said.“The man told police that his wife had gone missing on the night of October 18, when he and their son left for Tughlakabad to attend a birthday party. He told police that when he returned they searched for the woman and before he could go to the police the next day, she was found. During investigation, we checked CCTV footage and the woman could be seen leaving her house. More CCTV footage were checked and we spotted a man who joins her,” Meena said.The DCP said local enquiry helped them identify the man, who lives in Govindpuri. “Since the woman was last spotted with him, we raided his house but he was at large. We obtained the address of his native place in Patna, Bihar and following a raid he was arrested from Patna,” the officer said.During questioning, the man confessed to have sexually assaulted the woman. “He said that on October 18, both of them went to Chandiwala park where he sexually assaulted her,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-from-bihar-for-raping-woman-in-se-delhi-park-last-week/story-PiNzBjotgB8pCR2vinmTZP.html
27-10-2020||India||SC stays HC order barring rallies in MP||The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a direction passed by the Madhya Pradesh high court that imposed strict conditions on physical gatherings by political parties on the campaign trail for the 28 assembly seats in the state for which bypolls will be conducted on November 3.The high court order -- delivered by its Gwalior bench on October 20 and later extended on October 23 -- said that public campaign meetings could be held only if virtual events were not possible, and with the written permission of district magistrates after fulfilling safety conditions due to the pandemic.The order was challenged by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on the grounds that it amounted to a direct interference with the commission’s power to supervise and monitor elections in the country under Article 324 of the Constitution. ECI also contended that the high court order paralysed election campaigning in the state.It was also challenged by two candidates from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – Pradyuman Singh Tomar and Munnalal Goyal, contesting elections from two seats in the Gwalior assembly segment -- who said that the restraint on physical rallies has cost them a seven days of campaigning, and asked that they should be compensated for this by being given additional time to reach out to the electorate. The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjeev Khanna agreed that the order must be stayed, but justified the high court’s directions in light of the spread of the virus. “We direct the Election Commission to consider the issues referred to in the impugned order (of the high court) and proceed in the matter in that regard in accordance with law appropriately. We are not expressing any opinion either way on the merits of the process to be adopted or about the decision to be reached by the Election Commission of India,” the bench said.“The situation was not improving on the ground so High Court had to interfere. You (ECI) should have intervened at appropriate stage and ensured that public meetings by candidates do not violate the Standard Operating Protocol (issued by the state owing to the Covid-19 pandemic). We wish you were more proactive in supervising elections,” it added.ECI issued guidelines on September 25, allowing for physical gatherings subject to curbs recommended by the state. But the HC was told on October 20 that 10 FIRs were registered against candidates who violated rules.The judges told the probe panel that it shoulders the responsibility for holding free and fair elections and not the High Court. “You must set right the situation. We will stay this order but you must ensure there is no violation of the law seeing the ground situation.” On the demand for added time for campaigning, the bench gave liberty to the candidates or political parties to approach ECI.State spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party, Rajneesh Agrawal, said: “Our party will continue to respect and follow the ECI guidelines in the elections as decided by the SC.”Congress spokesperson for the state, Bhupendra Gupta, hailed the order. “High court’s order had led to a state of confusion as to whose orders to follow whether ECI’s or Home Department’s or the high court’s. The SC’s order has made the situation clear.”Political analyst Girija Shankar said, “Supreme Court’s order has come in accordance with The Representation of the People Act, 1951 which states that once the election process begins Election Commission is the authority which will decide the entire election process. After high court’s order it appeared that the high court was intervening in the process slightly. Hence, it’s ECI which moved the Supreme Court first.” Still, Shankar added, the HC was only trying to address inadequacies in how campaigning was happeing against the backdrop of Covid-19. “Political parties have been responsible for crowds in political meetings and violations of Covid-19 protocol. Unfortunately, the collectors who were and are supposed to take action in capacity of returning officers on such violations kept mum. Hence, HC had to intervene. But even then the HC didn’t fully undermine the authority of the Commission as it said the permission for the political meetings will be given by the collectors only after approval by the Commission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-hc-order-barring-rallies-in-mp/story-fQqg7GEdxeE5yliMMOzIJP.html
27-10-2020||India||Ex-NDA minister Dilip Ray gets 3-year jail in coal case||A Special CBI court on Monday sentenced former union minister of state for coal, Dilip Ray, 66, to three years for illegally allocating, in 1999, a Jharkhand coal block to a private company Castron Technologies Ltd (CTL). The special CBI judge, Bharat Parashar, observed that the Brahmadiha coal block in Giridih, Jharkhand was allocated to Castron Technologies Ltd in 1999 by Dilip Ray, the then minister of state (Mos) for coal despite the fact that he was part of a “caretaker” government, which should not have taken a major policy decision. Ray was part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government that was acting as a caretaker government when this particular allocation was approved by Ray. Besides Ray, two former senior officials of the coal ministry, Pradip Kumar Banerjee and Nitya Nand Gautam, as well as Mahendra Aggarwalla of Castron Technologies Ltd have also been sentenced to three-year jail terms and fined ₹10 lakh each. The judge also imposed fines of ₹60 lakh on Castron Technologies Ltd (CTL) and ₹10 lakh on Castron Mining Ltd (CML). The accused were convicted on October 6 for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and prevention of corruption act. In his conviction judgment on October 6, Parashar said: “Undoubtedly, the approval of said guidelines for allotment of captive coal blocks for opencast mining and underground mining amounts to taking a major policy decision and which Dilip Ray as part of a Caretaker government should not have taken. The question which however requires examination is as to whether the impugned decision was necessary for day to day administration or it could have waited till the new elected government was formed”. Ray’s lawyer Manu Sharma said: “We are going to challenge this particular assertion about caretaker government because CBI never brought up this charge during investigation or trial.” Former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), V S Sampath said: “There is nothing like a caretaker government. A government is a government”. Still, the Election Commission also clarified in 2018 that a caretaker government in states should desist from taking any major policy decisions. Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, who has represented various accused in coal scam cases, said: “I am very surprised at conviction under section 409 of the IPC (criminal breach of trust by a public servant) as the same court in the past has acquitted people charged under 409 IPC in view of three-judge bench judgment of Supreme Court.” His reference to the SC’s three-judge ruling is about a 1999 order in Common Cause Vs Union of India matter in which the apex court said that the power of a minister to allot a property due to discretionary powers over dealing with a particular good is not covered by criminal breach of trust. Aggarwal added that the sentence was not harsh. Parashar, while sentencing Ray and others, observed on Monday that “the loss from ordinary crimes such as burglaries, robberies and larcenies etc. may run into few thousand rupees only but the loss from white collar crimes may run not only in lacs but in crores of rupees”. “Though on the face of it, the arguments of learned counsels for the convict(ed) companies that no loss was caused to anyone in the present matter since almost the entire amount of extracted coal was surrendered back to the government while surrendering back the lease deed, seems to be attractive. However, non-availability of sufficient raw material such as coal has in fact resulted in the lack of infrastructural/industrial development of the country. Had coal block been allocated to a deserving applicant company after following the due process of law and the company would have proceeded to extract coal so as to use it captively in its end use project then it would have certainly added to the infrastructural/industrial development of the country,” the order said. “...suffice to state that arbitrary allocation of coal blocks as has been seen in the present matter to unscrupulous persons who never intended to establish any end use project in itself has caused huge loss to the nation which is difficult to be computable in monetary terms,” Parashar observed. The case pertains to allocation of 105.153 hectares (ha) of an abandoned coal mining area in Jharkhand’s Giridih district in favour of Castron Technologies Limited by the 14th screening committee of the Union coal ministry in 1999. It is different from the investigative agency’s probe into improper allocation of captive coal blocks between 2004 and 2009 -- a scandal that roiled the United Progressive Alliance headed by Manmohan Singh. Ray, a hotelier, was one of the founding members of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the 1990s. The BJD was part of the short-lived Vajpayee government that was in power for 13 months. He left the BJD in 2002 (he was actually expelled) but returned to the Rajya Sabha (to which he had been elected in 1996) as an independent with the support of some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmakers from Odisha. He joined the Congress in 2004, and returned to the BJP in 2009, actually winning the Rourkela assembly election on the party’s ticket in 2014. By then, however, the CBI case against him had been registered at the instance of the Supreme Court. In 2017, charges were framed against him and in 2018, he quit the BJP and also politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-nda-minister-dilip-ray-gets-3-year-jail-in-coal-case/story-d5L61q3wXZHbv109tB4rzN.html
27-10-2020||India||3 PDP leaders quit after Mehbooba Mufti’s flag remark||Three senior Peoples Democratic Party leaders resigned from the party on Monday terming party president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s remarks on the tricolour as “provocative” which “hurt patriotic sentiments”. In a joint letter addressed and signed by the three leaders -- former MP, TS Bajwa, former member of legislative council Ved Mahajan and former state secretary, Choudhary Hussain Ali Wafa-- said, “We, your party colleagues in Jammu region, most of whom remained associated with the party through every thick and thin, since its formation, are feeling quite uncomfortable over some of your actions and undesirable utterances, especially which hurt patriotic sentiments.”On Friday, addressing her first press conference after over 14 months of detention, Mufti said she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year were rolled back. Attacking the BJP-led central government, Mufti had said, “They [Centre] themselves desecrated the Constitution...What do they expect from us? Our flag is this {pointing towards the erstwhile J&K flag} and our relations with the country’s flag have been established by this flag.” Once close confidante of Mufti, Ved Mahajan said, “We strongly condemn her provocative comments against tricolour. Tricolour is our identity and national pride. We are patriotic people. How can we tolerate such provocative remarks from her. They were highly provocative. We are angry with her statement. PDP was formed by late Mufti Sahib to provide an alternative to the people of Jammu & Kashmir, which we did,” he said. PDP leaders were not immediately available for comment.Separately, in Srinagar, three men, claiming to be BJP workers, were detained on Monday after they tried to organise a rally to hoist national flag, police said.Senior Superintendent of Police, Srinagar, Haseeb Mughal said that they did not have the permission to hold the rally. Later, BJP workers held the rally moving with tricolour from Tagore Hall to Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre, to commemorate accession day.BJP leader Aijaz Hussain said that they wanted to send a message to PDP that there are thousands who are ready to die for the national flag.Reacting to BJP’s tricolour rally, PDP leader, Firdous Tak said in a tweet, “We don’t need a certificate of nationalism from the Godse brigade who have always discredited and dishonoured the flag and constitution of this country....”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-pdp-leaders-quit-after-mehbooba-mufti-s-flag-remark/story-RXJSI5Mbra2DhhPUPiSZVI.html
27-10-2020||India||Chhattisgarh may amend state law to counter farm legislation||To counter the three agriculture laws enacted by the Centre last month, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to amend its own law on agricultural produce to bring in specific safeguards for farmers, senior state government officials aware of the development said, adding that this is a different route to what the Punjab government took when it passed a new set of legislation to negate the central laws.A draft of the Chhattisgarh Agriculture Produce Market (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was on Monday approved by the state cabinet at a meeting chaired by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, and would be tabled in the special assembly session to be held on Tuesday and Wednesday.Chhattisgarh is the second state after Punjab to hold a special session of the assembly to counter the central laws. The Punjab assembly had on October 20 passed four bills and a resolution to invalidate the three farm laws, guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) for wheat and paddy growers, and provide for imprisonment of not less than three years and fine for its sale or purchase below the MSPs, even as it is yet to get presidential ascent for the state legislations. In first week of November, Rajasthan government too will call a special session of the assembly in which bills to provide MSP protection for seven staple crops would be introduced, state government officials said.According to a senior government official privy to the developments, the Chhattisgarh government, where the Congress is in power, has not opted for new bills to negate the central legislations because it could be in direct conflict with it.“So, the state government has decided to amend its own Chhattisgarh Agriculture Produce Market Act for safeguarding the interests of the local farmers,” the official said on condition of anonymity.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 were pushed through in Parliament last month. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say the Centre’s farm reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the system of MSPs and that deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.Agriculture minister Ravindra Chaubey said that of the three central laws, the federal government has gone back to original position on the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, after the onion crisis in the country. “As far as other two bills are concerned, the Chhattisgarh government will not bring any law to negate them but will amend Chhattisgarh Agriculture Produce Market Act. The aim is to counter the central law with our own state laws,” he said.The minister said the amendments by the state will increase the “operating area” of mandis to the entire state, like Rajasthan did in September to limit the impact of central farm laws. “Through these amendments, we would be able to audit and investigate the procurement by private companies,” Chaubey said, adding that the Constitution has given the state government power to make laws for agriculture.On why Chhattisgarh has opted for a different route than that of Punjab, a senior official at the Chief Minister’s Office said getting the governor’s approval for a new law would be difficult. “But, widening the ambit of our own APMC law will not be in conflict with the central farm laws and the governor should not have any problem in approving it,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-may-amend-state-law-to-counter-farm-legislation/story-FD2SZAoxuBnrRDksQ4S3vO.html
27-10-2020||India||BJP wins Ladakh council polls by bagging 15 seats, Congress wins 9||The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) on Monday won 15 out of the 26 seats in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) –Leh elections while the Congress managed to capture nine seats. Independents won two seats in the election, the first since Ladakh was made a Union Territory in August last year. The Leh Council has a total of 30 seats with four of the councilors nominated by the government. BJP president JP Nadda termed the party’s victory as historic. “Gratitude to the people of Ladakh for their faith in BJP,” he tweeted and congratulated party leaders and workers.Former BJP minister and ex-president of the BJP’s Ladakh unit, Chering Dorjay said, “It’s a mandate against the BJP. In 2015 they had won 18 seats and this time around they won 15. The BJP lost in their strongholds like Upper Leh. The party’s CEC P Wangyal also lost Sakti, while Phyang and Temisgam constituencies went to Congress.” “I think it is a big defeat of Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, the BJP MP and party chief of Ladakh UT. Though 14 is required to form the council and numbers are on their side but denial of sixth schedule and Wangyal’s performance was not good,” Dorjay added. BJP’s Ghulam Mehdi won Turtuk seat by defeating independent candidate Ghulam Hussain with a margin of 367 votes. Kunzang Lotus of BJP won Hundar seat by defeating Congress candidate Stanzin Chotar with a margin of 420 votes. P Wangyal couldn’t be reached as his cell phone was switched off. The BJP also won Diskit, Tegar, Panamik, Tangtse, Kungyam, Martselang, Karzok, Thiksay, Chuchot, Sku-Markha, Lamayouru, Khaltse and Lingshet, officials said. The Congress won Saspol, Igoo, Temisgam, Basgo, Lower Leh, Upper Leh, Phyang, Sakti and Skurbuchan council seats. The Independents bagged seats of Nyoma and Chushul.BJP and Congress had fielded their candidates on all the 26 constituencies while Aam Aadmi Party fielded 19 candidates. 23 independents were also in the fray. The campaign for the polls was dominated by the demand for the Sixth Schedule status to protect local demography, jobs and land and legislative powers to the LAHDC-Leh. Dorjay had cautioned the Centre on September 28 about a sustained campaign in case the Apex Body of People’s Movement, an apolitical body, was hoodwinked about its long-pending demands. The body has former BJP Member of Parliament (MP), Thupstan Chhewang, Dorjay, Rinpoche Nawang Chamba Stanzin, the head of Thiksey monastery, and Nawang Rigzin Jora, a former minister, as it’s members. The umbrella group includes political parties and religious organisations and the all-powerful Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association. The safeguards will also guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wins-ladakh-council-polls-by-bagging-15-seats-congress-wins-9/story-FrSsK1RB3uHta85k29hrNI.html
27-10-2020||India||Woman’s decapitated, mutilated body found||A 35-year-old woman’s headless body, chopped into pieces was found in a sack in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut on Monday, the police said.Some passers-by spotted a sack near a graveyard in the Fatehullahpur locality and reported the matter to the police on Monday morning, said Prashant Kapil, the station house officer of Lisari gate police station.“The initial examination of the body indicates that the crime could have been committed at least a day before and the chopped body was dumped at a secluded place near the graveyard. The killers disposed of the chopped head elsewhere to conceal the identity of the woman,” said Kapil. The body would be sent for post-mortem examination, he said. Meerut’s superintendent of police (city) A N Singh said it appeared that the woman was murdered inside a house by some persons who knew her and her beheaded body was dumped near a graveyard to conceal her identity. He said CCTV footage was being collected and examined to trace the perpetrators of the crime.Prima facie it appears that somebody known to the woman has killed her and it (beheading) was done to hide the identity of the deceased. The body was stuffed in a sack, which was apparently being pulled by stray animals at the dump site,” Singh said. “An investigation is on and efforts are on to work out the case,” the officer said.Police were trying to identify the woman through her clothes and efforts were underway to find out whether any woman had gone missing from the area, the SHO said. Legal proceedings are being carried out in the case, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-s-decapitated-mutilated-body-found/story-5P5tujxQQGwLPDu1XgIDcL.html
27-10-2020||India||Single-day Covid-19 deaths drop below 500||The number of daily Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) deaths reported in India dropped to 443 on Sunday, a 66% reduction from a peak of 1,290 deaths on September 16.The cumulative number of deaths due to Covid-19 nationally was 119,034 till Sunday night according to the HT dashboard. “With effective containment, aggressive testing, and standardized clinical management protocols across government and private hospitals, the number of new deaths has significantly dipped,” the Union health ministry said in a statement. Critical care specialists treating Covid-19 patients also say that more lives are being saved now in hospitals as compared to a few months ago because of a better understanding of the disease, and what therapies work. “More serious Covid-19 patients in hospitals are now recovering well. My experience has been that four things work in saving a serious patient: oxygen therapy, steroids, heparin (blood thinner), and the state of care that includes infrastructure in the ICU, training of staff etc. The jury is still out on the benefits of the others, including investigational therapies,” said Dr Anjan Trikha, professor, department of anesthesia, critical care and pain medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. “It is not just giving oxygen but also how you give oxygen that is an art that actually helps in saving a critical patient. All these training workshops that we hold on critical care of Covid-19 patients, the focus is on training doctors in providing oxygen therapy using the right way,” he added. There are 2218 dedicated Covid hospitals in the country. To be sure, the progressive reduction in daily deaths, even amidst rising cases is a feature of the pandemic in Europe as well as the US. The drop in the number of deaths has resulted in steadily declining case fatality rate (CFR), which is the total number of Covid-19 deaths out of total number of cases that returned Covid-19 positive. India’s current CFR stands at 1.5%, which is nearly half of Covid-19 deaths reported globally, and is the lowest since March 22 this year, when it was a little over 3% (3.3%). There are 14 States with CFR lower than 1%, the target that government has set for the country. “Absolutely numbers do not give the real picture . What tells us that the number of deaths is declining is the case fatality rate. A drop in CFR means the overall Covid-19 deaths are going down, which is a good sign,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/single-day-covid-19-deaths-drop-below-500/story-jgtwoQKsJ0z1r17JXTrXNP.html
27-10-2020||India||‘Cannot stand it’: CJI laments standard of TV news debates||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde told television presenter Arnab Goswami’s lawyer on Monday that he could not stand the level to which prime time news channel debates had descended and wondered where that had left public discourse in the country.In an open admission during a hearing before a three-judge bench of an appeal filed by the Maharashtra government challenging a stay order on an investigation against Goswami in criminal cases lodged against for allegedly spreading social disharmony, Justice Bobde commented it was the court’s duty to ensure peace in society.“Frankly speaking, I cannot stand it. This has never been part of our public discourse,” he said about the high-decibel television debates. “Frankly speaking” also happened to be the title of a show presented by Goswami. The Maharashtra government appealed against a June 30 order of the Bombay high court staying the investigation into two FIRs naming Goswami and other members of his channel, Republic TV. Appearing for Goswami, senior advocate Harish Salve said the FIR was politically motivated as it targeted the news anchor and his channel for raising questions over the silence of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her party over the killing of two Hindu seers by a mob in Palghar in April.“At best, these individuals can file defamation but where is the question of charging them under Section 153A which is inciting disharmony,” Salve argued. This fact was noted by the high court which in its June order said, “It is quite clear that the object of or the target of the petitioner’s attack was primarily Sonia Gandhi and the Congress party. There was no mentioning of either the Muslim or Christian community. It would be too far-fetched to say that the two religious communities were involved in the debate.” The Supreme Court bench, also comprising justices DY Chandrachud and LN Rao, said, “We are more concerned about peace and harmony in this country. Nobody is immune from being questioned. We can ensure questioning is done (by police) in keeping with your right to dignity. But we want an assurance of a sense of responsibility from you (Goswami).”Salve replied, “Responsible journalism is covering sensitive cases without sensationalising.” Salve agreed there was too much noise in television debates which made the court remark, “It is better to remain old fashioned.” The bench said it was concerned that with each passing day, there was a new conflict between the state and Goswami’s channel. The court allowed Salve to file an affidavit mentioning further developments since the high court stay on the investigation. The Maharashtra government questioned why Goswami should get treatment distinct from that given to any other citizen as the high court even stalled the investigation into the two FIRs in relation to the Palghar incident. The bench replied, “While nobody is above the law, some are targeted with greater intensity. Some people thus need additional protection.” The bench said in such matters it adopted a “conciliatory” approach and asked the state to produce a list of all cases being investigated against Goswami and his channel in two weeks. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for the state said that the high court stay on the investigation must go. He was willing to give an undertaking that there shall be no arrest, and summons for appearance will provide a time gap of 48 hours and no questioning will be conducted during night time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-stand-it-cji-laments-standard-of-tv-news-debates/story-SAmCfKWWdbjH6QSavZ2rBP.html
27-10-2020||India||India, US to sign BECA agreement during 2+2 dialogue to facilitate exchange of sensitive information||India and the US will sign the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), the last of four so-called foundational agreements for sharing sensitive information and sales of advanced military hardware, during the 2+2 ministerial dialogue on Tuesday.The agreement, which will facilitate sharing of classified satellite and sensor data, figured in discussions between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his visiting American counterpart Mark Esper on Monday. The signing of the pact will be one of the key outcomes of the 2+2 dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers of the two sides.“The two ministers expressed satisfaction that agreement of BECA will be signed during the visit,” the defence ministry said in a statement after the meeting between Singh and Esper, who arrived in New Delhi on Monday afternoon along with secretary of state Mike Pompeo.Also Read: India must overcome China syndrome, embrace QUAD | AnalysisBECA is considered the last of the foundational agreements to be signed by India and the US. The two sides have been sharing real-time intelligence under the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which was signed in 2018. The two countries signed the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) in 2002 and the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016.Pompeo held a separate meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, during which they discussed concerns and interests, including stability and security in Asia, and the global situation and contemporary challenges, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. It is understood that the India-China border standoff figured in the discussions, though the people said specific issues would be taken up at the 2+2 dialogue. Jaishankar was briefed by Pompeo on the US administration’s thinking on the situation in Afghanistan and the peace process. Jaishankar “highlighted India’s stakes and its continuing concern that decisions should be made by Afghans themselves without the “use of force”, one of the people cited above said. He also made it clear that “cross-border terrorism was completely unacceptable”, the person said. India has been worried by the sharp spike in violence in Afghanistan, mainly by elements with ties to Pakistan’s military, even as the Taliban and the Afghan government are holding talks in Doha. New Delhi has already said the outcome of the intra-Afghan dialogue must ensure that the soil of Afghanistan isn’t used for anti-India activities. Jaishankar stressed the “uniqueness of technology and talent flow connects” India and the US and said “a knowledge economy with greater data sensitivity makes an even stronger case for collaboration”, according to the people. An innovative partnership would be central to the future of the two sides and their policies must support this, he added. Education is a special bond between India and the US and both should work to further expand cooperation in this sphere, Jaishankar was quoted as saying by the people. The discussions between Jaishankar and Pompeo, described as productive, followed up on their meeting in Tokyo earlier this month, and they believed bilateral ties have grown in almost all domains, including trade, energy, defence and education, over the past four years. The two leaders followed up on Indo-Pacific engagement and the Quad deliberations, and also focussed on maritime security, counter-terrorism, open connectivity and resilient supply chains, the people said.

They called for continuation of existing defence dialogue mechanisms at all levels during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the Military Cooperation Group (MCG), the statement said. “They also discussed requirements of expanding deployments of liaison officers,” it added.Singh spoke about initiatives under India’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) initiative and encouraged investments in the country’s defence industry.

27-10-2020||India||Nehru-Gandhi dynasty never respected the PM’s office: JP Nadda||Bharatiya Janata Party president JP Nadda on Monday lashed out against the Congress for alleging that freedom of speech under the current dispensation and democracy is at a crossroads. In a series of tweets, Nadda accused the Congress of disrespecting the Prime Minister’s office and of double-speak on the issue of freedom of expression. He said the Congress can never pontificate about freedom of speech as they have shown contempt against dissenting voices for decades. “...We saw glimpses of it during the emergency. Later on, the Rajiv Gandhi government made a brazen attempt to weaken press freedom. Free press rattles Congress,” he tweeted. On freedom of speech, Congress can never pontificate to others. They have contempt for dissenting voices for decades. We saw glimpses of it during the Emergency. Later on, the Rajiv Gandhi government made a brazen attempt to weaken press freedom. A free press rattles Congress.Nadda went on to say if anyone wants to see a laboratory of usage of brute state power, troubling opponents, curbing freedom of speech in trademark Congress style, they should see the working of the Congress blessed Maharashtra government. “…Except governing, they are doing everything else,” he tweeted. The BJP leader’s comments were a response to Congress president Sonia Gandhi‘s piece in the Hindustan Times where she wrote about the fundamental right of freedom of expression being systematically suspended through suppression and intimidation.  “Many institutions that are meant to uphold the rights of citizens and society at large have been co-opted or supported. The Indian state now diverts attention from the real problems of the people by pronouncing bogus threats to ‘national security’ everywhere,” Gandhi wrote. In response the BJP hit back by claiming that the Congress has been misleading people and despite their “lies”, the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi continue to receive support from the masses. “One dynasty’s deep personal hatred against a person who was born in poverty and became prime minister is historic. Equally historic is the love people of India have showered upon PM Narendra Modi. More Congress is lies and heat increases, the more people will support PM Modi!” Nadda said. One dynasty’s deep personal hatred against a person who was born in poverty and became PM is historic. Equally historic is the love people of India have showered upon PM @narendramodi. More Congress’ lies and hate increases, the more people will support PM Modi!He also criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for burning the PM’s effigy in Punjab during a protest against the recently framed farm rules. “The Rahul Gandhi-directed drama of burning PM’s effigy in Punjab is shameful but not unexpected. After all, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has NEVER respected the office of the PM. This was seen in the institutional weakening of the PM’s authority during the UPA years of 2004-2014,” he said. While the Congress has accused the BJP of being anti-Dalit and failing to curb crimes against women, Nadda responded that if there is any party whose conduct reeks of disgust it is the Congress. “…Atrocities against SC/ ST communities are at an all-time high in Rajasthan, women are unsafe in Rajasthan as well as Punjab, and the Punjab ministers are committing scholarship scams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nehru-gandhi-dynasty-never-respected-the-pm-s-office-jp-nadda/story-Qx55ydZK5k395jXjFR4QFK.html
27-10-2020||India||Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper to attend India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue||India and the US are set to review their strategic and security ties and discuss ways to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific during their third 2+2 dialogue between the defence and foreign ministers in New Delhi on Tuesday. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper arrived in the national Capital Monday afternoon for a two-day visit, during which they will also hold bilateral talks with their Indian counterparts S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh and meet National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 2+2 ministerial dialogue, to be held on Tuesday morning, is expected to focus on regional security cooperation, defence information-sharing so that the two sides can tackle regional challenges more effectively, global cooperation, including public health collaboration to cope with Covid-19, economic cooperation, and working together in the Indo-Pacific, officials have said. “Grateful for the opportunity to connect with our partners to promote a shared vision for a free and open #IndoPacific composed of independent, strong, and prosperous nations,” Pompeo tweeted on Sunday as he began a trip that will also take him to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia.

The visit by Pompeo and Esper will cap a series of high-profile engagements between the two sides this year, which began with President Donald Trump’s visit to India in February. “India, with its large economy, strong support for entrepreneurship and innovation, and its growing international trade, is one of the world’s leading economic powers and is well positioned to promote our shared vision for a free and rules-based Indo-Pacific where all nations can prosper,” the statement said. As outlined in the US national security strategy, Washington welcomes New Delhi’s emergence as a leading regional and global power, and looks forward to collaborating closely during the country’s upcoming term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council during 2021-22.

27-10-2020||India||India should end its ostrich-like approach to China, work with the US | Analysis||India and the US will today sign the Basic Exchange Cooperation Agreement (BECA),the last of the four foundational military agreements which allows both countries to share geo-spatial data. The signing is a culmination of 13 years of negotiation, delays and reflects the mistrust between New Delhi and Washington in the past. The misplaced fear that the US will be able to access Indian data, which could compromise national security in the future, was used by South Block to object to the agreement. That India would be able to get geo-spatial data of the entire neighbourhood, including its adversaries, from the US was not considered.That wasn’t surprising. Since the 1960s, India’s policies and national objectives have been framed in such a way that strategic independence meant distance from America. The matter got compounded when a Republican administration under Richard Nixon feted China in July, 1971 and sent Task Force 74 led by USS Enterprise to the Bay of Bengal in December to punish India for liberating Bangladesh and deter New Delhi from taking military action against Pakistan. The Enterprise’s presence in the Bay of Bengal made such a lasting impact on young Congress politicians at the time that neither Pranab Mukherjee nor AK Antony could erase from their memory as defence ministers during the UPA I and II regimes. It was the Enterprise syndrome that sowed the seeds of suspicion between India and the US. Today, the US Republican administration under Donald Trump has taken a 180 degree turn from Nixon’s China move after 50 years by openly contesting the expansionist policies of Beijing.If it was the Enterprise syndrome that hobbled India’s relations with the US, then Indian policy planners have, since 1962 border skirmishes, adopted an ostrich like approach towards China with all its foreign policy moves towards Beijing bordering on appeasement. The very belief that China will accommodate India if the latter reciprocates and that disagreements should be brushed under the carpet for the larger good of the relationship has not worked — at least for New Delhi. While China wants to deal with India bilaterally on the border issue, it had no compunction in bringing its all-weather ally Pakistan into the border equation when the latter illegally ceded 5180 square kilometres of territory in Shaksgam Valley to Beijing in 1963 and then allowed CPEC construction through Occupied Kashmir. It was China who bought Pakistan as a third party without any qualms. The fact is that China has encouraged Pakistan to punch way beyond its weight category with India in order to create hurdles in the form of terrorism, communalism and to globally entangle it on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. China has blocked India from becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group and has gone to the extent of conspiring with Pakistan to brand Indian engineers working in Afghanistan as global terrorists under the 1267 UNSC resolution.  Also Watch | Trump vs Biden, who’s better for India? The China, economy, climate factorsIndia, in the name of strategic autonomy and non-alignment, has always been accommodating towards China since 1950s Panchsheel Treaty, trying to ignore China’s unwanted comments on the status of J &K, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh in the past, even while maintaining a studied silence over its iron rule in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan. There was an initial attempt to downplay the Arunachal Pradesh stapled visa issue in 2010 and the denial of visa to the Northern Army Commander (Kashmir is under its protection) but India finally took a firm stand after the facts were made public.China has been quite unforgiving towards New Delhi and has always been wary about the economic rise of India , a country with far more soft power and natural affinities with the West, especially the US. The on-going aggression in Ladakh is also designed to punish India for abrogating article 370, making Ladakh into a separate union territory and publishing a new Ladakh map on November 20, 2019 with both occupied Aksai Chin and Gilgit-Baltistan shown as part of it. The resurrection of the already rejected 1959 claim line by Beijing and declaring Ladakh to be under the occupation of India is also an attempt to test the resilience of the Narendra Modi government while at the same time asking New Delhi not to be part of any US alliance. Beijing has played its cards very cleverly. It saw a opportunity in the 2008-2009 world economic crisis . Today under the shadow of the coronavirus disease , which originated from Wuhan, it is again on the front-foot and has no qualms in even engaging Iran while pushing India on Ladakh, Australia on trade, Japan over Senkaku Islands, Taiwan with brute military force, and ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia though sheer bullying over already rejected claims in the South China Sea.Under the circumstances, as a rising power, India should not only protect its national interest but also advance it by aligning with other QUAD members in order to boost trade and connectivity; work together on counter-terrorism initiatives; and strengthen its financial status. QUAD should be seen as a stabilizing global order in an increasing multi-polar world and a counter to China’s expansionist moves under Xi Jinping. In its hey days, the US would have solely handled China but today with its declining heft it needs a rising Japan, Australia and India to restore the rule of law, trade and free and open sea lanes of communication. The third edition of the two-plus-two dialogue and the QUAD maritime exercises next month in Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea provide India an opportunity to synergise its hard security objectives with the US. QUAD is a reality now and not a pipedream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-overcome-china-syndrome-embrace-quad-analysis/story-PPdMWVCGNaK1NwQ8YPzhsJ.html
27-10-2020||India||NHRC study recommends protecting rape accused from ‘false cases’ till found guilty||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has recommended protecting the rape accused from “false cases” by keeping their identities under wraps until they are found guilty.The NHRC recommendation has come at a time when rape cases are leading to public outrage and the public and the political parties alike are demanding the strictest action against the accused.A study, which was commissioned by the NHRC and conducted by the Centre for Women’s Development Studies that is affiliated to the ministry of education, sought to understand sexual violence against women from the perspective of sexual predators. Also read: NHRC issues notice to UP govt, state police chief in Hathras gangrape caseIt said, “While revealing the identity of victims of sexual crimes is a punishable offence, the same principle does not hold in the case of alleged or actual offenders, whose names and personal details can be freely circulated. A time has come, when there is a need for safeguards to protect the accused from ‘false claims’ .” The study – titled “Interrogating violence against women from the other side: An exploratory study into the world of perpetrators” – asserted that anonymity would be beneficial, particularly for the juvenile accused.“Although issues of identification and naming of the principal actors may not appear to be significant in the larger scheme of things, they have major ramifications especially for accused, who are later found to be innocent,” it said.It suggested introducing reforms for perpetrators rather than declaring them guilty at the time of framing of charges against them. “…. a crime like rape must be understood not only in the context of an illegal act that breaches a given statute but as a transgression aimed at violating the agency of the victim(s)” and “there is a crucial need to understand the reasons behind such crimes,” it stated.The study has also dwelt on the concept of consent in a sexual activity. “According to the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, 2012, sexual activity with anyone below 18 years of age is illegal, and yet today’s social context has created the conditions for such interactions. Consequently, the narrative of ‘false cases’ and ‘framing’ by the girl and her family come to represent the deep tensions between tradition and modernity,” it said.“Perhaps, for the first time, women are exercising sexual autonomy and choice in a social milieu in which premarital sex for pleasure especially for women is still very much taboo,” it added.However, activists don’t agree with keeping the name of accused persons in rape cases ‘anonymous’. Lawyer and women rights activist Vrinda Grover said, “What public purpose will be served by anonymising the name of the adult accused in cases of rape? If the argument is that disclosure of the name of an accused impacts his reputation, then that would be relevant for accused of all crimes, including, for example, acts of terrorism. There is no rationale to create an exception for this purpose.” “By raising the age of statutory rape to 18 years, the State has enabled the criminalisation of consensual sexual relationships between adolescents and allowed parental and societal control over the lives of young people. It is these cases that provide fodder for the “false cases” narrative. There is compelling evidence available for the state to amend the law and revert the age of statutory rape to 16 years,” Grover added. Women rights activist and Secretary of All India Progressive Women’s Association (AIPWA), Kavita Krishnan said “The solution to this issue is not to put an embargo on naming persons accused of rape. The solution lies in lowering the age of consent to 16, as it was before 2013, when the government went against the Varma committee recommendations and raised the age of consent to 18”. “Using these facts about girls’ parents criminalising consensual relationships to feed the bogey of ‘false cases’ is disingenuous, dishonest. There’s no evidence that false cases filed by women is a phenomenon at all. In cases where women (not parents and caste or communal outfits) file rape cases, why should the accused not be named? In many cases the accused already enjoys impunity, and popular movements are needed to break that impunity. If we didn’t know rape accused Kuldeep Sengar was being protected from arrest because he was a ruling party MLA, would Sengar be convicted and jailed today?” Krishnan added. The researchers interviewed about 70 juvenile and adult offenders lodged at three facilities in the national capital such as Observation Home for Boys Sewa Kutir at Kingsway Camp, where undertrial juveniles, aged between 15 to 18 years, are housed; Special Home for Boys at Majnu Ka Tilla, which is for convicted juveniles; and Tihar Jail, where adult inmates are lodged. Also read: ‘Harassing for money after failed marriages,’ allege parents after MP woman accuses brothers of rapeExperts from the fields of psychiatry, law, police, media, gender, child and women’s rights were also interviewed before arriving at the conclusion.Majority of these sexual predators claimed that they had a “romantic or consensual relationship” with their victims, whose family members were allegedly responsible for framing them.About 40% of juveniles of the 43 boys interviewed at Sewa Kutir said they had a consensual sexual relationship with their victims that either turned sour or was disapproved of by their parents. “In these cases, the boy usually blamed the parents of the victim for framing him. Some of the respondents expressed concern for the security of the victims, who went back to their family members after their arrest. Four of the respondents accepted that they had committed rape,” the study said. Three out of the 43 boys said they were part of the crime under “peer pressure”. “Three of boys noted that they were part of a gang that committed rape; but they denied having committed the act themselves. They said they were either making a video of the act being committed by other gang members or just watching it from a distance” the study added.At least seven cases out of the 43 relate to “elopement”, where juveniles eloped with the victims without realising the legal implications of underage sexual relationships or marriage.The reasons for rape given by eight juveniles interviewed at Special Home for Boys at Majnu Ka Tilla mirrored the issues and themes found in the narratives in the interviews done at Sewa Kutir, the study cited.In Tihar Jail, 20 adults, accused of sexual assaults, were interviewed. “A majority of the interviewees in Tihar Jail denied the charges. Most of them blamed the criminal justice system, which was in their view tilted towards the victim. Others claimed that the charges were levied against them due to reasons such as family rivalry or alcoholism. Some others denied the charges claiming they were co-accused in a gang-rape, in which they played little to no part,” it added. Neeraj Kumar, a former Delhi Police commissioner, who had handled the investigations during December 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case in the national capital, agreed with some of the findings of the study.“I agree. It is widely accepted that adding severity of punishment to a certain offence does not necessarily lead to its prevention. However, I do feel that the quantum of punishment prescribed for an offence reflects the view of the society: how it looks at the offence; how it sends the message that justice has been done and the victim avenged. All these are important attributes to a healthy justice system,” he said.“It is a fact that rape laws have been misused by stretching the concept of consent a bit too far. Miscarriage of justice on this count can be prevented by alert and mindful judiciary. Treating adults accused of rape on par with juvenile offenders is stretching the logic a little too far. By the same argument, adults accused of other crimes should also not be named until framing of charge. This suggestion appears untenable,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-study-recommends-protecting-rape-accused-from-false-cases-till-found-guilty/story-WDKegC6e1EZkpqtIeCJogN.html
27-10-2020||Today's||IAS, the steel-frame or birds of passage||Every year, through a three-stage competitive process, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) selects about 100 bright young men and women to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Hailing from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, speaking different languages, possessing diverse educational qualifications, they truly reflect the diversity of the country. After the fundamental course of six months of initiation and camaraderie with fellow officers at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, the probationers go on a six-week Bharat Darshan tour, as we did in 1963. Travelling by rail for days through the country’s heartland, getting glimpses of mile after mile of green fields dotted with tubewells, occasional power plants emitting clouds of smoke and bustling towns of an emerging chaotically vibrant India was exciting and a great learning experience. I vividly remember our visits to Chandigarh, Bhakra Nangal, Bhilai and Durgapur, the temples of modern India, and the ancient temples of Kashi Vishwanath, Jagannath Puri and Konark. With its wide avenues, well-laid out office and residential areas, shopping plazas, Le Corbusier’s architectural marvel, Chandigarh, was – and still is – the most beautiful and modern city. On our return, we devoted ourselves to studies that included law, mainly the Evidence Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure, economics with emphasis on planning for development, public administration, a brief history of India and its culture and the language of the state to which we were allotted. A considerable time was devoted to the study of the Evidence Act. With some amusement, I remember law professor Pathak’s five funnels formula for filtering evidence from the depositions of parties in civil and criminal proceedings. Professor Ramaswamy, formidable in size and knowledge, who taught us economics and development, used to tell us with his caustic sense of humour that the larger the size of the economic cake we helped baking, the bigger would be our share of it! Academy director SK Dutta, dapper and a pipe-puffing ICS, rarely addressed us in regular classes, but his valedictory talk was remarkable. He told us how important it is for civil servants not only to do justice but also appear to be doing so, and to choose the time and place for doing what we liked to do in our private life. Distilled, discreet words of wisdom! Most of us would remember our handlebar moustachioed riding instructor Naval Singh and his admonition in his stentorian voice that without learning how to control a horse we wouldn’t be able to control a district! By the time we left the academy, we were a loosely knit group of enthusiastic young men and women imbued with idealism, a sense of purpose and pride, sharing many common concerns about the amazing diversity of our country and its pervasive poverty, raring to join as cogs in the gargantuan wheels of the omnipresent government. We were a privileged lot bestowed with the rare opportunity of serving our country of teeming millions and making a difference, however small it be, to their lives. A favourable combination of circumstances catapulted some of us to the top echelons of the civil services. For brief periods, some of us came under the arc light as bit players in the saga of governance soon to be replaced by another set of actors. So goes the continuing narrative of the IAS, the steel frame of India for its patron-saint Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and a bunch of birds of passage and jacks of all trades for its detractors. akuttynair@gmail.com The writer is a former Punjab chief secretary, chairman of Public Enterprises Selection Board, and principal secretary and adviser to former prime minister Manmohan Singh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/ias-the-steel-frame-or-birds-of-passage/story-UnhmrQRaftaiz7KwQlBESM.html
27-10-2020||Editorials||The Delhi-DC strategic dance | HT Editorial||The most striking element of the latest Indo-United States (US) 2+2 talks is that two senior US ministers flew personally to India during a pandemic and a week before their national elections. This is a testament to the strategic importance Washington attaches to New Delhi. The tangible outcome from these talks was the formal signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Intelligence (BECA). This is the last of four foundational defence agreements between the two countries that allow a much higher level of military cooperation in technology, interoperability, and defence manufacturing.It is not to New Delhi’s credit that it has taken nearly two decades to sign these agreements, overly worried at false claims these would undermine Indian sovereignty. The US has BECA agreements with 57 countries; so, this is hardly an exclusive arrangement. But it is also true few of these countries have ballistic missiles that can now achieve pinpoint accuracy when heading to their targets by accessing the US’s unparalleled network of military-grade satellites. The Trump administration and the Narendra Modi government have been fast-forwarding the integration of the Indo-Pacific strategies of their two countries. In the past several weeks, there has been an alignment of the Malabar naval exercises with the Quad and India participated in a meeting of the Five Eyes intelligence coalition. The Trump team wanted to go further, but the Indian government has preferred to wait for the next US administration to assume office. There are reasons for this caution, notably the erratic nature of US grand strategy over the past 12 years.The next step is about taking things beyond guns and gizmos. India needs to leapfrog economically and technologically to become a genuine strategic balancer to China. Washington now talks of internet coalitions and developing supply chains in high-technology products that all exclude China. But this requires the US government to rework its traditional trade negotiations, put pressure on its firms to make that break, and put a strategic touch to its immigration policies. India now talks of an “innovation partnership” that must develop along with all the military-to-military bonhomie taking place. All this will wait until after the US elections, and requires a negotiations format that goes beyond the present 2+2 conversations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-delhi-dc-strategic-dance-ht-editorial/story-3StIXRnekFZN0vHDh76yvM.html
27-10-2020||Editorials||Stay focused on the big picture in Nepal | HT Editorial||India-Nepal ties are back in the spotlight with the visit of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief, Samant Goel, to Kathmandu last week. Mr Goel met the Nepali Prime Minister, KP Sharma Oli, who has espoused belligerent anti-Indian nationalism for domestic political ends. His visit has drawn up the predictable response in Nepal — of Indian interference in internal affairs — and has also led to criticism of Mr Oli, who is being accused by his critics of now softening up to India.Two things are noteworthy here. One, R&AW has had a substantial role in the neighbourhood in general and Nepal in particular. It not only ensures that the Indian system is on top of information and changing dynamics, but has been an instrument for action — as is the role of any intelligence agency. Nepal’s politicians criticise it publicly, while seeking to cosy up to it privately. The visit and Mr Oli’s willingness to meet Mr Goel confirms this.More broadly however, the visit has led to speculation of India-Nepal ties going back to normal, especially since the Indian Army chief is scheduled to visit Nepal next. India has to do business with whichever elected government is in power in Nepal. But at the same time, New Delhi must be careful that “normalcy” in ties should not come at the cost of narrowing down its interests in Nepal. Only a stable, inclusive, democratic Nepal — led by a regime which knows the value of special ties with India and engages with China within certain boundaries — can help keep the regional security environment balanced. Mr Oli has not given signs of doing this. Delhi can remain tactically prudent, but should not lose sight of this long-term goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/stay-focused-on-the-big-picture-in-nepal-ht-editorial/story-6MKWB688Svz48lgBx1jgZL.html
