We were striding down Avenue Montaigne, a street that connects the Eiffel Tower with the famous Champs-Elysées , the most glamorous street in the fashion world, which houses the haute couture designers of Europe. To my surprise, there was a queue, around the block, of Chinese customers waiting to enter the LVMH store. As I was about to enter the store, I was approached by two Chinese women. They requested me to buy two handbags from the Louis Vuitton range at any price and had the money in hand. There was a quota system of sales in the store, and since they had exhausted their quota, they needed help.In February, I was visiting the same avenue. The economy was undergoing great pain, and it was apparent with the absence of well-heeled customers. The Chinese were the only buyers around who were wooed by the French. Gone were the days of quotas on purchases.But it is not just in terms of consumption patterns. The Chinese have become a force to reckon with in the fashion world, as they manufacture and supply almost all of the luxury clothing and goods to the world. But Covid-19 has dramatically altered the situation, with the market for Chinese goods shrinking.China, however, remains focused on flooding the India market, by supplying copies of indigenously popular crafts, at a fraction of the cost. The Chinese do not work with a costing policy on their goods when they enter a market. It is, at best, a political policy which decides the price of their products. This means they can undercut anything, at any price, to get into India’s fashion and wedding business. They have been quick to create a collection, based on deep research of the values and habits of the Indian consumer. Unfortunately for Indian handmade crafts, China is focused on the production of machine-made alternatives, copying designs from India’s vast resources of craft skills, practised even today by 16 million Indians.This cannot be allowed to continue, especially in a context where Indian craftsmen and women are already confronting rising unemployment due to the Covid-19 crisis. One really must look very carefully at why India is today being inundated with Chinese copies made on cheap fabrics, which is now taking on a vast repertoire — Benarsi and Chanderi saris; Rajasthani crafts of bandani, printed on synthetics; copies of mirror work embroideries of Gujarat and Kutch; a whole repertoire of kantha, suzani, phulkari and Lucknow embroideries, recreated on synthetics by digitised machinery in China; Banjara bags and Kolhapuri chappals, mostly imported from Xinjiang; fake cashmere from Mongolian wool, labelled as pashmina. Not one of these products, imported from China, now rapidly available in most markets, in big or small-town bazaars, helps generate local employment. Instead, they take away work from established craft sectors.India is the only country which has preserved its fashion identity, and given indigenous fashion a young, modern interpretation based on traditional silhouettes, crafts and textile processes organic to the country — a truly Make in India product. It is a miracle, and an enigma, especially if one compares it with countries as disparate as Japan and Mexico where organic clothing is now in museums and the countries follow diktats of the ramps in Paris, with little relevance to their traditional culture and climate. In India, this miracle is a combination of a deep presence of India’s cultural textile crafts and its newfound affluence.For most people I have spoken to, the most controversial and troubling trend is the substantial Chinese inroad into the Indian religious festive markets. I don’t have any quarrel with fairy lights being imported, though this is not rocket science and can be easily be produced in India. But I do think we need to review the imports of diyas; images of Ganesh, Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati; Radha and Krishna sets for $1 to $50, from a country that is not sensitive to India’s religious preferences. This is almost sacrilegious, as these deities are traditionally carved by hand, made of clay and straw, by a combination of sculptors and potters. These are often done during the festive season in sheds in most village communities; the ritual of creating mud objects for worship is deep and historic. These are biodegradable, have an authenticity which gives them their character, and are based on the principle of recycling. We must protect our potters by banning imports of religious objects which are produced in moulds with modern-day materials, and pollute rivers where they are immersed after the festivals. With Covid-19, the traditional orders for potters are slow this year and it makes no sense to get containers of diya alternatives, and Diwali-gifting options from China.As part of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), India needs to review the present situation of imports of non-essential items. An already-strained crafts sector needs protection, not competition from giants in Shijiazhuang and Xiamen, who, in plastic moulds, will churn out any number of images for Holi and Diwali, or volumes of fake embroideries on digital machines at no price at all. These imports from China must be banned immediately before the festive seasons begin, to save our craftspeople from more pain than they are facing already.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/protect-indian-crafts-ban-chinese-imports-analysis/story-zWBFwyrajIHZibuefosj5K.html
07-10-2020||News||Decoding the secret of Modi’s communication | Analysis||Having been a journalist and an anchor for many decades, there is one question that many people keep asking me. “Rajat ji, who is your favourite anchor?” While most professionals compare themselves to their own earlier versions and improve over them, honestly, everyone has someone else in their profession that they like and so do I. However, it is when someone outside your profession shines in a role such as anchoring that one sits up and takes notice. In my rather short list of favourite anchors, I have a non-journalist entry — Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The latest instance of his excellent skill of holding and moderating a meaningful conversation was seen in the Fit India Dialogue 2020. As a yogi who had become the global brand ambassador of yoga, he was fittingly the moderator of this dialogue. And as a karmayogi who has never taken a day off, he is also the epitome of fitness. However, that is not what stood out in the conversation; it was something else.From a young female Kashmiri footballer to a cricket superstar, from a nutritionist to a yoga guru, Modi spoke to everyone effortlessly and held forth on their respective topics with elan. The ease with which he connects to people from many walks of life, something that I had observed long ago, was there for everyone to see.The warmth Modi exudes also helps people connect easily with him. This breaks the ice and puts people at ease and makes them open up, forgetting the fact that they are speaking to a larger-than-life leader. For example, in the same “Fit India” interaction, he cracked a joke with Milind Soman about his age, created a phrase “Ace It Like Afshan” for the footballer, and asked Virat Kohli about the Yo-Yo test.When it began, some people thought that Mann Ki Baat would be a monthly speech on the radio. But Modi has made it a conversation where he, as the anchor, brings together the successes and stories of common people. Even there, he is a calm and knowledgeable anchor whenever he is speaking to people. The conversations are always engaging. An engaging conversation is possible only when people are looking to learn from one another with an open mind. This ability to think that they may have something to learn from the other person is what makes people good listeners. An important reason behind Modi’s excellent conversation skills is that he sees himself as a constant learner. He may be the prime minister, but he still thinks he can look to learn something from everyone, young or old.A good anchor should be sufficiently knowledgeable about different topics to hold the conversation with people from different domains. This ability to be a constant learner has not only helped Modi converse better with people, but has also helped him in a different way. He knows quite a lot about many topics. He has said many times that he has spent some time in most districts of India, especially before he began to hold national positions in his party. Being among the people has helped him gain great knowledge about India’s vastly diverse people and cultures, which one cannot get from books or newspapers; it’s practical knowledge. This is the sort of knowledge that, if one wants a media parallel, separates an anchor who has reporting experience from a studio-bred anchor who does not have experience of the heat and dust outside.In a recent interaction organised by Niti Aayog, Modi was speaking to a few bureaucrats and technology experts on skill mapping- and employment-related issues. I came away impressed by the precise questions he asked on connecting people with skills, employability, social infrastructure in worker clusters, rating of companies based on how they take care of employees and forecasting of manpower requirements in upcoming industrial clusters. He elevated the level of conversation with his specific questions and inputs that even the panellists could not help saying that it inspired them to think deeper.A similar trend was seen across the multiple interactions he had during the coronavirus pandemic with media, doctors, and various other sections of society. He spoke with specifics at hand, calmed everyone and made everyone remember why they were doing what they were doing.Indians are generally passionate about conversations. This is the reason why Modi’s conversations, be it “Fit India Dialogue” or Mann Ki Baat or a host of other such conversations are avidly followed by people. However, the “X factor” in all of them is Modi. The most articulate orators are good at mass communication which is often unidirectional. However, Modi is a rare phenomenon who is both a mass communicator as well as an excellent moderator in multi-directional communication. In fact, given the “aggression” in news studios of late, some anchors can take a leaf or two out of Modi’s book, that research, preparation, and composure create enriching conversations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/decoding-the-secret-of-modi-s-communication-analysis/story-OwnVGIqcvGob9GVAofVLQO.html

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus continued to ravage the population. Of the 34 million global cases, more than two thirds of all infections were in that region and many of those infected were young people or children who could not afford the high costs of treatment. In 2000, less than one per cent of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries had access to treatment.That same year, activists, experts and leaders from Indian generic-producing pharmaceutical groups came together and agreed to produce lifesaving ARVs at a fraction of the cost (less than a dollar a day for the triple therapy) and distribute them across low- and middle-income countries. Those efforts paid off with tens of millions of lives being saved as treatment rates increased exponentially. It also provided a blueprint for how new health technologies, including diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines can be effectively scaled up and priced so that they’re accessible to those that need them most. Now,after Covid-19 has taken its millionth life, India once again has the opportunity to take the lead in tackling a pandemic by acting in solidarity and utilising its world-leading industries for the benefit of all. And the good news from the United Nations General Assembly is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to the global fight against Covid-19: “As the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today. India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.” Furthermore, Indian manufacturers recently pledged to make hundreds of millions of Covid-19 doses available for low- and middle-income nations in 2021 as part of an expanded distribution effort that again demonstrated Indian’s global leadership. Covid-19 has hit India hard in recent months, but there are promising signs that the epidemiological curve is starting to flatten. Key to controlling the outbreak has been the ability to scale up testing, enabling health officials to treat those who are sick and trace their contacts to break the chains of transmission. This is not the first time our country has tackled an infectious disease, which many said would be impossible to wipe out. It has now been nine years since India saw its last case of polio, and it was a combination of government leadership, millions of health workers trained to identify and isolate cases, continuous innovation in the delivery systems – including new ways to record child vaccination and electronic registries – and a safe and effective vaccine that led to its elimination. An effective vaccine is unsurprisingly a major focus of the world’s current response to Covid-19. Laboratories across the world are working around the clock to design and deliver an effective inoculation in record time, with some products already in phase three trials, which is the final stage of testing whether a vaccine is safe and effective for widespread rollout. In this regard, India has been on the forefront of bringing the world together. Along with now 167 countries, it has joined the COVAX Facility, which has the biggest and most diverse Covid-19 vaccine portfolio in the world. The facility set up by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is designed to ensure that as new vaccines are discovered, they are shared effectively around the world. This ensures that those who are most at risk – including health care workers and the vulnerable – are protected first. To do this, WHO has designed an allocation framework that means all countries involved in COVAX will receive a supply of its approved safe and effective vaccines. This isn’t just the morally right choice; it’s also the smart economic choice because by sharing a limited supply of vaccines equitably, countries can vaccinate high-risk populations. Rejecting vaccine nationalism and coordinating across borders will ultimately save many more lives, help to stabilise health systems across the world and ensure a truly global economic recovery. COVAX has outlined an ambitious goal to scale up vaccine production so that two billion doses are available by the end of 2021. Long considered the pharmacy capital of the world, India, which already supplies large amounts of medicines and vaccines to global health programmes such as PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis and Gavi, will have a key role in achieving that wide-scale roll out of a Covid-19 vaccine.India was at the forefront of the AIDS crisis and continues to be a major force in driving research and development on Covid-19, vaccine preventable diseases like rotavirus and neglected tropical disease. By joining the COVAX Facility, we have once again sent out a powerful message to countries across the world that India is committed to working across borders to fight disease and improve health for all. Our nation is home to some of the brightest minds in health, medicine, and logistics, and it is right that we should share that expertise with others to ensure that, as a global community, we are more the sum of ours parts in our response to Covid-19.Dr Soumya Swaminathan is Chief Scientist at the World Health Organization The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-vaccine-india-s-key-role-in-ending-the-pandemic-analysis/story-HiAssMfWqfgv23sKPKro0K.html
07-10-2020||News||A new science, tech innovation policy||The Covid-19 pandemic triggered the worst global catastrophe since World War II. The world economy has hit one of the worst recessions ever.However, extraordinary situations need extraordinary responses. Despite the economic distress caused by the pandemic, India has launched several comprehensive and forward-looking policies, which will bring about a paradigm shift in national development. From the National Education Policy (NEP) to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission and other associated reforms, a serious attempt is being made to steer the country towards self-sufficiency, and adopting innovative solutions to foster sustainable growth, secure jobs, and increase competitive abilities.A wave of transformation is discernible in all sectors of the economy. It is in the same manner that we are fine-tuning the role of science, technology and innovation (STI) to tackle emerging social, economic and environmental challenges. Keeping the new world order in mind, the task of re-energising the economy is now being undertaken through the finalisation of a new national Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (STIP) 2020. The foundational values of the proposed STIP-2020 are being inclusive, expert-driven, bottom-up, decentralised, inclusive, evidence-based, and knowledge-supported.STIP-2020 is being launched by the government at a crucial juncture. A policy that aims to transform must be adaptive to dynamic change. STIP-2020 is India’s fifth policy on science and technology and is being finalised amid unprecedented circumstances, in the backdrop of the global pandemic and resultant economic distress. The current situation demands a considerable departure from previous policies in terms of processes and outcomes.There is no doubt that we need to encourage more social “experimentation” and implement a policy that will ensure disruptive social entrepreneurship in all sectors. Therefore, the new policy seeks to provide space for initiatives to protect the diversity of innovation, harness entrepreneurial potential and steer qualitative change in people’s lives. This is the only way to tackle the kind of sustainability crises that we are facing at the moment and also prevent them in the future.We have tried to change the entire STI ecosystem in the last six years. It has undergone a rapid transformation in terms of relevance, scope, and scale. These changes must reflect in our policy positions to ensure a long-term development trajectory and vision for the country. Moreover, Covid-19 has introduced some new learnings and added different dimensions to the STI ecosystem.Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has given a clarion call to achieve Atmanirbhar Bharat. This will need a greater focus on the development of indigenous technologies and encouragement to grassroots-level innovation. This is the opportune time to build strong connectivity among government, academia and industry. The country must take advantage of the emergence of disruptive and impactful technologies. The government’s focus on equity and inclusion issues is becoming much more relevant than ever before.India’s STI growth trajectory over recent years has been impressive. Our entry into the club of the top 50 countries in the global innovation Index with a rank of 48 (a massive improvement from 81st place in 2015) speaks volumes for our potential. Keeping this as a top priority, the new STI policy aims to address issues at the grassroots and build a long-term pathway, which will fulfil the dreams and aspirations of millions of young Indian scientists and students. This can be achieved only through an inclusive and participatory policy formulation process. Hence, the STIP-2020 process has been divided into four interlinked consultation tracks.Track-I involves extended public and expert consultations carried out by the Science Policy Forum that aim to reach out to Indians citizens across the world, for their comments and feedback. Track-II relates to expert consultations through 21 thematic group discussions. Track-III includes consultations with ministries (including line ministries) and states/Union Territories in keeping with a decentralised approach and Track-IV comprises apex-level consultations and advice.A total of 150 categories of stakeholder consultations have taken place so far, in which more than 25,000 people participated and held extensive discussions. STIP-2020 will also address some key issues such as increasing the expenditure on research and development (R&D) to 2% of the gross domestic product, private sector contribution to R&D, technology indigenisation and self-reliance, equity, and inclusion, mainstreaming traditional knowledge systems, strengthening industry-academia-government interconnectedness, ease of doing research, science-diplomacy strategy and building strong Centre-state partnerships.I am confident that STIP-2020 will lend an impetus to strategies which contribute not only to economic growth and productive diversification, but also to sustainable and inclusive development. I expect STIP-2020 to be a true enabler of transformation for the nation. Harsh Vardhan is Union minister for science & technology, earth sciences, health, & family welfare.

07-10-2020||News||Alternative medical tools against Covid-19||In the absence of a proven vaccine against Sars-CoV-2, exploring alternative ways to combat the disease is key. The development of targeted reactivated antibodies, discovering new antiviral molecules and other effective tools of immunotherapy could provide a boost to immunity against the virus. “Designer antibodies”, with neutralising ability for the virus, have become an important tool in treating infectious diseases. The best example is that of a lethal infectious disease caused by the Ebola virus. Researchers developed a therapeutic antibody cocktail involving two fundamentally different antibodies, one from a genetically-humanised mouse and the other from a human survivor with the same disease. Humanised mice are commonly used as small animal models in biomedical research. Their immune system is modified such that it becomes an efficient source of naturally-selected fully human antibodies. In a recent paper published in Science, scientists at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. exploited the same technology to successfully generate pairs of highly potent antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein, which could be used as a therapeutic antibody cocktail aimed at minimising the viral load in patients with Covid-19. But why does one need a cocktail of two antibodies? It turns out that individual antibodies, no matter how good, are not potent enough against a devastating disease such as Covid-19 since the virus is able to find ways to escape being neutralised. Regeneron, on September 29, announced the first data of their phase 1/2/3 clinical trial of an investigational antibody cocktail, REGN-COV2. The trial involving 275 patients showed reduced viral load and improved symptoms in non-hospitalised patients. The greatest improvement was observed those who had failed to mount their own effective immune response prior to treatment, suggesting that such a “designer antibody” could emerge as a substitute for the naturally occurring immune response. No unexpected side-ffects have so far been recorded. The results of the trial have generated so much of confidence that physicians have opted to treat United States (US) President Donald Trump with this “experimental antibody”, with a large dose of eight grams, as against the usual dose of 2.4g. The second weapon for controlling the spread of the coronavirus is based on a better understanding of the mechanism driving its high infectivity. In a paper published in Science, a team of researchers at the University of Bristol unexpectedly found molecules of a free fatty acid, namely linoleic acid (LA), buried in a tailor-made pocket within the receptor-binding domain of the virus protein. Using the powerful imaging technique, electron cryo-microscopy (Cryo-EM), they were able to decipher the structure of the virus Protein LA complex at a near-atomic resolution. LA is a constituent of linseed oil, used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of linoleum. It is indispensable for many cellular functions including maintenance of cell membranes in the lungs so that we can breathe properly. It plays a vital role in inflammation and immune modulation and is the most likely molecule to which the Sars-CoV-2 attaches itself in order to enter the human body. The next step is to develop a drug that could distort the virus spike protein and prevent it from attaching to the molecules of LA. The third strategy is based on interferons (IFNs), that get released by host cells in response to the presence of several viruses. Besides their antiviral properties, these molecules play an important role in anti-tumour and immunomodulatory responses. Of the various varieties, type 1 IFN-a is known to influence the development of innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections. In a study published in Science, Paul Bastard and colleagues have reported that in about 10% of patients with serious Covid-19, the interferon response gets crippled by the development of neutralising IgG auto-antibodies that attack IFNs itself at the onset of critical disease. Interestingly, none of the 663 people in a control group with mild or asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2 infection had these rogue antibodies. An interesting feature of this study is that the majority of patients with IFN-attacking antibodies are males (94%) with half of the gravely ill being over 65 years of age. This helps explain why older men face a higher risk of severe disease. The study raises an important possibility. Could synthetic IFNs given before or soon after the infection help block the virus before it causes severe disease? Interferon therapy has already been approved as immune-boosters in several diseases, including cancer and hepatitis. Several trials have already been initiated for Covid-19 at a dozen universities in the US and Europe and their results point to IFN safety and faster clearance of the virus, particularly if the therapy is initiated early. The Covid-19-era has witnessed unprecedented swiftness in scientific collaboration. Several welcome possibilities have emerged and these have the potential to protect the high-risk health care workers, while also lessening the severity of Covid-19 in hospitalised patients until the vaccine becomes available.

In fact, the Bills open a number of options for the farmers to sell their produce at good price. The farmers will be able to directly sell their produce to private companies. In contract farming, private players will bring in new technology and invest. This will help the farmers,” Sharma said. Sharma was speaking at a press meet where Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and other BJP functionaries were present. The MP reiterated that the Bills had not abolished the MSPs and the mandis. “The MSPs will continue to remain in force. The MSPs will be decided on the principal investment amount plus 50% profit,” he said. He said contract farming policy is already in place in some states. “Contract farming is in place in Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and some other states,” he said. In such a farming pattern, only the crops will be under contract and not of the land, he said. “In case of any dispute, the local sub-divisional magistrate will resolve the matter and the farmers need not go to court,” he said. The GB Nagar MP said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, through these Farm Bills, implemented recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee Report: National Commission on Farmers. He said under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, the government had transferred Rs 93,000 crore directly in the bank accounts of 10 crore farmers. Pankaj Singh termed the three bills as historic and said BJP workers will take the message to urban and rural areas and inform the farmers. “There are some people who are misleading the farmers that these bills are against them. In fact, this reduces the involvement of middlemen. We will hold meetings and chaupals and inform farmers them about it,” he said. On September 25, Bharatiya Kisan Union members had protested and blocked the Delhi-Noida border near Sector 14A in protest against the Farm Bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/msps-and-mandis-not-abolished-we-will-reach-out-to-farmers-to-remove-misconception-gb-nagar-mp/story-YGR7VmkoJU87KqpHeutg0I.html
07-10-2020||Noida||Three more persons arrested in Bike Bot ponzi scheme case||The Noida police Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and Noida Special Task Force (STF) teams on Wednesday arrested two more suspects in connection with the ₹3,500 crore Bike Bot scheme case.Till date, 14 people have been arrested in the case, which involved duping many investors in the name of opening a app-based motorcycle taxi company.The suspects arrested on Wednesday were identified as brothers 35-year-old Dankaur resident Sachin Bhati and 33-year-old Dadri resident Pawan Bhati. Meerut STF also arrested third suspect 50-year-old Ganga Nagar resident Karanpal Singh from Hapur in connection with the case. Raj Kumar Mishra, additional SP (Noida STF) said that that Pawan and Sachin were arrested from Nangla Nainsukh village in Dadri. “They were directors of Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited, which had floated the Bike-Bot scheme in 2017. Their older brother Sanjay Bhati was the mastermind of the scheme and is presently in jail,” he said. Mishra said that police arrested the absconding brothers based on a tip.Meanwhile, Karanpal Singh, who was also a director in the company, was arrested from an auto in Hapur. He told police officials that he had retired as hawaldar from Indian Army in 2009. In 2013-14, he went to Dehradun and worked with a private investment company. In 2017, he came in contact with Sanjay Bhati and started working for the Bike-Bot scheme. Sanjay Bhati had allegedly set up the company in 2010. The modus operandi was lucrative, said police. The accused would seek ₹62,000 investment per motorcycle in return for ₹1.17 lakh per annum income. This, however, never took off and last year, people approached the police against the company.

He was addressing the virtual ceremony of ‘Daring Cities-2020’, a global forum on climate change. Speaking of the odd-even plan, Kejriwal said that initially there was lack of political will as well as fear among citizens that they would face transportation issues due to the plan. He said, “Earlier there was fear among the people as well as politicians that this would lead to problems but gradually we started seeing benefits of this scheme.”He also said that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has expanded its operations to ensure people across the city remain connected. “We have given a huge push to develop public transportation.DMRC’s network has observed an 80% increase in the last four years,” Kejriwal said.“Sharing this experience with you all to let you know that political will exists to implement such plans now,” he added. The chief minister also highlighted that when the measures were introduced there were huge fines levied on violators, but gradually fines have decreased.Speaking about the air pollution that Delhi faces during the winter season the chief minister attributed it to stubble burning along with other causes. He said that due to stubble burning the air quality index (AQI) drops below normal range. He highlighted that the city has taken various measures to lower the effects of the stubble burning by using methods suggested by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).Kejriwal also said that the city continues its mission of developing a greener Delhi. He said, “Every year 3 million saplings have been planted by citizens as well as the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/daring-cities-2020-arvind-kejriwal-reiterates-commitment-to-cleaner-and-greener-delhi/story-sEr5iTXodMWwDgrMm2hCjP.html

According to police, the teams covered 38 vulnerable spots in a three-hour operation.“These areas were identified taking into account both police input and feedback from the public, including suggestions received on the women helpline,” joint commissioner of police, law and order, Luv kumar, said.The drive mostly focussed on public markets and parks across the district.“We had inputs from women in sector 29 that a few nefarious characters hang out at the open gym and ogle women there. Taking such feedback into account, these areas were targeted and 30 people across the district were booked for either public drinking or harassment,” Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women and children safety, said.Police said 536 suspicious characters were questioned, most of whom were let go after questioning and warnings. Some of the police teams were in plainclothes for surprise checks.The suspects were booked under section 290 (Punishment for public nuisance) of the Indian Penal Code while a few were booked under section 151 of the CrPC.

This year, more vigilance is required on part of all agencies and neighbouring states to curb pollution, and not let it aggravate the Covid-19 situation,” Rai told reporters. He said working together is crucial as Delhi falls in the airshed area where activities around 300 km of its radius contribute to high air pollution levels in the city. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee has constituted 14 teams to inspect various locations to ensure dust-control norms are being followed at construction and demolition sites and ready-mix plants. “This August we had directed that all construction sites bigger than 20,000 square metres will have to mandatorily install anti-smog guns to control dust. In a recent inspection of 39 such sites, we found that six have not been following norms and these agencies were asked to stop work. At most sites, construction and demolition work is being taken up by central government agencies,” Rai said.Rai said he will inspect these sites on Friday and if they are still not following rules, work will not be allowed to start. He said states such as Haryana and Punjab must adopt the bio-decomposer technology initiated in Delhi to tackle stubble burning. “Even though stubble burning is negligible in Delhi. we have taken this initiative to create a role model for other states,” he said. Chadha, in a separate press meet, said: “The states of Punjab and Haryana are guilty of dereliction of duty towards dealing with air pollution and stopping stubble burning. The first week of October has seen stubble burning increase nine-fold in Punjab and three-fold in Haryana, compared to the corresponding period last year.”“On the one hand, the Prime Minister talks about combating air pollution. On the other hand, the BJP government in Haryana disregards his advice. The state governments of Punjab and Haryana have chosen to blindfold themselves on the issue of stubble burning. AAP demands that the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority recommends stringent action against the two governments,” he said.EPCA chief Bhure Lal said, “We have already directed the state governments of Haryana and Punjab to take action against the rising incidents and step up surveillance. They have started several measures to stop stubble burning in smaller patches of farmlands, which used to go unnoticed before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-to-work-on-a-war-footing-to-stop-pollution-spike-delhi-minister/story-TuB9hAS2sFo3Qq4q1fuKUM.html

There are many residents who find it difficult to come up to the corporation headquarters for seemingly small complaints like related to water supply, cleaning staff, dysfunctional street lights or even on the number of benches in parks,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner, Ghaziabad. “So now the corporation will go to them.”The chaupals have been happening since October 1 and the corporation has prepared a schedule to cover all 100 residential wards. Around three to four wards are covered a day and the chaupal is held from 8am to 10am in a park which is accessible to residents of the wards. “When residents raise their issues, the concerned department heads note it down and begin the resolution process. The heads are also given a chance to speak and they tell the residents about the work they have been doing in the area. We hope to cover all 100 wards in 25 days. In next round, the process will continue,” Tanwar added. Sant Ram, the local councillor from ward 51 of Sector 11 at Vijay Nagar, said that one such chaupal was held in his ward last week. “The residents pointed out that walking track should be prepared at one of the parks and also raised issue of dysfunctional motor pump that affected water supply. After the issues were raised, the pump was rectified in 24 hours and the work for creation of walking track in park has also started,” he said. “In the next chaupal, we will update the officials on the work. In a way, the concept is well received by residents as they have small issues and many of them do not find suitable platform to lodge their complaints.”Residents welfare associations (RWAs) said the opening of a complaint redressal call centre, on October 5, and initiation of the Jan Chaupal will help residents get more access to the corporation. “Since it is a civic agency and handles local civic issues, the Jan Chaupal has provided residents with a way to connect to officials. Now, the residents will be able to speak out issues concerning their area. We appreciate the initiative and it must go on,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-corporation-starts-jan-chaupal-in-residential-wards-for-addressing-local-complaints/story-eUzufqQRXQsYzruLq9RHkK.html

To make sure that happens, the government has planned to make at least one airport in each division. There are 18 divisions in the state and we have a vision to ready 20 airports in the next two to three years to boost air connectivity,” Singh said.Singh visited the Noida International airport Limited office in Greater Noida’s sector Omega-I, where the concessionaire agreement for the Noida International Greenfield airport proposed at Jewar was signed with Zurich International. In Western UP alone, the government has decided to build an airport each in Saharanpur, Meerut, Aligarh, Noida and Muradabad.“We are likely to acquire land for the Meerut airport project and work will begin soon. In Western UP, work will begin soon for the Saharanpur, Meerut, Aligarh, Noida and Muradabad airports. Hindon has already started operations. Besides we have planned airports in Eastern UP cities such as Azamgarh, Chitrakoot, Sonbhadra, Shravasti and Ayodhya. We acquired 78 acres land for an airport in Bundelkhand’s Lalitpur division and land is to be acquired for an airport in Jhansi division. Nobody ever thought of providing air connectivity to these cities,” Singh said. In the temple town Ayodhya, the UP government already has 200 acres of land and another 400 acres are being acquired to set up an international airport there, Singh said. The Kushinagar airport is likely to start its first flight by the end of October. “We plan to start work in Azamgarh, Shravasti, Muradabad and Aligarh by March 2021. In 2016, UP had only 37 flights daily and now in 2020, there are 63 daily flights. We are focusing on air connectivity to boost growth and bring development,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/big-infrastructure-push-in-uttar-pradesh-plan-for-an-airport-in-each-division/story-sxQZo2ZMUO8bcUEusF63MM.html

A high-speed Metro line, an extension of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and other road projects are part of the plan.“The UP government is serious on constricting a 50 kilometre dedicated high-speed Metro project that will directly connect proposed Jewar airport with IGIA. Also, we will expedite the work to connect the Eastern Peripheral Expressway with Jewar and also extend Delhi Metro via Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk so that once the airport is operational, commuters can reach the airport conveniently,” said SP Goyal additional chief secretary to UP Chief Minister and civil aviation department, after the agreement singing with Zurich International AG. Jewar is 70km away from Delhi and 30 km away from Greater Noida. Yeida has already planned to build a 35.64-km Metro connecting Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park-II with Jewar airport by 2023 even though the agency admitted that the project may not be economically viable. According to the detailed project report, the ridership by 2023 would be only around 82,000 when it needs at least double that number to recover the cost.“ We are bound to provide world-class public transport facilities along with Jewar airport. We will start work on the Metro project after obtaining requisite clearances and finish it with the airport’s deadline of 2023,” said Arun Vir Singh CEO of the Yeida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-govt-to-focus-on-critical-link-infra-to-connect-jewar-and-delhi-airports/story-4PcB0Oh9aBv9quSnjJImoI.html

07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana’s uniform traders see a ray of hope with schools reopening next week||Private schools deciding to reopen for board classes has come as a much-needed relief for school uniform dealers, who have been struggling with losses due to the closure of schools amid the Covid-19 pandemic.With educational institutes remaining closed for the past seven months, dealers had reported zero sales of summer uniforms, leaving large stocks unsold. This pushed several of them in severe cash crunch with no funds to purchase the winter uniform stocks next.Right before the schools were ordered closed due to the pandemic, traders had stocked their shops with school uniforms as the new academic session starts from April 1, which normally elicits huge demand for the summer collection by parents. However, due to the unprecedented disruption in demand due to the Covid outbreak, uniform traders were left staring at huge losses, with monthly rentals and instalments also knocking at their door. This caused a lot of them to shut shop or remain closed for months. “I was forced to keep the shop closed as there was no income since March and it was becoming difficult to pay the rent. I purchased the summer stock in March first week and expected to earn profits by the end of that month. But the lockdown imposed by the government shattered the hopes of shopkeepers and forced them to sit at home,” said Sunil Kumar, who runs a uniform shop near Clock Tower. “I used to have seven employees, but had to lay off five of them due to losses for five months. I had never faced such a slowdown before in my 34 years in this business. I reopened the shop two months ago, and for the last 10 days, some customers have been turning up to purchase uniforms,” said Kulpreet Singh, owner of King’s Wear in Model Town.Echoing Kulpreet’s views, Manjeet Singh, owner of Virdi Point on Char Khamba Road, who has also been in the trade for 35 years, said the uniform business will revive only if schools reopened completely.“Earlier, I had 15 staff members, but due to the pandemic, the shop remained closed for several months. This forced me to trim down my staff strength to three, as it was difficult to pay the salaries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-s-uniform-traders-see-a-ray-of-hope-with-schools-reopening-next-week/story-kCm8dnFsrTfyv8TGDWoUPM.html

It is for the first time DDA is hiring a private player to not only construct but to operate the sports facility.The land-owning agency, which had earlier planned three sports facilities in Dwarka sectors 8, 17 and 22, has now decided to integrate all three and proposed this integrated complex that will have a FIFA-compliant football stadium, shooting range, swimming pool, tennis and basketball courts, etc.“We have decided to integrate all the projects and develop this sports complex,” the official said.At present, the land-owning agency has 15 sports complexes—Siri Fort, Yamuna, Commonwealth Games, etc., three mini-complexes with facilities for a few sports and two golf courses.In Dwarka, there is just one sports complex in sector 10, which was constructed 15 years ago. A senior DDA official said, “This will be a state-of-the-art facility with sports infrastructure as per international standards. This is the first time we plan to develop the facility on a PPP basis. We have invited expressions of interest after which we will float tenders for the Rs 250-crore project,” said the official.According to a senior DDA official, the private developer will be given two years to complete the project after the work is awarded. While locals welcomed the move, they say there should be more sports complexes in different areas than just one facility. “It is good that they are finally thinking about creating a new facility, as there is an urgent requirement for it. But we want more sports facilities to be planned in different sectors so that it is convenient for people to go,” Sudha Sinha, president of Federation of CGHS Dwarka, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-plans-a-mega-sports-complex-in-dwarka-on-a-ppp-mode/story-1rnTGTleidZ8LzlN0BD5CL.html

07-10-2020||City||HC issues notices on plea over CBSE exam fee||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought response of the Centre, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Delhi government on a plea, contending that EWS children appearing for Class 10 and 12 board examinations cannot pay the exam fees. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the Union education ministry, CBSE and the Delhi government seeking their stand on the plea by a society which has contended that CBSE “arbitrarily” increased the exam fees in 2019-20 and was charging the same this year too when people are undergoing financial distress due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The court was hearing a plea filed by Parents Forum for Meaningful Education, a registered society of parents and educationists.The petition said the Delhi government had paid the fees last year and had assured the parents that the issue would be solved.During a hearing on a separate petition on the same matter last week, the Delhi government had told the high court that it had written to CBSE asking for an exam fee waiver due to the pandemic. Last year, the examination fee of class 10 and 12 students belonging to the general category in Delhi government schools was increased from ₹375 and ₹600, respectively, to ₹1,500 for five subjects. For SC/ST candidates in class 10, the examination fee was increased from ₹375 to ₹1,200 and for class 12, from ₹600 to ₹1200 in Delhi government and government-aided schools. If practical and additional or optional subjects are to be taken into account, the fee comes to around Rs 2,750 for class 12 students and to Rs 1500 for class 10 students.The petition also sought creation of an empowered committee to examine the fixation of exam fees by CBSE for students in schools run by the Delhi government.The matter would be now heard on November 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-issues-notices-on-plea-over-cbse-exam-fee/story-iTTIur7BFUPUyg8eSLql2J.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai breast cancer patient recovers from Covid-19, returns home after 34 days||A 62-year-old patient of breast cancer and obesity, who had contracted Covid-19, was able to combat the infection despite a host of comorbidities. She spent 34 days in hospital and says her recovery is a miracle. Bandra resident Mahnaaz Lokhandwala, who is a first-stage breast cancer patient, underwent a mandatory test for Covid-19 in end-August, before a scheduled surgery as part of her cancer treatment. On August 26, she tested positive for Covid-19. Initially, Lokhandwala was asymptomatic but had to be admitted to Bombay Hospital on August 28 when she developed breathlessness. Her doctor, Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant general physician at Bombay Hospital, said that in addition to being a cancer patient and weighing 172 kilograms, Lokhandwala’s comorbidities include asthma, diabetes, hypertension and severe sleep apnoea. “She had all the underlying health issues that make an individual most vulnerable to Covid-19. It was a really tricky case for us,” said Dr Bhansali. Lokhandwala’s oxygen saturation had also fallen below 70%. “Considering her health condition, we didn’t want to put her on a ventilator. Plus, due to her acute obesity, her neck was extremely short. So we kept her on non-invasive ventilation,” said Dr Bhansali. Other doctors in the team treating Lokhandwala were intensivist Dr Sanjay Wagle and chest physician Dr Sujit Rajan.Dr Shashank Shah, bariatric surgeon with Hinduja Hospital said that a patient with obesity along with cancer has suppressed immunity which makes them the easy target of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “Obesity is a low grade inflammatory disorder. It also leads to respiratory disorders just like Covid-19. Often, they have other underlying health issues like diabetes and hypertension which make them more susceptible. Their health condition may worsen if they develop diseases like cancer,” he said. “But with timely inversion, they can be cured,” he added. Lokhandwala tested negative for Covid-19 after 16 days, but due to her underlying health issues, her condition remained critical. On October 2, she was finally discharged from hospital. “I am still on one litre of oxygen support daily. It is a miracle that I survived. My movement is still restricted so I am undergoing physiotherapy,” said Lokhandwala. She said her message for the public was to be cautious but not scared of Covid-19. “If I can survive, you can survive too with timely intervention. Trust your doctors and take all required precautions,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-breast-cancer-patient-recovers-from-covid-19-returns-home-after-34-days/story-0F8fqOzHOuTN9qStf9snGO.html

07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Virus infections drop in Haryana, fresh wave likely during festival season||For the second consecutive week, the number of coronavirus infections in Haryana continued to decline with the state reporting 2,429 less cases from September 28 to October 4 as compared to the week before i.e September 21 to 27. A decline of over 5,000 infections was recorded between September 21 and 27. The health department statistics show that 10,096 new cases were reported across the state between September 28 and October 4 as against 12,525 infections between September 21-27. A week before between September 14-20, the state had reported an all time high of 17,616 infections. While the continuous decline has raised hopes of a gradual bend in the infection curve, health officials are worried over the possibility of a fresh wave of infections during the festival season. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said a fresh wave of infections is expected in light of resumption of more activities by the Union ministry of home affairs in its latest unlock guidelines. These include opening of educational institutions, cinemas, multiplexes, entertainment parks, allowing social, religious and political congregations. “It is a phase where the infection rate is stabilising. We expect per day fresh infections to come down to about 800-1,000. However, once people lower their guard and stop following safety measures, the infection rate will increase,” Arora said. Decline in testing Since the health authorities have also decreased the number of rapid antigen tests (RAT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in the last two weeks, it has also reduced the infection rate to a certain extent. Health officials have maintained that the decline in infection rate has outnumbered the reduced testing. As per the data, the number of RAT and RT-PCR tests last week (September 28-October 4) came down to 1,70,217 as compared to 1,70,309 the week before (September 21-27) and 1,91,420 between September 13-20. The ACS said the reduction in sampling was mainly because of a decrease in the number of infections reported. “Once the infection rate is on the decline, so is the number of primary and secondary contacts of the infected persons. Thus a logical decrease in testing,” he said. Officials said they will again step up testing, including the RAT, which was deliberately reduced in view of indiscriminate testing. Bad and good news Statistics show that 10 districts—Karnal, Faridabad, Panipat, Panchkula, Ambala, Rewari, Gurugram, Kurukshetra, Sirsa and Hisar—now have more than 6% sample positivity or confirmation rate, a critical value as per the ministry of health and family welfare parameters. The overall positivity rate is 6.57%.Also, 18 of the 22 districts have now more than 200 active cases and more than 15 active cases per lakh population, both critical values as per the parameters. The infection doubling rate which is calculated over a seven-day period is more than 28 days for each of the 22 districts, a desirable value and the case fatality rate in seven districts—Charkhi Dadri, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Mahendergarh, Palwal, Rewari and Sonepat—is less than 1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/virus-infections-drop-in-haryana-fresh-wave-likely-during-festival-season/story-7gUluTXJBi4oLd3JAp9tuM.html

07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Only state has power to de-notify acquired land: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that it is the state that has the power to de-notify the land acquired under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.The high court bench of justice Daya Chaudhary said Section 101-A inserted by Haryana government in Central law is an enabling provision and gives discretion to the state government to de-notify the land acquired for the public purpose under Land Acquisition Act, 1894, if the purpose has become unviable or non-essential.It is the discretionary power vested in the state which can be exercised in respect of the ‘entire acquired land’ and not just a parcel of land and thus an individual landowner does not have any right to seek de-notification of his individual parcel of land and the court cannot issue direction to exercise the discretion, the bench said.“This provision has been interpreted for the first time.Individual land owners were approaching courts for release of their land which was resulting in undesired litigation. It will help in curbing that,” said, Ankur Mittal, additional advocate general, Haryana, who appeared in this case. The order came on a plea from a landowner, who was seeking release of his land notified for an acquisition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/only-state-has-power-to-de-notify-acquired-land-hc/story-NPFqnkOQEoDYwrEt20RFBJ.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai students may face academic hurdles due to SC stay on FYJC admissions: Experts||With the admissions’ process for junior colleges on hold, over 2.42 lakh students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are faced with uncertain futures. While some coaching classes have started online classes, experts and parents have flagged concerns about the far-reaching consequence of delaying the opening of junior colleges in the state. On March 21, Nimisha Pawar, 15, wrote her last paper for her secondary school certificate (SSC) examination and went on to score an impressive 91%. However, she is yet to begin her first-year junior college (FYJC) classes. In line with the Supreme Court’s (SC) interim stay on the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community in jobs and education, Maharashtra’s education department stayed the admission process for FYJC on September 9. Following this, the second merit list for admissions, scheduled to be released on September 10, has not been released and the admission process is yet to restart. “The last few months have been really stressful. First, the results of SSC exams came out late due to Covid-19. Now the delay in colleges reopening has added to our stress. I was really hoping to get the college of my choice in the second merit list, but the stay on admission has now led to a lot of uncertainty,” said Pawar, a resident of Worli. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) released the SSC results in July and the online admission process began in August for Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati. Across the six divisions in the state, nearly 4 lakh students have applied for admissions. In the zero rounds for admissions under various quotas – including management, minority and in-house – and the first admission round, over 78,000 students were admitted to colleges in the MMR out of the 2.32 lakh students who submitted applications this year. Of the total applicants, 2,923 students applied for the 17,844 seats under the Maratha quota. Colleges warned that this delay could have far-reaching consequences. “Students are already under a lot of psychological stress due to the delay in admissions. While syllabus completion seems to be a key challenge in the days to come, we are more worried about students not being able to cope academically,” said the principal of a South Mumbai school, requesting anonymity. SL Dixit, a retired chemistry teacher from SK Somaiya College and the president of the Mumbai Regional Junior College Teachers’ Organisation (MRJCTO) said, “Especially for subjects like physics and chemistry where students get to do practicals in order to understand key concepts, this delay is dangerous. Class 11 is the base for concepts that are taught in Class 12 and it cannot be ignored. Even if colleges begin now, colleges and students are going to be under immense stress.” Subhash Joshi, trustee of city-based coaching chain Science Parivar, pointed out that realigning the state’s academic year requires coordination with other academic calendars. “A large number of FYJC students will appear for other competitive exams like JEE, NEET etc. Since these exams will happen as per their schedules [next year], pushing the academic year further will put Maharashtra students in a spot.” Joshi said that while coaching classes have started teaching online from August, students can’t attend practicals, which are conducted by colleges. “Classes are not equipped to teach [practicals] but it forms the very basis of concepts in science. We hope the government allows a hybrid model where some students are allowed to visit colleges on a rotational basis,” he said. Ahana Seth, a Borivali-based parent whose son wants to study in the Arts stream, said, “Most Arts students do not go to coaching classes and college is the only place where they learn things. Subjects like psychology, sociology are completely new for students and the delay in reopening colleges effectively means losing out on time to understand these subjects well.” Colleges say they are awaiting a directive from the government. “We cannot start classes for those who are admitted because it would be unfair to the others who are still waiting,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal of VG Vaze College, Mulund. While state education minister Varsha Gaikwad remained unavailable for a comment despite calls and messages, a senior official from the education department said that the state is exploring options to start classes soon. “We have yet to receive advice from the law and judiciary department on how to proceed. Meanwhile, the education department is trying to start free online classes for FYJC to prevent further delay,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-students-may-face-academic-hurdles-due-to-sc-stay-on-fyjc-admissions-experts/story-OIByLBcXtCnVBfQJxwanaN.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||2010 murder case: Submit probe report before Gurugram court, HC tells CBI||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to submit its probe report before a Gurugram court in the 2010 murder case of Kid Zee Play School director Nargis Juneja. The high court bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice HS Sidhu while answering a criminal reference observed that where FIR has been registered by the local police and upon submission of challan court has commenced trial but CBI is roped in, the agency shall submit its report to the trial court where earlier FIR was pending. The bench said the high court while roping in CBI will have to pass a specific order with regard to fate of the investigation already conducted by local police when probe is entrusted to the agency.The division bench was answering a reference made by a single bench to decide on the legal question on fate of Haryana police probe in the case as the CBI had submitted its probe report before the designated special court in Panchkula. The central agency in its report submitted to Panchkula special CBI court had exonerated her husband Rakesh Juneja and a special judicial magistrate had accepted the closure report. However, in the Gurugram court where trial was stayed by high court in 2012, her husband had been chargesheeted as accused. In December 2010, Nargis Juneja, wife of Rakesh Juneja was killed at her home. Her father Roshan Lal Kapoor had alleged the husband’s involvement along with his ‘paramour’ Rosy Bhasin. In 2011, Haryana police SIT had filed an untraced report, exonerating both, but the Gurugram court did not accept it and named Juneja as accused. In April 2012, the high court roped in CBI and stayed the trial. While Gurugram court trial remains pending, the CBI filed the report in designated court, which accepted closure report in January 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2010-murder-case-submit-probe-report-before-gurugram-court-hc-asks-cbi/story-nA5z7ySBKfaBw2gOTkAQQJ.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Illegal detention: HC awards Ropar woman, daughter ₹1-lakh each||The Punjab and Haryana high court has awarded ₹1-lakh compensation each to a Rupnagar woman and her daughter, who in 2019 were illegally detained by the district police for two days without making any entry in official records. The high court bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice HS Sidhu while awarding the compensation ordered that the amount may be recovered from the erring officials. “If such an action is condoned, it would be prone to grave misuse. The requirements of law and the procedures have to be strictly complied with,” the bench observed, terming the detention illegal.The division bench was answering a criminal reference made by a single judge on the plea of Parneet Kaur, who on September 4, 2019, approached the HC with a plea, seeking release of her mother Harvinder Kaur and sister Rupinder Kaur from the detention of Rupnagar police.The HC appointed a warrant officer, who visited the police station the same evening and found both the woman, but not in the lockup. The warrant officer did not find any entry in the police station’s records, and on enquiring from the two, he was told they were kept there for “protection”.The single judge taking note of these facts had referred the matter to the division bench for appropriate orders, observing that even if it is accepted that some persons had tried to cause harm to them, the women could not be kept in the police station for two days without even making an entry and without informing the district/area magistrate.Were kept there in good faith: PoliceAccording to police, the women had complained of a theft at their house on September 2 and named some individuals of the village. When police reached there, some villagers started abusing and beating them, and cops had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the crowd. Some cops were also injured. The women were then taken to the police station, where they were permitted to stay back until the situation got normalised, police had argued. However, there were allegations from the women’s family that police were also making enquires about Harvinder Kaur’s husband, Parvinder Singh, who is at large and wanted in a murder case.The division bench did not accept the argument of police that it was not a case of illegal detention and both were rescued by police from their village and kept in “good faith to protect their lives” from an angry mob.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-detention-hc-awards-ropar-woman-daughter-1-lakh-each/story-yHjlOTnyk7nJ21QvZIWwlJ.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Covid testing rates at private labs slashed by 40% in Chandigarh||Seeing a dip in Covid-19 testing numbers, the Chandigarh health department on Wednesday slashed the rates set for private labs and is also planning aggressive surveillance in micro-containment zones in the city.Health secretary Arun Gupta said the move aims to encourage people to get tested, especially if they are contacts of positive patients or live in containment zones.The rate for RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test has been reduced from ₹2,000 to ₹1,200, while for rapid antigen tests, it has been fixed at ₹650. The Haryana government had recently fixed the same rates.According to the order issued under the Epidemic Disease Act 1897, the rates are “inclusive of GST/taxes if any, cost involved in pickup, PPE packing transportation of samples, documentation and reporting in the city of Chandigarh”. The tests are conducted for free at government labs.Drop in testing cause of concernTesting has plunged from an average of 1,500 a day in September to around 700 in the first week of October, raising serious concerns among experts. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the PGIMER’s community medicine department, cautioned that any laxity in testing and contact tracing could lead to another surge. “Delhi is a fine example. It saw another surge after witnessing a peak once. The reason could be the drop in testing numbers and surveillance,” he said.“There is a dip in the number of tests being conducted in private as well as government labs,” said Arun Gupta, adding that it could be due to various factors. “As positive cases have decreased, the number of contacts has gone down too. However, it is a cause of worry if even those with mild symptoms or those who have come in contact with positive patients are not coming forward. There is a limit to which we can push people to go for testing.” Gupta said the administration will also increase surveillance and go for aggressive testing in the notified containment zones. “There is no target to achieve as far as testing is concerned, but in the present scenario, we need to test around 1,000 people a day. We are working towards that by increasing testing of asymptomatic people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-testing-rates-at-private-labs-slashed-by-40-in-chandigarh/story-CXrR3z5Nk4u5uW90FaoH8L.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana BJP MLA stages dharna to highlight farmers’ plight during paddy procurement||The political blame game in Haryana over paddy procurement took a new turn on Wednesday after the ruling BJP’s Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel held a dharna in front of the Vidhan Sabha secretariat here to highlight the plight of farmers. The two-time BJP legislator targeted additional chief secretary (ACS), food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, PK Das for mismanagement at the mandis (grain markets), leading to the procurement delay and insisted that his protest wasn’t against the government. Goel’s surprising stance not only left the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government red-faced but the sit-in dharna also gave the much-needed ammunition to the opposition to further corner the government on emotive issues concerning the peasantry. The leader of opposition and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda was quick to train guns at the state government. “The farmers have been bringing in paddy and other crop for past many weeks, but it is not being procured. The procurement in comparison to arrival is negligible,” Hooda claimed. “The farmers are being harassed in the name of gate pass and registration...taking advantage of the situation, now private agencies are fleecing the hapless farmers,” he added.Earlier, at the dharna site, the MLA repeatedly said he was not protesting against the state government. “This protest is against the ego and dictatorship of an officer, who has been working against the interests of the state government,” Goel said, reiterating that farmers, labourers and traders were being harassed due to delay in paddy procurement. “When my people are suffering, it is my duty to voice their problems,” Goel said while lifting the dharna that lasted near an hour. He threatened to hold a bigger protest on Monday if the situation at the mandis does not improve.Wrong to blame ACS Das: KhattarHis remarks evoked strong reaction from chief minister Khattar, who without mincing words, said the MLA is himself an ahrtiya (commission agent), who have been facing some teething problems with the transparent procurement policy. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function here, Khattar also rebuffed Goel’s vitriolic remarks against senior bureaucrat Das. “It is wrong on his (MLA’s) part to blame PK Das. The officers work as per the direction of the government,” Khattar said. It is learnt that Khattar spoke to Das and asked him not to feel hassled with what the MLA had said. According to Khattar, barring one demand regarding transportation of the produce, the government had accepted all other demands. “The ahrtiya have some problems about the steps taken, including direct transfer of money to the accounts of farmers. He (MLA) himself is a ahrtiya...I will speak to him,” he said. ACS PK Das said, “The procurement process is going fine and progressing in an orderly fashion...farmers interest are uppermost for the government. The state government has taken numerous measures to ensure transparency in procurement and to eliminate ghost purchase that hurts vested interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-bjp-mla-aseem-goel-holds-dharna-against-acs-food-and-civil-supplies-for-delay-in-paddy-procurement/story-nsNYETRJEZnEUTG9uKglxJ.html
07-10-2020||City||Navi Mumbai auto driver arrested for raping 12-year-old girl||Navi Mumbai police, on Tuesday, arrested a 30-year-old auto rickshaw driver from Osmanabad for allegedly raping a minor girl and fleeing the city. The accused had deliberately told his friend that he was going to Pune to throw the police off his scent.The accused, identified as Vijay Rathod, a resident of Turbhe, raped a 12-year-old girl staying in his neighbouring chawl on Sunday at around 6.30pm. Rathod’s wife was not at home during which time he lured the minor into his house and sexually assaulted her, said police.After raping the girl, Rathod immediately fled the area, leaving the girl traumatised. When the girl’s mother found her sitting aloof, she inquired about her health. The minor broke down and confided in her mother about Rathod. The girl’s family then informed Turbhe MIDC police.Knowing that the police would inquire his friends and family, Rathod told his friend that he was taking a bus to Pune to send the police on a wild goose chase. Searching for him in the city limits, police did not find him. They sent an alert at Sukapur toll booth in Panvel and another at Pune borders to look out for buses while circulating Rathod’s pictures.When Rathod could not be traced, police figured out that it was merely a false lead. The accused had also switched off his phone to go incognito. But, based on technical analysis, police found an unknown number calling Rathod’s wife between Monday and Tuesday. Rathod is originally from a village on the outskirts of Osmanabad. As the number was also calling from the same district, police dispatched a team to Umarga in Osmanabad, tracing him there.“By the time our team reached Umarga, he fled to Holi village in Lohara. We followed him outside the village and found him hiding in a sugarcane field. After a brief chase, our constables apprehended him and brought him back to the city,” said Pawan Nandre, assistant inspector at Turbhe MIDC police station.Rathod has been booked for rape under sections of Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.Police said they were looking for Rathod’s criminal records, if any. Officials will also interrogate him to check if he had attempted to molest or rape the girl in the past. Police will also check if he had targeted any other children in his residential area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-auto-driver-arrested-for-raping-12-year-old-girl/story-2ueq0wX6oB5e02pTDauJxN.html
07-10-2020||City||2 lure Navi Mumbai resident into buying piece of comet, dupe him of ₹1 lakh; arrested||The Navi Mumbai crime branch has arrested two men for duping a Panvel resident of ₹1 lakh by trying to sell a metal ball claiming it to be a piece of comet that crashed on the earth. One of the accused posed as a scientist with a trick of stopping a wristwatch and a smoke chemical reaction ‘authenticated’ the comet to con the man.James George, 49, who works at a Mumbai-based logistics service, got acquainted with the accused, Popat Khomane, 51, around two months ago. Khomane kept in touch with George regularly, gaining his trust and confidence until September 10, when he asked George to meet him.An officer from the crime branch said, “Khomane met George at Airoli bus depot and showed him a picture of ‘the comet’. The ball was actually a copper piece covered in an aluminium foil and a coloured cotton cloth.”Khomane told him he knew a man who was trying to sell the ‘comet’ piece that would fetch ₹25 crore in the international market. Khomane asked George to buy it after which they would sell it in the international market as the rock was highly sought-after by cosmology scientists.He claimed that the original seller was unaware of the real price and was selling it for only ₹20 lakh.Promising to get a seller for ₹25 crore, Khomane asked George to give him ₹3 crore from the profit. Finding the deal lucrative, George agreed. To further convince him, Khomane introduced him to his accomplice, Afsar Sayyed, 35, who posed as a scientist.The men showed him the ‘comet’ and placed a wristwatch on it. The watch stopped working on it. Khomane then paid him ₹1 lakh as an instalment. While showing the stone to George, Sayyed sprinkled a whitener like chemical to authenticate it.“When the ball released smoke like fumes, Sayyed claimed that the comet was releasing radiation and will take four days to cool down after which he can collect it. We arrested them after laying a trap on October 3. They have been remanded in custody till Thursday,” said Subhash Nikam, senior inspector, unit 1, crime branch.

The results of vocational courses can be expected tentatively by October 29, while those of BA (Programme) courses may be delayed due to the large volume and combination of papers involved.The court is hearing a petition filed by law student Prateek Sharma and the National Federation of the Blind, who wanted better facilities for physically disabled students during examinations.Delhi University had conducted the final-year examinations for undergraduate students from August 1 to 31 in the online open-book mode and later in the blended method (online and physical examinations) from September 14.On September 23, the court had expressed its unhappiness on the extended schedule of the DU in declaring the results of examinations. It had said the varsity should take all steps to expedite the results as many students have to secure admissions in universities in the country and abroad.The court had also sought to know if the varsity could declare results by October 12. In response, DU said, “After taking stock of the situation, it is most respectfully submitted that the university reiterates the tentative dates to declare results as submitted before the court on September 23.”The DU counsel, advocate MS Rupal, also told the judges that it has hired 10 more data entry operators, in addition to the 40 already hired from the National Informatics Centre, to expedite the work on tabulation of results. “The university has undertaken efforts to maintain the timeline to declare results, while maintaining social distancing at the workplace,” he said.DU further told the court that the tentative schedule for results declaration can be met only once all answer scripts are emailed to the respective examiners. “This is a time-consuming process. A fair and proper evaluation of answer scripts requires that no undue pressure is imposed on examiners,” the affidavit said.Following these submissions, the court posted the matter to October 12 and asked the varsity to furnish a fresh status report. on that day.A member of the University’s examination branch, requesting anonymity, said, “The university has started releasing results and the results of some courses have already been declared. It will take some more weeks to wrap up the remaining evaluation process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/can-declare-obe-exam-results-only-by-oct-20-du-tells-high-court/story-uhFpjd0mp4UAfWe9WXc4YP.html

07-10-2020||Delhi||PIL seeks to do away 30-day notice under Special Marriage Act, HC seeks govt response||The Delhi high court Wednesday sought the response of the Centre and the Delhi government on a plea by an interfaith couple, challenging provisions of the Special Marriage Act (SMA) that mandate a 30-day public notice, inviting objections to the marriage being registered under the Act.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan issued a notice to the ministry of law and the Delhi government, seeking their stand on the petition which contends that the 30-day notice period “discourages interfaith couples from getting married”.Appearing for the petitioners, their counsel Utkarsh SIngh told the court that there is no such provision under personal laws with regard to same faith marriages. He contended that the 30-day notice period inviting objections to the marriage directly impinges on the fundamental rights of the petitioners.“The issue of whether either party has a living spouse, which can be raised as an objection under Section 4 of the Act, is not a condition imposed on same faith marriages,” the petition said.The petition also sought the court to declare as “illegal, null, void and unconstitutional” the provisions of the Act which lay down the procedure for the 30-day notice.Singh also sought a direction to the Centre and Delhi government to decide on the objections, under the Act, on the basis of undertakings and certificates, issued by any government hospital or any other competent authority. However, opposing the plea, Central government standing counsel, Monica Arora, told the court that similar pleas have been filed by an NGO, Dhanak for Humanity, and it appears to be behind the present petition as well.The court said since the petition raises legal issues which need consideration, the government should file a reply mentioning the objections. It asked Arora to file a reply and posted the matter for further hearing to November 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pil-seeks-to-do-away-30-day-notice-under-special-marriage-act-hc-seeks-govt-response/story-QyzQnfEJe8ZbaawvcuEG3K.html

We are already reeling under losses due to the ongoing pandemic and the civic body is adding to our woes.”“Most of the shops in Ghumar Mandi were established even before the CLU norms came into existence. We had also conducted a meeting with mayor Balkar Sandhu and area councilor-cum- Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation chairman Gurpreet Gogi in the mid of September. The mayor had assured us that no action would be taken before the discussion of the issue in the meeting of the MC general house. But MC has started sealing the shops,” said Batra. The shopkeepers said that if the corporation fails to roll back the notice, they will raise an agitation in the entire city. Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal also extended support to the Ghumar Mandi market association.Sunil Mehra, general secretary of Beopar Mandal, said, “We will stand by the Ghumar Mandi shopkeepers and MC will have to roll back notices.” As per MC officials, around 1,600 notices have been served to shopkeepers across the city.

While interacting with mediapersons after a meeting of party workers in Panipat, Dhankar said, “The Congress is opposing the promises it made in its election manifesto. The farmers are being misled over the farm bills by the Congress as its leaders have lost the confidence of people.”He said the minimum support price will continue and these bills will help the farmers to sell their produce outside the mandi without any taxes. “It will also help the growers of onion and potato as these vegetables have been exempted from the list of essential commodities and the farmers will get good and remunerative prices,” he added.‘Will announce BJP candidate for Baroda by poll after Oct 10 meet’Dhankar said the BJP will announce its candidate for the Baroda by poll after a meeting of election committee on October 10.“The Baroda voters know that the BJP is in power and their nominee can bring development projects in the constituency in the next four years. Our candidate will register a thumping majority in the by poll scheduled to held on November 3,” he said.Slamming Punjab chief minister Captain Amrinder Singh, Dhankar said he is misguiding farmers by touring on a tractor with sofa. “ Captain sahab’s supporters burnt the same tractor twice at Haryana –Punjab border and in Delhi.

07-10-2020||City||Hoteliers rejoice as tourists flock to Himachal in large numbers||Some of the districts in the state have been witnessing a large number of tourists for the past few days amid a surge in the number of coronavirus cases.In September, the Himachal Pradesh government had allowed the entry of tourists into the state, and ever since the restrictions were lifted, nearly one lakh tourists have visited the state bringing much relief to the tourism industry that was badly hit due to the Covid-19 enforced lockdown.Popular stations such as Shimla, Manali, Kullu, Dalhousie and Dharamshala are being thronged by visitors. As per the state tourism department, around 21,400 people have visited Shimla and nearby areas during the last month. While more than 7,000 vehicles entered the summer capital last week on weekend.Tourism is gradually picking up in Manali which witnessed 15,000 touristsSince Himachal opened doors for tourists, the occupancy at hotels has considerably increased during weekends. So far only, around 90% of hotels have started operations. The places of tourist interest, particularly in Shimla including the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Army Museum, amusement parks in Kufri, were still closed.“The main concern is that tourists stay for a short duration due to the lack of publicity of places in and around each popular destination. We have requested the tourism department to publicise the places that may interest tourists in and around each destination,” said M K Seth, president of Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association. There are 3,300 hotels registered with the government with a bed capacity of nearly 12,000.Tourism stakeholders are dismayed as the tourist visiting Shimla and other tourist destinations are preferring short stays instead of booking package tours. “Many tourists visiting Shimla prefer to book hotels for a day. However, there are many places to visit around Shimla such as watersports at Yatra Pani, Tulip Garden, Jakhoo temple, museums which are not explored by the tourists. The stakeholders have asked the department to publicise these places through social media or by putting up hoardings in popular stations,” said Sanjay Sood, president of Shimla Hotels and Restaurateurs Association. He said that many tourists do not follow Covid guidelines such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing which needs to be checked by the administration.Meanwhile, tourism has also picked up in the Dharamshala region, especially on weekends. However, hoteliers say that high-end tourists are still not keen to visit the state due to Covid-19 fear. Tourists who were arriving in the region mostly prefer to stay in cheaper accommodations.“We did good business last week with many tourists arriving in the region,” said Vijay Inder Karan, a hotelier in Dharamshala.Another hotelier Prem Sood said that tourists, especially those from the neighbouring states, have started coming to the state in large numbers.He said that hotels have reduced prices of accommodations in order to attract domestic tourists in the coming days.The state had barred the entry of tourists in March to check the spread of Covid-19 and this had badly hit the tourism sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hoteliers-rejoice-as-tourists-flock-to-himachal-in-large-numbers/story-fodoER5JX3tcrqpQJGhaLM.html

07-10-2020||City||526 incidents of farm fires in 12 days in Haryana||Keeping a complete check on farm fires remains a challenge for the Haryana government as the state reported 526 incidents of crop residue burning from September 25 to October 6.The number of Active Fire Locations (AFL) is more than double the last year’s 200 during the same period. As per figures of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Kurukshetra district tops with 118 cases followed by 98 in Karnal, 65 each in Ambala and Kaithal, 48 in Fatehabad, 42 in Yamunanagar and 24 in Jind. The government had spent a whopping amount of ₹ 1,300 crore for setting up custom hiring centres to provide machinery to farmers for management of crop waste. This year, the state government had also divided the villages into red, orange and green zones, as per the previous records of the incidents of farm fires. A local-level committee was formed to keep an eye on the erring farmers with a special focus on red zones to ensure immediate action.Officials of the agriculture department and district administrations claim that the rise in incidents of farm fires is due to harvesting, which began a week earlier than last year. It is also learnt that strict action was not taken this year due to the ongoing protests by farmers against the agriculture bills and tardy paddy procurement. In Kurukshetra, which has reported the highest number of incidents of AFLs, deputy commissioner Sharandeep Kaur Barar has issued strict directions to officials of the agriculture department to register FIRs against the erring farmers. The DC has also deputed concerned agriculture development officer, patwari and panchayat secretaries to keep an eye on farmers of 31 villages in red zones. Officials say the number of farm incidents may go up following an increase in area under parmal varieties. The parmal varieties are harvested by combine harvesters and the machines leave about 20 quintals of unmanaged crop waste every acre. Meanwhile, a difference has been noticed between the AFLs identified by Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) and incidents of stubble burning reported on the ground. The HARSAC reported 118 active fire locations in Kurukshetra district by October 6 but the district administration claimed that only 11 incidents of stubble burning were registered after physical verification. Deputy director of Haryana agriculture department Karam Chand said, “There are reports that AFLs recorded by HARSAC were not found after physical verification in Kurukshetra as well as Kaithal district.” Reacting over the increase in incidents of stubble burning this year, S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “We have been vigorously taking up the matter with farmers so that they could use eco-friendly harvesting equipments provided by the government to prevent stubble burning.” “Since the poor air quality caused by farm fires may intensify the impact of Covid-19, there is a need to keep a check on incidents of stubble burning,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/526-incidents-of-farm-fires-in-12-days-in-haryana/story-FlgN98KeDFLyiSZgp35jPJ.html

While a woman and a seven-year-old boy received 70% burns each, a toddler boy sustained 20% burns, said the officer. Others received relatively minor injuries and have been discharged from Safdarjung Hospital after treatment.

07-10-2020||City||Three farmers booked for burning crop residue in Fatehabad||Police on Wednesday registered an FIR against three farmers for burning crop residue in Haryana’s Fatehabad.A police official said the cases were registered on a complaint lodged by the district agriculture department.The Fatehabad agriculture department had lodged a complaint against eight farmers for setting crop residue on fire in the district. District agriculture department, deputy director, Rajesh Sihag, said the HARSAC imagery indicates 25 instances of stubble burning in the district. “Our teams visited the locations traced by the HARSAC, of which eight cases of stubble burning were detected and other locations were found wrong. So far, police have registered a case against three farmers under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and cases against the remaining farmers will be lodged soon,” he said.He said the deputy commissioner have formed a team of officials from the agriculture department, patwari, village secretary and policemen to tackle the menace.“With farmers continuing to flout the orders by burning stubble, the deputy commissioner has invoked Section 144. We have deployed teams to check stubble burning and a campaign has been launched to spread awareness about its consequences on the environment,” Sihag added.Kisan Sangharsh Samiti president Mandeep Nathwan said the action taken against farmers on the basis of HARSAC images is unfair. “Many times the farmers burn grass in their fields and the HARSAC gets hold of those images on the basis of billowing smoke. Can farmers be held responsible for such act?,” he said.He said the Supreme Court had asked the state government to pay farmers ₹100 per quintal to dispose of stubble but they have failed to implement the initiative. “We used to set the residue on fire as stubble burning is a cheaper way of getting rid of crop residue rather than weeding it though the prescribed process, which is costlier. If the police will lodge an FIR against us, we will lodge a protest against them,” said Ramandeep Singh, a farmer from Jamalpur village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-farmers-booked-for-burning-crop-residue-in-fatehabad/story-3OIjCDYFqipGSuxrS8we3N.html

During a video conference with the DCs held to prevent burning of crop residues as per the Supreme Court order, Vardhan said panchayats coming in the red zone will be rewarded with ₹10 lakh, ₹5 lakh and ₹3 lakh at the state-level if they perform well under the crop residue management.He also directed the DCs to ensure availability of crop residue management machinery to small and marginal farmers on a priority basis. The vice-chancellor of Haryana agricultural university and member secretary of Haryana Pollution Control Board also attended the meeting.The chief secretary also asked officials to organise an awareness campaign at the district, block, and village-level to spread awareness about the menace of stubble burning.According to additional principal secretary to chief minister, V Umashankar, a system has been developed to closely monitor and control the incidence of crop residue burning. He said under this system, based on the satellite image, if stubble is found burning in the range of 100 to 115 metres, a text message will be sent twice a day to sarpanches, village secretaries, tehsildars and DCs to take necessary action including a visit to the spot. Additional chief secretary, agriculture and farmers’ welfare department, Devender Singh said crop residue management machines have been distributed to custom hiring centres and farmers.

Anurag is on a three-day visit to the region. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi will also reach Leh on October 9.“Thakur has kick-started poll campaign, in favour of party candidates, here on Wednesday. He held a series of meetings with party organisational secretary Ashok Koul and other leaders to ensure that BJP romps home with full majority,” a party leader said.Two more Union ministers, Kiran Rijiju and G Kishan Reddy, will also visit Leh and will be accompanied by party general secretary and MP Arun Singh.In the last elections conducted in 2015, BJP had won 18 of total 26 seats. On October 3, BJP had claimed that people are in its favour and it will make a clean sweep in the LAHDC-Leh polls.The polls are being held amid resentment over Centre’s failure in ensuring constitutional protection for Ladakh’s resources and cultural identity.“People are in favour of BJP and the issue of Sixth Schedule is over because the Apex Body of People’s Movement (ABPM), comprising of older leaders, recently went to Delhi and met Union home minister Amit Shah. Shah assured to fulfil their demand,” said LAHDC chief executive councillor and BJP leader Gyal P Wangyal.Former BJP lawmaker Thupstan Chhewang has formed ABPM to seek constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule on the lines of north-eastern states. Following Shah’s assurance, the body withdrew its call for a boycott of the council polls.Chering Dorjay, a member of the apex body, said, “After Ladakh was given UT status without legislature on August 5 last year, locals wanted safeguards under the Sixth Schedule for their land, jobs, language and culture.“Within 15 day of the culmination of the hill council polls, Shah has assured to provide us safeguards under the Sixth Schedule. However, the exercise has to be preceded by participation of the representatives elected in the polls. Further, we have to take people of Kargil on board,” he said.LADAKH WILL GET MUCH MORE THAN SIXTH SCHEDULE: THAKURUnion minister Anurag Thakur said people of Leh will get much more than just Sixth Schedule. He assured that their land, culture, ethnic values, etc will be safeguarded.Addressing a press conference in Leh, Thakur said, “It was a long pending demand of Ladakh to get UT status. It happened only when Narendra Modi became Prime Minister.”“I am a four-time MP from Himachal Pradesh and my father was a three-time MP, two-time CM, and two-time leader of Opposition. Yet we cannot purchase land in tribal areas of Himachal because Section 118 gives protection to the natives of Himachal for their land holdings,” he assured.“And this is when we don’t even have the Sixth Schedule there. People of Ladakh so not need to worry about this,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leh-hill-council-polls-anurag-thakur-intensifies-campaign-naqvi-to-reach-on-october-9/story-raxjEskicEs15haY1LkbUJ.html

Sinha had promised to help them get jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities.“A terrorist is a terrorist. Pak-sponsored terrorism has bled Jammu and Kashmir for the past 30 years. They (terrorists) go to Pakistan for arms training, come back with arms and ammunition and kill innocent people and security forces personnel. They can never be given jobs,” he said.“Our army, police and paramilitary forces are combating them 24x7. In Modi government, there can never be any rehabilitation for terrorists,” he said.On selection list of the fire and emergency services department, Raina said the list has many irregularities and is discriminatory.“I brought the matter to the notice of L-G Sinha and have urged him to scrap this list and conduct recruitments afresh. Graduates and postgraduates have been excluded while Class 8 and 10 pass candidates have been selected in the current list. It is a big scam and probe should be ordered,” he said.Raina added that if the list was not revoked then BJP will move court for an interim stay on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-rehabilitation-jobs-for-terrorists-under-modi-govt-j-k-bjp-chief/story-rk6Xp8HqZcu2UeBk3RwVUO.html

A befitting response was given,” he said.“The exchange of fire continued for around 15 minutes,” said Baramulla SSP Abdul Qayoom.This year has seen a number of ceasefire violations by Pakistan, especially in north Kashmir. The army says unprovoked ceasefire violation is mainly aimed to facilitate infiltration of terrorists.India and Pakistan, who have fought at least three wars since 1947, had agreed in 2003 to maintain peace along the border, but the violations intensified after bilateral relations plummeted in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pak-army-fires-mortars-across-loc-in-uri/story-TsARfC6vHEGWmlV44OtbWP.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC on whether offences under NDPS Act are non-bailable: Read full text||The Bombay high court on Wednesday granted bail to actor Rhea Chakraborty whoc was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with a drugs case linked to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.But the court did not accept the argument put forward by Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde that the offences involving small quantities of contraband are bailable under the NDPS Act.In a lengthy judgement, Justice Sarang V Kotwal delved deeper into the issue and highlighted two important judgements of the Supreme Court.“This issue is important and, therefore, I am examining this issue in detail. In support of his contention that the offences involving small quantities are bailable, Mr Maneshinde relied on a judgment of a single judge of this court in the case of Stefan Mueller vs State of Maharashtra. In this case, it was held that the offences involving small quantities of contraband were bailable offences,” Justice Kotwal observed.“The language of Section 37 itself mentions that every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable, but, there is no such similar sentence mentioning that every offence punishable under NDPS Act shall be non-bailable,” the judge further said.Here is the observation made by Justice Kotwal in deciding Chakraborty’s bail (from the court order):Since this is an application for bail in respect of offences punishable under the NDPS Act, the provisions of that Act are required to be considered carefully. The bail provisions under the NDPS Act are mentioned under Section 37 of that Act. Section 37 reads thus:Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)--(a) every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable;(b) no person accused of an offence punishable for offences under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A andalso for offences involving commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless--(i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release, and(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.(2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause (b) of sub-section (1) are in addition to the limitations under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or any other law for the time being in force, on granting of bail.”As per requirements of this Section, the Court has to give opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to oppose the application for such relief. Such opportunity is given in the present case as I have heard learned ASG extensively. He has opposed this application. The second requirement is that, the Court should be satisfied about the two conditions. There should be reasonable grounds for believing that the Applicant is not guilty of such offence and the Applicant is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Therefore, the Court will have to consider whether these two conditions are satisfied. However, these requirements are applicable only where the rigours of Section 37 mentioned in Clause (b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 37 are applicable in the case. This view is consistently taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Rattan Mallik alias Habul2 has dealt with this aspect in Paragraphs-12, 13 & 14. They are as follows:It is plain from a bare reading of the non obstante clause in Section 37 of the NDPS Act and subsection (2) thereof that the power to grant bail to a person accused of having committed offence under the NDPS Act is not only subject to the limitations imposed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it is also subject to the restrictions placed by clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. Apart from giving an opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to oppose the application for such release, the other twin conditions viz. (i) the satisfaction of the court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence; and (ii) that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail, have to be satisfied. It is manifest that the conditions are cumulative and not alternative. The satisfaction contemplated regarding the accused being not guilty, has to be based on “reasonable grounds”.The expression “reasonable grounds” has not been defined in the said Act but means something more than prima facie grounds. It connotes substantial probable causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence he is charged with. The reasonable belief contemplated in turn, points to existence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient in themselves to justify satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence (vide Union of India v. Shiv Shanker Kesari, (2007) 7 SCC 798). Thus, recording of satisfaction on both the aspects, noted above, is sine qua non for granting of bail under the NDPS Act.We may, however, hasten to add that while considering an application for bail with reference to Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the court is not called upon to record a finding of “not guilty”. At this stage, it is neither necessary nor desirable to weigh the evidence meticulously to arrive at a positive finding as to whether or not the accusedhas committed offence under the NDPS Act. What is to be seen is whether there is reasonable ground for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence(s) he is charged with and further that he is not likely to commit an offence under the said Act while on hail. The satisfaction of the court about the existence of the said twin conditions is for a limited purpose and is confined to the question of releasing the accused on bail.”Based on these guidelines and observations, I am deciding the present application.I need to decide following questions in this application.I. Whether the offences alleged against the Applicant are bailable. This question needs to be decided because theApplicant is claiming her release on bail as a matter of right.II. If the offences are non-bailable, then, as to whether rigours mentioned in Section 37(1)(b) of NDPS Act are applicable.III. If such rigours are not applicable and if the offences are non-bailable then whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant or refuse bail.WHETHER ALL THE OFFENCES UNDER NDPS ACT ARE NON-BAILABLEThe applicant has vehemently contended that the allegations, at the highest, show that the offence is a bailable offence and the Applicant could not have been detained in custody since the Applicant was ready and willing to furnish bail.This issue is important and, therefore, I am examining this issue in detail. In support of his contention that the offences involving small quantities are bailable, Mr. Maneshinde relied on a judgment of a Single Judge of this Court in the case of Stefan Mueller Vs. State of Maharashtra. In this case, it was held that the offences involving small quantities of contraband were bailable offences.. This judgment in the case of Stefan Mueller was relied on by a Division Bench of High Court of Delhi in the case of Minnie Khadim Ali Kuhn Vs. State NCT of Delhi and others. The learned Single Judge Bench of this Court in Stefan Mueller (supra) has observed that the heading or the marginal note of Section 37 reads as “Offences to be cognizable and nonbailable”.However, the language of Section 37 itself mentions that every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable, but, there is no such similar sentence mentioning that every offence punishable under NDPS Act shall be non-bailable.. The learned Single Judge referred to a few judgments explaining that marginal note, heading or title of a Section has a limited role to play in the construction of statutes. In cases of conflict between the plain language of the provisions and the meaning of the heading or title, the heading or title would not control the meaning which is clearly and plainly discernible from the language of the provision thereunder.The learned Judge has observed that since the Legislature has not declared specifically under Section 37 that all the offences under the Act shall be non-bailable, the provisions of CrPC are required to be looked into to find out whether the offences under NDPS Act are bailable or not. The learned Single Judge thereafter referred to Part-II of the Schedule to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘CrPC’), which gives classification of offences against other laws declaring them to be bailable or non-bailable. This classification under Part II of the Schedule to CrPC mentions that the offences in other laws are bailable if they are punishable with imprisonment for less than three years or with fine only. Therefore, according to the learned Judge, since the offences involving small quantity of the contraband were punishable for sentences less than three years, these offences would be bailable. In the same judgment, it was further held that in bailable offences, even conditions cannot be imposed on the accused in view of provisions of Section 436 of CrPC.The judge then went on the describe the amendments brought in to the sections of NDPS Act in 1985 and 2001.“The situation has not changed since 1999 when these observations were made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. In fact, the situation has become worse. Therefore, these observations apply to today’s scenario with more force,” the judge said.Further examining the provisions of Section 27A, Justice Kotwal said in his observation, “The allegations and material against the present applicant are that on some occasions she had used her own money in procuring drugs. She facilitated procuring of drugs through her brother. For that purpose employees of Sushant Singh Rajput were also used. As discussed earlier, her acts would not fall under Section 27A of the NDPS Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-on-whether-offences-under-ndps-act-are-non-bailable-read-full-text/story-EYhOiManU0j4RqkSwn5qlK.html

First-time legislator from Banjar, Shourie had tested positive for Covid-19 on October 2 and had accompanied dignitaries including chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and attended the inaugural function.Shourie was also amongst those VIPs who had gone to welcome defence minister Rajnath Singh at the SASE helipad. Shourie, on his Facebook post, said that he was asymptomatic and had got himself tested on the directions of the Special Protection Group (SPG), and as soon as he came to know about the status of his Covid-19 test report he along with his staff went into isolation. Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee’s general secretary Rajneesh Kimta on Wednesday accused the state government of openly defying Covid safety protocol and said that the way rules were violated during the Prime Minister’s programme in Manali proves that Covid norms are only for the opposition parties and public and not for the BJP.Kimta said that the incident of Banjar BJP MLA meeting people at the function is a serious issue and an FIR should be lodged against him for violating Covid protocol as he has intentionally tried to spread the infection amongst the people“A stern action should also be taken against officials of the health department who did not place Shourie under isolation,” he said.The state government had claimed that everyone who will be the part of this ceremony will have to undergo the Covid-19 test, but no tests were conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-demands-fir-against-banjar-mla-for-hiding-covid-19-positive-status/story-DGb4yJFrUpL4oAuGgcgc7M.html
07-10-2020||City||Misappropriation of saroops: Probe report finds CA, former SGPC chief secy delinquent||AMRITSAR The Akal Takht-appointed panel that probed into the misappropriation of 328 saroops of Guru Granth Sahib points out that timely computerisation of the accounts by the private firm hired for the purpose could have averted the incident. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) uploaded the 1,100-page report on its website on Wednesday. The SGPC had hired SS Kohli and Associates on a monthly fee of ₹3.5 lakh in January 2009 for conducting the annual internal audit. The probe penal found that the firm was allotted four key works — internal audit (pre/concurrent audit on daily basis), including stores etc. at all locations, computerisation of accounts on regular basis of all the location, implementation of internal control system as suggested by a renowned consultancy firm, and implementation of online system proposed and designed by the consultancy firm — at the time of the hiring. “Chartered accountant (CA) Satinder Singh Kohli did only one work, but he was given the fee for all the four works. One of the works was computerisation of the printing press’s accounts. Had the timely computerisation been done, the misappropriation (of the saroops) could not have occurred,” reads the report. It further says: “It was the responsibility of former SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh to get all the works done from the CA. The money which was paid to the CA was the donation of the devotees. Roop Singh had irresponsibly gave the money to the CA. So a departmental and criminal action is needed against Roop Singh.” Roop Singh had quit on “moral and ethical grounds” and his resignation was accepted by the SGPC executive on August 27. The report that was partially made public by the SGPC on August 27 had held Roop Singh and 13 other officials and staff members of the publication and allied departments responsible for the missing saroops. SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal had also taken departmental action against the erring officials, besides promising criminal action against some officials, barring Dr Roop Singh. The SGPC later took a U-turn on criminal action. The probe panel in its report also pre-empts resignations from accused officials. “Despite their resignations, the executive committee should take appropriate action against them, otherwise it will leave a leave a bad precedent for other employees,” says the report. A year after being picked by the SGPC, the audit firm’s monthly fee was increased by ₹75,000 per month in 2010. The probe team found that the SGPC increased the fee of the firm even as it did little to computerise the SGPC accounts and other records. “The SGPC had been paying the audit firm for the last 10 years for no work. If the mistake was committed by an official or an employee, he or she would have been sacked, but it is very unfortunate that the SGPC’s executive committee, which has supreme rights, had been increasing the contract of the firm without reviewing Kohli’s work,” reads the report. It further says, “The money of the sangat and the misappropriation of the saroops of Guru Granth Sahib could have been stopped, if the printing press’s record had been put online, besides conducting a regular audit. The firm is also a partner in the crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/misappropriation-of-saroops-probe-report-finds-ca-former-sgpc-chief-secy-delinquent/story-cDvIVvn2KI2yeix7kOoQiP.html

Due to the process of unlocking the state, rules should be fixed keeping in mind the concessions provided and the government should work with utmost care for them, party workers said.CPI(M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said that due to this poor functioning and irresponsible behaviour of the state government, Covid-19 cases have crossed the 16,000-mark in the state and more than 200 deaths have been reported so far. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur is in isolation, ministers and their family members, officers and employees of the CM’s office, leaders of the ruling party and doctors, paramedical staff, police and other employees are getting infected and some of them have even lost their lives. This has exposed the state government’s preparations to deal with the pandemic, he said.“It has become clear that the preparations were not made after the government had imposed lockdown and curfew in March, rather the state government was engaged in irrational work and politics,” he added.He said that a movement will be launched if the state government fails to take effective steps to deal with the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-urges-himachal-government-to-form-task-force-to-deal-with-covid/story-hToLEVfx07C7i5Si8kQ05K.html

The inquiry also pointed towards serious lapses in hospital management. The woman, 54, from Chopal had tested positive for coronavirus on September 18 and was admitted to DDU Hospital. The incident had raised questions on the functioning of the hospital that how a patient in a ward where 20 to 25 other patients are also present could commit suicide in the presence of the hospital staff.The family members of the woman said that she had been suffering from hypertension and was not given her routine doses at the hospital.The inquiry report has indicted the hospital administration for lapses and stated that the patient was not administered medicines for hypertension for four days. It further revealed that the hospital staff did not attend to the Covid-19 patients and treat them well. The hospital staff left the food for patients at the doors of the Covid ward and they had to carry their food themselves, it added. Elderly and critically-ill patients found it difficult to pick up their meals from the door. Several patients said that there was no intercom facility at the ward to communicate with hospital staff in case of emergencies. The report also pointed serious lapses on the part of senior doctors who did not attend to the patients. The magistrate recorded statements of the hospital staff and the patients who were hospitalised at the time when the woman committed suicide. “The report has been forwarded to the government for consideration,” said DC Amit Kashyap.Meanwhile, the government took few steps to improve the conditions at the hospital after the incident rocked the state. The government decided to install televisions at the hospital ward and the provided communication facility for patients. Besides, it has now become mandatory to supply newspapers to patients. The government has ordered to improve the quality of food provided to patients admitted in Indira Gandhi Medical College in Shimla and DDU Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-patient-suicide-case-magisterial-probe-indicts-shimla-s-ddu-hospital-administration/story-jo2FgxS0B1EXvIYe2thhgP.html

07-10-2020||Kolkata||Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee says trucks originating from other states could be potential carriers of Covid-19||Expressing concern over the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Bengal’s Jhargram, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, during an administrative meeting in the district on Wednesday, said trucks and lorries originating from other states might be carriers of coronavirus.Banerjee also said that there was no clear idea yet over the modes of virus transmission, and it was necessary to conduct “forensic tests” on truck tyres to ensure they were not infected.“We should not forget that Jhargram shares border with Jharkhand. There are trucks from Mumbai, Chennai and other states passing through the district. We can conduct forensic tests on the tyres of a couple of lorries that pass through the toll plaza to see if the virus is spreading through these,” she maintained.The chief minister further claimed that it cannot be said for sure if the virus spreads from the clothes people wear and the bags we carry.“I think this (Covid-19) is also air-borne. We actually do not have a clear idea how it is spreading, if it can get transmitted from the bag we are using in the market or from the clothes... The only thing that we can do is take appropriate precautionary measures. And since cases are on the rise in Jhargram, we have to take measures in advance,” Banerjee explained.She said that truck drivers coming to the state from elsewhere should carry own food.“People coming in lorries from other states, such as Delhi, Mumbai or Chennai, must carry own food. The virus might be spreading when these people sit in dhabas to eat food.“If they want to eat in dhabas, proper sanitisation and health protocol should be followed there,” she said asking the administration to chalk out a plan in this connection.Urging people to strictly follow safety guidelines, the chief minister said her government would distribute masks to the poor free of cost.“I saw people moving around without masks here. If needed, they should be given masks by the police during Durga Pujas through community development programmes,” she said.Of the 79 gram panchayats in Jhargram, 10 has been affected by the disease, a senior official said.The district currently has 209 active cases, while 10 people have succumbed to the infection so far, according to the bulletin released by the state health department.The CM, during the meeting, also asked the district administration to identify a piece of land, where a press club could be constructed.She highlighted various welfare schemes initiated by her government, and enlisted policies beneficial for the scheduled caste and tribal population.Banerjee asked the district officials to ensure all beneficiaries receive their dues without any hassle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-says-trucks-originating-from-other-states-could-be-potential-carriers-of-covid-19/story-ahCLSlHRCCfIUH03Xm2q1H.html

Addressing the media in Hoshiarpur, he said the BJP played a significant role in the formation of the coalition government with the Shiromani Akali Dal in 2012 and now it’s all ready to form the government on its own. “We put our candidates on 23 seats and made them (SAD) contest the rest but it does not mean we do not have the requisite organisational strength to fight the elections on our own. We will contest all 117 seats and form the government,” Sharma said. Declining comment on the chances of rapprochement with the SAD or prospects of fresh alliances, he said that at present the party is focused on contesting all 117 seats. Union minister Som Parkash, who was also present in the press conference, said that the SAD’s departure had not caused any loss to the BJP. He said that its president Sukhbir Singh Badal was convinced with the farm ordinances but later took a U-turn. The minister said that the Congress should have welcomed the new farm laws as it had envisaged the same agriculture reforms in its election manifesto. “The bills should have been unanimously passed in Parliament but the Congress and other political parties played foul. They are misleading farmers on the issue whereas experts such as SS Johal have endorsed the bills,” Parkash said. He said that the BJP would clear farmers’ misconceptions and convince them that the Narendra Modi government is actually working for their uplift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-strong-enough-to-go-it-alone-in-punjab-state-chief/story-4bYcabw4kvyIzyfbJcNtPN.html
07-10-2020||Pune||Covid positivity rate dips to 15% in PCMC||The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) witnessed a dip in Covid-19 case positivity rate from 21.59% between September 21 and 27 to 15.90% between September 28 and October 4. The reduced positivity rate has brought respite to the civic administration though officials say they are cautious given that restaurants and bars are resuming operations and residents are eagerly awaiting the Navratri festival. Positivity rate reflects the proportion of people who test positive among those who are tested. The dip in ratio was noticed since mid-September while August saw the massive rise in positive cases with daily figures crossing 1,000 on numerous occasions. “Everywhere around the state, the positivity rate has been declining. Currently every week we are conducting 26,000 tests. Prior to last week, the number was 26,500 per week and before that it was 28,000 per week,” explained Santosh Patil, additional commissioner PCMC. On Tuesday, 444 fresh positive cases were added to the tally while four deaths were reported, which takes the total number of positive cases so far to 78,588 and death toll to 1,086. Post Ganesh festival, PCMC saw a huge rise in the positivity rate, however, it continued to fall as September ended. “Positive rate dipping down has no relation with testing. All over Maharashtra, Pune, even in rural areas, the cases are decreasing which is a good sign. We have not put our guard down and tests are conducted on priority. Focus is on reducing the positivity rate and also mortality rate,” added Patil. With the upcoming Navratri festival, PCMC is making sure cases do not increase like it happened after Ganesh festival, added officials. “We are taking stringent action against people not wearing masks and are also conducting mass awareness programmes among people to celebrate festivals at home and avoid coming out of their homes,” added Patil. Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer, Symbiosis Hospital, said, “I am cautiously optimistic about the situation. It is a good sign, but people should not think that the pandemic is over. They need to maintain social distancing and follow all the norms. We have seen the surge during the Ganesh festival and with hotel and bars now open, during Navratra festival, I hope people follow all the regulations.September 28-October 4: 4,135 total cases Tests per week: 26,000 Positivity rate: 15.90 per cent September 21-27: 5,722 total cases Tests per week: 26,500 Positivity rate: 21.59 per cent Day-wise data showing decline in Covid numbers Date: Daily positive cases October 5: 421 October 4: 496 October 3: 592 October 2: 599 October 1: 603 September 30: 712 September 29: 628 September 28: 505 September 27: 763 September 26: 1,138 September 25: 806 September 24: 745 September 23: 835 September 22: 780 September 21: 655||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-positivity-rate-dips-to-15-in-pcmc/story-ysKmBT0ke5mRqThMeq00dM.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||National and international companies in fray for Mumbai Monorail rake bid||After scrapping the last bid in which two Chinese companies had shown interest in manufacturing rakes for the Mumbai Monorail, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has received a good response from national and international companies in its revised tender.MMRDA had widened the scope of the tender to suit the Central government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Abhiyan’ or self-reliance policy. According to a senior official, national companies like Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Titagarh Wagons, Medha and ABB Group, and international companies like Cosmos, Intamin and Chinese companies CRRC Corporation Ltd and BYD Co Ltd have shown interest in manufacturing the 10 rakes. CRRC and BYD were the two companies that had participated in the last bid. However, MMRDA scrapped it, stating that the firms were asking for too many changes. This is MMRDA’s third attempt at procuring rakes. The first bid was floated in early 2019. The 10 additional rakes are crucial to improve the frequency of the monorail and attract more commuters. “The tender document has been modelled in line with Atmanirbhar Abhiyan and Make in India policy, and also the government order of July 2020, where countries sharing land borders with India have to register with the government,” said the senior MMRDA official.In July 2020, the Centre said that companies from nations that share a border with India will be barred from bidding for government contracts for goods and services until they register with the industry department. It said the decision was taken to “strengthen the defence of India and national security”.The official, who did not wish to be named, said that MMRDA has received more than 150 queries on technical, financial and contractual clauses of the tender document. The last date for bid submission is November 3. The Mumbai Monorail is a 19.5-km corridor between Chembur and Jacob Circle. It is India’s first monorail that was inaugurated in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/national-and-international-companies-in-fray-for-mumbai-monorail-rakes/story-O85JlKt4r5gOjWQdogElLP.html

We have 12 hours with us and with social distancing norms we can operate about four flights in an hour. So currently, we have 42 flights and the capacity to run 48 flights. We cannot squeeze in more flights since we have to follow social distancing norms. Flight operations will continue only from 8am to 8pm.” At the Lohegaon Airport authority committee meeting held on Tuesday, chaired by Pune’s member of parliament (MP), Girish Bapat of the BJP, expanding cargo capacity emerged as a top priority. Bapat said, “We are trying hard to acquire the land for a cargo facility. Currently, local industries, not just from Pune, but nearby districts including Satara and Ahmednagar, transport their goods to Mumbai airport. If Pune’s cargo facility is improved we can tap into a daily business of about Rs 2.5 crore in freight. The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, which was also part of the meeting, said that with an increased cargo facility there can be a trade increase of about 500 tonnes.” Bapat also said that it is crucial to improve cargo from Pune airport given the fact that Pune could be supplying a Covid-19 vaccine to the world in the future.Stating that Covid-19 has impacted air travel drastically, director Singh said, “In 2018-19 we had a passenger footfall of 9 million at the peak, but in Jan-Feb 2020 we saw a footfall of only 2,000-3,000. Until September, we saw about 1.63 lakh passengers and 1,948 flights operated from Pune.” Bapat added, “We are trying to get to more land acquired from the air force to increase the parking facility. Currently, only seven planes can be parked, which will be increased to 14 flights, which will benefit travellers and flight operators.” Bapat further said that land acquisition talks are on with the defence ministry, but after the pandemic struck, meetings could not be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-night-flights-at-pune-airport-from-october-26/story-YkMVllwNSZw8EXRfZ5lJ6I.html
07-10-2020||Pune||Four booked for realtor’s murder; police widen probe||The Pune police have booked four people in the case of the murder of a realtor who was shot dead in broad daylight on Monday. The deceased man was identified as Rajesh Haridas Kanabar (64), a resident of Sopanbaug Ambience Emperial, Ghorpadi, Pune. While the police have not revealed the names of the three people who are being questioned, they are suspected to be related to the land dispute that the deceased man was fighting for several years.

We are interrogating some people at the moment but it will not be right to reveal their names yet,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police. Senior police inspector Shrikant Shinde of Bund garden police station who is investigating the case remained tight-lipped about the investigation.

A complaint in the matter was lodged by the driver of the deceased man Vishwas Gangawane (32), a resident of Yerawada who saw the shooting while he was waiting for his employer. Kanabar had come to the collector’s office for a hearing about a land dispute. While he was making his way towards his car, he stopped to buy fruits from a nearby vendor and turned around to enter his car when a pedestrian ran towards him, shot him, and fled the spot, police officials said. The driver has told the police that he suspects the other party in the land dispute to have commissioned the murder as the dispute was about to land in favour of the deceased realtor. A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 3(25) of the Arms Act was registered at Bund garden police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/four-booked-for-realtor-s-murder-police-widen-probe/story-mvCztMN6C40zkB76aXynwK.html

It is the seventh extension granted to the two-member commission probing the January 1, 2018, riots at Bhima Koregaon near Pune.

The commission should file its report within the extended period,” stated the order issued by VM Bhat, deputy secretary, home department. According to the commission registrar VV Palnitkar, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the commission and its staff are likely to face some problems especially while conducting hearings. “It has become difficult for advocates and witnesses to attend the hearing due to the fear of infection. The staff members have also expressed their fears about contracting the virus. The commission does not want them to come to office in such a situation and moreover, they are not government employees. Earlier, we had to postpone hearings during the lockdown and now the situation has aggravated further. We are finding it very difficult to conduct the hearing. We will have to think about the safety measures. We had requested for the Sahyadri guest and require more space to accommodate people based on social distancing measures and health guidelines,” said Palnitkar.

The commission functions with the powers of a civil court in two locations: the Public Information Office at Madam Cama road, Mumbai and the Zilla Parishad building in Bund garden, Pune. The commission had approached the state home department after the last extension ended, but received no response from the government. During its last submission to the government, the commission has stated it was yet to examine 40-50 witnesses. The people who are scheduled to appear before the commission before the lockdown were NCP Supremo Sharad Pawar; former Pune rural SP Mohammad Suvez Haque; former district collector Saurabh Rao; senior IPS officer Ravindra Sengaonkar and Rajendra Gaikwad, descendant of Govind Gopal Mahar whose tomb was allegedly desecrated at Vadhu Budruk.

07-10-2020||Lucknow||UP Congress farmers’ wing to empower women with ‘Gandhi Ki Lathi’||The Uttar Pradesh Kisan Congress has launched a week-long programme called Gandhi Ki Lathi, as a symbolic gesture to promote self-defence and empowerment of women amid increasing incidents of crime against them in the country’s most populous state.“We have launched the week-long Gandhi Ki Lathi programme to distribute lathis among women for self-defence and to empower them against crime amid the recent incidents such as the Hathras gang-rape case,” said Tarun Patel, president, Uttar Pradesh Kisan Congress (central zone).Also read: Congress, farmers stage protest in Muzaffarnagar against farm billsA token distribution of lathis was made to around 20 women at a programme organised at the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters in Lucknow to mark the birth anniversary of farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait on Tuesday.The Uttar Pradesh Kisan Congress put up a banner with Mahatma Gandhi’s picture in the backdrop of the dais. The banner carried the slogan “Gandhi Ki Lathi Betiyon Ki Aatm Raksha Ke Liye” (Gandhi’s lathi for the security of women)’.Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhana Mishra, who was the chief guest at the programme, garlanded the pictures of Tikait and Mahatma Gandhi on the dais before lathis were distributed.“Gandhiji’s lathi gives the message of self-defence and self-reliance,” Mishra said.Patel said both Mahatma Gandhi and Tikait carried lathis with them.“We value the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and Tikait. We also value the items they used. They carried a lathi with them and it (the lathi) shows us the way. Holding a lathi adds to inner strength. It makes one feel strong for the purpose of self-defence. We need Gandhiji’s lathi in this day and age for self-defence and self-reliance. It’s not for any aggression,” said Patel.“We will organise similar Gandhi Ki Lathi distribution programmes until October 11 in different districts of the state,” he added.A political analyst said there were apprehensions that the distribution of lathis among women might not send the right signal to the society, despite the UPCC’s assertions.“Lathi may be used for self-defence, as well as for aggression. Lathis are being misused for aggression these days. There are contradictory reports on the Hathras gang-rape case. The opposition should be constructive in its approach and must not indulge in any gimmick,” said SK Dwivedi, a former head of the political science department at the Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-congress-farmers-wing-to-empower-women-with-gandhi-ki-lathi/story-0DHV4bsyyLcLbBs8W0z2UM.html

The report has found that about 10% of the district’s population had migrated from 2011 to 2018.State Rural Development and Migration Commission (SRDMC) authorities have compiled the report, which was presented to Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who is also the chairman of the panel, on Tuesday.“As per the 2011 census, the total population of Rudraprayag district was 2.42 lakh. In our study we found that 22,735 people living in the district had migrated temporarily from one place to another within Uttarakhand. While another 7,835 people had migrated permanently from the district to other places. About 10% of the total district population had migrated between 2011 and 2018,” said SS Negi, vice-chairman, SRDMC. Also read: Kedarnath chief priest, health staff to be tested every 15 days for Covid-19“About 40% of the people, who were in the age group of 26-35 years, had migrated,” he added. The report suggested various measures to curb migration, including providing livelihood opportunities to the people such as a focus on local products.“A framework is needed to be implemented at a block level in a bid to curb migration from the district. The focus should be on pilgrimage and tourist spots in the district, which will help increase livelihood opportunities,” said Negi. He also suggested a “women-centric plan for socio-economic development”.He added: “A concerted effort is needed to be made to boost micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) units, ready-made garment, small agriculture and service sectors, which will help increase livelihood opportunities in Rudraprayag district. We need to increase the number of nurseries and cultivation of fruit bearing trees along with promotion of local products,” he said. Migration from rural areas in Uttarakhand has been a discernible trend through the years. A comparison between the 2001 and 2011 census data showed a slow decadal growth of population in most of the mountain districts of the state, according to the SRDMC. The SRDMC data showed a positive rate of decadal increase in the population in districts such as Dehradun, Udham Singh Nagar, Nainital and Haridwar. But in the mountain districts of Pauri, Almora, Tehri, Bageshwar, Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Pithoragarh, there was a negative rate of decadal increase in the population. Uttarakhand has around 700 ghost villages and over 3.83 lakh people had left their homes in 10 years prior to 2018. Around 50% of them had left in search of livelihood, according to a report released by the SRDMC in May last year. Uttarakhand has around 16,500 villages, of which 734, which are mostly located in mountainous areas, are deserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/need-to-focus-on-pilgrimage-tourist-spots-uttarakhand-migration-commission/story-O0b4BXgS0xsCcViVl7EecP.html

On September 19, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh had asked the members of the incumbent SGPC interim committee and that of the executive committee in 2016 to sweep the street from Saragarhi Sarai to Ghanta Ghar Chowk as a punishment. They were also asked to hold an Akhand Path Sahib at the Akal Takht secretariat. The jathedar banned the office-bearers and executive panel from addressing any public gathering for a month. “The incident of the missing saroops has brought shame to the SGPC. It has hurt the sentiments of the Sikh sangat the world over. Though our executive body was not summoned at Akal Takht, it was a load on our minds. We presented ourselves before Akal Takht and apologised to the jathedar and the Sikh sangat,” Longowal said. “Following the direction of the Akal Takht jathedar, we organised an Akhand Path Sahib at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib, the bhog of which was held on Wednesday. Another Akhand Path has been initiated at Akal Takht Sahib, the bhog of which will be held on Friday. Till then, as per the Akal Takht’s direction, we will perform the sewa (sweep Heritage Street) daily,” the SGPC chief said.

07-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 no ground to relocate abroad a child involved in custody battle: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has refused to accept that the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in the country is a valid ground to allow a Thai national and a person of Indian origin (PIO), who is engaged in a legal battle with her estranged husband, to relocate her son (12) to Bangkok.“This ground of Covid-19 pandemic for relocation does not appeal to us at all,” said the two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Amjad Sayed and Abhay Abuja, on October 1, while dismissing the petition filed by the woman, who is married to a Mumbaikar.The woman, who has been estranged from her husband since 2012, had moved the HC in June, seeking urgent orders to allow her to relocate her son to Bangkok until the time the petition for his custody was decided by the family court at Bandra.The petitioner had contended that “in view of the rapid spread of Covid-19 pandemic in India, we (the mother and the son) urgently want to relocate to our home country, Thailand, where my parents live, until the time the family court at Bandra decides on my son’s custody”.She had stated that she and her son were leading a lonely life in India without any basic medical and financial assistance, maintenance and insurance.She had claimed that the Covid-19 curve had flattened in Thailand and the South-east Asian country had become “one of the safest places on the earth amid the pandemic crises”.She had drawn a parallel between the viral outbreak in her native Thailand and India and also had given the example of June 18 in a bid to bolster her argument. She had pointed out that on that day Thailand had reported 3,290 Covid-19 and 58 deaths. On the contrary, India had reported 1.44 million and 32,063 Covid-19 cases and deaths, respectively, on the same day, she had added.However, the contentions failed to impress upon the court. The bench noted that the boy is studying in a reputed international school in Mumbai. “In our view, it would not be proper to disrupt the studies of the boy in the middle of the academic year, classes of which are being conducted online,” said the bench.The bench also thought it improper to uproot the teenager at this stage in his life because he has lived in Mumbai all along.The bench also rejected the petitioner’s contention that courts had allowed her nine times earlier to travel to Thailand along with her son. It said previous concessions would not work in her favour. “It certainly cannot be equated to relocating the boy to Bangkok pending disposal of the Bandra family court’s proceedings,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-pandemic-isn-t-ground-to-relocate-abroad-a-child-involved-in-custody-battle-hc/story-mSAE0rnnyQUDfmJD7CwpyK.html

07-10-2020||Mumbai||Dabbawalas, consulates staff allowed to travel in local trains||Mumbai’s dabbawalas and staff of foreign consulates and high commissions have been allowed to travel in local trains which are currently being run only for essential services staff, officials said on Wednesday.Dabbawalas, the famous lunch-box carriers in Mumbai, last month said there was never a six-month break in the “130 -year-old history of the tiffin services”, and demanded access to local trains to resume their services in full capacity.Currently, in view of the Covid-19 restrictions, only the dabbawalas who could reach the south Mumbai area on their cycles were able to deliver food to office-goers.They have now expressed happiness on being allowed to board local trains with effect from Tuesday.Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer of the Western Railway, said based on the unlock guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government on September 30, they have allowed the dabbawalas to travel in local trains.“The staff of foreign consulates and high commissions have also been permitted to travel in local trains, as per the directives received from the Ministry of Railways,” he said.Over 5,000 dabbawalas run the tiffin delivery business in the metropolis.Before the outbreak of Covid-19, they used to deliver over two lakh tiffins to office-goers on normal working days.They use suburban trains to ensure lunch boxes are delivered at the destination on time.Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer of the Central Railway, said QR-coded ID cards issued by the state government will be mandatory for them to travel in local trains, but dabbawalas have requested that they be allowed to travel on their identity cards.“If the Maharashtra government agrees to their demand, we will permit them to travel on their ID cards,” he said.Subhash Talekar, spokesperson of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association, expressed happiness on being allowed to travel in local trains.“Finally, after more than six months, we can resume our service,” Talekar said, adding dabbawalas will now contact their customers and request them to resume the tiffin service.He was, however, skeptic about resumption of services in full capacity amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“Before the pandemic, every dabbawala had on an average 20 to 22 customers, but I doubt all customers will resume the service immediately as many people are still working from home,” he said.Another issue is that many housing societies are still not allowing outsiders into the premises, he said.Talekar said the dabbawalas will start tiffin delivery even with four to five customers initially as they know it will take some time for things to normalise.“We are going to follow the Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and gloves, using sanitisers and maintaining social distance and will also ensure our customers about it,” he said.Most of the dabbawalas hail from Maval area of Pune in western Maharashtra.Following the enforcement of lockdown in March this year, many of them returned to their native places in Junnar, Ambegaon, Rajgurunagar, Maval, Haveli, Mulashi and other talukas in Pune district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dabbawalas-consulates-staff-allowed-to-travel-in-local-trains/story-aa5DhohQgxc4K2elBLR7RN.html

Deb, who had attended a programme at Sabroom in the state’s South district on September 11, had said that some “overexcited” newspapers are trying to confuse the public over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic situation and he would not forgive them. Also read: Tripura scribes wear black badges to protest against CM’s ‘threat’ over reporting of Covid-19 situationTripura Assembly of Journalists (TAJ), an apex organisation of the media persons in the state, drew the attention of the PM, Shah and the PCI authorities that at least six journalists were assaulted across Tripura since Deb’s controversial remarks.Though complaints were lodged, there has been no progress in investigation of any of the cases, the media persons said. “...even during the Emergency in the 70s, the media didn’t face such a demoralising situation. The media is an independent body of newspapers, electronic channels and news portals, which follow their own in-house policy and guidelines ...The attack on journalists and creation of undue pressure on the media are undemocratic,” stated the TAJ’s letter.Subal Kumar Dey and Sekhar Datta, chairman and convener of TAJ, respectively, signed the letter. Earlier, the media persons had given a three-day deadline to CM Deb to withdraw his controversial remarks. The CM said he did not want to hurt anyone in his September 11 speech after the deadline expired. “I didn’t hurt anyone in my speech. I am dedicated to work for the interests of Tripura people, keep them healthy and safe and also prevent them falling into conspiracies. The people should know the truth and I have tried to present the truth before them,” Deb said later.The media persons also met Tripura Governor RK Bais regarding the issue and had protested wearing black ribbons on the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2.Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) didn’t comment on the complaint letter written to the PM, though earlier it had claimed that Deb’s comments were taken out of context.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tripura-scribes-write-to-pm-home-minister-about-cm-s-statement-against-media/story-mgj83u3TBw8gg6vlWW4NRN.html
07-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality hits ‘poor’ category, first time since June 2020||Delhi’s air quality entered the poor zone on Wednesday morning for first time since June this year. The air quality index (AQI) reading at 10 am was 207 (in the poor zone), as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Till Tuesday, the air quality was in the higher end of the moderate category. Government agencies had warned of deterioration in air quality due to the change in weather conditions and fumes from farm fires in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab contributing to pollution in Delhi. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, PM 2.5 is usually the main pollutant during winter. “The nighttime calm surface wind condition prevailed yesterday and is likely to do so for the next two days. Further deterioration in air quality is expected by October 9 and 10 but the AQI reading will remain in the poor category. An increase in stubble-burning was observed on Tuesday around Punjab, Haryana, and the neighbouring border regions. The boundary-layer wind direction and speed are favourable for the transport and accumulation of pollutants in Delhi, and the worsening of air quality in the coming days is expected,” the Safar bulletin read. Also Read: Supreme Court summons chief secretaries in stubble-burning caseAs per Safar, on October 6, synergised fire count was 336. After January and February, which had several ‘poor’ category days, only two ‘poor’ category days were recorded each in March, May and June. April, July, August and September had only ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ days. August was the cleanest month since 2015 when four ‘good’ air days were recorded. According to scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD), there has been a consistent dip in the night temperature over the last few days and the wind speed has also slowed down. Besides, the wind (whose direction changed to north-westerly) is bringing fumes from neighbouring states where stubble-burning has started. On Tuesday, the night temperature was recorded at 18.6 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal while the maximum temperature settled at 36 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-enters-poor-zone-for-the-first-time-since-june/story-oFp4cgeyv6Fs57zhhlYP3J.html

07-10-2020||Delhi||Master Plan of Delhi-2041: Villages need time-bound implementation policies||Planned areas have benefitted from the provisions of the Master Plan of Delhi (MPD)-2021, but planned growth has given a miss to the rural areas and urban villages in the national capital for years. Several villages, which come under the MPD-2021, lack basic civic infrastructure because of an absence of adequate planning measures.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has prepared MPD-2041, but questions are being raised for a time-bound implementation of its policies for all the 365 villages that come under the rural and urban categories. The DDA will hold public consultations with the residents of urban and rural villages on Wednesday.“The public consultations are a way to understand the issues faced by various groups of people. This will help us plan the strategy for future development better,” said a DDA official.The DDA and the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which comes under the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and has been entrusted with the task to prepare MPD-2041, is planning a discussion with the villagers as part of its consultative process. A delay in the implementation of MPD provisions and government policies has led to unplanned development, unauthorised construction and rampant commercialisation in most of these villages.MPD-2021, which was notified on February 7, 2007, has provisions for Low Density Residential Area (LDRA) and land pooling for planned developments in villages as urban extensions. The land pooling policy is aimed at providing 17 lakh dwelling units to meet the affordable housing requirements of the national capital, which has an estimated population of two crores. Though the LDRA is yet to see the light of the day, the land pooling policy was notified in 2015 and the work for its implementation had started in 2018.Bhupinder Bazad, president, MPD committee, Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, said, “These policies have been a non-starter. The civic facilities in the villages has gone from bad to worse due to an inordinate delay in the implementation of these policies. The number of unauthorised colonies has also increased over the years. There should be a time-bound implementation of these policies.”Of the 365 villages, 200 belong to the urban category, including 95, which were recently earmarked for the implementation of the land pooling policy.Residents living in urban villages said they lack basic civic infrastructure such as parks, schools, community centres etc. Paras Tyagi, president of Centre for Youth Culture and Law and Environment, who works on issues related to villages in Delhi, said, “The previous MPD had provisions for preparing a village development plan. The aim was to provide infrastructure to the public. A lot of development has happened in the villages over the years. Now, these areas need to be regularised.”In Mundka, which has emerged as one of the leading pollution hotspots in Delhi, residents said that the government should focus on creating more green spaces. Environmentalist Diwan Singh, who is also a member of Mundka village resident welfare association (RWA), said, “Our area is known for commercial activities. But the government should focus on developing green spaces instead of putting up more industrial units.”Sabyasachi Das, an urban planner and a former planning commissioner of the DDA, cited problems in the execution of such elaborate development plans for Delhi’s villages. “The DDA has prepared a detailed plan for four villages in Dwarka. But it could never be implemented. Land is the biggest problem, as very little of it is available in these villages to provide basic infrastructure. Besides, the villagers often don’t agree to give up their land for development. New areas are being planned for land pooling. Planning should be done for essential services in these neighbouring villages, especially those that have pooled land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/master-plan-of-delhi-2041-villages-need-time-bound-implementation-policies/story-SwqN9GeeI7Bo9kO8QlHNUJ.html

07-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Citizen organisation seeks implementation of city’s development plan||A Mumbai-based citizen group has launched a movement demanding the implementation of Mumbai’s Development Plan (DP) 2034. The group, RoadMarch, has created a 3D model highlighting the roads, part of DP 1967 and 1991, still lying incomplete. DP of a city is a 20-year urban plan where reservations are made for roads, gardens and social amenities after inviting suggestions and objections from the citizens. Mumbai has had a poor record with regards to implementation of the DP. For instance, only 33% of the 1991 DP while only 18% of the 1967 DP was implemented. Since the previous DPs were also not fully implemented, most of the reservations were repeated in the 2014-2034 DP. Also read: How much of Mumbai’s salt pans can be developed? Master plan in the worksRoadMarch founder Gopal Zhaveri said, “We did a study of the road reservations between Bandra and Dahisar and found that approximately 35% of it is yet to be implemented.” The model was displayed on October 2, when the organisation launched its movement. “We are looking at displaying it again in South Mumbai by the end of this month and also to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation commissioner. We will continue this movement till Mumbaikars don’t get good public infrastructure,” Zhaveri said, adding that the group has highlighted missing patches between Dahisar-Dindoshi, in Juhu and also Borivili, which are increasing the traffic woes in the city. Mumbai is one of the worst cities in India when it comes to traffic congestion on roads. According to the TomTom Index 2019, Mumbai is the fourth most traffic congested city in the world where citizens spend 65% longer on the roads during peak hours. It states that Mumbaikars spend 209 hours or 8 days and 17 hours in traffic each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-citizen-organisation-seeks-implementation-of-city-s-development-plan/story-sZsZEtnYvl5GNEwKPZsdLL.html

07-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra reaching a plateau, says health minister Rajesh Tope||As Maharashtra recorded a comparative decline in daily Covid-19 cases, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that the curve is “stabilising”. In the first six days of October, the state has recorded 82,619 new cases, down from 114,360 during the corresponding period last month. The minister added that the number of Covid-19 cases in the state is reaching a plateau.Over the past nine days, the state has recorded a relatively lower number of cases, compared to previous weeks. However, the number of tests conducted between September 28 and October 5 has seen a substantial dip in figures compared to its previous week between September 20 and September 27. Tope said that though the average testing has seen a dip, the positivity rate has remained around the same.“We have asked the [districts] to increase testing. Some of the districts are testing a lower number [of samples]. We will ask them to increase tracing and testing. Our intention is to take it up to 1.50 lakh tests daily. Even if the testing has reduced, the positivity rate has remained the same,” Tope said. Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe minister added, “We are seeing lower cases daily. The situation is stabilising here and we are reaching a plateau.”Between September 28 and October 5, according to the health department data, 604,238 samples were tested. The previous week — between September 20 and September 27 — 779,502 samples were tested. Between September 12 and September 19, 713,626 samples were tested.

The two occupants of the car, Ankit Malhotra and Ranjan Kalra, worked for an event management firm and were both 35 years old. According to RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), removing the container truck from the car required the services of two private hydra cranes and three cranes of the traffic police. By the time these machines could lift the rice bag-laden container from the car, the two occupants were already dead. The accident took place around 3.45 am at a tri-junction under the Lajpat Nagar Flyover.“The errant driver fled the spot,” said the DCP. While Malhotra was a resident of east Delhi’s Karkardooma, Kalra lived in Lajpat Nagar.The circumstances of the mishap are still being probed, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-two-crushed-to-death-after-container-truck-topples-onto-car/story-eEzWbT2lsapOo9ek9MEmSO.html
07-10-2020||City||Project Dolphin: Maharashtra develops action plan for conservation of oceanic dolphins||Maharashtra has chalked out an action plan for the conservation of oceanic dolphins along its 720 kilometres (km) coastline in line with the Centre’s proposed Project Dolphin programme.On the occasion of the 74th Independence Day on August 15, Prime Minister Narenda Modi had launched the Project Lion and Project Dolphin endangered species conservation programmes in a bid to replicate the success of Project Tiger. Also read: My Ganga My Dolphin campaign launched at six sites across river GangaThe Maharashtra government’s mangrove cell submitted a proposal on the implementation strategies and a synopsis of previous research on oceanic dolphins to Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF-wildlife), earlier this week coinciding with the Wildlife Week, which is being celebrated from October 2 to 8. “The proposal is being examined at the moment. The state government will send it to the Centre soon,” said Kakodkar.“We will be looking into conservation-based research projects associated with the rich aquatic biodiversity. A special focus will be on oceanic dolphins over the next few years along the Konkan coast as part of the state’s action plan for Project Dolphin. Mangrove Foundation will be the nodal authority for the upcoming projects,” he added. The plan suggested measures such as a monitoring network, population estimation, habitat conservation for dolphin hot spots, strengthening marine stranding network, and developing livelihood by building eco-tourism projects around protection of the species.“Similar to the pan-India tiger estimation programme, we intend to develop a large population estimation exercise in Maharashtra to determine the oceanic dolphin count,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), (mangrove cell), Mumbai.Manas Manjrekar, deputy director, Mangrove Foundation, said, “This project opens up the possibilities of studying and monitoring these cetacean populations on a long term basis. It will lead to the implementation of effective conservation measures for oceanic dolphins.”According to the mangrove cell authorities, four dolphin species – Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, spinner dolphin, pan-tropical spotted dolphin, and striped dolphin – have been found in Maharashtra’s coastal waters along with several sightings of the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise.“Our plan entails conducting an initial baseline survey first along each district followed by identification and selection of dolphin congregation areas, where monitoring is carried out annually,” said Tiwari.Kakodkar said dolphin watch has become a money-spinner for the local population. “The idea is to expand the programme. It will also help understand and implement dolphin tourism at feasible areas of specific coastal villages to promote community-based conservation and develop livelihood programmes for the locals,” he said.Under a 2016 Cetacean Population Assessment Project, which was undertaken in Sindhudurg district by the Konkan Cetacean Research Team appointed by the mangrove cell along with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), a statistical analysis had showed a minimum of 661 Indian Ocean humpback dolphins in the region, of which 572 had dorsal fins and another 15.5% of the population were juveniles. The study had covered a total area of 4,086 square (sq) km and had showed an estimated encounter rates for Indian Ocean humpback dolphin and Indo-pacific finless porpoise at 0.0348 and 0.0152 per km, respectively. Porpoises have smaller mouths and spade-shaped teeth, as compared to dolphins that have prominent, elongated beaks and small cone-shaped teeth. Dolphins have a curved dorsal fin, while a porpoise has a triangular dorsal fin. All species of oceanic dolphins are protected under the Schedule I of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.“Occurrence and genetic studies related to Indian Ocean humpback dolphins are in progress along other coastal districts as well. It is being scaled up by pooling in research into other dolphin species for a wider conservation approach,” said Tiwari.The Konkan coast has also reported 107 cases of marine mammal stranding, including dead and alive, along beaches and coastal zones between 2015 and 2017. However, a sharp decline in their population was reported after 2017, which led to the formation of a marine respondents’ group involving forest department, citizens, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), veterinary doctors etc. Between November 2019 and September 2020, 25 cetaceans, including nine Indian Ocean humpback dolphins, seven baleen whales, five finless porpoise and two striped dolphins were washed ashore along the Konkan coast.“We plan to strengthen our marine stranding network for easy response and management of such incidents and equip groups with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sample collection and morphometric kits for authentic data collection for genetic studies and to understand causes of offshore deaths and stranding,” said Tiwari.Independent experts said the Project Dolphin must adopt a simple approach. “We need to know the exact abundance of various dolphin species. We have to study their mortality rate. If the difference between annual mortalities versus abundance is small, stringent conservation measures have to be implemented. Maharashtra has taken a lead with its plan,” said E Vivekanandan, emeritus scientist at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), in Kochi, Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/project-dolphin-maharashtra-develops-action-plan-for-conservation-of-oceanic-dolphins/story-4JHyRE6HnaZKJVGhvx2DjJ.html

07-10-2020||Kolkata||Pandemic protocol should not be violated during Durga Puja, says Bengal CM||Cautioning the people about the rising number of Covid-19 infections in the state, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said that the pandemic protocol should not be violated during the coming Durga Puja.She said that the marquees should be made open and airy and the pandal hoppers should avoid jostling and maintain proper physical distancing.“People should go for shopping. Shops will remain open. Otherwise, how will they do business? But while shopping for the pujas people should not forget about the protocol,” she said.Banerjee, who was speaking at an administrative meeting at Kharagpur, asked the police to disburse the one time grant of Rs 50,000 to each puja committee in West Midnapore district.“Police must ensure that all the puja committees in the district get the grant. I have entrusted you (police) to disburse the money but not the panchayat department or my party. Do not listen to what a panchayat member tells you about the grant,” she said.Banerjee said the cycle threshold (CT) value of an RT-PCR test which can give useful information to doctors treating a coronavirus patient, of the affected people should be noted to ascertain the degree of risk.Those diagnosed with CT value above 20 could be in home isolation but everyday monitoring should be done by the district administration, Banerjee said.“A person who has a CT value below 20 is considered critical as the viral load of such patients will be maximum. I think we can segregate and create a list of patients who are diagnosed with CT value below 20. They are those who spread the virus.“Those who are above CT 20 can be in home isolation.But they must not forget to wear masks and maintain physical distance,” Banerjee said. “We have to provide the right treatment to those with comorbidities. They should be called every day to find out about their health condition,” she said.The chief minister urged the West Midnapore district officials to work so that the death rate in the area due to the pandemic is below one per cent.Announcing a slew of sops ahead of next year’s assembly elections, she directed officials in the district to clear all the necessary work so that funds meant for ‘Kanyashree’, ‘Sikhasree’, ‘Sabuj Sathi’ schemes and pension meant for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are disbursed on time.The chief minister also stressed on monitoring the public distribution system, Swasthya Sathi scheme and said, “People belonging to the scheduled caste, will get the Joy Bangla pension immediately after reaching the age of 60 years.“We are paying pension to over a lakh of people. Clear it for the month of October, November,” she said.The ‘Maatir Sristi’ scheme was also launched to improve the financial condition of the villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/pandemic-protocol-should-not-be-violated-during-durga-puja-says-bengal-cm/story-AZH5CavJsZrAY0grw8GPaN.html

The victim, Ram Mehar of Datta village in Hisar, ran a factory in Hisar’s Barwala town. Sadar Hansi station house officer Kashmiri Lal said that they received a call that two motorcycle-borne men and a car occupant were following the trader near Bhatla village. “When we reached the spot minutes later around midnight, we found the driver was burnt alive and the car was gutted. His relatives told us that he had called them up also to say that three men were chasing him and he was carrying Rs 11 lakh,” the SHO said. A case was registered under Sections 392 (punishment for robbery) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. The victim’s nephew said that he had given Rs 9.9 lakh to his uncle on Tuesday after withdrawing the amount from a bank. Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said that “maha jungle raj” prevailed in Haryana. “A trader was burnt alive in the middle of the road after looting Rs 11 lakh from him. There is maha jangalraj in the state under the Manohar Lal Khattar government. There is no law and order. Criminals are ruling in the state. Traders’ lives and goods are being looted.

07-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 testing down from high; antigen dominates||Testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi in recent weeks appears to have again dropped from peak levels, shows Delhi government data.Delhi conducted 59,368 daily tests at an average for the week ending September 20, what has been the city’s highest recorded rate of testing till date. Since then, this number has seen a near-consistent drop. Two weeks ago, the city conducted an average of 54,629 tests per day, and this has further dropped to 50,116 in the past week — down by around 16% from the peak.This drop in testing has largely coincided with the drop in new cases in the city. The seven-day average of daily cases has dropped from 4,174 for week ending September 17 (the peak so far) to 2,702 in the last week — a drop of 35%.In late August, taking note of persistently rising Covid-19 numbers at an emergency meeting, the Delhi government had decided to massively scale-up testing in an effort to catch and isolate more infections. As a result, the number of tests during this period had gone up from under 20,000 to over 60,000 by the third week of September.Experts said the government should not lower its guard on testing and should be conducting as many tests as possible. “Even if there are fewer cases, the number of tests should not be reduced. You should do as many tests as possible; there is no upper limit. If a large number of tests are being done and very few cases are detected, then the government will know for sure that there are very few cases in the community. However, if only a small number of tests are done there is a possibility that we might be missing the cases,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Experts also questioned the Delhi government’s strategy of relying heavily on rapid antigen tests to increase testing numbers instead of the gold-standard RT-PCR test.Rapid antigen tests were introduced Delhi in mid-June to scale up testing when the number of cases had started shooting up. The downside of antigen tests is that they tend to give anywhere between 50-80% false negatives, or in other words, they can miss positive cases. This is the reason, anyone with symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat who tests negative using the rapid test is asked to undergo an RT-PCR test.“Rather than the rapid antigen test, the government needs to scale up RT-PCR test that are more accurate at picking up infections. There are clear ICMR guidelines on where the tests should be used and the same strategy should be followed. Currently, very few of the rapid tests are being re-checked using RT PCR; all the people who have any symptoms should ideally be retested using RT-PCR,” said Dr Kant.This will help in monitoring the increase and decline in the cases that might happen over the next few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-testing-down-from-high-antigen-dominates/story-sZW4hR3GJ0VR9RwIOGXCzM.html

A special court turned down Chakraborty and Showik’s bail pleas on September 11, after which the two moved HC for bail. According to NCB, Chakraborty and Showik financed the deceased actor’s drug habit. Advocate Maneshinde, who is representing both Chakraborty and Showik, has maintained section 27 A (financing illicit trafficking of drugs or harbouring offenders) of the NDPS Act are not applicable to his clients. He has argued that Rajput was known to have consumed drugs before making Chakraborty’s acquaintance in April 2019. Also, according to Maneshinde, NCB’s allegations are on the basis of a solitary incident from March 17, when Chakraborty gave Miranda her credit card and the latter withdrew Rs 10,000, allegedly to purchase some contraband material for Rajput. Maneshinde has said Chakraborty’s card was not directly used to pay any alleged drug peddlers and therefore she cannot be considered associated with a drug syndicate. Advocate Taraq Sayed, who represents arrested accused Abdel Basit Parihar, has submitted that Parihar is a student of architecture who had to miss an examination, due to being in judicial custody, and cannot be termed drug peddlers or suppliers. Since the alleged transactions involve small quantities of drugs, Sayed has also argued that Parihar, Chakraborty, Showik and Miranda are entitled to bail along with arrested accused Dipesh Sawant, who was part of Rajput’s household staff. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who opposed the bail applications on behalf of NCB, had submitted that the NDPS Act does not state that offences are bailable based on the quantity of drugs involved. Justice Sarang Kotwal had agreed with his submission on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-judicial-custody-of-actor-rhea-chakraborty-others-extended-till-october-20/story-r0sKiLqro89l1jQ7aLfujL.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singht Rajput’s sisters petition to quash FIR against them adjourned to October 13||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday posted a petition filed by Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, sisters of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, for further hearing on October 13. Priyanka and Meetu Singh have sought to quash the first information report (FIR) registered against them by Bandra police, following a complaint by actor Rhea Chakraborty. The bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik adjourned the hearing as neither Chakraborty’s legal counsel nor any one for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) appeared to respond to the petition. In her complaint, Chakraborty has alleged Priyanka got Dr Tarun Kumar of New Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi to prescribe to Rajput medication that is prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. Chakraborty has alleged that the medication may have caused chronic anxiety and contributed to Rajput taking his own life. Rajput’s sisters have responded in a petition filed through advocate Madhav Thorat that not all the prescribed medication is banned and guidelines issued by the Medical Council of India in April this year allow medication to be prescribed to patients even at the first consultation. The petition also questions the timing of Chakraborty’s complaint, pointing out that she lodged it on September 7 while the medication was prescribed on June 8 (which is the date that Chakraborty and Rajput parted ways). Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14. Chakraborty was arrested on September 8 by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) as part of its probe into allegations of drug abuse in the case of Rajput’s death. Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde issued a statement on Tuesday, alleging Rajput’s family and their legal team are “are interfering and tampering with the investigations”. Advocate Satish Maneshinde’s statement, issued on Tuesday: The SC on 19th Aug 2020, to ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter (of Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR) death case) considered it appropriate to accord approval for the ongoing CBI investigation into the case registered at Patna and directed transfer of any case registered on the death of SSR into the circumstances of his unnatural death to CBI. The Bandra Police registered a case on the allegations of Rhea Chakraborty against the sisters of SSR in relation to illegal administration of medicines on the basis of forged prescription which could be the cause of SSR death and transferred it on 9th Sept 2020 to the CBI as per the orders of the SC. Therefore the family also stand to face investigations in the case. The CBI is independently and impartially investigating both the cases. The CBI is supposed to be an insulated and free from any interference. It is disturbing to learn that the family of SSR and its lawyers are interfering and tampering with the investigations by bringing pressure on the AIIMS team of doctors by speaking to them during investigations and releasing purported audio recorded conversations and information to the media in order to bring pressure and tamper with potential witnesses. The SSR family lawyer is supposed to have said that he is going to meet the CBI director to get the family’s pre-determined path of investigations in SSR death. It is very disturbing to read such information in the media as attempts are being made to get a pre-determined result in the case. Any further attempts to interfere and tampering in the investigations would be brought to the notice of the appropriate courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singht-rajput-s-sisters-petition-to-quash-fir-against-them-adjourned-to-october-13/story-3YbS8CO2Ya1UYs9J55Lj1N.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra police to probe Sushant Singh Rajput case conspiracy||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday announced a probe into what he called a “conspiracy hatched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defame Mumbai and Maharashtra Police in the Sushant Singh (SSR) case”. Seeking an apology from the party and its leader Devendra Fadnavis, Deshmukh alleged the links were found in the University of Michigan, US’s study of the social media campaign. The BJP has rubbished the allegations, saying the state government should punish the culprits by investigating the case thoroughly. Fadnavis, who is in Bihar for the Assembly polls, was not available for a comment. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14. Deshmukh said: “The report stated the SSR case study reveals the BJP’s hand in the conspiracy theories. A few people outside the state were used as puppets by the BJP to defame Maharashtra. The electronic media and a few channels were at the forefront of the conspiracy for the past three-four months. The crime branch of Mumbai Police and cybercrime department of the state police will conduct a probe.” Citing the recent report by AIIMS Hospital in New Delhi, which said Rajput was not poisoned, Deshmukh said, “The Supreme Court, during its hearing, had applauded Mumbai Police’s investigation. A few BJP leaders, however, were targeting Mumbai Police for political gain in Bihar elections. They even called the Mumbai police mafia. Fadnavis, too, had targeted Mumbai Police, doubting their competence.” Deshmukh also asked if Fadnavis will participate in the Bihar campaign along with former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey who is in the fray. “Will Fadnavis, who has been appointed as poll in-charge in Bihar by his party, share the dais with Pandey who played a key role in defaming Mumbai and Maharashtra police?” He also attacked CBI, which has taken over the SSR case investigation from Mumbai Police, saying he was eagerly waiting for the outcome of the probe. BJP leader and leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar said the home minister should wait for CBI to reveal the findings from the probe. “Why is Deshmukh in a hurry to jump to a conclusion? Is he trying to mount the pressure on CBI and the Narcotics Control Bureau? Instead of raising questions, Deshmukh should first reply whether he wants to support the drug mafia active in the film industry,” he said. Another BJP leader Ram Kadam said they are not against the probe into fake accounts created on social media to discredit Mumbai Police. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The BJP used three central agencies for gains in the Bihar Assembly polls. Selective information was leaked by the agencies on a daily basis. We will hand over more information on the fake social media accounts and their misuse to Mumbai Police on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-police-to-probe-sushant-singh-rajput-case-conspiracy/story-kXlPbYUOajLJYFznt4APqK.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Mumbai Police registers two FIR’s against trolls||Mumbai Police has registered a first information report (FIR) against those who created fake accounts on social media to troll Mumbai Police commissioner and orchestrated a campaign to discredit Mumbai Police and Maharashtra government over the investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.At least 80,000 fake social media accounts were created across nine countries as part of an orchestrated campaign, a report by the force’s cyber unit had stated. “Several social media account holders are trolling the Mumbai Police commissioner on different platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and are using abusive language against him and the force. Hence, an FIR has been registered against those account holders under 67 of the Information Technology (IT) Act. Most of these accounts are fake and we will be taking action against all those account holders,” said deputy commissioner of police (Cyber), Rashmi Karandikar. “Another FIR has been registered against the culprit who used a morphed image of the official Twitter account of Mumbai Police commissioner recently. We have started the probe in both matters,” added Karandikar.The internal report, submitted by the unit to city police commissioner Param Bir Singh, said it found posts were uploaded on social media platforms from different countries, including Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Romania and France. Singh has now issued an order asking joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe to monitor the probe and has also sanctioned additional manpower for the cyber unit.Singh, on Wednesday, said, “We have written to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and sought the detailed report of such fake accounts. Once we procure details, we will start taking action against those who are behind this act.”“There are many fake accounts and for that analysis, the unit needs more manpower as I have asked Bharambe to monitor and provide manpower as much as they need for their investigation,” Singh said.“The campaign was run against Mumbai Police to demoralise us at a time when 84 personnel had died due to the pandemic and over 6,000 were infected with Covid-19. This was a motivated campaign with a vested interest to malign the image of Mumbai Police and derail our line of investigation,” Singh had said. He added that all found violating the law would be prosecuted under relevant sections of the IT Act. “Multiple fake accounts on social media were created to target Mumbai Police in abusive tones,” he added. Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Mumbai home on June 14, setting off speculation about the cause of death. Mumbai Police called several members of the film industry for questioning before the actor’s family filed a police complaint in Bihar alleging a conspiracy behind the death and blamed his girlfriend, actor Rhea Chakraborty, and her family. The case is being probed by several agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Chakraborty, her brother Showik and some other associates are currently in jail on drug charges. The cyber unit’s report revelation came days after a medical team from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) ruled out the possibility of murder in the case – a development the Maharashtra government claimed as a vindication of its stand in the sensitive case. “We had investigated this case very professionally. The CBI had set up a panel of AIIMS doctors who have justified our investigation, the findings of Cooper Hospital and the forensic laboratory. Except for a few people, nobody else was aware of our investigation, but still, many have criticised it,” Singh had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-mumbai-police-registers-two-fir-s-against-trolls/story-3onyb8BPQZBneQ88abUFGK.html

The accused claimed that the trust was involved scams worth ₹10,000 crore and also threatened to kill the complainant if he refuses to pay the amount.The complainant Prem Masih, 68, a resident of August Kranti Marg (Kemps Corner), is also managing director of United Church of North India Trust Association. Masih in his statement to the Gamdevi police has stated that on July 21 he received a call from a person who identified himself as Udaybhan Singh, told him that he is calling from the office of undersecretary, North block, Home Ministry, New Delhi.Singh told Masih that their department has received various complaints against him and his trust. He asked him to come to Delhi and to carry trust’s original documents, for inquiry. Masih, however, told him that he cannot come to Delhi due to spread of Covid-19. This didn’t go well with Singh who yelled at him over phone saying that United Church of North India Trust Association and Church of North India (CNI) do not exist and you (and your associates) have done scams worth ₹10,000 crore under the name of trusts. Singh also threatened saying if he wants to settle the matter or lose life. He also threatened Masih if wouldn’t come to Delhi then CBI officers would arrest him from Mumbai and throw him in jail for life term, said the complaint (a copy of which is with HT).Masih told the accused (Singh) that he wouldn’t be able to come to Delhi as his trust have not indulged in any illegal activities and have records of all government and court documents.“Later Singh also offered to settle the matter and demanded ₹10 crore - ₹5 crore to be given to Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and ₹5 crore to the CBI. Masih then suspected that Singh is not from any government office and is a private person trying to extort money. Later he stopped answering Singh’s calls,” said an officer requesting anonymity.On July 27, a man tried to meet Masih, but was stopped at the society gate by the guard. When Masih enquired, he told him that he is Thakur and has been sent by the department from Delhi. The person threatened Masih and his son and asked them to comply with their demands, the officer added.Later, Masih learnt that his trust’s chairman Premchand Singh and his nephew Navdeep Gill also received threat calls for extortion.Masih then registered an FIR with the Gandevi police.The police have registered a case under sections 384 (extortion), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) and 34 (common intention) Indian Penal Code.Police sources said that two people have been arrested in the case, but they are just henchmen. The main accused is yet to be arrested.Masih was not available to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-wilson-college-management-gets-10-crore-extortion-call/story-9HL7I9v0oanBUCqxCJsIRP.html

07-10-2020||Mumbai||Cyber attack on server delays Mumbai university’s IDOL course exams||For the second day in a row, exams for the distance education wing of the University of Mumbai had to be postponed. In a statement released by the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), authorities explained that the technical glitches were a result of a cyberattack on the examination server.Close to 9,000 students of IDOL had their third-year Bachelor of Commerce and Arts exams scheduled, however, more than 90% could not access the exam link on Tuesday.After receiving flak from students, many of whom also gathered at the university’s Kalina campus on Tuesday evening, IDOL released a statement postponing the day’s exam. It added that due to the trouble with the examination server, they have postponed the exams scheduled to take place on Wednesday as well.“I had logged on the exam app 15 minutes before the paper was scheduled to begin, but I received an error message instead. An hour after logging in also the question paper was not available,” said a Commerce student.In a statement released on Tuesday evening, examination authorities said the error was due to technical glitch.“We are in touch with the software company and they are still trying to find out the exact reason behind this error. We are sure the remaining papers will be conducted smoothly,” said Vinod Malale, deputy registrar (public relations). MU this year has opted for a Singapore-based software company called LittleMORE Innovation Labs to conduct exams online. This same problem occurred on Saturday as well, when IDOL conducted its first paper and several students ended up missing the exam due to similar technical glitches. The same exams have now been rescheduled to the second week of October. For exams postponed on October 6, a rescheduled timetable is yet to be announced.By Tuesday evening, members of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) objected to the continued problems faced by students during the examination and demanded that all exams be postponed until the technical glitches resolved. “Firstly, the university should postpone all IDOL exams until the software problem is solved. The varsity should also consider terminating services of the software company for creating so much confusion and anxiety among the student community,” said a statement released by MNS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyber-attack-on-server-delays-mumbai-university-s-idol-course-exams/story-LQSsJwiw5w1F0gNgrpAtgM.html

Confirming the development a ED official said that the two have been arrested under section 19 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). Both accused were produced before the special judge (PMLA) and were granted seven days of ED custody.”Earlier in June, the ED had raided five premises belonging to senior management of CKG.On March 8, ED had arrested Yes Bank’s founder Rana Kapoor, who is currently in judicial custody. The agency has been scanning the transactions made by the bank to its borrowers. “During the investigation, irregularities were also noticed in relation to the loan sanctioned to CKG. The group had created multiple layers of onshore and offshore subsidiary across the globe, through which the monies were siphoned off,” said an ED officer.According to ED statement, during investigation, it surfaced that Yes Bank had total outstanding of ₹3,642 crore in respect of Cox & Kings Group of Companies. CKG forged it’s consolidated financials by manipulating the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries. In addition, some board resolutions submitted to banks for sanctioning the loans were also found to be forged. The investigation also revealed that the loan sanctioned from Yes bank was driven by then CMD Rana Kapoor and was given bypassing the norms. ED gathered the evidence regarding clear instructions of Rana Kapoor to the concerned bank officials to get the said loan continued and not to take efforts to recover it.The probe has also revealed that during the fiscal year 2015 to the fiscal year 2019, sales of ₹3,908 crore was made to 15 non-existent/fictitious customers. Majority of the collection shown in ledgers from Ezeego (another group entity of CKG ) was not found in the bank statements. Also, there are fictitious 15 high-value debtors reflected in the books of accounts. Another 147 sets of customers also appeared to be suspicious and not existent. The Cox & King Limited (CKL) has diverted ₹1,100 crore to another stressed company without any approval of board which has no business relationship with the company, the agency said in a release.Khandelwal and Jain also acquired the mortgaged property amounting to ₹63 crore in their business entity Reward Business Solutions without paying a penny from their pocket.The investigation further revealed that Khandelwal and Jain purchased various immovable properties from the funds diverted from CKG. It further revealed that from Ezeego, ₹150 crore were diverted to Redkite Capital Private Limited which was promoted by family members of Khandelwal and Jain. Investigators have found that the bank transactions of Cox and King Group are not matching with the books of accounts and Khandelwal & Jain creating disparities between the books of accounts and the bank statements to camouflage the fraud.During the seven-day custody, ED officials intend to grill the two in relation to the irregularities and collect more evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-ed-arrests-two-senior-officials-of-cox-kings/story-FX9Ji2zHyddE31j3wRQVQN.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra gets India’s first wood anatomical database for mangrove tree species||Maharashtra has become the first state in India to undertake forensic timber identification of mangrove tree species for enhanced conservation of the salt-tolerant coastal trees.The Institute of Wood Sciences and Technology (IWST), Bengaluru, has come up with a first-of-its-kind study for developing an inventory of wood anatomy of mangrove species along the Maharashtra coast. The Mangrove Foundation and state mangrove cell of the forest department sanctioned the report this week. Stem and branch wood samples from 17 species from 12 genera belonging to nine families collected from Mumbai (Daravali, Madh), Navi Mumbai (Airoli), Panvel and eight locations at Sindhudurg along the state’s coastline were studied for various anatomical and physical properties.“Owing to lack of information on mangrove wood anatomy, identification of the cut wood or those spotted on encroached forest land poses a real challenge to the mangrove cell and other enforcement agencies. However, with this database, we will now have a strong tool and proof to verify the type of trees up to the species level,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell).N Mohan Karnat, former director, IWST and co-investigator of the project said, “This is exactly like the forensic analysis or DNA fingerprints for humans wherein even a small piece of wood can now be easily traced back to which species it is.”Maharashtra is home to 20 mangrove species spread over 320 sq km across six districts with close to 50% mangrove forests under government land declared as reserved forests while remaining areas fall under private land. Though mangroves are protected under various forest laws and the Bombay high court’s 2018 order banning the destruction of the trees, isolated cases of mangrove hacking, illegal transportation of timber, and encroachment on mangrove land are regularly reported.“Mangrove woods are illegally cut and used as fuelwood in many coastal areas,” said Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell) adding, “Due to limited information on wood anatomy of mangrove species, it becomes difficult to identify and differentiate them from non-mangrove species or mangrove associates in case of legal issues or during the basic investigation.”Apart from firewood, they are used for boat building, brick-burning and to make poles for various purposes including aquaculture among other uses. Tree barks are used in tanning industries since mangrove tree barks are rich in tannin.S Shashikala, project investigator, IWST explained that the wood structure varies for different species depending on the proportions, size and distribution of various cell elements like vessels, fibres, parenchyma and rays. “Our study not only helped to build an identification tool database but also helped to understand how the woody material could be used for value-added utilisation based on physical properties,” she said.For example, the wood of grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) and Indian mangrove (Avicennia officinalis) were anatomically inseparable except for different ray (cellular structures) heights. “Similarly, river mangrove (Aegiceras corniculatum) can be distinguished from other species by its small vessel size and higher vessel frequency, and woods of the Rhizophoreacea family (Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Ceriops) can be distinguished from other mangrove species by the presence of scalariform perforations in vessels,” said Shashikala adding that samples collected from Sindhudurg showed higher wood density and lower shrinkage (by volume) compared to wood from Thane or Mumbai districts.Data generated through this project is being summarised in the form of a book - Hand Book of Mangroves of Maharashtra: Morphology and Wood Anatomy – which is under publication. “Apart from identifying the cut mangrove wood, this study also provides a base for several researchers to understand the internal changes in the cell structure of mangrove wood due to changes in several environmental factors such as high salinity, lack of oxygen in sediment, diurnal tidal inundation etc.,” said Sheetal Pachpande, assistant director (projects), Mangrove Foundation and co-author of the book.Along with wood anatomical studies, other tools like molecular, DNA and chemical marker database are also to be used in forensic discrimination of timber species. “Following Maharashtra’s approach, other coastal states need to implement this in the advent of climate change and mangroves being the first line of defence,” said Karnat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-gets-india-s-first-wood-anatomical-database-for-mangrove-tree-species/story-7oArPFseldatOvbQNv0A2I.html

The police had booked Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal and Sandeep Lodha, CEO of OHHPL’s brand Weddingz.in, for alleged fraud and conspiracy. In court, they had argued that the dispute is purely civil in nature and the criminal case is an abuse of the process of law. While Gupta had alleged that fearing losses amid Covid, OHHPL ended a contract, Oyo is arguing in court that differences with the other party were over the appointment of an arbitrator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cheating-case-hc-stays-criminal-proceedings-stayed-against-oyo-top-management/story-xl3K1f1HXu35CdPQz7mlsI.html

07-10-2020||City||People who sought farmers’ votes are signing their death warrants: Abhay||The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) on Tuesday staged a protest against the newly enacted three farm legislations across its 14 headquarters in Haryana. INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala led the protest march in Sirsa and Fatehabad, while his son Arjun Chautala remained at the forefront in Bhiwani. The INLD leaders submitted memorandums to deputy commissioners in the name of President Ram Nath Kovind and Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya.Interacting with mediapersons in Sirsa, Abhay said the central government imposed three bills on farmers without their consent.“These three bills were introduced to hand over the farmers’ land and agriculture market to few crony capitalists. Instead of implementing the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission, the Union government forced these three farm laws on farmers. Those (Dushyant) who had sought the votes from farming community are now favouring these death warrants,” he added.The Ellenabad legislator said the ruling BJP-JJP state government cannot underestimate the anger of the farming community and people will teach them a lesson at the right time.“In coming days, the ruling party leaders will have to visit any village with cavalry, otherwise people will not allow them to enter. I am surprised few persons, who claim to be well-wishers of the farmers, are standing in the favour of these bills,” Abhay added.He urged his party workers to start canvassing for the Baroda bypoll. “People want to elect our nominee to save the state from the Congress and the BJP-JJP government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-who-sought-farmers-votes-are-signing-their-death-warrants-abhay/story-6yRFRgQSCvbMIk7XpCgTyO.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh employees’ housing scheme: CHB, urban planning dept to iron out differences||To break the deadlock over the new design proposals for the government employees’ housing scheme, Chandigarh Housing Board and the urban planning department will hold a meeting on Wednesday.The urban planning department has so far not accepted the fresh architectural proposals for the scheme, it has been learnt, the main objection being to the planned high-rise buildings.In order to reduce the rates of flats for the scheme, CHB hired a consultancy, which prepared new architectural plans for all possible options. Costing will be done once the design is finalised. Currently, CHB is working on two options: a seven-storey or a 10-storey housing block. “The latter will reduce the land needed for the scheme. As major cost of the project is because of the high price of land, reduction in land requirement will bring down the flats’ cost for applicants. But, so far, the planning department hasn’t agreed to it,” said a CHB official, requesting anonymity. The process to reassess and revise the cost of the project started after the August 19 meeting between the UT administration, employee representatives and the ministry of home affairs officials. The meeting was chaired by the Union home secretary. It was decided that the calculation of rates be made again for different categories of flats by applying various factors, such as floor area ratio, collector rate and plotted area, in consultation with the petitioners in the court case filed by the affected employees.Dr Dharminda, the representative and petitioner on behalf of the employees, said: “We have written to the UT adviser, requesting him to direct CHB to speed up the process of assessing revised prices. CHB had sought two weeks, but even after more than a month and a half, no information has been provided to us.”THE PROJECT: A LONG WAIT CHB was to build around 4,000 flats for government employees in Sectors 52, 53 and 56 as part of a scheme launched in 2008A draw of lots was held in 2010, in which 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around ₹57 croreLater, the scheme was shelved, but revived after the employees took up the matter with MP Kirron Kher But with the ministry of home affairs telling the administration to transfer the land to the CHB at the current collector rates, the prices shot upFrom ₹5.76 lakh to ₹34.7 lakh, depending on the flat category (A-D), the prices reached ₹50 lakh to ₹2.08 croreThe employees then moved the HC alleging that the CHB was charging multiple times the initial price||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-employees-housing-scheme-chb-urban-planning-dept-to-iron-out-differences/story-hjADK6w8GBGW0v5QRpwaAO.html

The civic body will mark boundaries of 13 koliwadas – Versova, Juhu, Charkop, Chimbai (Bandra) Gorai, Khardanda, Madh, Mahul, Malvani, Manori, Turbhe, Borivli, Bhatti – in DP 2034. Residents of koliwadas and gaothans (erstwhile villages) across Mumbai have been demanding special status for their villages by demarcating their boundaries in DP 2034, since it was sanctioned by BMC and sent to the state government for approval in 2018. Godfrey Pimenta, a city-based lawyer who has been following up with BMC, said, “As BMC had not marked boundaries of gaothans and koliwadas, they were considered slum settlements and could be redeveloped under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) schemes. With our follow-ups, now all gaothans and koliwadas will be marked in DP.” Koliwadas have characteristically small houses with narrow winding lanes. Without special mentions in DP, redevelopment would be challenging. If categorised as slum settlements, developers would get a higher floor space index (FSI) of 4, which determines how tall a building can be built on any land. BMC’s move comes a few months after it created Special Development Control Rules (SDCR) for gaothans and koliwadas, which gives them the freedom to decide what to do with their settlements, whether to preserve them, or opt for self-redevelopment or tie up with a developer, in which case they also have the option to sell excess inventory of flats in the market. BMC has now called for suggestions and objections for demarcating boundaries of these 13 koliwadas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-mark-boundaries-of-13-fishing-villages-in-mumbai-s-development-plan/story-KKdlEG3zvUr1u6SP9zxQ4L.html

07-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP corporators pulled up after their votes for Mumbai civic panel polls turn invalid||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to two of its corporators, Bindu Trivedi and Yogita Koli, seeking an explanation, after their votes to elect the chairperson of the education committee on Monday became invalid. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP’s group leader in BMC, confirmed the development. Both the corporators, who are members of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s education committee, raised their hands in support of the BJP candidate Surekha Patil, but signed against the name of Sena’s Sandhya Doshi, owing to which their votes were counted as invalid. When any member takes a dual stand, their vote is considered invalid during the counting. Trivedi and Koli said the error happened as their masks created moisture on their spectacles and hence they could not see the ballot paper clearly. Before the voting for committee elections takes place, the group leader of each political party issues a whip to the party corporators about voting, which every member is expected to follow. In the 26-member committee, Sena bagged 13 votes, while BJP managed to get only seven for the post. The BJP, which has nine members in the education committee, was expecting to get all the nine votes, but lost two of them after their candidates signed against the Sena candidate’s name. Four members of the Congress abstained from voting after their candidate Sangeeta Handore withdrew her candidature, while one member each of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) voted for the Sena to keep the BJP away from the power. When contacted Trivedi, BJP’s corporator from Ghatkopar, she said, “I am a party worker from the past 25 years. I had raised my hand for the BJP candidate, but there was a mistake on my part while signing. This was because a lot of moisture had developed on my spectacles, as I was wearing a mask.” Patil, BJP’s Malad corporator, also had the same explanation. “It was not done deliberately, but was a genuine mistake and I will submit my reply over it,” she said. On Monday, Sena also won the post of the standing committee chairperson after Yashwant Jadhav won the seat for the third time. On Tuesday, Sena’s Sadanand Parab won for the elections for the chairperson’s post for the 26-member improvement committee after securing 13 votes. BJP’s Vinod Mishra bagged nine votes. Congress’s Javed Juneja withdrew his candidature and three members of the Congress abstained from voting, even as one BJP member was absent. Meanwhile, in the 17-member Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST), Shiv Sena’s Pravin Shinde received eight votes for the chairperson’s post, while BJP candidate Prakash Gangadhare bagged eight votes. Congress’s Ravi Raja withdrew his candidature and abstained from voting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-corporators-pulled-up-by-party-after-their-votes-for-mumbai-civic-panel-polls-turn-invalid-duo-claim-they-were-unable-to-see-names-because-of-masks/story-z4eL6xiuJwwam7MLvl3gyL.html

07-10-2020||City||Police turn water cannons on protesting farmers in Sirsa||Police on Tuesday resorted to using water cannons and tear gas to disperse the farmers heading towards the houses of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and his grand uncle Ranjit Chautala in Sirsa, seeking their resignation from the Manohar Lal Khattar government over the recently enacted three farm legislations. Situation turned tense when few protesters sustained injuries after some ‘unidentified’ persons pelted them with stones. A stand-off continued for three hours between the police and protesters. “A former BJP leader, who fought election as an Independent from Sirsa, tried to break the barricades and defame our agitation. The police failed to take any action against him,” said Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, who in the evening sat on an indefinite dharna near Dushyant’s house. Bharatiya Kisan union (BKU) state chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief Baljit Singh Daduwal also took part in the daytime march, which was stopped by the police near Dushyant’s house in the heart of Sirsa city. Heavy force was deployed in Sirsa city and 12 deputy commissioners were tasked with maintaining law and order. Few protesters also said that they were canecharged, a claim denied by the police. Swaraj India chief said farmers from two dozen organisations had taken part in the protest to seek the resignations of Dushyant and Ranjit, who is also the state power and jails minister in the BJP-JJP government. “The farmers have clearly asked the duo to choose whether they want to stay with them or the BJP government in Haryana. They can enjoy power for four years if they opt for the BJP, but the upcoming generations of farmers will never forgive them for supporting these death warrants,” he added.Meanwhile, Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, also reached Sirsa, but the farmers’ unions urged him not to share the stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-turn-water-cannons-on-protesting-farmers-in-sirsa/story-spS4Se2eqXDg5HlsA6B9oJ.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Transportation of grains from Punjab comes to a halt as farmers continue blockade of railway tracks||The transportation of foodgrains from Punjab to other states has come to a standstill with the farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agriculture laws blocking nearly all the major rail routes in the state. The situation is such that grain stocks in the state are piling up with the stock of rice and wheat touching 215 lakh tonne. It would be a tough task for the state agencies to manage the pile-up as fresh paddy crop, for which the procurement has already begun, is already reaching the storage points. Nearly 170 lakh tonne paddy is expected to arrive in the mandis for procurement in October and November. Currently, 147 lakh tonne wheat and 68 lakh tonne rice is stored in the state’s godowns. “Since the farmers are blocking 35 major rail routes in the state, it is tough for us to reach the storage points,” said an officer of Food Corporation of India (FCI). “Before the farmers’ protests began on September 24, the FCI was booking 35 freight trains carrying wheat and paddy from Punjab to other states daily. One train carries 2,600 tonnes. But now, not more than 2-3 trains are moving out. At times, there is none,” he added. “Hopefully, the movement of grains will resume once the protests are lifted,” said director (food and civil supplies) Anindita Mitra. PSPCL raises an alarm over depleting coal stockThe Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has raised an alarm that the coal supply in three privately owned thermal power plants at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and Goindwal Sahib would last only 5 to 6 days. “The PSPCL-owned plants at Lehra Mohabbut and Rupnagar have sufficient supplies,” said Jatinder Goyal, who holds charge of director generation. “A large number of trains carrying coal are in transit and are parked outside Punjab. These trains would reach the thermal stations once the farmers remove blockade from the railway tracks,” said Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/transportation-of-grains-from-punjab-comes-to-a-halt-as-farmers-continue-blockade-of-railway-tracks/story-s9ObzA0QvLo8ExFInb6KAO.html

Registrations to Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) 2020 begin at 10am Tuesday, and the first seat allotment list will be released on October 17, 2020.As per information shared by IIT-Delhi, the organising institute for 2020, the total number of students who qualified for admissions this year stands at 43,204 as compared to 38,705 students who qualified for admissions last year.The cut-off for the general category has been reduced to 17.5% from last year’s 25%, while that for scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) is 8.75%, down from last year’s 12.5%. The qualifying score for the general-EWS and OBC-NCL categories is at 15.75% this year, lower than the 22.5% last year.This year, the total intake capacity of 23 IITs has risen by 2,500 seats. From 13,583 last year, the intake capacity stands at 16,053 this year. In 2018, the intake capacity across IITs stood at 11,279.Last year too, the qualifying criteria was lowered by 5-10% in every category. A senior official from Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) 2019 has confirmed that the reason behind lowering cut-offs in 2019 was a request from the Centre to qualify at least twice the number of students than the number of seats. “Every year seats in IITs go vacant even after seven-seat allocation rounds, so for the past two years, IITs have been trying to include more students in the seat allocation rounds to give more students a chance at vying for the same seat,” said the official on condition of anonymity.In a press statement released on Monday, IIT -Delhi confirmed that of the 1.5 lakh students who appeared for the exam on September 27, around 43,204 had qualified. This includes 18,028 in the general/open category, 9,349 in the other backward class-non creamy layer (OBC-NCL) category, 5,140 in general economically weaker section (GEN-EWS) category, 7,869 and 2,818 in scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) categories respectively.Of the total students who qualified for the exam, 36,497 are male candidates and 6,707 are female candidates.“Criteria for inclusion in the rank list depends on the aggregate marks of a student calculated on the basis of marks obtained in mathematics, physics and chemistry. Candidates have to satisfy the subject-wise as well as the aggregate qualifying marks to be included in a rank list,” highlighted the statement released by IIT-Delhi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/qualifying-criteria-lowered-this-year-more-students-to-aim-for-iits/story-7Cvsvx2haCzE5RwUJQsTQP.html

Apart from enactment of the much-promised law to fast track justice in cases of crimes against women within 21 days on the lines of Andhra Pradesh’s Disha Act, the stakeholders, during a meeting with Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday also demanded for installation of CCTVs, a dedicated police force at local level and speedier action in cybercrimes. Deshmukh met elected women representatives, officer-bearers of women cells of ruling parties and organisations representing women on Tuesday to discuss steps to be taken to keep cases of crime against women in check. During the meeting, the home department made a presentation and stated that Maharashtra ranked eighth in the country in crimes against women, though it was the second largest populous state. “According to the presentation made by the police department before us, the recently released NCRB data has revealed that Maharashtra has the third most number of rape cases in the country, but in overall cases of crimes against women, the state ranks eighth. The conviction rate in these cases has improved in the past few years and the number of cases has reduced. The number of the women police personnel and officials deployed is on the rise, the department said during the presentation. The women representatives gave their suggestions and demanded that they be implemented in a time-bound manner,” said an official from the department, who was present at the meeting. Some of the prominent politicians who attended the meeting were Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) parliamentarian Supriya Sule, legislative Council’s deputy chairperson Neelam Gorhe, Congress’s women wing chief Charulata Tokas and Shiv Sena legislators Manisha Kayande and Yamini Jadhav. In response to the demand for a law on the lines of the Disha Act, Deshmukh said that the draft is ready and being studied by the sub-committee appointed for it. He said that the bill would be introduced at the earliest. Gorhe demanded for suo motu action by the police in cybercrimes against women. “The police should take suo motu action on objectionable materials on social media hurting the dignity of women. Section 66A of the Information Technology Act dealing with cybercrimes should be made non-bailable. Immediate assistance and guidance in cases of rape, domestic violence and molestation is important and dedicated contact numbers and email ids of the senior officers should be published for such cases,” she said. Some of the leaders called for the constitution of protection committees in local bodies and more recruitment of women in the police force. “We were told that there are 29,000 women in the state police force of 2.33 lakh personnel. Deshmukh said that their endeavour is to take the percentage of the women personnel to 30% to match the reserved positions meant in recruitments. We were also told that police help can be reached within 10 minutes on complaints made to the dedicated helpline – 112,” said Vidya Chavan, former legislator from NCP. Tokas said that she has called for the inclusion of the information about the legal remedies in the crime against women in school and college syllabus. During the meeting Vishwas Nangare Patil, joint police commissioner (law and order), Mumbai, shared his experience of how police’s special squads in plain clothes were deputed to nab offenders, at spots with high cases of eve-teasing in Nashik, where he served as commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hathras-case-women-leaders-ask-maharashtra-home-minister-to-bring-law-similar-to-disha-act-call-for-speedier-action-in-cybercrimes-more-cctvs/story-lTB0wIfOAEr35iLsgUmnYN.html

While a gram sabha is an assembly of the village voters to discuss the local governance and development issues, a panchayat is an elected body headed by sarpanch and panchayat members. The 31 farmers unions and labourer unions leading the agitation against the Centre’s move had urged the village panchayats to pass such resolutions. There were more than 13,000 panchayats across the state. The maximum resolutions were passed in the Ludhiana district (80), followed by Kapurthala (50), Sangrur (40), Mansa (24) and Faridkot (10) among othersBut not many gram sabhas passed resolutions in the Majha region.In the resolutions, the gram sabhas termed the agriculture laws as anti-farmer as growers will be forced to sell their produce to private traders who will pay them less.In its resolution, the Dhurkot gram sabhas in Faridkot district said they will intensify the stir if the Centre does not repeal the laws and also urged to boycott the Reliance Group fuel stations. It announced to impose Rs 2,000 fine on those not adhering to the diktat.Gurmail Singh, sarpanch of Gharanchon village in Sangrur district, said they will send the resolution to the Central government to convey their displeasure over the new legislations.

The HC bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice HS Sidhu observed that the ecology and environment of the area would be affected drastically if the parks are converted into residential area. “The residents of the society have a fundamental right to free air and enjoy the public amenities. It was expected from the respondents to evict the illegal encroachers from the public land instead of nullifying the orders passed by this court from time to time by converting the park into residential areas. The respondents are bound to preserve and save the open spaces. Every citizen has a fundamental right to fresh air,” it said. The bench was responding to a plea by Jan Kalyan Samiti, a local society from the town, which had alleged that two public parks in NIT Faridabad were encroached upon and slums, houses, and workshops came up in an unauthorised manner. In 2006, the HC was approached, which directed to clear the area. However, instead of that, the government decided to build residential complexes in that area, the counsel, Deepender Singh, said. The HC, while seeking response by November 19 and asking authorities not to proceed further, observed that it is evident that parks were carved out as per the master plan. However, with the passage of time, these were encroached upon and authorities, instead of clearing it as directed by the court, opted to convert parks into residential areas. With this, both government approval to convert park into residential areas and further action of local MC inviting objections, have been stayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coversion-of-parks-into-residential-complex-citizens-have-fundamental-right-to-fresh-air-says-hc/story-gFL4a7ghWzUOh75t96m3uJ.html

More than 5 lakh tonne legacy waste is dumped at the Dadumajra dumping ground, and an additional 25,000 tonne is lying at the processing plant there. The lack of waste segregation at source was one of the major disputes between the MC and the private firm that was earlier running the plant.The civic body had drawn a lot of flak after a report of the Centre for Science and Environment on Solid Waste Management released by the Swachh Bharat Mission revealed that the MC had claimed 100% waste segregation at source in 24 of the 26 wards in the city.The report stated that against 479 tonne waste produced in the city in a day, 455 tonne was processed daily. However, in reality, only 120 tonne is being processed.‘Segregation to start soon’MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “Our plan is to start segregation by the end of this month. As soon as we get 390 additional waste segregation vehicles, we will begin 100% segregation at source. A meeting of the Chandigarh Smart City Limited board has been scheduled for October 15 to finalise it.”Currently, the civic body has 100 waste segregation vehicles, but many of these couldn’t be used because the segregation drive failed to kick off in many sectors.“The NGT panel has its own deadlines, but if we face practical problems, we explain the situation to them,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ensure-100-waste-segregation-by-oct-31-ngt-panel-to-chandigarh-mc/story-9144dfLUSYZWiWYIx0D7VK.html

The notice was issued in 2017. Kartik is son of Murari Lal Tayal, who, along with former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has been named by CBI in the scam. Allegations are that their action caused wrongful loss of nearly ₹1,500 crore to the land owners in four villages, including Manesar in Gurugram, while availing a windfall gain for themselves and several real-estate builders. Kartik, too, was named in the FIR as accused. He had told the court that he had to go abroad for medical treatment and the lookout notice is ‘fettering’ his right to travel abroad. It was also told that he has not been arrested till date and has joined the investigation whenever called to do so. The court observed that the conditions for lookout notice, such as preventing arrest, are not met in the case in hand and Kartik has gone abroad and returned on six occasions. The continuation of a lookout notice for more than three years against the petitioner is a violation of his fundamental right to life and personal liberty, the court said, asking CBI to withdraw the same. However, Kartik was asked to furnish an undertaking before the investigating officer concerned that he would present himself whenever required by the investigating agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manesar-land-acquisition-case-cbi-asked-to-withdraw-lookout-notice-for-ex-haryana-officer-s-son/story-2G2ESYiJccHar6kKipx3YI.html

Her family has alleged that her health deteriorated because the authorities of the school where she was employed forced her to report to work despite the woman being unwell. In August, the teacher was tested positive for the virus. After she recovered, the school principal insisted her to report to work, owing to which she fell ill again in September and died of Covid-19 said her relative. “She is survived by her husband and three children – the youngest being a 15-year- old. Her husband conducts private tuitions, which is not running well since the lockdown was imposed. For the family, she was the sole earning member. Due to the insistence of the school to report to duty, she could not recover completely. She was also on Covid-19 survey duty for three months and had hardly received any rest or care,” said the relative. Despite various attempts, the school principal was not available for comment. However, one of the teachers from the school said, “As soon as the authorities came to know that she was tested positive, they put up a notice that the school will remain shut for 10 days. As per the announcement, we have to report to work from October 12. But there is no pending work in school and we can conduct online classes from home.” The Maharashtra Shikshan Kranti Sanghatana, a group for school employees, has requested the state to register a case of culpable homicide against the school authorities for the teacher’s death. “Despite the work-from-home guidelines, the teachers, who had completed the Covid-19 survey duty, was forced to go to school regularly. Even if they did not have any official work, the teachers had to be present in schools for conducting online classes. These teachers would make travel by public transport to reach their respective schools, posing a health risk for the entire staff. Hence, we demand a case of culpable homicide against the school,” said Sudhir Ghagas, secretary of the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-teacher-dies-of-covid-19-relative-alleges-school-forced-her-to-report-to-work-despite-she-being-unwell/story-BLmyLA0ZWEdwpZPoEWNgGP.html
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Child marriages in Maharashtra surge by 78.3% amid lockdown as families reel under poverty||The Covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse repercussion on the lives of hundreds of teenage girls across Maharashtra. Data from the state’s women and child development (WCD) department has revealed that child marriages in the state have increased by 78.3% until September this year as compared to the same period in 2019. Last year, WCD had managed to stop 120 child marriages in the state. This year, the department has rescued 214 teenage girls from marriage. Experts have attributed the spike to the growing poverty owing to the lockdown imposed to control the spread of the virus, which has forcing girls out of schools and into work or marriage. “Child marriage is considered as one of the reasons for early pregnancy and malnutrition among children. We have instructed the child protection committees to be more vigilant about such incidences,” said the state WCD secretary IA Kundan. Activists believe that the numbers are just the tip of the iceberg, as numerous ceremonies have gone unreported owing to the strict lockdown measures, limitations on gatherings and law enforcement bodies such as the police being busy on Covid-19 and lockdown-related duties. According to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, child marriage is illegal in India and the marriage of girls below 18 years and boys below 21 is a punishable offence. The maximum number of cases has been reported from 17 districts of the state – Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nanded, Ahmednagar, Latur, Buldhana, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nashik, Solapur, Osmanabad, Kolhapur, Sangli and Washim. In June, the state government imposed a 50-people cap on wedding receptions, which made ceremonies extremely economical for poor farmers. It has been observed that since then, the incidents of child marriage have surged. Until June, there were 76 child marriage cases that were reported, but in the following three months, 138 new incidents were reported. “Though farmers are poor, they spend most of their savings on marrying off their daughters as per social demands. As it became less expensive [owing to the cap on members who can participate in gatherings], farmers are taking advantage of it,” said Sudhir Tupe from non-governmental organisation (NGO) Lokkalyan Charitable Trust in Satara district. He also works with Childline, a pan-India NGO that works for the welfare of children. Since June, Tupe’s organisation alone has received more than 50 tip-offs about child marriages. According to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), almost half of all child brides worldwide live in South Asia, with one in three being from India. “In India, the median age at first marriage is 19.7 years for women in the richest quintile compared to 15.4 for the poorest women,” states a UNICEF report. This month, another NGO, Save the Children, published a study which stated Covid-19 would globally put 2.5 million more girls at risk of early marriage by 2025. Sanjay Sharma, deputy director-programme management (West) of the NGO, said that due to the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers have gone back to their native places. This has given a wide opportunity to the girls’ families to find prospective grooms. “Due to the fear of spreading the infection, the central government has instructed to close down orphanages. Thus, we had to hand over the girls to their distant relatives who often consider them as unwanted. To shy away from their duties, they are marrying off the girls discreetly,” he said. Maharashtra has a large number of sugarcane factories where many unemployed migrants look for jobs. But factory owners prefer couples over single individuals. “This has become one of the reasons for migrant labourers getting married the girls,” said Sharma. Advocate Varsha Deshpande from the National Commission for Women, who works in Marathwada region, said as migrants have returned, the girls’ fathers are getting them married for their safety and to avoid their daughters falling in love against their wishes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-child-marriages-in-maharahtra-surge-by-78-as-families-reel-under-poverty/story-fo3hE2V72YiIj4Gn6wUs0N.html
07-10-2020||City||Farmers of Hindustan know how to fight: Rahul in Kurukshetra||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the newly enacted farm laws will take away the jobs of lakhs of people associated with the mandi system. Terming the new laws a ‘direct attack’ on farmers, the Wayanad MP, during his ‘Kheti Bachao Yatra’ that reached Haryana’s Kurukshetra in the evening, said, “By enacting these laws, the Prime Minister wants to enable the big corporate houses to take the entire agriculture business over.”“Modi ji, if you think that farmers cannot fight due to the pandemic, you are mistaken. You do not know the farmers of Hindustan. They know how to fight,” said Rahul, who was joined by Haryana’s former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress unit president Kumari Selja. “Procurement, MSP and food security are interlinked. Entire system will collapse and lakhs of people will be left jobless if this chain is broken,” he added. “If the BJP is to be believed, these bills are supposed to help farmers. Then why the farmers of this country are out on roads, agitating over these bills? Why were these bills introduced during the Covid-19 crisis and why there was no discussion in the parliament?” he asked. ‘Modi is a coward’Firing his final and sharpest salvo before wrapping his visit up, Rahul dubbed PM Narendra Modi a ‘coward’ while attacking him over the India-China standoff in the Ladakh theatre. “India is the only country in the world where army of another country entered, encroached upon its land, and killed its soldiers, but our coward Prime Minister says that there was no infiltration...” he said at a Kurukshetra grain market. “Desh ki zameen hadpi gayi hai aur yeh (prime minister) apne aap ko deshbhakt kehte hain,” he quipped. The former Congress president, who also visited Jyotisar and offered prayers, said, “This PM didn’t even know the strength of Indian Army, Indian farmers and labourers. He only focuses on building his image.” ‘Will repeal these laws within 10 days of coming in power’Rahul assured the farmers that these three laws will be abolished within 10 days of formation of the Congress government. He said during six years’ rule, Modi government not only failed to do anything for the poor, “but also inflicted several wounds in the form of demonetisation, GST and now, these farm bills”. Earlier, Rahul accused PM Modi of wasting taxpayers’ money. He said that PM Modi bought the Air India One because he saw that his friend US President Donald Trump has the Air Force One. Convoy stopped at Haryana borderHigh drama was witnessed on the Haryana-Punjab border from where Rahul Gandhi’s convoy was set to enter the state. Haryana Police stopped the Congress leaders and supporters, citing the ban on gathering of more than 100 people. “They have stopped us on a bridge on the Haryana border. I’m not moving and am happy to wait here. 1 hour, 5 hours, 24 hours, 100 hours, 1000 hours or 5000 hours (sic),” the former Congress president posted on Twitter. A small contingent was, however, allowed to enter Haryana after a protest and sloganeering by Congress workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-of-hindustan-know-how-to-fight-rahul-in-kurukshetra/story-8Jk76SyVjh8mwGICf8C7TM.html
07-10-2020||City||Sero survey: 41-60 age group in Mumbai most exposed to coronavirus||City residents in the age group of 41-60 years have been most exposed to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to results of the second round of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) serological survey conducted in Mumbai in August. The age group is followed by those above 60 years living in slums. Meanwhile, exposure has been the least in case of those older than 60 years who live in non-slums. A sero survey is a study of how many people have antibodies (Immunoglobulin-G) against Sars-Cov-2 in their blood, indicating these people may have been silently infected and recovered, helping map the trend and spread of infection. BMC tested 3,022 slum residents and 2,174 non-slum residents from all age groups, selected randomly from three wards – R-North (Dahisar, Borivli), M-West (Chembur), F-North (Dadar, Matunga, Wadala) – in the second half of August, under round two of the survey. This round revealed that 45% of slum residents and 18% non-slum residents who were tested were exposed to Sars-Cov-2. The earlier round too was conducted in the same three wards in July. The idea is to understand the trend over the months. A civic officer from BMC’s health department said, “Senior citizens living in non-slum areas are hardly venturing out to buy groceries or interact with the community and hence are more protected. Whereas senior citizens who live in slums have shown considerable exposure to the virus, as their homes are small, and people interact with each other. Overall, the age group of people who work, or are more likely to step out for chores, go for a walk, meet friends, is 41-60 years. Also, 25-40 age group has shown increased exposure. In non-slum areas, even those who are less than 24 years of age have shown exposure maybe due to fluidity of movement in the community.” According to the report on results of round two (HT has a copy), the positivity rate of exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in the 41-60 age group in slum residents is the highest at 50.3%. Similarly, in case of non-slum residents, the highest positivity rate is in the same age group, at 18.6%. In case of slum residents, second-highest exposure is seen among those above 60 years (48.2%), followed by 25-40 years (42.2%) and 12-24 years (40.8%). In case of non-slum residents, people in the 41-60 age group are followed by 12-24 age group (18.5%), and 25-40 (16.6%). The exposure in case of senior citizens living in non-slums is 13.2%. Moreover, women have shown marginally more exposure than men – 46.2% of the 1,405 women in slums showed exposure, while 44.4% of the 1,619 men were positive. In case of non-slum residents, 17.6% of the 721 women showed exposure, while 16.7% of the 1,452 men showed exposure. Mumbai on Tuesday recorded 1,625 new cases and 47 deaths due to Covid-19. The total number of cases has now gone up to 217,113, and total deaths to 9,202. Mumbai has 26,003 active cases as of Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sero-survey-41-60-age-group-in-mumbai-most-exposed-to-coronavirus/story-UnLcJdRLPFVLuwOiXpeQ6I.html

The state also reported 370 deaths, pushing the toll to 38,717.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 1,625 fresh infections in the city, taking its tally to 217,113. Mumbai also reported 47 fatalities, taking its toll to 9,202.The state now has 247,023 active cases. With 17,141 patients discharged on Tuesday, the tally of recovered went to 1,179,726. The state’s recovery rate improved to 80.48%.State health minister Rajesh Tope told HT that the Covid-19 situation in the state is “stabilising” and that the state is reaching a “plateau”. Over the past nine days, the state has recorded a relatively lower number of cases, compared to previous weeks.However, the number of tests conducted between September 28 and October 5 has seen a substantial dip in the figures in comparison to its previous week between September 20 and September 27. Tope said that though the average testing has seen a dip, the positivity rate has remained around the overall rate.Between September 28 and October 5, according to the health department data, 604,238 samples were tested. The previous week — between September 20 and September 27 — 779,502 samples were tested. Between September 12 and September 19, 713,626 samples were tested. The average number of tests conducted between September 28 and October 5 was 75,529, while it was 97,437 the previous week.“We have asked the [districts] to increase testing. Some of the districts are testing lower [samples]. We will ask them to increase tracing and testing. Our intention is to take it up to 1.50 lakh tests daily. Even if the testing has reduced, the positivity rate has remained the overall rate,” Tope said. A total of 7,241,376 tests have been conducted till date and the positivity rate recorded is 20.24%.The minister said, “We are seeing lower cases daily. The situation is stabilising here and we are reaching a plateau.” A health department official said that the decline in cases is a “positive” sign. He added that areas such as Nagpur, Nashik, Pune have been recording fewer cases compared to a fortnight ago. “With further unlock and the upcoming festive season could create some spike in daily cases, but it is not expected to get out of control,” the official said. Tope, meanwhile, added that they are “hopeful” that the surge would not be big during the festive season.Even as there is a gradual decline in fresh cases, deaths are mounting in the state. Maharashtra is inching towards the grim landmark of 40,000 deaths due to Covid-19, and could breach it this week. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.64%.Meanwhile, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (excluding Mumbai) reported 1,915 fresh infections and 41 deaths. Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and Pune rural saw 674, 444 and 620 new infections, respectively. Pune saw 17 deaths, while its rural areas reported 10 deaths. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported four fatalities.Nagpur city reported 537 new cases and 17 deaths, while its rural area reported 217 new cases and seven fatalities. Nashik city saw 515 fresh infections and 14 deaths, while its rural areas reported 154 new cases and 15. Satara district crossed 40,000 cases with 774 fresh cases, taking its tally to 40,529.

07-10-2020||Delhi||Ashram Chowk: Snarls, noise, now dust||Residents near Ashram Chowk, already forced to live with vehicular emissions, snarls and noise pollution round the clock, are now being choked by dust pollution, which they say has gotten worse over the past five months. Naseema (55), who has lived near the busy intersection on the Delhi-Mathura Road -- one of the busiest arterial roads in the national capital -- for over 18 years, said she is finding it difficult to breathe these days. Since the past five months, a thin patina of dust has settled on every corner of her house and remains impervious to her attempts to clean it. “It is difficult to breathe and it will only get worse. There is so much dust that I have to clean my house three times a day,” said Naseema, while adding that winter is coming -- a season when Delhi’s air quality touches alarming lows owing to local emissions, weather conditions and stubble burning in neighbouring states, among other factors.Much of the dust, residents say, is due to the ongoing underpass construction at the intersection that started in January this year. The public works department (PWD) is building the underpass to ease traffic at this junction, which is an important link between central and south Delhi and the satellite towns of Noida and Faridabad. The Delhi Police estimates that at least 11,600 vehicles cross the intersection every hour. Work on the underpass was moving at a snail’s pace since it started -- first due to the Delhi assembly elections, then the north-east Delhi riots and then the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. But once the restrictions were eased in May, work is on in full swing, a senior PWD official said.Lokesh Kumar, a security guard deployed at the gate of NAFED’s building, said hardly any measure is being taken to control the dust at the underpass site.“I shudder each time a bus crosses the intersection as it throws up a plume of dust. There are only a few mounds of debris and sand kept covered there. Everything else is open and strewn about. Even water sprinkling does not happen regularly,” Kumar said.A senior PWD official, on condition of anonymity, said the contractor of the project has been asked to ensure all dust-control measures are undertaken. “Last week, we received complaints of high dust pollution in the area. So, we directed the contractor to comply with all norms or face action. A slew of measures was taken after that and debris along the intersection were covered up,” the official claimed.Also Read | Ashram crossing descends into chaos; commuters, residents sufferAnumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said with measures already being taken to contain pollution hot spots, there are several stretches whose condition is similar to that of Ashram Chowk -- heavy dust pollution has been reported from these places, either owing to unpaved roads or from ongoing construction work. “Dust-control norms are the most basic of measures that agencies need to take while undertaking any work. The government needs to make construction agencies accountable by making it mandatory in the contract itself to take dust control and soil stabilisation measures as well as having a post-construction restoration strategy. Also, there has to be strong surveillance and monitoring to ensure that norms are not flouted. A system has to be put in place for this,” she said. Roychowdhury said instead of building more roads and flyovers, what the government needs to focus on is the reduction of traffic volume. “It is a global experience that any capacity enhancement for traffic ( new roads, bridges) will quickly be saturated. This means that it is a losing battle. The government has to work on reducing traffic volume by scaling up public transport, putting in place a parking policy and creating pedestrian and cycling spaces on an urgent basis,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ashram-chowk-snarls-noise-now-dust/story-kDJQ4yHqX1JctH3ZGMKIeP.html

It became difficult for us to breathe, and the smoke is still visible at 10:30pm.”Gupta said every few months, fire breaks out at the dumping ground, and the authorities need to look into the reason. Similar incidents were reported in 2016, 2017 and 2018 as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fire-erupts-at-dadumajra-dumping-ground-in-chandigarh/story-7SdtOJYjza6Az5VlE41X2L.html
07-10-2020||Delhi||Traffic to be restricted at Ashram Chowk towards Bhogal for two nights till Thursday||With the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) carrying out urgent repair works on a pipeline leak at the Ashram Chowk, the Delhi traffic police has restricted vehicular movement from Ashram Chowk towards Bhogal on the Delhi-Mathura Road between 10pm and 6.30am from Tuesday until Thursday. The restriction will be in effect for two nights (Tuesday and Wednesday). “These restrictions will be in place from 10pm to 6.30am, Tuesday to Thursday,” said SD Mishra, additional commissioner of police (southern traffic range). While the stretch will be shut to traffic during this period, all commercial vehicles and buses going towards Ashram flyover from the Badarpur side of the Mathura road, will be diverted from CRRI to the Modi Mill flyover and onwards, police said. From there, vehicles are expected to take a U-turn below the Kalkaji flyover, go on to Captain Gaur Marg and then onto the Ring Road to cross the Ashram flyover. “If the traffic at the Ashram Chowk is not high during these hours, we may even allow commercial vehicles up to the intersection,” said Mishra. Private vehicles, Mishra said, can take a right from Ashram Chowk to go on to the Barapullah flyover and from there to Lala Lajpat Rai Marg. They can, alternatively, take a left turn from Ashram Chowk to Moolchand and from there a right to get onto Lala Lajpat Rai Marg, the officer added. The traffic officer said diversions were required to repair a pipeline leakage on Mathura Road as part of the ongoing work on the underpass there. The Delhi Jal Board is working to fix the leak, he said. “The leakage is causing a portion of the road to slowly cave in, and that is further causing more potholes. All these are hindering the smooth flow of traffic. To prevent further deterioration of the road, the DJB will be carrying out urgent repairs,” Mishra said. A senior DJB official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The PWD, which is doing construction work here asked us to shift the water and sewer lines in the area this August. Now that the PWD has started digging work and some traffic is also plying on the road, the lines get damaged every now and then and need to be repaired urgently, which is why the stretch has to be blocked. Ideally, the shifting of lines must be done before starting the digging work, but it was delayed due to Covid restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-to-be-restricted-at-ashram-chowk-towards-bhogal-for-two-nights-till-thursday/story-sRmQoBXGjU0ZsJmBDIaanO.html
07-10-2020||Gurugram||3 sharpshooters held after shoot-out in Sohna; 2 policemen injured||Three sharpshooters of a gang were arrested by the crime branch after a brief chase and alleged crossfiring in Sohna on Tuesday evening. At least 25 bullets were exchanged during the chase in which two gang members and two policemen suffered gunshot wounds. The injured were rushed to the civil hospital in Sohna for treatment, where their condition is stable, said the police. Two pistols, two revolvers, a countrymade gun, 110 live cartridges, a backpack, and a motorcycle were recovered from the possession of the suspects. The police said two more policemen were shot at but they escaped injuries since they were wearing bulletproof vests. According to the police, the crime branch of Sector 39 received a tip-off that three sharpshooters of Sube Gujjar’s gang would arrive in Sohna to allegedly murder a property dealer in Dhunela on Tuesday. Following this information, two teams were formed. The police noticed three suspects arriving on a motorcycle on Nangli road in Sohna. Upon spotting police presence, the rider reversed the motorcycle, arousing suspicion and the police started chasing them in a car. During the chase, one of the pillion riders fired several gunshots at the police car. In retaliatory fire from the police, one pillion rider was shot in the leg and, as a result, the motorcycle lost balance and fell on the road. The second pillion rider’s foot got caught underneath the motorcycle. Both the suspects were caught while they were trying to flee. The motorcycle driver escaped on foot and fired several gunshots at sub-inspector(SI) Raj Kumar, who was leading the raid, and his team. Two policemen, head constables Suneel and Abhilash, were hit on their arms respectively in the crossfire and were taken to civil hospital. Two bullets hit SI Kumar on his chest while one bullet hit ASI Adesh, but both escaped unhurt since they were wearing bulletproof vests. The third suspect was asked surrender but when he continued to fire at policemen, the police returned fire and he was shot in the leg, following which he was nabbed. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “The suspects — Rajesh alias Fauji, Kamal alias Kamli and Aman — are sharpshooters of Sube Gujjar’s gang. The police had received an input that they would be targeting a property dealer in Dhunela. Rajesh alias Fauji is a bad character — a person with a history of crime — of Sadar police station and is accused in at least 18 criminal cases, including murder, robbery and dacoity. The other two are also accused in several criminal cases in Nuh, Palwal and Gurugram.” The suspects have been admitted to civil hospital in Sohna and would be questioned after they are taken into custody. The nature of injuries is not serious, said police. Sube Gujjar, a gangster who is accused in several cases, is on the run since 2018. He has a reward of ₹5 lakh for information leading to his arrest. Police commissioner K K Rao has announced a cash reward of ₹2 lakh and a certificate of appreciation for the crime branch unit of Sector 39. A case was registered against the suspects under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Sohna City police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-sharpshooters-held-after-shoot-out-in-sohna-two-policemen-injured/story-AihPsoMPF0YwADMz2j6vLL.html
07-10-2020||Gurugram||Housing sales sees slight recovery, but long way to go for normalcy||Real estate markets that have been reeling under the effects of Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown have started showing green shoots of recovery in the third quarter of the calendar year (July, August and September). Housing sales and new launch figures, as per a report released by real estate consultancy Anarock, were better in the third quarter as compared to previous three months of the lockdown. The recently released report by Anarock also says that the top seven cities in the country saw the sales of 29,520 housing units between July and September of 2020 as compared to 12,730 units in the previous three months. However, in comparison to last year, the sales are still quite muted and experts admitted that it would take a few more quarters before things become normal.As per data, saleS in July, August and September, 2019, stood at 55,080 units across the top seven markets of Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune.The report said that Delhi-NCR saw the sale of 52,00 units from July to September this year as against 9830 units sold in the same period in 2019. The supply of new residential units, however, increased during this period in NCR and stood at 6,810 units as compared to 5,790 units during the same period of 2019.Compared to last year, the sale of residential units from January to September stood at 15,450 units in 2020, which is less than half of 36,210 units that were sold in the same period in 2019.Realtors and brokers based in Gurugram said that they received more queries in the last few months and more sales were converted as buyers finally decided to take the plunge. Prashant Solomon, managing director, Chintels, said, “End users and serious buyers with capacity to invest are coming back to the market and this augurs well for the industry,” he said.The report further said that despite the steep rise in Covid-19 cases, periodic local lockdowns imposed across states and the ‘shradh’ period during which many people avoid new purchases, sales of residential units and new launches have seen reasonable momentum. The April-June quarter was more of an outlier with most activity at a standstill, it added.Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock property consultants, said, “MMR, Bengaluru, NCR and Pune together accounted for 84 percent sales in the July-Sept quarter. MMR saw maximum sales of 9,200 units, followed by Bengaluru with 5,400 units, NCR with 5,200 units and Pune with 4,850 units.”City-based developers said that incentives offered by them and rock-bottom home loan interest rates are a major attraction for homebuyers. “The figures indicate that sales during the festive season are likely to be higher as the sentiment is improving with opening of the economy and people are returning to their jobs in cities,” said Pradeep Aggarwal, CMD, Signature Developers. He said that a large number of new buyers are those who stayed in rented properties and now want to buy their own houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/housing-sales-sees-slight-recovery-but-long-way-to-go-for-normalcy/story-c0l2BfbGy68wJdyCipnzVJ.html
07-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s second Covid wave has already peaked: Arvind Kejriwal||With the number of daily new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city dropping consistently since its mid-September peak, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the “second wave” of the infections had already peaked, and the situation in the Capital was under control.“The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is under control now. The peak of the second wave of infections was witnessed on September 17, when around 4,500 cases were recorded. With time, the number of fresh cases have gone down even with the high number of tests being done. Similarly, the occupancy of hospital beds that had gone up to about 7,200 has dropped again to 5,500. The occupancy in ICUs has reduced too. I hope we are past the second peak,” said Kejriwal during his visit to a manufacturing plant of crop stubble decomposer in Najafgarh. On September 17, 4,432 cases of Covid-19 had been reported. Kejriwal had earlier mentioned the possibility of Delhi already having moving past the peak of the “second wave” of Covid-19 on August 24. The number of cases of the infection had shot up during the second and third weeks of September. As per data shared by the Delhi government, an average of 4,001 cases were being reported each day during the second week of September, 3,960 during the third week, after which the number came down to 2,780 during the previous week.The Capital added 2,676 cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, when 53,591 tests were conducted.“The number of cases is definitely coming down, as per the data available in the public domain. However, to say whether this was the second wave of infection and whether we are past it, we will need more detailed data. In epidemiology, a second wave will be when the first wave has subsided to the baseline and has remained low for some time before going up,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Mishra said it is likely the cases will keep going up and down until herd immunity is developed. When asked about the outcome of the latest sero-survey (which showed lower prevalence rate of antibodies among people), Kejriwal said the survey was done in a “decentralised” manner and the outcome is related to change in “sample collection method”. He, however, did not elaborate further on this. The sample collection for the third round of sero-survey conducted in the first five days of September was ward-wise instead of district-wise as in the previous surveys. The samples were also collected according to the places of residence such as whether the participants were living in planned colonies, unauthorised colonies, or slums. The prevalence dipped to 24.8% from the previous 29.1%. “The dip could have been because of the change in the sample collection method. There are also some reports of the antibody titers (concentrations) going down over time. However, even if antibody levels go down, people are likely to still have innate immunity from the infection with very few cases of re-infection. This means Delhi might develop herd immunity soon,” Dr Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-second-covid-wave-has-already-peaked-kejriwal/story-49BM6MDwCySbDCaAuwCceL.html
07-10-2020||City||Production of anti-stubble solution starts, trial from October 11: Kejriwal||New Delhi: The mass production of a bio-chemical solution to convert crop stubble into compost began at a centralised plant at Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and the first set of trials at the fields will be conducted on October 11, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said after inspecting the site on Tuesday.The Delhi government said it has received applications from farmers for the solution to be sprayed over 1,300 acres of farmland in the city’s rural belt growing paddy (non-Basmati) varieties where stubble burning is practised. The total area under paddy cultivation in the city is around 2,000 acres (800 hectares).The solution is being prepared at a centralised plant at Najafgarh’s Kharkhari Nahar village by mixing jaggery and gram flour with bio-decomposer capsules developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa.The solution once sprayed on paddy fields converts stubble into compost over a period of 20 days, which can be used to test the fields, IARI scientists say.“The entire process of creating the liquid solution and spraying it across 800 hectares of farm fields costs just Rs 20 lakh, which proves it is a cheap and effective alternative and can be adopted by neighbouring states where massive stubble burning takes place and the fumes of which travel to Delhi, contributing to air pollution in winter,” Kejriwal said.He said if the experiment is successful in Delhi, it will create a model for other states to adopt the technology. The Delhi government will make available the spray to farmers free of cost.The peak harvest season is during October-November when air pollution spikes because of a combination of stagnant weather conditions, falling temperature, local emissions and fumes from stubble burning in neighbouring states such as Haryana and Punjab.K Annapurna, head of the microbiology department at IARI, who leads the team that developed the solution, said, “It is a simple solution and besides converting stubble into compost, it will also improve the quality of farmlands. Within seven days from now, 50 litres of the liquid solution will be ready, which mixed with 1,000 litres of water can be sprayed across 2,000 acres of farms.”Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said 1,200 farmers have registered for the scheme. Farmers can start sowing rabi crops within three days of spraying. “Though stubble burning was almost zero in Delhi, we want Delhi to become a role model for other states where stubble burning is a major issue. Stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and other states contribute nearly 45% of air pollution in Delhi. We have approached the state governments to adopt this policy,” Rai said.Farmer unions, meanwhile, raised concerns that if some varieties are harvested in mid-November, the window for sowing the rabi crop will be just about one week and spraying at that time can delay the process.Birender Dagar, president, Bhartiya Kisan Union, Delhi Pradesh, said the area under paddy cultivation is very less and burning is also not significant. He said the government should have rather focused on real issues of farmers not being able to sell their produce at mandis at the minimum support prices (MSP) fixed by the Centre.Dagar said the solution can be sprayed and tested for varieties being harvested now but for those harvested later in November. “The sowing of rabi crops begins in the first week of November. Farmers switching from paddy to rabi won’t have enough time to wait for officials to spray the solution and then wait for three more days to begin sowing. However, it is an experiment and if it’s beneficial to the fields, we will support the initiative,” Dagar said.However, Rai said that farmers can start sowing within three days of spraying and hence it will not cause them any delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/production-of-anti-stubble-solution-starts-trial-from-october-11-kejriwal/story-IiXvgjhTxOOX5xa0haAV1K.html

Police have cited messages that the nine arrested people had shared on a WhatsApp group -- “Kattar Hindu Ekta”-- that was created during the riots to attack members of the other community. HT has seen the supplementary charge sheet that police filed before chief metropolitan magistrate Purushottam Pathak on September 26. The charge sheet is related to the murder of Hashim Ali during the riots in Gokulpuri area. Earlier, in June, the police had filed their first charge sheet in the case against nine accused — Lokesh Kumar Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Vivek Panchal, Rishabh Chaudhary and Himanshu Thakur. The nine were allegedly active members of the WhatsApp group in which they had plotted the violence during the riots. They were then charged under sections of murder, unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon, rioting, causing disappearance of evidence, among other sections of the Indian penal Code (IPC). In the supplementary charge sheet, police have added sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc) and 505 (public mischief) for targeting victims on the basis of their religious identity.” Also Read: How the Delhi riots probe polarised society | Analysis“During the investigations and data retrieved from seized mobile phones has revealed that in the Whatsapp group ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’, there were averments for promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion and acting in a way that is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony,” the charge sheet read. According to the charge sheet, some of the messages sent by the group members were “Do not give them flats on rent” and “we will burn everything of theirs like we burned the madrasa today”, “Do not leave them, kill them.” “As per the chat of Whatsapp group, the accused persons... conspired to teach Muslims a lesson for attacking the Hindus. They equipped themselves with sticks, swords, firearms etc and killed nine innocent Muslims, including Hashim Ali and his brother Aamir Khan. It is prima facie revealed that there was a well-hatched conspiracy among the accused persons,” the charge sheet said. “The group members lost their individuality and started working with a mob mind,” police said in their charge sheet. Another chat that police have attached in the charge sheet was by a man, who has claimed that some people from the “RSS” had come to support them. Also Read | Delhi riots case: Police file over 17,000-page charge sheet, name 15 peopleIn their charge sheet, police have told court that they applied for obtaining sanction from concerned authorities to charge the arrested persons under sections of promoting enmity on basis of religion. The court will take cognizance of charges and proceed to start trial only when the state government gives its sanction. Under section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , the police have to take prior sanction from the department of prosecution, Delhi government for prosecuting anyone under section 153 A. According to the chargesheet, the WhatsApp group was allegedly created on February 25 to take revenge from the other community. Riots between Hindus and Muslims had broken out in different parts of north-east Delhi earlier this year, which left 53 dead and over 400 injured. The riots had started after a clash between supporters and protesters of the Citizenship Amendment Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-police-file-supplementary-charge-sheet-name-nine-for-promoting-religious-enmity/story-oBhxGie9gYNltbJSUxHYEI.html

It would be made sure that the patient is aware of this advice.” It could be done by mentioning the same as a stamp on the patient card, read the release.Dr Gupta said as a majority of private hospitals in Chandigarh did not have adequate infrastructure to manage Covid-19 patients, those who tested positive and their attendants will be guided to another facility for treatment and management.“It was also important that the patient was not left in the lurch in case such a situation arose,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-private-hospitals-asked-to-put-up-notices-if-they-don-t-offer-covid-treatment/story-8lomS4TYfxykl23GQfqD1M.html
07-10-2020||Delhi||No penalty until glitches in HSRP system are fixed, says Delhi transport minister||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Tuesday directed officials to ensure that motor vehicle owners are not penalised for failing to have upgraded to high-security registration plates (HSRP) and colour-coded stickers until further orders, at least as long as glitches in the system are fixed.The direction was issued at a meeting of the Delhi government with stakeholders – also including the National Informatics Centre (NIC), vehicle manufacturers and HSRP manufacturers – which was held on Tuesday for discussions on increasing complaints of applicants not being able to avail the registration plates and fuel stickers from the 236 authorised dealers in the city, said a senior government official.The minister also said that no new application should be entertained until the backlog is cleared and the current problems are resolved.A statement issued by the transport minister’s office on Tuesday evening said, “The minister instructed (the) original equipment manufacturers to put a system in place for addressing the grievances of the vehicle owners. He also instructed them not to book any new appointment for HSRP fitment until a proper system is in place and also instructed the transport department to delay enforcement until further orders.”Gahlot said, “Our objective is public convenience. It was misinterpreted by a section of people that we are immediately enforcing the HSRP rule. This created panic among vehicle owners. We have asked dealers and HSRP manufacturers not to take any further appointments until a proper system is in place. Plus, we are clear on our part that we will give sufficient time to vehicle owners to get the HSRP and colour coded stickers installed before enforcing the HSRP rules.”A spokesperson of Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited – a manufacturer of HSRP – said, “As instructed by the minister, we are putting a system in place addressing the grievances of the vehicle owners and not taking any new appointment for HSRP fitment till further notice… We are submitting the standard operating procedure, (and develop) mobile application and (a) doorstep home fixation system this week. Further, vehicle owners who have booked the plates till today will get them in the next few days.”On September 23, the Delhi government had issued a public notice asking vehicle owners to avail HSRP and colour-coded stickers at the earliest in order to avoid being penalised under existing laws but it did not mention any deadline in the notice.Between September 23 and October 5, around 40,000 vehicle owners in the city have applied for HSRP and stickers and around 32,000 of them have so far succeeded, leading to a backlog of at least 8,000 at this point, said a senior official in the transport department. The official added that for the past few days there have been numerous complaints about dealers turning away applicants on time slots booked by them and refusing fresh applications.The official said there are around 3.2 million vehicles in Delhi — commercial and private — which are supposed to have high-security registration plates. These include around 1.1 million four-wheelers and 1.9 million two-wheelers, while the rest include auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, buses, trucks, and others. The rule applies largely to vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, as vehicles registered after that date are mandatorily equipped with HSRPs and stickers, the official said.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor on Tuesday said that he has written to lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal urging him to involve more authorised dealers and petrol pumps in order to expedite the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-penalty-until-glitches-in-hsrp-system-are-fixed-says-delhi-transport-minister/story-ueSdzk46DkbEgXaLYZf1SL.html
07-10-2020||City||Number of tests, daily Covid cases and positivity rate go down in Pune||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has lowered the number of tests it is conducting daily to detect Covid-19 cases in the city. The number of fresh Covid cases and the city’s positivity rate have also subsequently dropped, data released on Tuesday shows. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “We have not brought down the number of tests, We are testing all those required. You must see that the positivity rate has also gone down which indicates clearly that the number of new cases are going down. Also, the absolute number of deaths which was around 40 deaths daily due to Covid has now gone down to 30. Fewer new cases are coming up and so eventually the number of tests down for contacts is also coming down.” While the positivity rate between September 19 and September 25 was an average of 27.97%, the number of tests carried out was 38,145. The positivity rate for the week from September 29 to October 5 is 20.38%, but the number of tests carried was 34,019. BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole took to Twitter to question the civic body for bringing down its testing. He tweeted, “Pune City has reported that 4334 Total Tests. I sincerely hope that this daily decrease in testing is due to drastic decrease in symptomatic patients & not some smokescreen to artificially reduce the number of positive cases reported daily. While citizens of #Pune maybe happy about the drastic drop in daily #COVID19 infections reported, I am deeply concerned that the drop is more to do with the decrease in number of tests being conducted and not an actual indicator of Pune flattening the curve of Covid19. By reducing the no. of tests & consequently reducing infection nos, we risk misleading #Pune into a false sense of security & normalcy. I fear that this deceptive flattening of the curve will lead to laxity in following protocols and bring about a 2nd wave of infections.” Dr Avinash Bhondwe, IMA president (Maharashtra) while reacting on dip in cases said, the reasons will be known only after seven days. “Whether it is herd immunity or reduced testing or temporary flattening of curve? We will know the exact situation only after seven days.”The state government scheme, “My Family My responsibility”, has found a prevalence of 10% positive, in those tested based on symptoms in the city. From September 15 to October 10, of the 18.31 lakh people screened in the city, 7,343 were referred to flu clinics, of which 872, or close to 11.87% were found to be positive. This is part of a door-to-door survey conducted in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/number-of-tests-daily-covid-cases-and-positivity-rate-go-down/story-QIw7GiSI0qn5EGe4tqfrxH.html
07-10-2020||City||MCCIA survey: 68% workforce back in industry, real estate reports return of 60% migrant labour in Pune||PUNE: In its recent survey conducted by Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), the industry body has found that 68% workforce has returned to work in over 150 industries in and around Pune. The real estate body Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) has also reported over 60% migrant labourers back while Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) claims that 90% workers have resumed work. Many sectors had to down shutters after lockdown was announced in March. The survey conducted by MCCIA during September involved 150 small, medium and large industries from Pune district. Regarding the current level of production, the survey states that on an average, the surveyed companies said that their current level of production has gone up from 50% in August to 55% in September 2020. On an average, the surveyed companies said that the number of employees working has gone up from 56% in August to 67% in September 2020. The surveyed companies were also asked about when their production levels were expected to be the same as January 2020. As compared to 15% of respondents in August, 22% of the respondents said that they expect their production levels to go back to the pre-Covid levels in less than three months. About 55% of respondents said they expect it to take between three to nine months and 24% said they could not comment on it at the moment. A few of the companies who had said their recovery back to pre-Covid levels would take more than nine months in August, said that it would now take between three to nine months. The distribution of organisations surveyed ranged from micro, small, medium and large scale organisations was 33%, 33%, 17% and 17% respectively. About 63% of the organisations surveyed were from the manufacturing sector, 24% from the services sector and the rest were involved in both manufacturing and services, according to the survey. Sudhir Mehta, president, MCCIA, said, “We are glad to see the month-on-month growth in production levels and employee strength. We hope that these figures go back to the pre-Covid levels by the end of this calendar year, or in the worst case by the end of this financial year.” The real estate sector too is returning back to normalcy in the city. CREDAI president Suhas Merchant said that the construction industry is also limping back to normalcy as most sites have resumed work.“About 45,000 workers or 60% of those gone back to their native place have returned to Pune. Most developers have restarted their construction sites though they are facing fund crunch,” said Merchant. After lockdown was announced, around 80% workers, mostly from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, returned home as government allowed special trains. During unlock, as trains began operations, workers too have started coming back, said another developer. CREDAI hopes that with more trains restarting soon in Maharashtra, more workers will return to city. Earlier last week, Maha-Metro also claimed its workforce back to full strength in the city. Currently, according to Maha-Metro public relations officer Hemant Sonawane, 4,500 labourers are working on Pune metro sites. “This is double the strength as compared to July-August, when Maha-Metro resumed work, post lockdown,” Sonawane said on Thursday.Fifty per cent of security guards back on duty in PuneAround fifty per cent of security persons who had left the city during the Covid situation are back on duty and the figure seems to rising each day. Industry experts cite financial crunch faced by security persons as the reason for their resuming work. A large number of private companies, cinema halls and hotels had terminated private security guards as part of layoffs during the lockdown in the city.Experts believe that the sector will take another two years and more to revive as the commercial sector is badly affected. Arun Waghmare, office-bearer, Pune Mahanagar Security Association, said that a large number of security staff still await jobs. “The situation is still not stable and many security guards are unwilling to return. We appeal to the government to declare some sops for the sector,” he said.Manoj Kumar, a security guard posted at a construction site said, “I left for home during lockdown and returned last month. There is no income source at home. I have been accepted by the previous employer at half the salary,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/68-workforce-back-in-industry-real-estate-reports-return-of-60-migrant-labour-in-pune/story-si4CD7wrcMFBy17TxHCFyH.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Covid forces exodus of students from private to government schools in Chandigarh||More than 50% students from Classes 1 to 8 who joined government schools in this year of upheaval due to the Covid-19 pandemic have made the switch from private institutes, UT education department data shows.Of the 9,233 students admitted to government schools between Classes 1 to 8 this year, 4,985 (54%) were from private institutes.They had sought admission during online counselling held between July 31 and August 14.Economic impact of Covid Rubinderjit Singh Brar, UT director, school education (DSE), said the students were opting for government schools “due to the economic effect of the Covid pandemic and the lockdown.”Education in government schools is free up to Class 8 in government schools under the Right to Education (RTE), so people going through an economic crisis or those who have lost their jobs have chosen such institutes, Brar added.The influx was unlikely to add pressure on these schools, which had enough resources to accommodate students even as social distancing was required, he said.Acknowledging the fact that students were moving out, Anuja Sharma, principal of DAV Model School, Sector 15, said parents were playing smart by getting their wards transferred after studying in private schools till September. “Parents are asking for transfer certificates and I received over ten such transfer requests on Tuesday. They are of the opinion that a large part of the academic year is over and by shifting to a government school, their children will be promoted under RTE even if conducting physical exams is not viable in these times.”It was a double whammy, Sharma said, as “private schools are already reeling from the effects of the Covid lockdown and this has made things worse for us.”Not all private schools reporting exodusNot all private schools, however, are reporting an exodus. HS Mamik, president of the Independent Schools Association , said, “In the association as a whole such a trend hasn’t come up, although a few students leaving from some of the schools is possible.”The need of the hour was to assess whether government schools will be able to teach better. “The government schools should also hire more teachers to ensure the teacher to student ratio doesn’t suffer,” Mamik added.Attributing “the shift” to private schools demanding fees from students even during the lockdown, Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents Association, said: “Some students were removed from online classes and many others were threatened over non-payment of fees. The Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights had to intervene and prevent this, but the damage was done and students and their parents could have ended up feeling humiliated.”Goyal added that the education department needed to analyse the trend and safeguard the interests of private school students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/50-class-1-8-students-joining-govt-schools-this-year-in-chandigarh-are-from-private-institutes/story-z69U5U5CztUG84za4CNheI.html
07-10-2020||Pune||Education minister visits SPPU campus; final year exams begin from Oct 12||Over two lakh students have opted to take online and 50,000 will appear offline for the final year exam conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) beginning October 12. To review the exam preparation, state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant visited the university campus on Tuesday and met the officials. Samant said that there will be no more delay in the examination schedule, which was postponed in light of other exams and strike by non-teaching staff. Samant, who was tested Covid positive a few days back, made his first official visit after completing the quarantine period. “All the arrangements are in place and we hope that the exams will be conducted smoothly. For offline students, 113 centres have been identified by SPPU in three districts and instructions have been given to follow Covid prevention measures. The police commissioner and district collector of all the three districts — Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar — have been instructed by our department to coordinate for these exams,” said Samant. Several students have complained about internet connectivity and other issues for online exam. Gurudev Somani, director, Mastersoft Erp, which is working with various city-based colleges for online exams, said that students have reported about facing internet connectivity and devices/browsers competency issues. “Using mobile phones with different application versions, different data plans, created certain compatibility issues. It is advisable for students to settle down 10 minutes prior to the exam, go through mock tests conducted by the college, watch training videos and follow instructions. Following these steps will help address 99 per cent issues,” said Somani. For the final year examination, a total of 2.5 lakh students of SPPU and its affiliated colleges are going to appear. The written exams will start from October 12, while the mock test and question paper sets for practice will start from October 8. These exams will be of 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for a duration of one hour. SPPU faculty are preparing question paper sets for around 3,300 different subjects. Fees and reopening of colleges Talking about the college fee issue, Samant said, “We had instructed colleges earlier that there should be no increase in fees this year due to Covid-19 pandemic and students should not be forced to pay fees immediately. Development and gymkhana charges which are included in annual fees should not be charged this year. Action will be taken against colleges found not following the instructions.” “We have got the guidelines from the Union home ministry about re-starting colleges, but our stand is still the same that we will not allow colleges to reopen until the Covid situation normalises,” he said. Issues faced by students “Students are facing a lot of problems due to Covid-19 pandemic. Colleges are demanding full fees and students, mainly those coming from rural background, are unable to pay fees now. We requested the minister to reduce fees by 50 per cent,” said Sandhya Sonawane, Pune division head of Nationalist Congress Party students’ union. Kuldeep Ambekar, president of students helping hand organisation said, “There are various issues which students are facing today due to Covid situation, right from paying fees, hostel or accommodation to appearing for the final year exams. Our demand is that the state education department should cancel the backlog exams for first and second-year students or else take their exams through MCQ method. The syllabus should be reduced by 25 per cent looking at the current online system of taking lectures. As most of the students come from rural part, there is connectivity issue and they cannot attend lectures regularly. College fees should be reduced by 50 per cent for this academic year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/education-minister-visits-sppu-campus-final-year-exams-begin-from-oct-12/story-4Cnbtqi00uxr0QoMsqS1lK.html
07-10-2020||Pune||Flying squads to monitor bars, restaurants in Pune; testing facility for staff||The district administration has decided to slap fines on bars and restaurants found flouting coronavirus prevention norms. Flying squads have been appointed to carry out random checks and violators will be fined up to Rs 50,000. Speaking to the media, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “The city had reported a surge in Covid-19 cases as the police did not impose fines for violation of prevention norms during the Ganesh festival. The rise in Covid cases after 18-22 days after the festival had put pressure on the healthcare system. Against this background, we conducted a meeting with the police, excise and hotel association representatives and decided to form flying squads to monitor bars and hotels.” Rao said, “Our intention is not to badly impact the hotel industry, but ensure that these establishments function within the 50 per cent customer capacity. The flying squads will also have members from the hotel association.” He said, “Police officers, excise department personnel, PMC and PCMC staff, and hotel association representatives would be part of the team. In the rural parts, revenue department officials would be part of the squads. If the same establishment violates the norms repeatedly, if necessary, the administration would suspend the licence for running bars.” The commissioner said the squads would mainly monitor customer capacity, waiting areas, disposal system, ventilation, and entry and exit facilities. Rao said that the virus positivity rate has stabilised in Pune city and adequate oxygen supply stock and hospital beds are available. “Though it is a positive sign, the administration is alert and improving bed capacity every day. Special teams have been formed to increase bed capacity in the city and district. More than 600 beds have started functioning in jumbo Covid facility.” Testing facility for hotel and bar staff Divisional commissioner has announced free Covid-19 testing facility for staff working in hotels and restaurants. The circular issued by the commissioner states that staff need to come forward to avail the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/flying-squads-to-monitor-bars-restaurants-in-pune-testing-facility-for-staff/story-m7odw7ddPjHhKyMOhSqqAN.html
07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Success of National Education Policy depends on General Education Council||The public education system entails regulation and monitoring to ensure excellence in achieving goals in policy documents. But, it generally encounters scepticism in the esoteric circles of academicians who believe in the doctrine of absolute individuality in professional life. As such, regulation are viewed as excessive and restricted. It is in this context that the extant regulatory regime of higher education in India is restrictive rather than facilitative.Besides, the reforms envisioned in the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, need reforms in the regulatory mechanism to ensure its implementation. Four verticals under the Higher Education Commission of India will be set up, which will function in synergy. These verticals are the National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC), National Accreditation Council (NAC), Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC) and General Education Council (GEC).EMPOWERING GRADUATES TO BECOME GLOBAL CITIZENSThe GEC is the most crucial vertical for the success of the NEP, 2020, and thus is its soul. The council shall be responsible for framing graduate attributes (GA) – the qualities, skills and understandings that students should develop while pursuing degrees. Intended to empower graduates with competencies and 21st-century skills to become global citizens and contribute to the nation’s economy, GAs shall also provide for content mapping, suggest pedagogical pathways and effective evaluation tools for measuring attainment levels prior to award of the degrees. In essence, the basic mandate of the GEC shall be to prepare learners with skill sets. The GEC, through the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), will ensure a departure from certifying educational qualifications on the basis of duration, entry qualifications and other criteria to a system of quantifying and certifying predefined competencies. It is supposed to provide a framework for translating competencies into credits and/or hours, seamless amalgamation of the formal and non -formal modes of earning credits and fixing minimum credits for certification, and finally, a framework for the academic bank of credits.INTEGRATING VOCATIONAL INTO HIGHER EDUCATION The NHEQF will work with the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) for the integration of vocational into higher education. The NSQF focuses on qualifications in accordance with levels of knowledge, skills and aptitude. These levels are defined in terms of learning outcomes irrespective of whether these are acquired through formal or informal learning opportunities. Professional bodies such as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Veterinary Council of India, National Council for Teacher Education, Council of Architecture and National Council for Vocational Education and Training will act as professional standard setting bodies (PSSBs) and shall set standards for professional courses.Traditional skills such as carpentry, pottery and other forms of craftsmanship abundantly available in rural India need to be institutionalised. As such, NHEQF should also devise standards and mechanism for certifications of such skills informally imparted in rural homes that craftsmen traditionally inherited from previous generations. This will help preserve the traditional skill base of rural India, and also will provide impetus and recognition to craftsmen.CONVERTING CHALLENGES INTO OPPORTUNITY The challenge and opportunity before the nation is to help the GEC to translate its mandates into ground realities. The GEC will accomplish its mandate through a panel of experts. The moot question is, whether the GEC can have the luxury of enough expertise to develop programmes and course-wise GAs and a broad framework for course contents in commensuration with GAs along with corresponding pedagogical pathways – a Herculean task. More importantly, are the teachers trained and equipped to engage with the type of personalised, experiential, flipped and similar student-centric pedagogies to mentor the learners to achieve targeted GAs and to develop the required level of competencies matching with international standards? Devising measurable evaluation tools and putting those into practise will be another challenge. Making the education system learner-centric with focus on how and what to learn and inculcating in them the desire for lifelong learning will be another challenge. All this can be possible provided the teaching community decides to come out of the comfort zone and imbibes the spirit of the guru shishya tradition to rise to the occasion and convert challenges into opportunities. Initially, the quality of students entering higher education may also be a cause of concern, but quality will improve once school students trained under the new education system start pursuing higher education. A tight but light and facilitative regulatory framework, sufficient grant for developing world-class infrastructure, recruitment of quality teachers and tangible accreditation mechanism will be crucial for the GEC to meaningfully discharge its responsibilities. This quadrant under the Higher Education Commission of India can function and meet the objectives of the NEP if all verticals work in coordination. COMMITMENT FROM STAKEHOLDERSThe Union education minister demonstrated commitment in sensitising stakeholders, including civil society, with all aspects of the NEP. The same level of commitment is a must on the part of the nodal ministry, the University Grants Commission and vice-chancellors in actualising the reforms. Students, teachers, institutions and civil society should work in tandem to ensure that the GEC fulfils its mandate for developing 21st century competencies in youth and adults alike to enable them to become global citizens with critical and rational thinking in the socio-economic and cultural contexts of the nation. The GEC can help realise the prime minister’s vision of making Bharat atmanirbhar (self-reliant). This way, it can become the soul of the NEP.The writer is vice-chancellor, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, and a member of University Grants Commission.

07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana deputy CM Dushyant Chautala tests positive for Covid-19||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Tuesday said he has tested positive for coronavirus, adding that he was asymptomatic and feeling alright.Chautala, a JJP leader, urged people who had met him during the past week to get themselves tested.“My Covid-19 test report has returned positive. There are no symptoms like fever, but as the report is positive, I am self-isolating,” he said in a message on Twitter.Earlier, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, some ministers, assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta and a few legislators and MPs from the state had also contracted the infection and later recovered. Haryana, meanwhile, collected samples of 38,983 people in last 24 hours during which, 18 people succumbed to the viral disease and 1,206 new infections were recorded, as per the medical bulletin. The doubling rate improved from 33 on Monday to 34 on Tuesday, while the recovery rate also improved from 90.13% to 90.57%. The death toll in the state reached 1,509, while the tally of cumulative positive cases stood at 1,36,115. The bulletin said 1,690 more patients have been cured, taking the overall recoveries to 1,23,286. Four people each succumbed in Hisar and Yamunanagar, two each in Gurugram, Panipat and Sonepat, and one each in Jind, Kaithal, Fatehabad and Sirsa. The number of active cases case came down to 11,320. Gurugram again recorded the maximum new cases (266), while Faridabad logged 148 infections, Hisar 96, Rohtak and Kurukshetra 84 each, Ambala 57, Panchkula 53, Nuh 51, Karnal 50, Rewari 45, Mahendergarh 37, Sirsa and Sonepat 33 each, Panipat, Bhiwani and Palwal 32 each, Jhajjar 23, Yamunanagar 19, Charkhi Dadri 17, and Kaithal 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-deputy-cm-dushyant-chautala-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-wl78THkci8urJGdTNDPddO.html
07-10-2020||Dehradun||30 glaciers in Karakoram range in Ladakh, J&K have potential to burst: Scientists||Scientists from Dehradun’s Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) have identified 30 glaciers in the Karakoram range in Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir, where the intensity of glacial lake outbursts is likely to increase. In the last few decades, 146 outburst floods have taken place in the range due to obstruction of rivers passing through the valleys by these advancing glaciers, they said.WIHG is in the process of identifying the glacial lakes that can burst and creating a mechanism for their regular monitoring.Kalachand Sain, the institute’s director, said the scientists have identified many advancing glaciers, which form ice dams due to obstruction of passing rivers in these valleys.Ice dams are created when ice from upper parts of glaciers fall and block passing rivers, giving rise to glacial lakes, which lead to glacial lake outburst floods.Ice dammed lakes are different from moraine dam glacial lakes (one of them led to burst during the Kedarnath flash flood in 2013). Moraine dam glacial lakes are formed due to the retreating of glaciers, which leave behind soil and rocks and lead to an increase in capacity of a lake, making it prone to bursting.“These ice dam lakes pose a threat of bursting anytime because as melted water and debris from glaciers get accumulated in mountain depressions or valleys, then the lakes will have more water than their capacity. This, in turn, can break walls of lakes and when they suddenly get released downstream, they can create flash-floods,” said Sain.The Karakoram mountain range is around 500 km long. It has 18 mountains over 7,500 metres high and four over 8,000 metres, including the second-highest peak in the world-- K2 (8,611 m). The range starts in the Wakhan Corridor in Afghanistan in the west and passes through Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh including the Aksai Chin area.Karakoram range is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions. The 74-km long strategically important Siachen Glacier between India and Pakistan and the second-largest glacier in the world’s non-polar region is also located in the Karakoram range.WIHG’s ongoing study named ‘Ice-dammed Lake Outburst Floods in Karakoram’ aims to form an updated inventory of ice dams and related glacial lake outburst floods, combining historical sources and remote sensing data. Scientists from Waterloo’s Wilfrid Laurier University, and Chandigarh’s Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment are also involved in the research.Rakesh Bhambri, a WIHG scientist working on the project, said 146 glacial lake outburst floods have taken place in the Karakoram region in 30 advancing glaciers. He said the scientists first started working in 2013 for this project.“...we need to study more about these areas and find out if there is a connection with climate change or not. And if there is, how it might affect the surroundings in the future,” said Bhambri.He added the inner part of Ladakh’s Shyok Valley, which has been in the news over ongoing India-China border tensions, can get flooded. “We do not have many settlements in these areas and only security personnel stay there. If these places get flooded, then border areas can get affected.”Sameer Tiwari, another senior scientist from WIHG working on the project, said if the lakes outburst, then major damage can occur in the Indus river basin, mainly covering Shyok and Nubra Valleys of Ladakh.“We are continuously studying the satellite data to understand where all rivers are being blocked due to surging glaciers leading to the formation of lakes that can outburst. We can only collect data and form an inventory so that this information can be used by the local administration to prevent a disaster,” said Tiwari.He said in 2019, a lake outburst was reported from Shispare Glacier in the Gilgit-Baltistan area. Shispare Glacier is one of the 30 identified glaciers.After studying the glaciers of the Karakoram region, scientists say that one of the outcomes has been an urgent need to identify which glaciers are of concern, and initiate frequent, if not continuous monitoring of their activity.Sain said as they study more and more glaciers and glacial lakes, they will be able to know what measures to take to prevent a disaster. “During the 2013 Kedarnath flash floods, mass destruction took place due to a cloudburst along with debris accumulation and a similar situation can arise here too. From our studies, we will be able to collect data regarding weather conditions, the number of lakes formed, whether they have reached their capacity. An early warning system can be generated to predict a lake outburst.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/30-glacier-lakes-in-karakoram-range-in-ladakh-j-k-have-potential-to-burst-scientists/story-SjvW30KlsnTyBzN4eYUjCP.html
07-10-2020||World||In hardening stance, France, Germany push for EU sanctions on Russians over Navalny||France and Germany said on Wednesday they would propose European Union sanctions against Russian individuals after receiving no credible answers from Moscow over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent.Several Western governments have said Russia, which has denied accusations by Navalny that it was involved in the poisoning, must help in investigations or face consequences.The decision and speed with which Europe’s two main powers agreed to push ahead with sanctions suggests a hardening of the bloc’s diplomacy towards Moscow.It is in stark contrast to 2018 when it took almost a year for members to agree on sanctions against Russian individuals following a nerve agent attack on a Russian spy in Britain.“No credible explanation has been provided by Russia so far. In this context, we consider that there is no other plausible explanation for Mr Navalny’s poisoning than a Russian involvement and responsibility,” Foreign Ministers Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas said in a joint statement. Diplomats had earlier told Reuters the two countries would propose sanctions on Russian GRU military intelligence officials when the EU’s 27 foreign ministers meet on Oct. 12. “Drawing the necessary conclusions from these facts, France and Germany will share with European partners proposals for additional sanctions,” the two ministers said.“Proposals will target individuals deemed responsible for this crime and breach of international norms, based on their official function, as well as an entity involved in the Novichok programme.”Blood samples taken from Navalny confirmed the presence of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Tuesday.EU foreign ministers are expected to give their political support on Monday, but the sanctions are not expected to be approved immediately as legal texts must be prepared and cleared by experts from the 27 EU states.Le Drian told a parliamentary committee in Paris on Wednesday: “We say with Germany that clarification by Russia is indispensable and if it doesn’t clarify then we will need to draw conclusions among Europeans. We are in sync with Germany.”He said Paris was not closing the door to dialogue with Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-hardening-stance-france-germany-push-for-eu-sanctions-on-russians-over-navalny/story-A6RLxwUx5tXGGJlY6qAF9K.html
07-10-2020||World||Two British IS members charged for deaths of American hostages||Two Islamic State militants from Britain were brought to the United States on Wednesday to face charges in a gruesome campaign of torture, beheadings and other acts of violence against four Americans and others captured and held hostage in Syria, the Justice Department said.El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are two of four men dubbed “the Beatles” by the hostages they held captive because of their British accents. They are expected to make their first appearance in the afternoon in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, where a federal grand jury issued an eight-count indictment that accuses them of being “leading participants in a brutal hostage-taking scheme” that resulted in the deaths of Western hostages, including American journalist James Foley.The charges are a milestone in a years-long effort by U.S. authorities to bring to justice members of the group known for beheadings and barbaric treatment of aid workers, journalists and other hostages in Syria. The men’s arrival in the U.S. sets the stage for arguably the most sensational terrorism trial since the 2014 criminal case against the suspected ringleader of a deadly attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.The case underscores the Justice Department’s commitment to prosecuting militants captured overseas, said Assistant Attorney General John Demers, who vowed that other extremists “will be pursued to the ends of the earth.”“If you have American blood in your veins or American blood on your hands, you will face American justice,” Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official, said at a news conference announcing the charges.Videos of the killings, released online in the form of Islamic State propaganda, stunned the U.S. government for their unflinching violence. The recordings routinely showed prisoners in orange jumpsuits on their knees beside a captor dressed in black whose native English drove home the global reach of a group that at its peak occupied vast swaths of Syria and Iraq.The defendants are charged in connection with the deaths of four American hostages — Foley, journalist Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller — as well as British and Japanese nationals who had been captured.The indictment describes Kotey and Elsheikh, both of whom prosecutors say radicalized in London and set off for Syria in 2012, as “leading participants in a brutal hostage-taking scheme targeting American and European citizens” from 2012 through 2015. It accuses them of working closely with a chief spokesman for IS who reported directly to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a U.S. military airstrike last year.In July 2014, according to the indictment, Elsheikh described to a family member his participation in an Islamic State attack on the Syrian Army. He sent the family member photos of decapitated heads and said in a voice message, “There’s many heads, this is just a couple that I took a photo of.”While the 24-page indictment describes Kotey and Elsheikh as coordinators of ransom negotiations conducted by email, it does not spell out their specific roles in any of the executions and other deaths.U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia G. Zachary Terwilliger, whose office will prosecute the case, said under U.S. law Elsheikh and Kotey can “be held liable for the foreseeable acts of their co-conspirators.”Relatives of the four slain Americans praised the Justice Department for transferring the men to the U.S. for trial, saying, “Now our families can pursue accountability for these crimes against our children in a U.S. court.”Elsheikh and Kotey have been held since October 2019 in American military custody after being captured in Syria one year earlier by the U.S.-based Syrian Democratic Forces. The Justice Department has long wanted to put them on trial, but those efforts were complicated by wrangling over whether Britain, which does not have the death penalty, would share evidence that could be used in a death penalty prosecution.Attorney General William Barr broke the diplomatic standoff earlier this year when he promised the men would not face the death penalty. That prompted British authorities to share evidence that U.S. prosecutors deemed crucial for obtaining convictions.In interviews while in detention, the two men admitted they helped collect email addresses from Mueller that could be used to send out ransom demands. Mueller was killed in 2015 after 18 months in ISIS captivity.The State Department, and the new Justice Department indictment, described their conduct in terms not nearly so benign.The State Department declared Elsheikh and Kotey as specially designated global terrorists in 2017 and accused them of holding captive and beheading approximately two dozen hostages.Specifically, the State Department said Elsheikh “was said to have earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions while serving as an ISIS jailer.”Kotey, according to the State Department, acted as an Islamic State recruiter and “likely engaged in the group’s executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding.”In a statement, relatives of Mueller, Foley, Sotloff and Kassig said the transfer “will be the first step in the pursuit of justice for the alleged horrific human rights crimes against these four young Americans.”“We are hopeful that the U.S. government will finally be able to send the important message that if you harm Americans, you will never escape justice. And when you are caught, you will face the full power of American law,” the statement said.The other two Beatles included the most infamous member of the group, Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John,” who was killed in a 2015 drone strike. Emwazi appeared and spoke in the video of Foley’s execution. The fourth member, Aine Lesley Davis, was sentenced to seven years in prison in Turkey in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-british-is-members-charged-for-deaths-of-american-hostages/story-6PlX5Q9AyMRyh75iTYmKfL.html
07-10-2020||World||Donald Trump’s health puts more focus on Pence, Harris showdown in VP debate||President Donald Trump’s battle with Covid-19 and Democratic challenger Joe Biden’s age provide an unusual backdrop to Wednesday’s vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.Pence and Harris are scheduled to take the stage at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City separated by plastic barriers for a 90-minute debate, a reminder of how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the race ahead of the Nov. 3 election.The Republican president announced last Friday that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus amid a White House outbreak and was hospitalized in Maryland for three days receiving a variety of treatments.Either Pence, 61, or Harris, 55, would be a heartbeat away from assuming the presidency, depending on the election’s outcome. How they handle themselves during the debate may be scrutinized even more closely than usual given Trump’s ill health and Biden’s age.Now 77, Biden would be 78 upon taking office in January, which would make him the oldest U.S. president in history. Trump is 74, making his Covid-19 particularly dangerous considering his age and other health issues. Trump already is the oldest president to seek re-election.Public opinion polls this year have indicated that some voters have reservations regarding the age of the presidential candidates.Biden is leading Trump in national polls, including an advantage of 12 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voters. Polls show the race to be closer in some of the election battleground states that could determine the winner.Harris is a U.S. senator from California picked by Biden in August as his running mate. Pence is a former U.S. congressman and Indiana governor who has steadfastly defended Trump during his tumultuous presidency.Their debate is unlikely to match the chaos of the first presidential debate last week in which Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and the two traded insults. Pence, more even-tempered than Trump, and Harris, a former prosecutor known for sharp questioning during Senate hearings, are seen as polished communicators.‘A FORTRESS’The two campaigns have squabbled over installing barriers on stage between Pence and Harris to guard against coronavirus infection. On Wednesday, television images of the debate stage showed two plexiglass barriers, one adjoining each lectern. Pence and Harris also will be placed more than 12 feet (3.6 meters) apart on stage.Harris had requested plexiglass shielding. Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller on Monday mocked Harris, saying if she “wants to use a fortress around herself, have at it.” An aide to the vice president on Wednesday said Pence had agreed to the barriers to facilitate the debate.Both Pence and Harris tested negative for the coronavirus on Tuesday. Current U.S. government guidelines call for anyone exposed to a person with Covid-19 to quarantine for 14 days regardless of test results.In a statement, Harris spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said, “If the Trump administration’s war on masks has now become a war on safety shields, that tells you everything you need to know about why their COVID response is a failure.”The pandemic is likely to dominate the debate. Biden and Harris have made Trump’s handling of the public health crisis a central theme of their campaign, blaming Trump for downplaying the health risks and failing to endorse mask-wearing to combat the spread of the pathogen.Pence, who has headed up the administration’s coronavirus task force, can be expected to defend Trump’s response to the pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans and battered the U.S. economy even as other wealthy nations have managed to get it under better control.A Biden campaign official said Harris has prepared for Pence to attack her as too liberal, which would echo Trump’s assertion that the moderate Biden would advance a “radical left-wing” agenda if elected president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-health-puts-more-focus-on-pence-harris-showdown-in-vp-debate/story-QY0FGBXsnp8qbC0g0wezfK.html
07-10-2020||World||Italy makes face masks mandatory as coronavirus cases surge||Italy on Wednesday made it mandatory to wear face masks outdoors nationwide in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as new infections jumped to the highest daily tally since April.The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months. It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said.Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory.Data from the Health Ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since April 24.Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and Britain. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by COVID-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after Britain, with 36,061 dying since the outbreak flared in February, according to official figures.Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the contagion under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast.However, daily Covid-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy’s epidemic six months ago.Some 31 people died of the virus on Wednesday, the Health Ministry said, while April 24, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths.The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid-19 state of emergency to Jan. 31.The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-makes-face-masks-mandatory-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-mX0ESMOcNhhh3Tyvvhd4eN.html
07-10-2020||World||In about-face, Donald Trump seeks to salvage parts of coronavirus aid||The White House on Wednesday tried to salvage its favorite items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that President Donald Trump blew up, with his administration pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and a new wave of aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic.In a barrage of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along.Trump’s tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended.He called on Congress to send him a “Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200)” — a reference to a preelection batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House.“I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” Trump said on Twitter Tuesday evening. He also urged Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.The stock market fell precipitously after Trump pulled the plug on the talks but was recovering in morning trading Wednesday after he floated the idea of piecemeal aid.Trump’s decision to scuttle talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi came after the president was briefed on the landscape for the negotiations — and on the blowback that any Pelosi-Mnuchin deal probably would have received from his GOP allies in Congress.“It became very obvious over the last couple of days that a comprehensive bill was just going to get to a point where it didn’t have really much Republican support at all,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday on Fox News. “It was more of a Democrat-led bill, which would have been problematic, more so in the Senate than in the House.”Pelosi told reporters that “all the president wants is his name on a check” for direct aid payments.The unexpected turn could be a blow to Trump’s reelection prospects and comes as his administration and campaign are in turmoil. Trump is quarantining in the White House with a case of the coronavirus, and the latest batch of opinion polls shows him significantly behind Democrat Joe Biden with the election four weeks away.Trump’s withdrawal from the talks came immediately after he spoke with the GOP leaders in Congress, Many Republican senators had signaled they would not be willing to go along with any measure that topped $1 trillion, and GOP aides had been privately dismissive of the prospects for a deal. Any Pelosi-sponsored agreement of close to $2 trillion raised the potential of a GOP revolt if such a plan came to a vote.Pelosi and Mnuchin talked briefly on Wednesday morning about the chances for a stand-alone airline rescue, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted. Pelosi directed Mnuchin to a measure she had attempted to pass on Friday on short notice under fast-track procedures, but only after Democrats made a number of changes Republicans did not like.The talks have been troubled from their start in July and never appeared to close in on an agreement both sides could embrace.Pelosi had been demanding a host of Democratic wins on food aid, unemployment benefits, help for renters and homeowners, and aid to state and local governments. Republicans charged she was dragging the talks to deny Trump a political victory before the Nov. 3 election.Early rounds of virus aid passed by overwhelming margins as the economy went into lockdown in March. After that, Trump and many of his GOP allies focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help.Still, the decision to halt negotiations now could be politically perilous. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the start of the pandemic exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.The economy has recovered more quickly than most economists had expected, largely because of the aid Congress approved in a $2 trillion package in March. The $1,200 stimulus checks, supplemental $600 unemployment benefits each week, and aid to small businesses boosted household incomes and enabled many low-income Americans to pay bills and rent and maintain their overall spending, according to data from Opportunity Insights.But the recovery has slowed and certain sectors such as restaurants, hotels, theaters and airlines remain in bad shape, shedding jobs and risking permanent realignment. Without more stimulus, economists expect growth will slow significantly in the final three months of the year.“You’re going to see quite a significant drag on growth,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. It “would really risk a double-dip recession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-about-face-donald-trump-seeks-to-salvage-parts-of-coronavirus-aid/story-y9KRTqaLaGYFNgGTzovWMI.html

He added, “I’m ready to take that deal if I can get it -- it sounded awesome.” Stern’s previous five-year contracts have paid him $80 million to $100 million a year.Sirius shares were volatile in premarket trading Wednesday and gained after the open, rising as much as 5.9% to $5.89.Stern said he called his agent upon hearing reports of his potential new contract and “we were both kind of baffled by it.”“I am telling you with my hand over my heart, I don’t have anywhere near a deal,” Stern said.However, laughing with co-host Robin Quivers, Stern added, “I’m telling Sirius now, whatever I read, I want. I’ll take that, right now. I’m a bad negotiator. I’m like, ‘OK, I’ll take it, I’m in, let’s do it.’”Before moving on to talk about the late guitarist Eddie Van Halen, Stern said, “We’ll see what happens.

During the debate, Harris, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump’s handling of Covid-19 crisis and Pence, administration’s coronavirus task force head, are expected to present starkly different visions for a country confronting multiple crises.The debate, scheduled to be broadcast at 9 pm EDT (6:30 am IST on Thursday) and hosted at the University of Utah, is being considered as one of the most highly anticipated vice presidential debates in recent memory. It will be 90 minutes long and divided into nine 10-minute segments.Viewers can catch all the action live as all major networks will be broadcasting the debate. It will also be streaming live on social media platforms including YouTube.Here is what to expect from the vice presidential debate:Two versions of country’s Covid-19 battleThe Covid-19 pandemic is likely to dominate the proceedings as Pence is expected to defend the country’s fight led by Donald Trump during the debate. While Harris is expected to highlight the government’s failure in endorsing face masks and how Trump constantly downplayed the pandemic.The United States is still reeling under Covid-19, as many as 210,000 Americans have lost their lives to the deadly disease. The pandemic has also caused a massive economic crisis with millions of Americans filing for unemployment.‘Too liberal’ HarrisA Joe Biden campaign official said Harris has prepared for Pence to attack her as too liberal, echoing Trump’s assertion that the moderate Biden will advance a “radical left-wing” agenda if elected, news agency Reuters reported.Lesser dramaThough this debate may not match the sheer chaos that took place in the presidential debate when Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and the two traded insults. It is expected to be fiery as Pence, who once hosted a radio show as a congressman, will debate with Harris who is a former prosecutor and is known for sharp questioning during Senate hearings.White supremacyAfter Biden’ nomination, Harris became the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s vice presidential ticket. As she faces off with Pence, who is white, Harris is expected grill Pence over Trump’s comments at the last debate where he declined to denounce white supremacy groups. During the first debate, the moderator asked whether Trump would condemn white supremacy. Trump responded saying, he mostly sees violence “from the left-wing.”Gender issuesTrump presidency has already been marred by criticism from various woman rights activists who accused the President of being sexist. Wednesday’s debate is featuring Harris and another woman as the moderator as against to the last debate, gender dynamics are expected to take a fair share of spotlight.Trump tweetsTrump who is known for his barrage of tweets, is expected to resume his habit as the debate will unfold in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-and-kamala-harris-all-set-to-face-off-in-vice-presidential-debate-what-to-expect/story-AciHBL3QeTSfSS5zDynjiJ.html

Delta is forecast to weaken and linger over Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula before strengthening again in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil companies were bracing for impact on their installations and ports closed.Officials ordered evacuations of Cancun’s hotel zone and other coastal areas, and opened the city’s convention center as a shelter. Workers at the Avis car rental firm boarded up windows with wood under a light rain on Tuesday afternoon.The governor of Quintana Roo state urged residents near the shore to evacuate, while recommending health precautions in shelters due to the coronavirus pandemic.“We have to prevent Covid in these sites, we have to take all preventative measures to this effect,” Governor Carlos Joaquin said, noting that the hurricane could take 12 hours to pass through the state after touching down by 2 a.m.Joaquin recommended households stock up on food and water for two or three days, anticipating delays in restoring water and electricity.A hurricane watch was in place for an area stretching from the beach town of Tulum, west past Cancun, and including Cozumel, an island made famous by Jacques Cousteau for the quality of its reef scuba diving.PANIC BUYINGSince Monday, local residents have formed long lines at supermarkets and construction stores to load up on food and supplies to protect their homes, television images showed.Panic buying left some shelves empty of basic pantry goods, said Marian Castro, who lives in Cancun’s hotel zone and recalls the destruction wrought by Category 5 Hurricane Wilma in 2005. “I’m not scared, because after Hurricane Wilma ... destroyed my house, this time we’re more prepared,” she said, pointing out her anti-cyclone windows.Water levels could rise by as much as 9 feet (3 m) over normal tide levels near Delta’s landfall, accompanied by dangerous waves in the hurricane warning area.The Yucatan peninsula was hit on the weekend by Hurricane Gamma, a smaller storm that nonetheless damaged property and forced restaurants and attractions to close, including the famed Chichen Itza pyramids.The region at the heart of Mexico’s tourist industry has suffered various setbacks in recent years, most recently from the coronavirus pandemic.Before that, the coast known as the Riviera Maya was affected by swaths of Sargasso seaweed on its pristine beaches.Cuba’s western province of Pinar del Rio and the Island of Youth also hunkered down ahead of tropical storm conditions, with schools closed and coastal areas evacuated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-cancun-braced-for-possibly-catastrophic-hurricane-delta/story-abBqZ5tBb8n7WjRtL76f3L.html
07-10-2020||World||Patel calls for review of UK visa used by Indian companies||Britain’s home secretary Priti Patel has ordered a review of the intra-company transfer (ICT) visas mostly issued to Indian companies that transfer employees to UK offices for varying periods, ahead of a new points-based immigration regime that takes effect in January.Official figures show that the ICT visa is mostly issued to Indians, reflecting the growing number of Indian software and other companies setting up base or servicing clients from a UK base. In the year ending June 2020, 48% of Tier 2 visas were granted to Indian professionals.The ICT visa is part of the Tier 2 visa route. Overall, there was a 20% fall in Tier 2 visas granted, and officials said that almost all of the fall was accounted for by a decrease in grants of ICT visas, which decreased by 38% (21,227) to 33,971 in the year ending June 2020. Much of this decline is as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, they added.Commissioning the review, Patel asked the Migration Advisory Committee to advise the Home Office on the salary threshold for entry to the ICT route; what elements, if any, beyond base salary should count towards meeting the salary requirement; whether different arrangements should apply to the very highly paid; what skills threshold for the route should be the conditions of the route, in particular those where it differs from the main Tier 2 route.She wrote to MAC chair Brian Bell: “It is our intention that the ICT route should sit alongside the new skilled worker route in the new points-based immigration system that we are launching in January and that the terms of the ICT route should, initially, be the same as now.”The ICT route currently has a different (and higher) salary threshold compared to the main Tier 2 route and different requirements, and the absence of any relating to English language. It also contains a sub-category for graduate trainees. Indian stakeholders have been urging UK authorities to exclude ICT visa holders from paying the mandatory National Insurance contribution, since they do not stay long enough in the UK to be eligible for state pension. The NI contribution is paid along with income tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patel-calls-for-review-of-uk-visa-used-by-indian-companies/story-M39isKFf1oZ49FhoWUo2FP.html
07-10-2020||World||Gene editing technique gets two women the Nobel prize for chemistry||From the hundred and thousands of years it takes for natural selection to change the genetic makeup of an organism, the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize for Chemistry brought it down to just a few hours. The biochemist duo Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were named for the prize for developing the revolutionary tool CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors in 2012. Adapted from the naturally occurring DNA-editing tool in the immune system of a bacteria, this “scissor” can be used to edit precise sections of the DNA. “There is enormous power in this genetic tool, which affects us all. It has not only revolutionised basic science, but also resulted in innovative crops and will lead to ground-breaking new medical treatments,” says Claes Gustafsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In the 111 occasions that the Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded since 1901, this is the first time two women have shared it. Till now, only five women had received the award, including Marie Curie in 1911 and her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie in 1935. French microbiologist and biochemist Charpentier, currently the director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, was interested in the research of pathogenic bacteria, particularly one that causes life-threatening complications such as sepsis (blood infection) and soft tissue breakdown in humans called Streptococcus pyogenes. On the other hand, America biochemist Doudna was fascinated with Ribonucleic Acid or RNA that plays a in coding, decoding, regulating and expression of the genes. She was studying the exciting new role of RNA in regulating gene expression, when she stumbled upon CRISPR or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. CRISPR is essentially a sequence that is repeated over and over again between unique sequences in the genetic material of various bacteria. What Doudna found was that the CRISPR associated genes (Cas) were similar to proteins that specialise in unwinding and cutting up DNA. At the same time, Charpentier’s study of the S. pyogenes found another piece of the puzzle – a previously unknown small RNA molecule called tracrRNA that exists in large amounts in the bacterium. Careful analysis of the genetic codes reveals that it indeed it is a part of the bacteria’s repetitive CRISPR system. A collaboration between the two researchers led to the understanding that the Cas9 is the scissor that cuts off the DNA molecule whereas the CRISPR was necessary to recognise where the cuts have to be made. In their natural form, the scissors recognise DNA from viruses, but Charpentier and Doudna proved that by changing the CRISPR part of the scissors to match the code where the cuts are to be made, any DNA could be edited at exactly the right places. Since their discovery, it has become extremely easy for scientists to play with the DNA of organisms to study their effect on the physical form. Apart from basic research, it has also helped in developing crops that can withstand moulds, pests and drought. It is also being used in the field of medicine to find ways to cure cancer and other inherited diseases. Theoretically, the technology makes it possible to select certain traits in off-springs by editing their genomes. But, globally scientists agree that germline editing or editing of traits that can be passed on to the next generation is irresponsible without data on the safety of the procedure. However, a controversy blew in November 2018 up when a Chinese scientist He Jiankui edited the embroyo of twins to delete a gene that makes them susceptible to HIV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gene-editing-technique-gets-two-women-the-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/story-xJvlPu9z28LKUEEzxXnzwK.html

Family and friends across the globe watched it on video.Mirpuri, whose family has links in India, said: “Thousands of weddings that usually take place in the summer have been postponed. It has been tough for the industry; billions of pounds have been lost. Guidelines are changing constantly. Many have postponed their big day to 2021”.“This wedding was a nice way to involve more than 15 people. The pre-wedding ‘sangeet’ and other events were held at the couple’s home. It was a risk and challenge for us to organise since it has never been done before; we didn’t know how it would work out,” she added.It took the London-born Mirpuri’s team two months to organise, after she and the couple realised the idea that started as a joke could work out. The guests in cars were provided with a hamper of snacks, hand-gel and plastic bags to put their rubbish in.On the day, the suitably attired Patel entered the park and travelled around in a decorated golf buggy driven by a venue staff member with a face mask. After the ceremony, the couple went round the park to greet the guests, who honked horns and flashed car lights.Mirpuri said: “I am really glad it worked out. We have now received several inquiries from couples. We have a blueprint now for a Covid-secure wedding. There are quite a few venues where similar weddings can be organised, using technology and following socially-distanced norms”.A spokesperson of Braxted Park added: “We are delighted to say…we were able to overcome these new restrictions in a safe and secure way by hosting our first ever (and we believe first for the UK) drive in wedding ceremony here at Braxted Park”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-jugaad-drive-in-to-a-big-fat-indian-wedding-in-uk/story-SOjQY6PuJTYPJdAfQqT7MJ.html

Authorities including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will observe the process.International travel has barely revived from a total lockdown as national restrictions and quarantines continue to limit services and put people off flying. The CommonPass app could help form the basis of a standardized system to overcome those curbs, according to the WEF, after slow progress with airport testing and so-called travel corridors aimed at restarting flights.The WEF said it developed the app alongside the Commons Project Foundation, a non-profit public trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-app-aims-to-restart-flights-with-proof-of-disease-free-status/story-kSYrGbQE30lU7y0N1CXfkM.html

The apex court last week barred the government from releasing them.Faisal Siddiqi, the lawyer representing Pearl’s family, told the media that the government prosecutor, Fiaz Shah, told the judges he needed more time for paperwork to prepare for the case.The court accepted his argument and adjourned the hearing till October 21.In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh, who was convicted in the abduction and murder of Pearl in 2002, to seven years. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case – almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.Two days after the Sindh High Court overturned Sheikh’s conviction, the Sindh government invoked the Maintenance of Public Order to keep the four convicts in jail. The Sindh government filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court verdict. Pearl’s parents also filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the high court to release the accused.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the alleged links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-s-murder-accused-to-remain-in-jail-for-another-three-months-in-pakistan/story-Svd0EgCZP55ohxOTD4bs7J.html
07-10-2020||World||Israeli PM’s wife may have violated lockdown with haircut||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife may have violated the country’s coronavirus lockdown by inviting a hairdresser into the official residence last week to prepare her for a public service video advocating the wearing of masks.The incident, first reported by the Yediot Ahronot daily, was the latest in a string of lockdown violations by Israeli leaders and public figures — drawing widespread criticism that they are undermining public trust in the government.Yediot reported that Sara Netanyahu had a hairdresser visit on the eve of the festive Sukkot holiday. Hair salons and barber shops are closed as part of a nationwide lockdown imposed last month, and people have been ordered to remain within 1,000 meters (yards) of home except for essential activities.The Netanyahus have long been criticized for enjoying a lavish lifestyle out of the reach of most Israelis. In past cases, Sara Netanyahu was fined thousands of dollars for using public money for her own extravagant tastes and for allegedly abusive behavior toward her personal staff.An official statement released in response to the news report said Sara Netanyahu was strictly abiding by all the coronavirus regulations, including sheltering at home and enforcing the wearing of masks at the official residence.As a public figure making an informational video, she believed she was entitled to employ the services of the hairstylist, the statement said. It added that they both wore masks and gloves during the appointment and that she asked the stylist to refrain from making conversation.The newspaper said that while the prime minister is entitled to such services as a public servant, his wife is not. An ordinary Israeli would pay a 500-shekel ($150) fine for violating the restriction.The prime minister has been the target of mass demonstrations in recent months, with protesters calling on him to step down while he is on trial for corruption and criticizing his response to the coronavirus.Israelis have also expressed anger about a number of recent instances in which senior officials and their family members violated lockdown orders. Netanyahu and the figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin, have both acknowledged improperly hosting relatives during the Passover holiday last spring.A Cabinet minister from Netanyahu’s Likud Party, Gila Gamliel, sparked uproar this week when it was discovered that she improperly traveled to the northern city of Tiberias for the Yom Kippur holy day last week and contracted the coronavirus. Israeli media have said she also lied to contact tracing investigators about her whereabouts.In June 2019, a court ordered Sara Netanyahu to pay a fine of more than $15,000 for misusing state funds after she was accused of misusing some $100,000 in state money on lavish meals. In 2016, a court ruled that she had mistreated a housecleaner and awarded the man $42,000 in damages. Other employees have also accused her of abuse.The Netanyahus have rejected all the allegations against them. Both say they have been the target of a “witch hunt” by hostile media and law enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-s-wife-may-have-violated-lockdown-with-haircut/story-DKhUtiOBOGxXRkPrEb8iRM.html
07-10-2020||World||Hurricane Delta, moving towards Mexico, weakens to category 3 storm||Hurricane Delta weakened to a Category 3 storm just hours before hitting the coast of Mexico, but remains life threatening.Maximum sustained winds are near 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) and the storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 8-12 feet along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, the National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday. The hurricane is predicted to strengthen again to Category 4 as it moves over the Gulf of Mexico toward the U.S. in the coming days.“Little change in strength is expected before the center reaches the coast of the Yucatan peninsula during the next few hours,” the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. “Although some weakening is likely when Delta moves over the Yucatan peninsula, re-strengthening is forecast when the hurricane moves over the southern Gulf of Mexico Wednesday night and Thursday.”The hurricane is forecast to churn through the energy-producing region of the Gulf before likely hitting Louisiana, which has been struck twice already this year, on Saturday.Delta’s winds can snap trees, flatten houses and cause power outages lasting weeks.“Extremely dangerous storm surge and hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico,” said Dan Brown, a meteorologist with the center.Delta threatens to become the latest in a string of deadly natural disasters in 2020, a year that has been marked by a hyperactive hurricane season, devastating wildfires and a derecho that wreaked havoc across the U.S. Midwest. It will be the record 10th tropical storm or hurricane to hit the U.S. in a year. So many have formed that the hurricane center has used up all the names on its official list and has resorted to the Greek alphabet to designate systems.Delta’s winds grew from 70 mph to 110 mph in 24 hours, which is the fastest intensification for an October storm since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Colorado State University’s Klotzbach said in a Tweet.Cancun and the nearby island of Cozumel are poised to “get hit hard,” said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. Delta could cause $12 billion to $16 billion in damage and losses to Mexico and another $2 billion to the U.S. coast later this week, depending on its exact path, he said.Mexico has started to evacuate the hotel zone in Cancun and the island of Holbox as the Yucatan readies for the impact of Delta, Quintana Roo Governor Carlos Joaquin said in a tweet. Meanwhile, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tuesday he’s sending 5,000 members of Mexico’s armed forces to the Yucatan for prevention efforts.Hurricane Wilma forced 70,000 people to flee and left 300,000 homeless after it struck the Yucatan in October 2005, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information. The storm came ashore with winds of 130 mph near Playa del Carmen on Oct. 22.Oil and gas producers including Enbridge Inc., BHP Group and Royal Dutch Shell Plc were evacuating or preparing to evacuate workers from Gulf platforms ahead of Delta. Operators had shut about 29% of crude production and 8.6% of gas output, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. The hurricane is poised to clip the Cameron liquefied natural gas plant, which had just resumed exports after being shut in late-August.After Delta loses power over the Yucatan, it’s expected to return briefly to Category 4 strength in the Gulf as it moves toward Louisiana, which was struck by Hurricane Laura in August. Cool water and wind shear in the northern Gulf could weaken Delta, but it will likely make landfall again as a hurricane, said Rob Miller, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc.“There is an increasing likelihood of life-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds, especially along the coasts of Louisiana and Mississippi, beginning on Friday,” the hurricane center’s Brown said in an advisory.New Orleans urged residents to “gather food, water & medication for at least three days” in a text via its emergency alert system on Tuesday.Miller said he expects the storm to strike somewhere west of New Orleans, but storm surge, heavy rains and winds could reach as far east as the Florida Panhandle.“This region of the county is the magnet for hurricanes this year,” Miller said.The Atlantic has spawned 25 storms this year, the second most on record after 2005, when deadly Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans.(Updates with category downgrade.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-moving-towards-mexico-weakens-to-category-3-storm/story-9hAhZbgnOtMj1TfgJxm4eL.html

Ha said the committee decided not to provide further details about Jo for his safety.Ha didn’t say how he obtained the information. It’s likely that he was debriefed about Jo by the National Intelligence Service, the country’s main spy agency, as committee members routinely meet NIS officers for discussions on North Korea.The NIS said it was checking reports about Jo’s arrival. South Korea’s foreign and unification ministries said they couldn’t confirm the reports.Before Jo, Thae Yong Ho, a former minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, was the most senior North Korean diplomat to defect to South Korea. He came to Seoul in 2016 and was elected to parliament this year. Thae said he had decided to defect because didn’t want his children to live “miserable” lives in North Korea and he was disappointed with Kim Jong Un.Thae issued a statement urging media outlets to refrain from exposing too much about Jo, citing worries about possible reprisal on his daughter left in North Korea.The motive for Jo’s departure from his Rome residence isn’t known. North Korea’s state media haven’t mentioned his possible defection.About 33,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the late 1990s to avoid political suppression and poverty in the North.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-north-korean-ambassador-to-italy-living-in-south-korea-claims-lawmaker/story-FLFoWSP5GELOM13TjLOIXN.html

They have been successfully used in countries around the world to drive prosperity and boost trade.Sunak, said: “Our new freeports will create national hubs for trade, innovation and commerce, regenerating communities across the UK and supporting jobs.” “They will attract investment from around the world as we embrace new opportunities following our departure from the EU and will be a key driver for economic recovery as we build back better post coronavirus.”Besides freeports in England, the government plans to set up at least one freeport in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The government will also introduce a package of tax reliefs on investment by businesses within freeport tax sites, new measures to speed up planning processes to accelerate development in and around freeports.The freeports are to be selected through a fair, transparent and competitive process, and will be expected to collaborate closely with key partners across the public and private sectors. The bidding process for locations to become a freeport in England will open by the end of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-brexit-uk-to-create-freeports-to-court-foreign-investment/story-u1pssmDtVZEivaPDAzppWP.html

The White House, in a statement late on Tuesday night, said that the President is improving America’s work visa programmes to prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect the American jobs and wages amidst the severe impact on the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic. The statement came hours after the Trump administration announced new restrictions on H-1B nonimmigrant visa programme which it said is aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners, a move which is likely to affect thousands of Indian professionals. The interim final rule announced by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday, less than four weeks ahead of the US presidential election, will narrow the definition of “specialty occupation” as Congress intended by closing the overbroad definition that allowed companies to game the system. The White House said that Trump is committed to making sure the American workers are not disadvantaged by foreign labour. “President Trump knows that H-1B visas should only be reserved for specialised talent that helps support a strong economy. For too long, this programme has been misused as an inexpensive labour programme, replacing American jobs in the process,” it said. “These critical reforms will improve the quality of the H-1B programme without changing the annual statutory cap for H-1B visas. The Trump administration is closing loopholes that have allowed employers in the United States to replace American workers with low-cost foreign labour,” the White House said. The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Such a decision by the Trump administration is likely to have an adverse impact on thousands of Indian IT professionals. Already a large number of Indians on the H-1B visas have lost their jobs and are headed back home during the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the US economy. The White House said that the Department of Homeland Security is tightening standards to require that foreign workers show specialised merit to establish their eligibility. It is also taking action to rein in “shadow,” third-party employers who use the H-1B programme to displace American workers and to reduce the validity period for H-1Bs used by these “shadow” employers, which will ensure more frequent vetting for compliance with H-1B programme requirements, the White House said. The Department of Homeland Security is codifying the existing authorities to conduct workforce inspections and clarifying that failure to fully cooperate with inspections may result in the denial or revocation of employer H-1B petitions, it said. “The Department of Labor is publishing a rule to appropriately identify the wage levels for H-1Bs and other foreign labour programmes, which will improve the quality of H-1B workers and better reflect wages paid to similarly employed workers in the United States,” the White House said. The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, it said. Asserting that Trump continues to stand up for the nation’s workers by taking action to preserve jobs for the American citizens, the White House said that earlier this year, the president signed an executive order to prevent federal dollars from being used to displace Americans with foreign workers or offshore labour. “To aid our nation’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the President placed a temporary pause on multiple categories of aliens from coming into the country for work. The Trump administration issued regulations that will, once in effect, remove the incentive to apply for asylum for the purpose of obtaining authorisation to work in the United States,” the White House said. Trump has worked tirelessly to reshore American supply chains, bring investments home from overseas and implement policies that promote buying and hiring American, it said. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin alleged that the “last-minute step is a ploy” to cover up for the President’s broken promise to stop H-1B abuse. “He never responded to my call at the start of his term to protect workers from H-1B abuses. Instead, his administration has granted tens of thousands of H-1B visas to outsourcing companies,” he said. Republican Congressman Lance Gooden supported the move. “The rule changes to H-1B visas are much needed reforms to a wildly abused programme. American workers who are struggling to get back on their feet will benefit from closing these loopholes,” Gooden said. Senator Marsha Blackburn thanked Trump for putting American workers first. “Refining the H-1B non-immigrant visa programme will protect US workers and restore integrity to the programme,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-visas-should-be-reserved-only-for-specialised-talent-to-support-strong-economy-white-house/story-tLxdtNelSoqBqRxHSlbxwO.html
07-10-2020||World||Australia expects Covid-19 vaccination is still a year away||Australia considered a rollout of a coronavirus vaccine no sooner than mid-2021 a best-case scenario in its pandemic planning that would save the economy tens of billions of dollars, the treasurer said on Wednesday.The Treasury and Health Departments developed economic modelling based on an assumption that a vaccine would be widely available in Australia toward the end of next year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.“These are very uncertain times and as a government, we have taken every step possible to give Australia the best possible chance of getting a vaccine,” Frydenberg told the National Press Club.Treasury modelling doesn’t contemplate a vaccine becoming available in Australia early next year. An early vaccine is regarded as one that is rolled out from July 1, providing certainty to households and businesses while promoting consumption and investment.This so-called upside scenario also assumes that international students would return to Australian universities late next year due to the vaccine. Hundreds of thousands of students from overseas have made the Australian universities sector one of the nation’s biggest earners of foreign currency.The scenario would boost Australian economic activity by 34 billion Australian dollars (USD 24 billion) above the current forecast in the June quarter of 2022. Economic growth would be 1.5 percentage points higher in the 2021-22 fiscal year than the 4.75 per cent currently forecast.Researchers are working on developing more than 170 potential Covid-19 vaccines. A June survey of 28 mostly US and Canadian vaccinology experts published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found most were pessimistic a vaccine would be available before mid-2021, but thought September or October was achievable.Frydenberg on Tuesday announced a raft of pandemic measures that would create a record Australian dollars 214 billion (USD 153 billion) deficit in the current fiscal year. Based on the assumption that a vaccine will become available closer to the end of 2021 than July, annual deficits are forecast to shrink in the next fiscal year and beyond.“We’re all hopeful ... that we will find a vaccine, and we have made that assumption based on the end of next year, but obviously as there are developments in the health and the global community, we’ll continue to update our position,” Frydenberg said on Wednesday.“There is a great deal of uncertainty in this pandemic,” he added.Australia has allowed for an earlier vaccine rollout with doses manufactured locally under deals struck with two pharmaceutical companies.If trials prove successful, the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and the University of Queensland/CSL will provide more than 84.8 million vaccine doses for the Australian population, almost entirely manufactured in Melbourne, with early access to 3.8 million doses of the University of Oxford vaccine in January and February 2021.The government has committed to make any vaccine available for free to Australia’s population of 26 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-expects-covid-19-vaccination-is-still-a-year-away/story-KOtgoRUgTmTL1TN9MtdQqI.html
07-10-2020||World||US agency wants two months safety data before approving Covid-19 vaccine||The US Food and Drug Administration made public its guidance for issuing emergency approval for a Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, making it clear it wants to see follow-up two months after trial volunteers have their second dose.It is therefore unlikely for President Donald Trump’s administration to have a vaccine on the market before the November 3 election, something the president frequently says is on the cards.“Data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile,” the document said.The two companies that are furthest along in their vaccine trials, Moderna and Pfizer, both began their final stages at the end of July, and both require two separate injections 28 days apart.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThat would mean that only the first few people who signed up for the trial would have completed the follow-up period by the end of October, and there would probably not be enough data to apply for emergency use.The vaccines will have to inoculate half of all patients against Covid-19. Additionally, there will need to be at least five cases of severe infection in the placebo group to prove the vaccine is effective.“FDA is committed to making the #Covid19 vaccine development process & our scientific evaluation as open & transparent as possible,” the agency’s head Stephen Hahn wrote on Twitter.The decision to issue the guidance comes amid a reported tug-of-war between the White House and the FDA.According to US media outlets, the White House viewed the two-month follow-up period as unnecessary and did not want the FDA to implement it.Trump expressed his disapproval on Twitter Tuesday night, writing: “New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job!”The news was welcomed by health experts who said it showed the agency was acting responsibly in the face of political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agency-wants-two-months-safety-data-before-approving-covid-19-vaccine/story-ycGczxN0qB72HiTpGiSNFI.html

The majority of the infected people are co-workers of the first patient, who was diagnosed at a hospital at the weekend and is from the densely populated Western province that includes the capital, Colombo.Hundreds of people — both factory workers and residents — waited in lines Tuesday at makeshift medical centers to be tested for the coronavirus in the small town of Minuwangoda, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Colombo, where the factory is located.Some who had tested positive were refusing to go to state-run treatment centers even after the government provided them with transport, Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said.A statement from Wanniarachchi warned that legal action will be taken under quarantine regulations against those who evade treatment. Violators of the law could face a fine and imprisonment up to three months.Separately, the health ministry ordered a halt to public gatherings such as exhibitions, parties, conferences, indoor or outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions.And police have widened the curfew in key suburbs of Colombo where many of the patients live. Previously, the government had closed schools, universities and imposed restrictions on public transport.Chief epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera said the new cluster poses a greater risk of spreading the virus in the broader society compared to Sri Lanka’s previous clusters.The government had long touted it had prevented community spread of the virus in Sri Lanka because all previously known cases were connected to 31 clusters and of them, only two remain active.Samaraweera said the risk is high with the new cluster as workers used to work very closely and also go home every day and mingle with others in the society. “Therefore, if people do not support us, we will find it difficult to control this.”Some of the workers come from different parts of the country. Local media reported police and health workers were visiting the homes of factory workers on leave and were testing them as well.The country has reported 3,733 patients with 13 deaths. Of the total patients, 3,266 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-widens-curfew-over-covid-19-those-evading-treatment-to-face-legal-action/story-Zf8Nm7RJdXLVhTNtB10deO.html
07-10-2020||World||Covid-19 likely to push 150 million people in extreme poverty by 2021, says World Bank||The World Bank on Wednesday warned that by 2021, as many as 150 million people are likely to be in extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic and countries will have to prepare for a “different economy” post-Covid by allowing capital, labour, skills and innovation to move into new businesses and sectors. The Covid-19 pandemic is estimated to push an additional 88 million to 115 million people into extreme poverty this year, with the total rising to as many as 150 million by 2021, depending on the severity of the economic contraction, according to the Washington-based global lender. This would represent a regression to the rate of 9.2 per cent in 2017, according to the biennial Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report. Had the pandemic not convulsed the globe, the poverty rate would have been expected to drop to 7.9 per cent in 2020, it said. “The pandemic and global recession may cause over 1.4 per cent of the world’s population to fall into extreme poverty,” World Bank Group President David Malpass said. “In order to reverse this serious setback to development progress and poverty reduction, countries will need to prepare for a different economy post-Covid, by allowing capital, labour, skills and innovation to move into new businesses and sectors,” he said. Noting that the new poor will be in countries that already have high poverty rates, the report said that a number of middle-income countries will see significant numbers of people slip below the extreme poverty line. About 82 per cent of the total will be in middle-income countries, the report estimates. The convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic with the pressures of conflict and climate change will put the goal of ending poverty by 2030 beyond reach without swift, significant and substantial policy action, the World Bank said, adding that by 2030, the global poverty rate could be about seven per cent. In its report, the World Bank noted that the lack of recent data for India severely hinders the ability to monitor global poverty. Absence of recent data on India, one of the economies with the largest population of extreme poor, creates substantial uncertainty around the current estimates of global poverty, the Bank said. Observing that effective approaches have tapped the skills and dedication of community members, the World Bank said that in Mumbai, city officials were able to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Dharavi, one of the city’s largest urban settlements, by mobilising community members and staff from private medical clinics for a strategy based on mass screening for fever and oxygen levels. In the space of three months, by July 2020, reported cases in the area had been cut to 20 per cent of their peak in May. To help poor families during the lockdown, foundations, non-governmental organisations and volunteers provided thousands of households with ration kits. Dharavi’s success stemmed from a combination of “customised solutions, community involvement and perseverance, it added. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 35 million people and killed more than 1 million across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 7.5 million cases and more than 2,10,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment.

Here’s what happened||White House senior adviser Stephen Miller is the latest in Donald Trump’s close circle to have tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday. Before him, several senior officials have reported positive crushing the myth of invincibility surrounding the White House. United States President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for the infection on October 2. Three days later, President Trump returned to the White House while still being infectious. Trump’s recent post that Covid-19 is just a flu is yet another remark which has drawn flak with Facebook and Twitter taking requisite action. “Take a look at what happened this week at the White House ,” top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said in an interview with American University’s Kennedy Political Union, when asked what advice he had about how people could discuss preventive actions with relatives who believed the pandemic was a hoax. Trump on many occasions has been spotted without a mask or face covering and his approach to ‘get out there and not fear Covid-19’ has further raised questions about the President’s concern towards the pandemic.Also Watch l ‘Don’t let Covid dominate you’: Trump returns to White House, removes mask Also Read: Facebook, Twitter take action over Trump’s posts suggesting Covid-19 is ‘just like flu’A ceremony held for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett at the Rose Garden on September 26 is being speculated as a Covid-19 spreader after several top White House members got infected post this event.Here is a look at some of the White House members who have contracted Covid-19:1.

The Bundle and Bhuddo islands that lie on one side of the city have largely remained untouched, with little vegetation and almost no humans living on them. Over the years, hundreds of strays, often escaping the cull, have found refuge on the islands and are helped by local fishermen who bring food and water to them on a regular basis. “If these dogs were living in the city they would have been shot dead by the municipal authorities,” says one animal rights activist. It is believed that local fishermen brought the dogs to the island to save them from imminent death.Most stray dogs in Karachi are killed by special squads who offer them poisoned food or shoot them. Dogs are considered unclean so there is little resistance against this culling activity from the local population.Last month, in a meeting between Prime Minister Khan and some leading businessmen, a consortium was formed to invest in two mega development projects — Urban Development and Bundle Island Project (UDBSP) in Karachi and Ravi RiverFront Urban Development Project (RRFUDP).The plan is to build a housing and entertainment complex on these islands and construct a causeway to connect the city to them. Currently the only way to reach these islands is by boat.A ray of hope has emerged in the form of the provincial Sindh government which objects to the manner in which the islands have been taken away from it. After Islamabad issued an ordinance to establish an Island Development Authority, the provincial government lodged a protest.Sindh government spokesman Murtaza Wahab said any island in Pakistani territory comes under the domain of the provinces. “The federal government took an unconstitutional step after issuing the island ordinance,” he said and demanded the government to immediately withdraw the ordinance.The Sindh government has said it will go to court to stop any construction taking place on the islands. But shipping minister Ali Zaidi under whose domain falls this issue has said that the government “will go ahead, no matter what.” In the meantime all the dogs can do is watch and wait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/karachi-s-famous-dog-islands-under-threat-of-urban-development/story-480rBWC3x8Lp9AmW3EJgrM.html
07-10-2020||World||Canada’s Justin Trudeau govt survives confidence vote||The Justin Trudeau government in Canada has survived a confidence vote in parliament after garnering support from the New Democratic Party, while every other opposition group voted against it.In the House of Commons, 177 voted in favour of the Throne Speech, the policy programme of the government presented by the Governor General when the session commenced. That was 25 more than the 152 MPs who voted against the Liberal Party government.This will also mean that the possibility of a snap election in autumn has receded.Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP, instructed members of his caucus to support the government after it made a pair of concessions in the benefits package that will come into effect to counter the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Among these are a national sickness benefit that will be available to those who are not covered by their employers, and an increase in the weekly payment from the proposed $400 to $500 to those rendered unemployed or underemployed due to the coronavirus crisis under the Canada Recovery Benefit.After the count was announced, leader of the government in the House Pablo Rodriguez tweeted, “The House just voted in favour of the Speech from the Throne. We are moving forward with our plan to protect the health and safety of Canadians while creating good jobs.”The two largest opposition parties in the House, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, voted against the government. They were joined by the Green Party, which had usually sided with the Liberals in recent times. Newly elected Green leader Annamie Paul, who recently became the first Black permanent leader of a federal party, described the government’s schemes as “platitudes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-justin-trudeau-govt-survives-confidence-vote/story-yxiSSj9p367t6fATeTHvLJ.html
07-10-2020||World||Trump admin orders better pays, higher qualifications for H-1Bs||The Trump administration on Tuesday announced new rules that will significantly raise wages for foreign workers on H-1B and narrow the eligibility criteria to qualify for these high-skilled visas. Both measures were aimed at preventing this programme from being used to displace Americans.Indian professionals are the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 visas issued every year.“These regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counterproductive to their very objective of saving the American economy and jobs,” said Nasscom, a trade body of India’s IT businesses. “This is particularly relevant at a time when U.S. businesses continues to face a huge deficit of STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills.”The White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump wanted to improve work visa programmes to “prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect American jobs and wages” and intended H-1B visas to “be reserved for specialised talent that helps support a strong economy”. The changes announced on Tuesday will be introduced as “interim final rules” and will go into effect separately, issued by separate federal agencies. The rule on higher wages, which goes into effect from Thursday, will be issued by the department of labour . It will be aimed at “strengthening wage protections, addressing abuses in these visa programmes, and ensuring American workers are not undercut by cheaper foreign labour”, said secretary of labour Eugene Scalia.US employers hiring foreign workers on H-1B and other work visas will be required to pay foreign workers prevailing wages or the actual wage paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications. The labour department will publish profession-specific prevailing wages based on surveys.“The prevailing wage rates in these programmes thus play an integral role in protecting US workers from unfair competition posed by the entry of lower cost foreign labour into the US labour market,” said the department.Critics of the H-1B programme have long argued it has been used to displace American workers by outsourcing their jobs to companies that use foreign workers, who are cheaper. The department of homeland security’s interim final rule (IFR) changing the definition of “speciality occupation” is expected to become effective in 60 days. The department said the rule will narrow the definition of specialty occupation by “closing the over-broad definition that allowed companies to game the system”.A basic college degree will not be sufficient any longer to quality for an H-B under the new rule. An applicant for a job in electrical engineering, for instance, will be required to have a degree in electrical engineering, not computers.“We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security. Put simply, economic security is homeland security. In response, we must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the American worker is put first,” said DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf.The new rule is expected to cut the number of H-1B petitions filed every year — around 200,000 — by a third, according to a senior DHS official.The department will also closely monitor third-party employers who hire H-1B workers and contract them out to work for US companies. The White House called them “shadow” employers. Their employees will be granted reduced validity H-1B visa, possibly a year at a time. The normal term is three years, extendable by another three.The DHS said it was skipping the usual notice-and-comment period as it rushes the rule to ensure that employing H-1B workers will not “worsen the economic crisis caused by Covid-19 and adversely affect wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers.”But the H-1B programme has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration from 2017, when the president signed the Buy American, Hire American executive order intending to rid the programme of abuse and fraud.“The pandemic has given this administration a pretext to enact all sorts of damaging and extreme immigration restrictions—against refugees, relatives of US citizens, and highly skilled immigrants as well,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.The rules are expected to be challenged in courts on the grounds, among other things, the forgoing of the notice-and-comments period.President Trump has suspended all immigrant and non-immigrants visas — except for certain health professionals — to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs becoming available in an economy crippled by Covid-19 and related lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-orders-better-pays-higher-qualifications-for-h-1bs/story-OVxIMFH2hX4mVIJYnwrDkN.html

07-10-2020||World||Category 4 Hurricane Delta roars towards Mexico’s Cancun area||Hurricane Delta, a slightly weakened but still dangerous Category 4 storm, barrelled toward Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) for an expected landfall south of the Cancun resort before dawn Wednesday. Quintana Roo Gov. Carlos Joaquín said the state government had prepared, but warned residents and tourists that “it is a strong, powerful hurricane,” though he considered it a good sign that Delta had weakened a bit late Tuesday. He said the area hadn’t seen a storm like it since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Delta increased in strength by 80 mph in just 24 hours, more than doubling from a 60 mph storm at 2 p.m. EDT Monday to 140 mph at 2 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Its top winds peaked at 145 mph (230 kph) before weakening slightly late Tuesday as it closed in on Yucatan. Forecasters warned it was still an extremely dangerous storm despite that weakening, saying it threatened to bring a life-threatening storm surge that could raise water levels 9 to 13 feet (2.7 to 4 meters), along with large and dangerous waves and flash flooding inland. Delta was centered 135 miles (220 kilometers) from Cozumel late Tuesday and moving west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Thousands of Quintana Roo residents and tourists waited for the storm hunkered down in dozens of government shelters. Everyone was ordered off the streets by 7 p.m. Throughout Tuesday the evacuations of low lying areas, islands and the coastline expanded as Delta exploded over warm Caribbean waters into a major hurricane. Much of Cancun’s hotel zone was cleared out as guests were bused to inland shelters. In Cancun alone, the government opened 160 shelters. Some 300 guests and nearly 200 staff from the Fiesta Americana Condesa hotel were taken to the Technological Institute of Cancun campus. All wearing masks, they spread out on thin mattresses in a classroom building and tried to get comfortable as workers boarded the building’s windows in a light rain. Some played cards or watched videos on their phones, while others called relatives. “The hotel has done a good job of making sure that we were provided for and that we’re going to be safe here in this place, so we don’t have any concerns at all,” said Shawn Sims, a tourist from Dallas sheltering with his wife, Rashonda Cooper, and their sons, 7-year-old Liam and 4-year-old Easton. “This is my first (hurricane) experience, but I see that these guys have a plan and they know what they’re doing,” Sims said. State tourism officials said more than 40,000 tourists were in Quintana Roo, a fraction of what would normally be there. Delta’s damage comes on top of months of pandemic-induced lockdown that has devastated the state’s tourism industry. At the Cancun Convention Center, 400 tourists from hotels and rental properties bunked for the night. “We hope that in this place we are surely much safer,” Quintana Roo Tourism Secretary Marisol Vanegas said. “This is a structure that has withstood other hurricanes.” Delta was forecast to spend several hours lashing the Yucatan Peninsula before moving into the Gulf of Mexico and re-strengthening before a strike on the U.S. Gulf coast later in the week. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Delta was expected to make landfall there Friday night or Saturday morning and the entire state is in the storm’s possible path. State and local officials in coastal areas were shoring up levees, sandbagging and taking other protections measures, he said. Louisiana is still recovering from Hurricane Laura, which ravaged the southwestern region as it roared ashore as a Category 4 storm in August. More than 6,600 Laura evacuees remain in hotels around the state, mainly in New Orleans, because their homes are too heavily damaged to return. Mexico put the commander of its navy in charge of the federal response. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday that 5,000 federal troops and emergency personnel were being made available in Quintana Roo to aid in storm efforts. Local and state officials urged residents to move to shelters. Juan Carlos Avila arrived at the Technological Institute of Cancun shelter with his seven-months pregnant wife, Joselyn, and their 3-year-old-son, Alexander. He said the staff had made them comfortable and seemed well prepared. The family, which lives in Miami, had been in Cancun a week and already went through Tropical Storm Gamma, which soaked the area over the weekend. “We’ve practically lived in storms during our stay here in Cancun,” Avila said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/category-4-hurricane-delta-roars-towards-mexico-s-cancun-area/story-81YYrdZdlZMJgydecendnI.html

Critics have said the program has depressed salaries in some professions. “We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security,” acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement.“Put simply, economic security is homeland security. In response, we must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the American worker is put first.”Last week, US District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction to block the government from ending the H-1B visa program, in a case brought by the US Chamber of Commerce and supported by technology trade groups.TechNet, a trade group which includes many Silicon Valley firms, denounced the new regulations, calling it an effort to circumvent the court order.“The administration is flouting the court’s ruling by issuing different rules to try to obtain the result it wants,” TechNet president Linda Moore said.“This new rule only harms America’s ability to recover from the pandemic during this critical time and has zero impact on increasing domestic American jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tightens-rules-for-h-1b-visas-used-by-tech-firms/story-gD8Z2xbTiFDzcvtZjrtBhP.html

Health officials had raised concerns that infections will rise because of increased travel during the five-day Chuseok harvest holiday that ended Sunday. The figures released by health officials Wednesday brought South Korea’s case total to 24,353 for the pandemic, including 425 deaths. Ninety-two of the newly confirmed cases were in the Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the center of a viral resurgence since mid-August. Health officials have been struggling to track transmissions linked to various places, including hospitals, churches, restaurants and an army unit in Pocheon, north of Seoul, where 37 soldiers so far have tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-reports-over-100-new-cases-of-covid-19-for-the-first-time-in-a-week/story-raT0ES7ylD1SLalTwirjBO.html
07-10-2020||World||Nobel Prize for Chemistry: Marie Curie, daughter Irene among five women ever awarded||The Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this year will be announced on Wednesday by the Stockholm-based Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Previously, the prize was given to 183 individuals on 111 occasions.However, the prize was not awarded on eight earlier occasions, including 1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940, 1941 and 1942 because of the prevailing World I and II, for not meeting the criteria in the foundation’s statutes. The award has been received by 71 scientists from the United States of America (USA), followed by 33 from Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) each, respectively.Also read: Three scientists share Nobel Physics Prize 2020 for their work on black holesThree of the four Nobel laureates, who have been awarded twice, have received one of their awards in chemistry. Marie Curie, the only woman to have received two Nobel Prizes, received the recognition for physics and chemistry.British biochemist Frederick Sanger had received it twice for his work on structure of proteins, especially that of insulin. He was one of only two persons, who was honoured in the same category.Linus Pauling, the only person to receive two unshared Nobel Prizes, had received the recognition for chemistry and peace. While John Bardeen was awarded two Nobel Prizes for Physics. Three Nobel recipients – two of whom had received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry – were forbidden by German Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler from accepting the award.The Nobel Prize for Chemistry for 1938 was given to the Richard Kuhn for his work on carotenoids, which are pigments in plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, and vitamins and to Adolf Butenandt for his work on sex hormones. Both had rejected the prize initially, but later had accepted it after World War II. The third person to refuse the award was Gerhard Domagk, who had received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1939. The youngest person to receive the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was Frédéric Joliot at the age of 35 in 1935. He had received the prize with his wife Irène Joliot-Curie, the daughter of Marie and Pierre Curie.So far, five women have received the coveted award, including Marie Curie and her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie. The others to receive the award were Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1964, Ada Yonath (2009), and Frances H. Arnold (2018).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-for-chemistry-marie-curie-daughter-irene-among-five-women-ever-awarded/story-OkvOFferkwWD2WYGORofqL.html
07-10-2020||World||Covid: Trump administration to sharply limit skilled-worker visas amid job losses||The Trump administration announced plans Tuesday to sharply limit visas for skilled workers from overseas, a move officials said was a priority amid job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor officials said new rules for what’s known as the H1-B program will restrict who can obtain a work visa and will impose additional salary requirements on companies seeking to hire foreign workers.Acting Deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said about one-third of the people who have applied for H1-B visas in recent years would be denied under the new rules, which also will include limits on the number of specialty occupations available under the program.President Donald Trump in June issued an order temporarily suspending the H-1B program until the end of the year.The new rules reflect a broader effort by his administration to curb both legal and illegal immigration, an issue important to Trump’s base even if it’s less prominent in his campaign this year than in 2016.A new requirement that employers pay higher prevailing wages to foreign workers will take effect in the coming days, reflecting the need to help the job market recover from the coronavirus shutdown, said Deputy Secretary of Labor Patrick Pizzella.“With millions of Americans looking for work, as the economy continues its recovery, immediate action is needed to guard against the risk lower-cost foreign labor can pose to the well-being of US workers,” Pizzella said.The H-1B program was created under President George H.W. Bush to help companies fill specialized jobs as the tech sector began to boom and it was harder to find qualified workers. Many companies insist they still need the program to fill critical positions.Critics include labor advocates as well as people who seek limits on legal immigration. But supporters argue that H-1B holders fill critical needs and don’t necessarily take jobs from Americans, but rather help expand the economy and create more opportunity.Increasing the required wages will especially hurt startups and smaller enterprises that may be unable to meet the increased requirements, said Cornell University Law School professor Steve Yale-Loehr, an expert in immigration law. “Companies may decide to offshore jobs overseas, hurting US workers,” said Yale-Loehr.Cuccinelli and Pizzella said the program has been abused to allow companies to displace American workers with less expensive employees from overseas.“US workers are being ousted from good paying, middle-class jobs and replaced with non-US workers,” Pizzella said. “It has also caused US wages in some instances to stagnate. That is wrong.”Among the new rules are significant limits on “offsite” firms that bring in large numbers of H-1B visa holders and then provide those workers under contract to other companies for a fee, a loophole that has been the subject of fraud and other abuse.There would also be increased workplace inspections and additional oversight of the H-1B program, Cuccinelli said.The US can issue up to 85,000 H-1B visas per year in technology, life sciences, health care and other sectors. They are typically issued for an initial period of three years and can be renewed. People from India and China make up the majority of the estimated 500,000 H-1B visa holders in the US. Officials said the Department of Labor rules would take effect immediately after publication in the federal register later this week while those that fall under the Department of Homeland Security would be adopted after a public comment period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-trump-administration-to-sharply-limit-skilled-worker-visas-amid-job-losses/story-4RjQa2FUNPkaMdfhGmL89N.html
07-10-2020||World||Democrats ask if more material omitted from SC nominee Barrett’s response||Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling on the Justice Department to provide any missing materials from a questionnaire completed by Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.Barrett, who was nominated to the high court last month by President Donald Trump, signed a 2006 newspaper ad sponsored by an anti-abortion group in which she said she opposed “abortion on demand” and defended “the right to life from fertilization to the end of natural life.”The ad was not included in materials Barrett provided to the Judiciary Committee for her pending Supreme Court nomination, nor in 2017, when she was nominated to the job she holds as a Chicago-based federal appeals court judge.In a letter Tuesday signed by all 10 Democrats on the Judiciary panel, lawmakers asked the Justice Department to explain the omission and confirm whether any other materials have been left out from the Senate questionnaire. If so, the department should immediately provide the materials for committee review, the senators said.A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department has received the letter and is reviewing it.Democrats don’t have the votes to block Barrett’s nomination, but they are trying to slow it down as Republicans speed ahead with an aggressive timetable, starting with hearings next week, aimed at confirming her before the election. Trump backs moving ahead quickly and on Tuesday called off negotiations on further coronavirus relief, saying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should focus “full time” on confirming Barrett.The 2006 ad, an open letter signed by Barrett and others, “opposed women’s reproductive freedoms and explicitly called for overturning Roe v. Wade,’‘ the landmark Supreme Court decision on abortion, senators wrote. The ad also referred to “the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.’‘The ad, which had more than 1,200 names attached to it, appears to be the most direct expression of Barrett’s opposition to abortion and has intensified debate over whether she would vote to restrict, if not overturn, abortion rights if confirmed to the Supreme Court.Barrett’s failure to disclose the 2006 letter “leads to additional questions about other potentially missing materials,’‘ the Democratic senators wrote in the letter.It also raises concerns that the process of collecting materials responsive to the Senate questionnaire, “like the nomination process itself, has been rushed, for no legitimate reason,” the senators wrote. The letter was signed by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, and nine other Democrats.White House spokesperson Judd Deere said last week that Barrett, who is Catholic, has distinguished her personal views from her responsibilities as a judge. “As Judge Barrett said on the day she was nominated, ‘A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,’ ” Deere said in an email.Meanwhile, an outside group advocating for conservative judges announced on Tuesday a 15-member team of pro bono legal professionals who will be conducting rapid response and other campaign-style support for Barrett’s confirmation.“The confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the opportunity of more than a lifetime to create the first true conservative majority on the Supreme Court in over 80 years,” said Mike Davis, a former chief counsel to Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who now heads the Article Three Project. He said the group is prepared to “do whatever it takes to push Judge Barrett’s nomination over the finish line by the end of October.”At a separate news conference Tuesday, several Senate Democrats said Barrett has a clear record of opposing abortion rights.“Judge Barrett has shown by her past writings and by passing the Trump test (for a Supreme Court nominee) that she would overturn Roe v. Wade,″ said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee.Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, another committee member, also attended the news conference, which focused on abortion rights and included advocacy groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-ask-if-more-material-omitted-from-sc-nominee-barrett-s-response/story-cf9037aw60NA3l3Z7JddUM.html
07-10-2020||World||Facebook, Instagram ban QAnon conspiracy-linked accounts ahead of US polls||Facebook on Tuesday announced a ban on all accounts linked to the QAnon conspiracy group, as the social network tries to clamp down on misinformation ahead of the heated US presidential election.The move against QAnon at Facebook and its image-sharing platform Instagram comes as the online giant tries to avoid being used to deceive or confuse voters, as was the case during the 2016 election that put US President Donald Trump in the White House.“We will remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content,” the internet titan said in a blog post.From an anonymous 2017 posting claiming bizarre child exploitation and political plots, the headless and bodiless movement has earned a place in Trump’s Twitter stream.The FBI last year said in a report that QAnon was one of several movements that could drive “both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts.”The ban on QAnon accounts steps up Facebook’s efforts to clamp down on misinformation campaigns sometimes endorsed by Trump, weeks ahead of the November 3 presidential election.“Facebook’s decision to ban QAnon from all its platforms is a much needed, if belated, step to purge dangerous conspiracy theories from the platform,” said Anti-Defamation league chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt.“We hope that this is a sincere effort to purge hate and antisemitism from their platform, and not another knee-jerk response to pressure from members of Congress and the public.”The moves made across Facebook and Instagram were against accounts tied to “offline anarchist groups that support violent acts amidst protests, US-based militia organizations and QAnon,” according to the blog post.The leading social network recently prohibited ads that praise, support or represent militarized social movements and QAnon.Facebook in August removed hundreds of groups tied to QAnon and imposed restrictions on nearly 2,000 more as part of a crackdown on stoking violence.Critics have charged that inflammatory content from QAnon was spreading on Facebook despite the platform’s proclaimed effort to contain it.Stoking flames Facebook said it tightened its prohibition on QAnon after noticing that, despite taking down posts directly promoting violence, QAnon supporter messages adapted to avoid restrictions.For example, QAnon used the platform to claim deadly wildfires raging on the West Coast were started by certain groups, which diverted attention of police and firefighters.“QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another,” Facebook said.The social network already bans content calling for violence and organizations that proclaim violent missions.The increasingly visible and vocal followers of QAnon promote a bewildering blend of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.Once on the fringes of the internet and focused on US politics, the movement has seen sharp growth on mainstream social media platforms this year.The movement centered on the unsubstantiated belief that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshippers has extended that this year to allege, without proof, that the coronavirus is a conspiracy by that group to control people using vaccines and 5G.Social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube have ramped up surveillance for QAnon content, as adherents attempt to bypass the new filters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-instagram-ban-qanon-conspiracy-linked-accounts-ahead-of-us-polls/story-ySfxWXgPenuAU2XanGc75O.html

07-10-2020||World||Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse: Report||The Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual predators for decades, preferring instead to safeguard its own reputation, and created a culture where abusers were able to hide, an independent report said Tuesday.The report, published by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, also found examples of clergymen being ordained despite a history of child sexual offenses.The inquiry heard that, from the 1940s to 2018, 390 people who were either members of the clergy or in positions of trust associated with the church had been convicted of sexual offences against children.The report found that, in many cases, the Church of England failed to take the abuse allegations seriously, and that perpetrators were “given more support than victims.”“Over many decades, the Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual abusers, instead facilitating a culture where perpetrators could hide and victims faced barriers to disclosure that many could not overcome,” the inquiry’s chairwoman, Alexis Jay, wrote.The report said sometimes sexual offenses were minimized. Citing the case of Reverend Ian Hughes, who was convicted in 2014 of downloading 8,000 indecent images of children, the report said that a fellow clergyman, Bishop Peter Foster, suggested to the inquiry that Hughes had been “misled into viewing child pornography” — even though more than 800 of the images were graded at the most serious level of abuse.The Church of England acknowledged Tuesday that progress has been too slow in supporting abuse victims and survivors, and said it was “completely committed” to improving this.“The report makes shocking reading and while apologies will never take away the effects of abuse on victims and survivors, we today want to express our shame about the events that have made those apologies necessary,” it said in a statement. “The whole Church must learn lessons from this inquiry.”The church announced last month that it had set up a large compensation fund for survivors of past abuse by members of the clergy.The report came after the inquiry held several public hearings in 2018 and 2019. The inquiry last year published a linked report focusing on disgraced bishop Peter Ball, who was imprisoned in 2015 for sexually abusing 18 young men over three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/church-of-england-failed-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-report/story-tjRvLqKtMLX0pOdCZg1n0K.html
07-10-2020||India||Ahead of BJP’s march to Nabanna, Bengal govt shuts secretariat; says it needs sanitisation||With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) planning to hold its biggest agitation this year by marching to Nabanna, the main secretariat in Howrah district, on Thursday; the state government declared that all offices in the building will remain closed for two days for sanitisation. The announcement was made shortly before working hours came to an end on Wednesday. Writers’ Building, the old secretariat in Kolkata, will also remain shut for sanitisation on Thursday and Friday, the government said. Since the Covid-19 pandemic started in March, the secretariats are sanitized mostly during the weekends barring a few exceptions. Thursday’s agitation has been organised by the BJP’s youth wing. BJP leaders said Union home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda showed interest when they were informed about the programme during a recent party meeting in Delhi. In a parallel development, the Kolkata Police did not give permission to the BJP to take out processions from Central Avenue and Hastings. The party had planned to approach the secretariat from four directions. Short videos were aired on local television channels to create awareness about the agitation. “It seems the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has already realised that its days are numbered. Our programme will be held peacefully as planned. We are not going to Nabanna to take over the building,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the party, has planned and organised the ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (March to Nabanna) programme with a seven-point agenda to highlight various issues ranging from lack from employment in Bengal to law and order problem. Thousands of party workers from Kolkata and the districts are supposed to take part in it. Several central leaders, including BJYM national president Tejasvi Surya arrived in Kolkata on Tuesday. “The government has suffered a nervous breakdown. It does not want to face the masses,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu. TMC leaders did not comment on the state government’s decision but CPI (M) legislator and central committee member Sujan Chakraborty took at a jibe at the government. “When Left parties and their youth organisations held a similar agitation in 2017 the police showered batons and teargas shells on our people. Mamata Banerjee is keeping the coast clear for the BJP by shutting down the secretariat. BJP workers can freely march to Nabanna. They seem to have reached an understanding,” quipped Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-bjp-s-march-to-nabanna-bengal-govt-shuts-secretariat-says-it-needs-sanitisation/story-eOGjYmXXuQE99jU2Hwb4yN.html

Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a high-level review meeting with officials of the agriculture and marketing departments to discuss the procurement of agriculture produce from farmers this season. While the new agriculture act enacted by the Centre says farmers can sell their produce wherever they wanted, the chief minister asked the farmers not to bring their paddy to the markets and face problems. He also assured that the government would ensure minimum support price to the farmers for their produce. “The entire quantity of paddy produced by farmers this “Vanakalam” (Kharif season) will be purchased by the government departments at the village-level itself. Since there is still Corona fear lingering, various government agencies would be sent to the villages to purchase the entire paddy produced by farmers,” an official statement from the chief minister’s office said, quoting the chief minister.He instructed that officials purchase the entire paddy in the state by setting up 6,000 purchasing centres and ensure that every grain of paddy is purchased. He reiterated that the government’s aim was to stand by farmers at every stage from extending financial assistance for crop investment to purchasing the produce. He directed that paddy with less than 17 percent moisture would be purchased by the state government at Rs 1,888 per Quintal MSP for Grade A Variety and Rs 1,868 per Quintal MSP for the Grade B variety. He instructed the agriculture, marketing and civil supplies department officials to take precautions at every point. He wanted the officials to make an estimate on how much paddy would be available and prepare a purchasing plan accordingly. KCR also asked the officials to ensure that the farmers get their money on the sale of paddy immediately along with the Bank Guarantees. Similarly, the chief minister also instructed the authorities to make arrangements for purchase of entire production of red gram (tur dal) from the farmers. He complimented the farmers for cultivating red gram in 10.78 lakh acres as directed under the Regulatory Farming policy of the government. At the same time, the government would also make arrangements for procurement of cotton through Cotton Corporation of India. “Continuous discussions are taking place with the CCI in this regard,” the chief minister said. This season, there was a record cultivation of crops in Telangana in 134.87 lakh acres. Of this, paddy was cultivated in 52.77 lakh acres, cotton in 60.36 Lakh acres and red gram in 10.78 lakh acres. Meanwhile, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman paid a visit to Jakkula Nekkalam village of Gannavaram block in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district and explained to local farmers about the benefits of the new agriculture acts enacted by the Centre. Accompanied by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders Sunil Deodhar, G V L Narasimha Rao, Kanna Lakshminarayana and P V N Madhav, the finance minister interacted with the farmers to know about their cropping pattern, remunerative price for their crops and the market situation. The farmers told Sitaraman that they were not getting remunerative price for food grains and sugarcane. Stating that they were not getting bank loans for raising sugarcane, they requested that the government take steps for ensuring adequate prices for their crops. The FM told the farmers that the new act enabled them to sell their produce wherever they get remunerative price. She suggested authorities educate the farmers about the new Acts. It may be mentioned that the ruling YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh is supporting the new legislation on agriculture and its MPs voted in favour of them in Parliament. On the other hand, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi strongly opposed the new acts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officers-will-visit-villages-to-buy-entire-paddy-kcr-messages-farmers/story-y10GSQbuqbdpnmA84XiUGI.html
07-10-2020||India||Funding for NE road development increased||New Delhi: The Centre has increased funding for road development in the Northeast by 95% from Rs 390 crore to Rs 760 crore, seeking to reinforce infrastructure in the strategic region, especially in border areas. The is the second consecutive increase of funding for the region in the current fiscal year under the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme in the North East (SARDP-NE). In August, the ministry of road transport and highways increased the allocation from Rs 290 crore to Rs 390 crore.Until September this financial year, the Centre allocated Rs 6,780 crore for national highways in the Northeastern region, according to transport ministry data. The government has been trying to reinforce infrastructure in areas considered strategic amid a tense standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries along the Line of Actual Control in the eastern Ladakh sector since May. The government in August also increased funding for border road development projects and raised the allocation for maintenance of frontier roads, HT reported on August 28.Funding for road development projects in border areas has been raised from Rs 340 crore to Rs 440 core in the current financial year. The budget for maintenance of border roads has gone up from Rs 120 crore to Rs 220 crore; in June, the ministry of road transport and highways raised the allocation for border road maintenance by four times to Rs 120 crore.In addition, the transport ministry has also sanctioned Rs 850 crore to the National Highway & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) towards expenditure incurred on sanctioned SARDP-NE-related projects during the current financial year.According to a transport ministry circular reviewed by HT on the revised allocation of funds for expenditure on sanctioned SARDP-NE-related works during the 2020-21 financial year, the allocation to the regional offices of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam has increased from Rs 200 crore and Rs 190 crore, respectively, to Rs 300 crore and Rs 460 crore, taking the total funding for SARDP-NE in the financial year 2020-21 to Rs 760 crore.SARDP-NE is to be taken up in three parts; Under Phase A, about 4,099 km of roads (3,014 km of national highways and 1,085 km of state roads) are to be improved. The phase is expected to be completed by FY 2023-24, according to the ministry. Phase B covers 3,723 km (2,210 km of NHs and 1,513 km of state roads). The third is the Arunachal Pradesh package involving development of about 2,319 km length of roads (2,205 km of NHs and 114 km of state /general staff /strategic roads) has also been approved by the government. The entire Arunachal Pradesh package is targeted for completion by FY 2023-24.The government has spent an amount of Rs. 30,315 crore on SARDP-NE including the Arunachal Pradesh Package, so far.There is a continuous need for revising budgetary support for roads in the Northeast, said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president of the Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research (CDEP).“It is important to build the road infrastructure in the northeast from three perspectives; It is critical from a military perspective...road and rail linkages are critical to support war efforts,” Bhattacharya said. “It is our moral duty to provide proper connectivity to our citizens in the northeast. And from an economic perspective, it is roads that being prosperity in the region and building these roads also align us to the government’s Act East policy. The roads will help the Northeast connect with the ASEAN markets of Myanmar, Thailand and beyond. However, we need to keep in mind that building roads in the toughest of hills in the world will be many times more expensive than building roads on plains. Hence the need for continuous re-evaluation of budgetary support for the roads.”“New Delhi’s hectic infrastructure building activities in the northeastern states indicates a new awareness within the country’s decision-making elite that physical connectivity is instrumental in moving from Look East to Act East. While the China threat has clearly quickened the process of building border infrastructure in the northeast, , improved connectivity in the region will bring it closer to the national mainstream, and will dampen several of the region’s local insurgencies,” strategic expert Happymon Jacob, an associate professor of disarmament studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/funding-for-ne-road-development-increased/story-u3WywqcbTCAmp89WdeFhvI.html

Doval hosted a dinner for Abdullah’s delegation that was attended by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, army chief Gen MM Naravane, senior officials of the external affairs ministry and key members of the High Council for National Reconciliation.Abdullah tweeted that he had a “constructive discussion” with Doval on the Afghan peace process and the talks in Doha. “He [Doval] assured me of India’s full support for the peace efforts, and that any peace settlement acceptable to Afghans, will have the support of India,” Abdullah said.“He [Doval] further stated that his country is in favour [of] an independent, democratic, sovereign & peaceful Afghanistan, where no terrorists can operate,” he added.Abdullah also thanked India for its continued support for Afghanistan and its “constructive role in peace efforts”.There was no official word on the meeting from the Indian side.Abdullah arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday afternoon for a five-day visit, during which he will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday and external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday. He will also deliver a speech at the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) on Thursday. Before his arrival in India, Abdullah issued a statement that described India as a “strategic partner of Afghanistan”. He said, “Our historical relation with India is very important to us, and the role of India in establishing a lasting peace in Afghanistan and the region is vital. I am visiting India on an official invitation by the government of India to discuss the peace efforts, and the need for regional consensus and support for the Afghan peace process.” Abdullah’s visit is part of an outreach to key countries in the region for support for the negotiations in Doha. He travelled to India after a three-day visit to Pakistan last week. In Islamabad, he had met Prime Minister Imran Khan, foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa. Abdullah told the Pakistani leadership that a message about reducing violence and showing greater flexibility in negotiations should be communicated to the Taliban leadership participating in the negotiations in Doha. India, the region’s largest provider of development aid to Afghanistan, has expressed concern at a recent spike in violence by the Taliban and terror attacks on minorities such as Sikhs. It has said intra-Afghan negotiations must ensure the interests of minorities, women and vulnerable sections of society and reduce violence across Afghanistan and its neighbourhood. Since 2001, India has undertaken projects worth $3 billion in Afghanistan, including $1 billion pledged in 2016 under the “new development partnership” scheme for five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-ajit-doval-meets-afghan-peace-negotiator-abdullah-abdullah-in-delhi/story-M6KRpC6YzM7ZX6HHveZDcL.html

The party also projected graphic images showing Modi’s record in elected office as compared to legendary figures like Franklin Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterrand, leaders who made important contributions to their nations.“Be it as a Chief Minister for Gujarat or as the Prime Minister of the world’s largest democracy, Narendra Modi has always been a crusader for people’s welfare,” the party said on social media.

He said, “Before BJP came to power, there was a culture of multiparty democracy and coalitions. These coalitions led to corruption across the nation, turned poor people into a vote bank and created an erroneous foreign policy.”Shah pointed out that as a chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi worked hard to develop the state’s infrastructure and ensured that people living in the state are safe and secure. Shah also highlighted that Modi’s performance as a chief minister was exemplary and hence he was chosen as BJP’s prime ministerial candidate for the 2014 elections.“PM Modi lifted the incomes of the poor and farmers. He wanted reforms and ensured that the impoverished not only have benefits but also have belief in themselves as well as the government. He also made sure that the minimum support price is the same as recommended by the Swaminathan commission,” said Shah.“Under his governance, the world realises that India, a nation of 130 crore people, is not to be taken lightly. We are a strong nation and the surgical strikes and airstrikes show that no one should take India lightly,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-minister-amit-shah-congratulates-pm-modi-on-beginning-20th-year-as-public-representative/story-aDf7PfODaEdYKwTdrWxkdL.html
07-10-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: ED files chargesheet against 3 prime accused||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday filed a chargesheet against three main accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case while one of them Swapna Suresh stated that her appointment in the Space Park was known to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. She said she was asked to apply for the post by former secretary of the CM M Sivashankar and later he told her that he will discuss it with the CM and ensure her appointment. She also told the agency that she met the CM a number of times and she was also close to his secretary, the chargesheet indicated. The ED also made it clear in the interim chargesheet that a detailed investigation was needed against Sivashankar and its personnel were in the process of collecting more digital evidence. It said a supplementary chargesheet will be filed later. After the gold smuggling case surfaced, the CM reportedly distanced himself from his secretary saying he was not aware of the appointment of Suresh for the key post. Later, his secretary Sivashankar, a senior officer, was suspended from service. Opposition parties then alleged that the CM got away easily after sacrificing his secretary. When Swapna Suresh resigned from the United Arab Emirates consulate she had applied for the job of Space Park Manager and she gave the reference of Sivashankar, the chargesheet said. And she applied for the job through consultant agency PricewaterCoopers as directed by Sivashankar. He also introduced chartered accountant Venugopal Iyer to her, the chargesheet said. During investigation, the ED had seized two kg gold and Rs one crore currency from the locker jointly operated by Iyer and Suresh. Later, it also came to light that some of the educational certificates of Suresh were fake. The chargesheet also stated that the three main accused, Swapna Suresh, Sandeep Nair and Sarith, were involved in money-laundering and owned huge properties and their source of income was mysterious. The ED rushed with the chargesheet while all three got bail in the case registered by the Customs. The gold smuggling case is being investigated by many agencies including the NIA. The current chargesheet was filed to avert the accused getting bail as they were under custody for more than 3 months. At least 30 people were arrested in connection with the case which surfaced after the recovery of 30 kg gold from a consignment that came to the UAE consulate in the state capital camouflaged as diplomatic luggage. The court had criticized the NIA on Monday and sought evidence for terrorism charges against the accused. This is the first time UAPA was invoked in a smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-ed-files-chargesheet-against-3-prime-accused/story-E5sqjdP0baijW1l3j7dWgN.html

Each time you point your figure, there are three fingers pointing back at you, which you cannot and must not ignore. And last, stop arresting all third parties around you in a 360 degree fashion and ignoring punitive action, but more importantly, punishment by conviction of the real accused of murder and rape,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-govt-ever-invoked-sedition-after-rape-congress-to-yogi-adityanath/story-Q63yys6m5KSTacAW5QaybJ.html

07-10-2020||India||MP begins probe into alleged multi-crore rupee scam in govt scheme for farmers||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Madhya Pradesh government initiated an inquiry on Tuesday into an alleged multi-crore rupee scam involving officers of the horticulture and food processing department in the purchase of agriculture implements under the Mechanisation Scheme of the central government in past eight years, an official said Wednesday. Deputy director level officers of the horticulture and food processing department allegedly not only cleared the bills related to purchase of sub-standard machines at much higher rate than the market rate but also transferred the amount of grant to dealers of implements instead of depositing the same in the beneficiary farmers’ bank accounts through direct benefit transfer (DBT), said an official who didn’t wish to be named. Under a scheme launched in 2013, the farmers get 50% subsidy in purchase of agricultural implements from the state and central governments. Inspector, EOW, Pankaj Gautam, who is investigating the case, said, “We have asked for details of the scheme, names of beneficiary farmers, amount transferred to their bank accounts and details of implements purchased in the past eight years. Similarly, we have sought details how the department procures the implement and hands over the same to farmers.” “We will probe the scam which the complainant has alleged to be of Rs 100 crore in the entire period since the scheme was launched. However, the amount of scam can be ascertained during the investigation,” said Gautam. A farmer Mukesh Patidar, of Richala Munha village of Mandsaur district, lodged a complaint with the horticulture department in August saying that it provided power tillers to farmers under the Farm Mechanisation Scheme without following the rules. “Instead of transferring the 50% subsidy in the farmers’ account by giving them a freedom of purchasing implements of their choice, the departments’ officers transferred the amount directly to unauthorized dealers. The department handed over China-made machines in the name of power tillers to the farmers, which don’t meet any specification which a power tiller should have,” Patidar said. Patidar said the department purchased machines for Rs 40,000 to Rs 100000 or more and thus the scam in the past eight years or so was of more than Rs 100 crores. After his complaint, the horticulture department formed a four-member committee headed by Shrikanth Bhanot, managing director, MP Agro Industries Development Corporation Limited, to probe the matter for the year 2019-20. The committee submitted the report on September 8 this year and also wrote to EOW to probe the matter as irregularities were found on many aspects, said an officer of the department. The report said that about Rs 9 crore was transferred as subsidy in the account of 24 firms against the purchase of 1774 machines. “The machines, which had been given to farmers as power tillers, are not authorized model and don’t meet the specification set by the Central government for a power tiller. The horticulture department doesn’t have any clear rules and regulations for procurement of machines, specification of the machines, transferring process of machines to farmers and registration of dealers. Most of the money was given in cash which led to irregularities in purchase,” reads the report. The committee recommended stopping payments against all pending bills and proposals and taking strict action against the officers involved in it. Horticulture department commissioner Pushkar Singh said, “The committee probed the purchase that took place in only one year. Now, we are going to share with EOW all the details.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-begins-probe-into-alleged-multi-crore-rupee-scam-in-govt-scheme-for-farmers/story-tvfvNKdrnCAoyXqFqSx2XM.html

CCTV cameras are being installed at the focal points of the house. These arrangements are being made with the consent of the family members,” said Prem Prakash Meena, the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Hathras.“Three-layered security is in place and personal security is also being provided to the family members,” Meena added. According to the news agency ANI, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said, “The SIT probing the Hathras case has been given 10 days more to submit their report. The team was supposed to submit the report to the chief minister today but the scope of investigation of the team has been extended on the order of the chief minister.” The SIT was initially told to submit its report within a week. The team visited the victim’s residence on Sunday morning to record the statements of her family members. On the basis of its first report, the chief minister has already suspended the then Hathras superintendent of police (SP) Vikrant Vir, a deputy SP and some other police officers. Their polygraph and narco analysis tests have been recommended.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has already recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the case. The 19-year-old Hathras woman died at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 29 after being allegedly gang-raped and brutalised in Hathras on September 14.All four accused in the incident have been arrested.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metal-detectors-cctvs-3-layer-police-ring-for-hathras-family-s-protection/story-mRlApLkhrN1tmHY2GRLI2H.html

He had also promised to help them with jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. “A terrorist is a terrorist. This Pakistan-sponsored terrorism has bled Jammu and Kashmir for the past 30 years. They (terrorists) go to Pakistan for arms training, come back with arms and ammunition and then kill innocent people and security forces personnel. They can never be given any jobs. The only policy for them is a bullet,” he said. “Our jawans of army, police and paramilitary forces are combating them 24x7. These terrorists are getting killed. Under PM Modi’s government there can never be any rehabilitation for terrorists in this country,” he asserted. “Whosover picks up a gun against the nation will be eliminated,” he added. On the selection list of the Fire and Emergency Services department, Raina said that the list has several irregularities and was discriminatory. “I have brought the matter to the notice of the LG and urged him to quash this list and conduct the recruitment process afresh. Graduate and post-graduates have been excluded while 8th and 10th pass candidates have been selected. There is strong resentment among the youth of Kashmir as well. It is a big scam and a probe should be ordered,” he said. Raina said that if the list was not revoked then BJP will approach the court of law for an interim stay on it and then get it quashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-bjp-chief-snubs-lg-says-no-rehab-policy-for-terrorists/story-NXrrZxO0JQyC0Yto4mqQRK.html
07-10-2020||India||China’s dos and don’ts for Indian media ahead of Taiwan national day||China on Wednesday issued a series of guidelines for the Indian media for coverage of the national day of Taiwan, observed on October 10, saying all countries having diplomatic ties with Beijing should “firmly honour their commitment to the One-China policy”. The move followed full-page advertisements issued by the Taiwan government in two Delhi-based newspapers ahead of the national day, which featured an image of President Tsai Ing-wen and the slogan “Taiwan and India are natural partners”. The advertisement referred to Taiwan’s efforts to counter Covid-19 and its sharing of experiences and essential medical items with like-minded partners. Against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff, experts and commentators have called for New Delhi to review its relations with Taipei, which has been dealing with the Chinese military’s actions in recent months. In 1995, India and Taiwan established representative offices in their respective capitals though the two sides do not have formal diplomatic relations. Taiwan has the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi, while India has the India-Taipei Association in Taipei to promote interactions and facilitate business, tourism, and people-to-people exchanges. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Taiwan had cancelled a reception for its national day because of the Covid-19 pandemic and would only have advertisements and a TV show to mark the occasion. A letter sent out by the Chinese embassy in New Delhi referred to the “so-called forthcoming ‘National Day of Taiwan’” and said it “would like to remind our media friends that there is only one China in the world, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China”. “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory...All countries that have diplomatic relations with China should firmly honour their commitment to the One-China policy, which is also the long-standing official position of the Indian government,” the letter said. “We hope Indian media can stick to Indian government’s position on the Taiwan question and do not violate the One-China principle. In particular, Taiwan shall not be referred to as a ‘country (nation)’ or ‘Republic of China’ or the leader of China’s Taiwan region as ‘President’, so as not to send the wrong signals to the general public,” the letter further said. The Chinese embassy said it “appreciates the good faith and efforts by friends from the media”, and was “willing to maintain communication with media friends on China-related reports”. After Indian Twitter users pointed to the Chinese embassy’s guidelines, Taiwan’s foreign minister Jaushieh Joseph Wu responded in a tweet: “#India is the largest democracy on Earth with a vibrant press & freedom-loving people. But it looks like communist #China is hoping to march into the subcontinent by imposing censorship. #Taiwan’s Indian friends will have one reply: GET LOST! JW”The Taiwan foreign ministry’s Twitter bio states all tweets initialled “JW” are from the foreign minister.In recent weeks, Indian officials have kept a wary eye on efforts by the Chinese embassy to project its views on the border standoff in the Indian media, especially since the growing perception on the Indian side is that the views of Indian diplomats in Beijing aren’t given similar play by the state-run Chinese media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-dos-and-don-ts-for-indian-media-ahead-of-taiwan-national-day/story-iTl985M10GxoxOtumee7cI.html

PK Dutta, who retired as deputy inspector general of police (DIG), was nabbed from Kakarbhitta on the Indo-Nepal border on Tuesday and brought to Guwahati by road. The former police officer, who had been absconding for nearly two weeks, was hiding in Nepal. “We knew Dutta was hiding in Nepal and informed the Union home ministry about it. Accordingly, we laid a trap for him and Dutta fell into it,” GP Singh, ADGP (law and order), told journalists on Wednesday. Dutta, who was rought to Guwahati by road in the early hours of Wednesday, was produced before the court of chief judicial magistrate which remanded him to the custody of the criminal investigation department (CID) of police for six days. Before being produced in court, the former police officer was taken to Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital (MMCH) where a rapid antigen test for Covid-19 was conducted. He tested negative for the virus. Dutta, who reportedly suffers from some heart ailment, was later taken to the Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) where some tests were conducted before he was sent to CID custody. Dutta and a ruling BJP leader Diban Deka are prime accused in the police sub-inspector recruitment scam. The written exam to select 597 SIs was postponed last month after the question paper got leaked. Deka (who has since been expelled by the party) was arrested earlier and is in police custody. Dutta and Deka are suspected to have fleeced many candidates for the exam for sub inspectors of police by assuring them jobs in lieu of cash. Deka is alleged to have procured the question paper ahead of the written test. Police investigation has revealed that a day ahead of the test on September 20, many candidates had taken a mock exam in a Guwahati hotel. Nearly 70 of these candidates were staying at one of the five hotels Dutta owns in Guwahati. Police had issued look out circulars for both Dutta and Deka and alerted income tax department, enforcement directorate and department of revenue intelligence after unearthing many properties belonging to the for IPS officer. “We questioned Dutta for a bit after he was brought to Guwahati. The nexus of how the job recruitment scam would be revealed based on his further interrogation,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-ips-officer-accused-in-assam-job-scam-sent-to-6-days-police-custody/story-7qlNvleTcMtqikKach5yUK.html
07-10-2020||India||India, Japan finalise key cyber-security deal to boost cooperation on 5G, AI||India and Japan have finalised an ambitious agreement on cyber-security to boost cooperation on 5G technology and critical information infrastructure, and the two countries pledged on Wednesday to work for a free and open Indo-Pacific with diversified supply chains. The readouts issued by India and Japan after a meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi in Tokyo made no mention of China, though many of the issues discussed by them appeared to be a response to Beijing’s actions across the region. The proposed cyber-security agreement will promote cooperation in capacity building, research and development, and security and resilience in critical information infrastructure, 5G, internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), the external affairs ministry said. “Recognising the increasing role being played by digital technologies, the two ministers highlighted the need for robust and resilient digital and cyber systems and in this context, welcomed the finalisation of the text of the cyber-security agreement,” the ministry said.ALSO WATCH l Amid tension with China, Jaishankar meets counterparts from Japan & Australia A cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved the agreement, and an official statement said the two sides will also share information on countering cyber-security threats and develop joint mechanisms to mitigate threats to information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. The two sides will also cooperate on cyber-security at international bodies such as the UN. The ministers “emphasised that a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region must be premised on diversified and resilient supply chains; and in this context, welcomed the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative between India, Japan, Australia and other like-minded countries,” the ministry added. The ministers met a day after they participated with their Australian and US counterparts in the second ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which pushed for a rules-based global order and peaceful resolution of disputes in the face of China’s growing aggression across the Indo-Pacific. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, described the proposed cyber-security agreement as significant as it will build on an existing dialogue with Japan at a time when both countries face challenges from hacking and other threats emanating from countries such as China and North Korea. “The problems faced by Hitachi Payment Services in 2016, when malware caused the breach of financial data and comprised the data of 3.2 million debit cards in India, is one example that shows the challenge of cyber-security is a joint one and can only be tackled through joint collaboration,” he said. The proposed agreement is also important as it covers critical information infrastructure, including infrastructure for banks and payment systems, telecommunications and internet, nuclear reactors and energy transmission systems, transport systems such as air traffic control, and water supply systems. “These are all essential for the functioning of the economy, polity and society,” Patil said. During their discussions, Jaishankar and Motegi agreed the Indo-Pacific had “acquired greater salience in recent times” and that India and Japan need to work together for the benefit of the region. “Reaffirming the similarities in their respective Indo-Pacific visions, that are based on rule of law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Japanese side agreed to be the lead partner in the connectivity pillar of the Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative (IPOI) and jointly take both countries’ respective visions for the Indo-Pacific forward,” the external affairs ministry said. IPOI, unveiled by Modi at the East Asia Summit in November 2019, has seven pillars – maritime security, trade and connectivity, disaster risk reduction and management, science and technology cooperation, reducing marine pollution, sustainable use of marine resources, and capacity building. Motegi said Japan attaches importance to its strategic relations with India and referred to Tokyo’s Covid-19-related aid for New Delhi, including a 50-billion yen emergency assistance loan and a 1-billion yen grant for providing medical equipment. A readout from the Japanese foreign ministry said the ministers “reaffirmed the importance of implementing Japan-India cooperation in third countries such as ASEAN and Southwest Asian countries and making steady progress on the high-speed rail project”. Jaishankar also held a separate meeting with his Australian counterpart Marise Payne. “Reviewed the progress in our bilateral ties after the Virtual Summit between our PMs. Discussed expanding our cooperation in global affairs & regional issues. Will work together more closely in multilateral forums,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-finalise-key-cyber-security-deal-to-boost-cooperation-on-5g-ai/story-WCMa9En3NFPkQMWClGNFJI.html
07-10-2020||India||‘TRP rating has to be stopped or improved’: Union minister Javadekar||Noting that there is a need for a mechanism or a metric for gauging popularity, Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said the present system of Television Rating Point or TRP-oriented programmes needs a rethink.The TRP is a tool used to collate data on programme popularity through a device attached to the television sets in a few thousand viewers’ houses to measure impressions.The minister said going by the reporting in the media in the past two weeks, it is clear that the “avoidable TRP rating has to be stopped or improved”. Speaking at an event organised by the RSS newsletter Panchajanya, Javadekar said TRP cannot be an excuse for provocative programmes on television and that is not journalism. “Because we believe in self-regulation, I urge media companies to work out a way for regulating their content. The government has faith in the media and the freedom of the press, but the media should work out a way to ensure how its freedom is ensured,” he said.Referring to the concerns about media practices, he said earlier the letter P stood for press, then came paid news and then fake news and now there is TRP journalism. “There should be responsible journalism and that responsibility has to come from within,” he said.He referred to the Press Council of India, a quasi-judicial body, that lays down regulation for the print media and said some TV channels have formed an organisation for self-regulation. “But how effective is it? Those who are not part of it do not listen to it. What should be done to bring everybody together,” the minister said, stressing the need for self-regulation. While the PCI has recommended setting up a media council that will have jurisdiction over television and digital media platforms, the TV industry has largely opposed it, opting for a self regulatory body such as the National Broadcasters Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-rating-has-to-be-stopped-or-improved-union-minister-javadekar/story-q109sBIsj5oPS9TvTA1pcN.html
07-10-2020||India||CRPF to reach out to 12 crore people in next 100 days on Covid-19 safety protocols||Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Director General – Dr A P Maheshwari said on Wednesday that the paramilitary force will connect with at least 12 crore people through its 1,600 bases across the country in the next 100 days to educate them about Covid-19 safety measures as part of a mega-awareness campaign planned by the Centre. Home minister Amit Shah had, on Tuesday, asked all the paramilitary forces to initiate a large scale campaign about Covid-19 safety protocols so that the number of cases can be controlled. “A meeting was held in the home ministry on Tuesday. It was decided that a campaign underlining three things - wearing a mask, washing hands and ensuring social or physical distancing, should be ensured by everyone to check the coronavirus spread. All the security forces, including the CRPF, will undertake this campaign in their respective areas. We aim to get in touch with 12 crore people through our 1,600 bases in the country over the next 100 days,” Maheshwari said. He informed that CRPF has already provided help to over 50,000 people affected due to the pandemic in the last six months. Maheshwari was addressing the troops of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) on its 28th anniversary at the Central Reserve Police Force camp in Meerut. The paramilitary forces – including, Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) - are currently engaged in providing medical, ration or blood/plasma related help to people in different states but the Centre has asked them to use their reach to inform people about life saving measures that can be easily taken. CRPF spokesperson M Dhinakaran said – “We have already made a large number of masks and sanitisers in various areas. As part of the latest Covid-19 campaign, our units will go to remote villages in Naxal-affected districts, north east and Jammu and Kashmir as well as cities in other states and inform people about advantages of wearing masks, washing hands and physical distancing. We will connect with RWAs, community leaders etc to send this message”. Speaking at the event, Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said that the Delhi riots were part of a big conspiracy to disturb the peace of the country while lauding forces like the Rapid Action Force (RAF) for successfully foiling the evil designs of such people. “A big conspiracy was hatched to disturb the peace in the national capital this year through riots. However, the RAF played an important role in suppressing the elements that spread anarchy and ensured peace,” Rai said, adding that the nefarious designs of rioters were completely defeated. “You suffer damage and injury during riots and protests...but you use force only when violent groups start troubling the peace of society,” the MoS added. The RAF is a special anti-riot wing of the CRPF and was raised in 1992. It is deployed for internal security and law and order duties in various states. The force was deployed during the communal violence that broke out in northeast Delhi in February, killing 53 people and injuring about 200. Delhi Police has filed multiple chargesheets before a Delhi court in these cases. The RAF has 15 battalions (over 15,000 personnel) located in various parts of the country. Rai said that the “best part about RAF is that it uses minimum force while maintaining peace in a particular area.” The MoS also lauded the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the parent organisation of RAF, for killing several terrorist leaders in Jammu and Kashmir in the last few years and playing a key role in bringing the population of the Union territory to the mainstream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-to-reach-out-to-12-crore-people-in-next-100-days-on-covid-19-safety-protocols/story-eT0ky4WpF4pHqMaOzcTdsJ.html

After her death on September 29, the woman was cremated in the dead of the night. Her family accused the district authorities of performing the cremation forcefully. But, Hathras district administration has denied any wrongdoing and said that they had the family’s consent.The cremation in the middle of the night fuelled allegation that the state government is trying to bury evidence.Currently, the case is being probed by a special investigation team constituted on the orders of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The state has also called for a Supreme Court-monitored investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation.Meanwhile, Adityanath has accused opposition leaders who have been leading protests against the crime, of doing politics on the basis of case, religion and region.He also said that the opposition parties are hatching conspiracies to malign the state’s image.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-over-500-law-students-claim-irresponsible-behaviour-by-officials-write-to-cji-demanding-action/story-0ctrN5cTzlxybeFcGKhXfK.html

07-10-2020||India||Journalist, 3 others on way to Hathras arrested, charged with anti-terror law||A journalist and three others on way to Hathras and arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police earlier this week have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sedition, according to an FIR registered in Mathura on Wednesday.The four, who had been arrested in Mathura on Monday, had been placed under preventive detention but an FIR was registered against them in the Mant police station of Mathura today and subsequently they were presented before a court.These four include Atiq-ur- Rehman from Muzaffar Nagar, Siddiq from Malappuram (Kerala), Masood from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur. Siddiq is a journalist. They were arrested on Monday night after a laptop and some objectionable literature relating to ‘Justice for Hathras Victim’ was allegedly recovered from their possession while they were en route to Hathras.They are allegedly linked with Popular Front of India’s (PFI) student wing Campus Front of India (CFI) and were coming from Delhi and moving towards Hathras in a car and were stopped, said police. The UP government has maintained that there is a conspiracy to whip up caste and communal violence in the state and the Hathras police are now investigating a conspiracy angle in the case, which has created a political storm. The Superintendent of Police (SP) for Mathura Rural Sheerish Chand confirmed that these four are now booked for sedition and other charges. He informed that all four were presented before Court on Wednesday and sent to judicial custody for 14 days. The FIR has been registered under section 153-A of IPC (promoting enmity between two groups), 295A of IPC (deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage feelings) 124 (A) (Sedition) beside section 17 and 14 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 and Sections 65, 72 and 76 of Information Technology Act.The FIR blames them for attempting to incite riots in Hathras and fuelling caste violence for which they were collecting donations through those working for website Carrd.co.It further said that money transfer was not through lawful method and the money so gathered from international sources was to cause riots. It was alleged that pamphlets ‘Am I Not India’s Daughter’ were to serve these unlawful purposes. The men are accused of attempting to incite a riot, spread rumours, gather people and wage a hate campaign against India through its website. The website, said police, was teaching ways to cause riots and to move out safely after achieving the objective. All four arrested were blamed to be involved in all these activities through the website, alleged Prabal Pratap Singh, the sub inspector and complainant in the case, according to whom, these unlawful acts make all four liable for sedition charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalist-3-others-on-way-to-hathras-arrested-charged-with-anti-terror-law/story-gGbbUrAfd1OAeRDxZ2EgkI.html
07-10-2020||India||Amid Hathras outrage, Adityanath accuses vested interests of playing politics over bodies||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath on Wednesday continued to aggressively counter what he described as ‘opposition propaganda’ against his government, saying that ‘vested political interests’ were doing politics over bodies in the state. “There are those for whom the poor are a vote bank and poverty alleviation a mere slogan as there had been no real desire to ensure that the poor were uplifted,” Adityanath said during a virtual address to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers of the Bangarmau assembly constituency in Unnao district. Bangarmau is among the seven assembly seats for which bye-elections will be held on November 3. “For us, politics is a medium to serve the masses. But there are those who are doing politics over dead bodies. For the opposition, politics is virtually a business and they can stoop to any level to ensure their business does well,” Adityanath said. Also read: ‘Must have called boyfriend to the field’: BJP leader’s shocker on HathrasThe BJP looks to do well in these bypolls in which the Hathras incident is being played up by the opposition to target the government.Adityanath’s remarks were in obvious reference to the Hathras incident where the gang rape and subsequent death of a 19-year old Dalit woman sparked a national outrage and led to an opposition build-up against the state government. The late-night cremation of the victim’s body sparked another outrage. The Adityanath government has, however, alleged that a conspiracy was underway to defame the government. The chief minister, who has been addressing party workers virtually in all constituencies where bypolls are due, has also been exhorting the cadres to expose the opposition who, he claimed, were conspiring to whip up caste and communal riots in the state.“There are some who view everything from the prism of caste, region and religion,” Adityanath said while lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for changing the way things are now done in the country. “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, UP has made all-round progress, especially in infrastructure, health, education, connectivity and investment. This is why the perception about the state has undergone a drastic change,” he said.BJP’s UP unit president Swatantra Dev Singh also targeted the opposition and urged the party workers to ‘expose’ those creating hurdles in the nation’s development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-hathras-outrage-adityanath-accuses-vested-interests-of-playing-politics-over-bodies/story-BFJTW4PS3S7HIKTAVnbbTN.html

Modi made the remarks when he spoke on the phone with Putin to convey his greetings and best wishes to the Russian president on the occasion of his birthday. “Both leaders agreed to remain in touch over the coming days, including on the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said. “The Prime Minister expressed his keenness to welcome President Putin in India, as soon as possible after the normalisation of the public health situation,” it added. Modi also recalled his association and friendship with Putin, and appreciated the personal role that the Russian leader has played in nurturing the special and privileged strategic partnership between the two countries. The Prime Minister’s planned visit to Russia for a summit with the president and meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) didn’t materialise because of the travel restrictions imposed worldwide following the Covid-19 pandemic.

07-10-2020||India||Former Goa Lokayukta bats for stronger Act, more powers to tackle graft||Goa’s Lokayukta Act is weak when compared to those in Karnataka and Kerala and needs to be strengthened in order to be effective, justice Prafulla Kumar Misra, who was effectively Goa’s first Lokayukta (ombudsman) has said. Justice Misra, former Chief Justice of the Patna High Court, who recently completed his tenure as Goa’s Lokayukta and returned to his home in Odisha on Monday, presided over an eventful, but ultimately inefficacious tenure as the government refused to act upon and rejected most (some are still pending for consideration) of his recommendations or chose not to act upon recommendations “To make the Goa Lokayukta Act more meaningful and effective some amendments are required. [Granting] power to the Lokayukta to prosecute as in Karnataka, Kerala, provisions for recovery of cost; power to punish for contempt are some of the amendments required to make it more effective,” Justice Misra told HT.The Goa Lokayukta Act empowers the Lokayukta to, upon receiving a complaint, to hold a preliminary inquiry to ascertain “whether there exists reasonable ground for conducting investigation the complaint” or whether the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or is not made in good faith; or there are no sufficient grounds for proceeding further; or other remedies are available to the complainant and in the circumstances of the case it would be more appropriate for the complainant to avail of such remedies. If satisfied that there are adequate grounds to proceed with a detailed inquiry, the Lokayukta will then proceed to conduct a hearing, examine evidence and communicate his findings and recommendations to the Government. The government has to then, within three months report back to the Lokayukta on the action taken or proposed to be taken, on the basis of the report.If satisfied, the Lokayukta shall close the case under information to the complainant, but where he is not satisfied and if he considers that the case so deserves, he may make a special report upon the case to the Governor.The Lokayukta can also formally declare a public functionary (elected representative or bureaucrat) as unfit to hold office but the onus is on the Government to either accept or reject such declaration after giving the public functionary an opportunity of being heard.The Lokayukta, however, rejected the notion that his directions were not binding on the government. “If you read the sections carefully, you will find that the report regarding ‘grievance’ and order to initiate prosecution are binding, as the words used is ‘shall’ and not ‘may’. Such mandatory word ‘shall’ is being conveniently ignored by all concerned,” justice Misra said “I can’t comment as to whether the Act was deliberately made weak. In the original Act sent to the President, there was a Provision for punishment for contempt, but it seems the Central Government raised objections at that time. Compared to the Karnataka and Kerala Act, the Goa Act is weak, but it is stronger compared to some other Acts in some States,” he said. Justice Misra took over as the Goa Lokayukta in April 2016 succeeding Goa’s first Lokayukta Justice (Retd) Sudarshan Reddy, who had resigned within seven months of his appointment on October 17, 2013. The post was vacant for more than two years. During his tenure Misra indicted former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar and recommended disciplinary action against two top officials of the Mines Department for hastily clearing 88 mining lease renewals including 31 in a single day and recommended a CBI probe in the matter. The findings were rejected by the Government. He also found irregularities in beach cleaning tenders, recommended a probe against a then minister for having allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and blamed the government for crippling the institution with inadequate investigating officers to carry out its functions. The Goa Lokayukta Act was passed in 2012 by the Manohar Parrikar-led government that came to power with an absolute majority on the plank of ‘zero tolerance to corruption’. In the run up to the election, Parrikar had promised that he would bring to fruition a strong Lokayukta Act. The Bill was passed after a heated debate in which the opposition benches said provisions of the Bill were designed to discourage complainants while at the same time had inadequate penal provisions to those found guilty of corruption. A Lokayukta to succeed justice Misra is yet to be appointed. The state government has been being directed to do so within three months by the Bombay High Court at Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-goa-lokayukta-bats-for-stronger-act-more-powers-to-tackle-graft/story-RZ5iTSeBsM6nd3JfjgS3iL.html

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday on the decisions taken by the Union Cabinet, Javadekar said till the time a vaccine is available, people need to wear masks, maintain distance and sanitise hands as part of efforts to check the spread of the coronavirus. He said following the three rules is a major defence against the virus. The government has all along been urging people to follow these measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Posters, banners and stickers would come up at public places and on metros, auto rickshaws and other public transports to spread the message, Javadekar said. Social media would also be used as part of the campaign, he added. He said the precautions are all the more important as winter season would soon set in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-launch-awareness-campaign-to-check-spread-of-coronavirus-prakash-javadekar/story-hVNz5Kz0yHnBS5FSMm2MfK.html

This will give a boost to mass transit system, said Union minister Piyush Goyal while briefing media on cabinet decisions today.The total length of the project is 16.6 km and it will consist of 12 stations. It will connect Howrah on the West bank of the river Hooghly with Salt Lake City on its east bank.“The metro corridor will ease traffic congestion, enhance urban connectivity and provide a cleaner mobility solution to lakhs of daily commuters,” the minister added.Goyal had on Sunday virtually inaugurated the Phoolbagan Station of Kolkata’s East-West Metro corridor, describing the extension of the line from Salt Lake Stadium as a “Durga Puja gift” for the people of the metropolis.He also flagged off the first train from the new station to Salt Lake Sector-V, and said the entire stretch of the corridor is likely to be completed by December 2021.Phoolbagan is the first underground station to become operational on the East-West Metro corridor, which travels both below the surface and on elevated tracks, and also through underwater tunnels below River Hooghly.M G Road in the north-south main line of Kolkata Metro was the last underground station to be commissioned back in September 1995. All metro stations to become functional after that are either elevated or at grade level.Work on the East-West Metro corridor was also disrupted due to an accident caused by an aquifer burst in Bowbazar area in central Kolkata during drilling operations in August 2019.It will take only 16 minutes to cover the 6.54-km distance between Sector-V and Phoolbagan. When complete, the East-West Metro will connect both Howrah and Sealdah stations, two of Railways’ busiest stations.The first phase of the project, a 4.88-km stretch connecting Sector-V and Salt Lake Stadium, was inaugurated by Goyal on February 13.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-gives-nod-to-rs-8-575-crore-east-west-metro-corridor-project-in-kolkata/story-BZt0gaSh2YwxHhXj7iWuMM.html
07-10-2020||India||‘Must have called boyfriend to the field’: BJP leader’s shocker on Hathras||A video of a BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki alleging that the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped must have called her boyfriend to the field in Hathras and may have been caught has gone viral on social media. Ranjeet Srivastava, 67, a former chairman of Nawabganj Nagar Palika (municipality), denied that there was a rape and questioned why “such women” are found in millet fields only. The Dalit woman was allegedly raped when she had gone to collect fodder with her mother in a field. “I think usually in such situations when girls are found in millet fields, they usually have an affair. This girl must have called her boyfriend to the fields,” Srivastava is both heard and seen saying it on the video, which has since gone viral on social media. The BJP has so far maintained a studied silence on his remarks. “Yes, the video you are talking about is indeed by me. Several other videos of mine are running in various news channels,” he said. A father of three sons, with one of them being a member of UP BJP’s youth wing, Srivastava on being asked about the reference to ‘aisi ladkiyan bajre ke khet main hi kyun paayi jaati hai (why are such girls found in millet fields only)’, Srivastava said, “I haven’t spoken of all the girls as many are believing. I merely said, ‘iss tarah ki ladkiyan’ (such girls)’,” he said. और सारी बकवास, जातिवादी, उन्मादी बातें करने वाले भाजपा में ही क्यों पाए जाते हैं? https://t.co/KziEKwGIgdAsked what he meant by “iss tarah ki ladkiyan”, he said, “jis tarah ki wo ladki thee (the kind of girl that she was),” before giving an elaborate, laboured explanation of his ‘understanding’ of the situation that he maintained was largely driven by ‘social media’. Also Watch l ‘Inculcating good values in girls can stop rapes’: UP BJP leader | Hathras case Questioned further if it is okay to take social media seriously on an incident as barbaric as this, he said, “I have also made a statement on social media. Then why are you giving so much importance to it.” “See the point I am making is that one has to rely on circumstantial evidence, where there is no evidence. So I am asking, on the basis of what has been reported, both in local papers as well as in social media, as to what was this girl (referring to the victim), doing in millet fields? Because initial reports suggested that she had gone with her mother to cut grass but then millet fields have no grass. But, just assuming there was grass in the millet field in which she had gone, then please remember that millet fields aren’t very dense. If she had sensed danger, she should have raised an alarm, instead of surrendering. And if whatever act she was allegedly subjected to against her will, then there must have been some sign of struggle, which clearly there is not.” In between these remarks, he kept on saying, “khair ab to jaanch ho hi rahi hai... (now, an inquiry is on anyway)”. A special investigation team has been constituted to probe the incident, the deadline to submit its report was extended by another 10 days today. A CBI inquiry in the case has been recommended. “Initially the FIR didn’t mention rape? Why? Let me explain this. That’s because had rape been mentioned in the FIR, then her medical examination would have been necessary. So whatever the medical examination must have happened was primarily to verify the physical assault, not rape. The rape part emerged in the FIR lodged by a Congress leader, eight days after the incident,” he said. The BJP leader also refused to agree to the dying declaration made by the victim. “I don’t think her statement on rape before her death can be taken as dying declaration simply because a dying declaration has to be made before the magistrate, which I don’t think had been done, so how can it be termed dying declaration,” he said. “All this is planned, part of the opposition game plan to discredit our party’s government,” he said.The Yogi Adityanath government is fighting severe criticism for its handling of the case, particularly after the local police burnt the woman’s body at night without the family’s approval. However, officials said the cremation was done “as per the wishes of the family”.Quoting an FSL report, the government has denied denied the rape charge and claimed that some people were trying to foment caste tensions in the aftermath of the incident. Four men from the so-called “upper caste” have been arrested in the incident. Facing a battering to its image, the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it wanted an apex court-monitored CBI inquiry into the Hathras episode, which the SC described as “horrible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-have-called-boyfriend-to-the-field-bjp-leader-s-shocker-on-hathras/story-uH6k0jgGHGJlqwkk4IsmbK.html

With relaxations under Unlock 5.0, the number of pilgrims visiting the Char Dham shrines has been increased to 3,000 per day. Dr. BK Shukla, chief medical officer of Rudraprayag district said that everyone staying permanently at the Kedarnath shrine premises will be tested at regular intervals. “As pilgrims coming to the shrine have increased in the past few days since the state government announced more relaxations, the risk has increased. Keeping that in mind, the district magistrate has instructed that the chief priest’s health will be checked twice daily and he will be tested every 15 days,” said the chief medical officer. He added that all other priests will also be tested every 15 days on a rotational basis. “We have already tested around 190 people and sufficient antigen test kits have been given already to the dispensary in the shrine premises. The health condition of all district officials is being monitored. The health status of the pilgrims is also being monitored at different points, district border and two points before entering the shrine,” said Dr. Shukla. The district administration took the decision of regular testing after it received many complaints of pilgrims not wearing masks and violating social and physical distancing norms at Kedarnath shrine. The helipad near the shrine will also be sanitized on a daily basis. Vinod Shukla, president of Kedarnath Tirtha Purohit Mahasabha, said, “Despite security personnel and all safety measures in place, many pilgrims are not wearing masks. We are also continuously monitoring the situation and ensuring that pilgrims follow all safety protocols, but with increased numbers, it is difficult to manage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kedarnath-chief-priest-health-staff-to-be-tested-every-15-days-for-covid-19/story-TsYRzF5T0cgPmiJ2YtIaDP.html

07-10-2020||India||Noida airport to have one runway and 90% domestic traffic initially: Zurich airport official||One runway of the Noida international airport will be built during the first phase of construction and around 90 per cent of the air traffic in the initial years will be domestic only, said a top official of Zurich Airport International on Wednesday. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh government and Zurich Airport International signed a concession agreement on Wednesday to begin the construction of the Noida airport in Jewar on the outskirts of Delhi. “We will obviously work with the local construction partners to build it (Noida airport) but we will be the main investor at the moment,” Daniel Bircher, Chief Executive Officer, Zurich Airport International (Asia) told PTI in an interview. He said the company might get another financial investor at a later stage to develop the airport further. “As a strategic objective, we are looking at building a platform of airports in India in the mid-term. So, it could be that we will join hands with a financial investor in a later stage to make this platform (Noida airport) grow. At this stage of the development phase (of Noida airport), we will do it ourselves,” he added. Zurich Airport International currently holds 100 per cent shareholding in the Noida airport project. It had outbid the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), Adani Enterprises and Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holdings Limited to win the 40-year concession for the Noida airport. The GMR group-led DIAL operates the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi. “What we know today is that the Delhi airport (IGIA) has natural limitations in the peak hours, so the airlines that want to operate during the peak hours will find ways to operate. So, there will be a shift of these airlines,” Bircher noted. “So, will the same airline also use the airport to do international flights? That is up to the airline to decide. I do not see this (Noida) airport to be the competition to the international traffic at the existing airport (IGIA). That will not change for some time,” he said. When asked if the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has changed its air traffic projections at the Noida airport, Bircher said,” Today, there is an impact (due to the pandemic) but we are very confident that India with such a large domestic market...will very strongly rebound as we have seen in 2011-12.” In the last 5-6 years, a growth rate of 20 per cent plus has been observed for some airports in India so any substantial changes in traffic projections are not seen, he added. When it won the bid on November 29 last year to build and operate the Noida airport, the Swiss company had said the airport will be able to handle 12 million passengers per annum after the first phase of construction. Bircher told the PTI, “Domestic travel, I have no doubt, will rebound very quickly. Since, we are going to have 90 per cent domestic traffic in the initial years...I think that our assumption still holds true.” When asked if the government has informed the company by when the construction of metro -- connecting the airport with the wider Delhi region -- will happen, he replied, “Our understanding is that the planning has been completed and the government is looking at starting the execution soon to bring it to the airport by the time we start operating.” The Noida airport site is around 70 km from the main Delhi region. He said the company has a total of three and half years to build the Noida airport. “We have three and half years, so we have six months to do financial closure, and the concession starts then and we have three years to build the airport,” Bircher mentioned. He said they were working hard now in the planning stage. “We are looking at Rs 4,500 crore of investment for the first phase. This is in an area of 1,334 hectares of land that has been given to be developed. This includes one runway, apron space, this includes 12 boarding bridges for the terminal, and it also includes cargo catering space,” he said. He said that in the planning stage, they were focusing on digitisation so as to give contactless services to passengers. “We are focusing on short connecting times....We want to make it easier for the passenger to connect (for the other flight) and also for the airline to reduce the time the aircraft is on ground so that reduces the cost for the airline,” Bircher said. Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Zurich Airport International  which has been incorporated to develop the greenfield Noida airport in Jewar. The YIAPL will implement the public private partnership (PPP) for the Noida airport project together with the Uttar Pradesh government, New Delhi Okhla Industrial Development Authority and Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority. Bircher said, “We see a good potential in developing this airport into a logistics hub with all the adjacent logistics development and planned projects. It also includes 74 hectares of cityside area that can be developed.” “This we will take in a phase-wise approach, initially most likely a hotel and the rest we are still studying. This includes also a metro station on our land,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noida-airport-to-have-one-runway-and-90-domestic-traffic-initially-zurich-airport-official/story-vKa0AyLayWzE0la15QF3gJ.html

07-10-2020||India||Oppn seeks action against UP govt officer in Meerut for forwarding BJP’s message||Opposition leaders have demanded an inquiry against district information officer of the UP government in Meerut, Ashutosh Chandola and accused him of violating service rules after he forwarded a message about the Bharatiya Janata Party farmers’ cell’s ‘tractor pujan’ programme to reporters on Tuesday. Opposition leaders also said he was resorting to publicity for the BJP.The message that Chandola forwarded to journalists said ‘BJP’s kisan prakosth (farmers’ cell) would organise a “tractor pujan programme in support of the farm reform bills near the Saket crossing at 1pm”. Chandola remained unfazed by the opposition’s outcry. “I forwarded the message,” he acknowledged and said that he did so after being requested.When asked whether he would forward similar messages of opposition parties on their request, he replied, “BJP is the ruling party, that’s why I forwarded (the message). How can I do it for the others?”District magistrate K Balaji said he was unaware of the issue and would look into it.Samajwadi Party district president Rajpal Singh demanded Chandola’s suspension. “There are many officials who have been working as workers of the BJP,” he said.He also said Chandola’s act was against service rules and that senior officers must take cognizance of the matter. The party will stage a protest, he added.Rashtriya Lok Dal’s organisational general secretary Rajkumar Sangwan said officials like Chandola seemed to have forgotten their actual responsibility and started acting like a dedicated worker of the BJP.He said such acts of officials were against their service rules and democratic norms. He suggested senior officials look into the matter and initiate action.BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Meerut Rajendra Aggarwal also said it was a gross mistake by the information officer. “It was the responsibility of the party’s media cell to circulate party programmes in the media,” he said. Gajendra Sharma, the BJP’s media in-charge in the district, supported the MP’s views. While it was the responsibility of the party’s media cell to publicise the activities and programmes of the organisation in the media, it was the information department’s duty to do the same for the government and its ministers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-seeks-action-against-up-govt-officer-in-meerut-for-forwarding-bjp-s-message/story-xHg2XQXeAWqYp0DzMd0EXP.html

The Covid-19 case mortality rate has further declined to 1.55%.Here are all the latest updates on Covid-19 vaccine:1. A phase 1 investigational trial has revealed that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by US-based pharmaceutical company Moderna elicited a strong immune response in older adults with no serious adverse effects, a study has claimed.2. In India, an expert panel of Drugs Controller General (DCGI) has directed pharma giant Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to submit a revised protocol for performing phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine (Sputnik V) in India, news agency ANI quoted a government official as saying.3. Vaccine major Bharat Biotech on Monday announced its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin will use adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II to boost immune response.

The Bombay HC said it doesn’t think that celebrities and role models should be treated harshly so that it sets an example for the young generation. 2. “I do not agree. Everybody in equal before law. No celebrity or role model enjoys any special privilege before the court of law. Similarly, such person also does not incur any special liability when he faces law in the courts.

The course of the meeting itself has changed. Earlier, the RSS, the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had called off the meeting of its highest decision-making body, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, in March.Also read: World looking up to Indian ways of life amid Covid pandemic, says Mohan BhagwatNow, it will hold the Karyakarni mandal at 11 places instead of a single location.The RSS has divided the states into 11 zones, or kshetras. A senior functionary said it is for the first time in the history of the Sangh that the Karyakarni mandal meeting, which is held around Diwali, will be hosted in multiple locations in a bid to adhere to the social distancing norms that have been enforced to curb the spread of Covid-19.RSS chief Mohan Bhgawat and general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi will be present for all the 11 meetings, where no more than 40 functionaries will be in attendance. The meetings will be held between October 27 and December 6 in Palakkad, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Jaipur, Prayag, Patna, Guwahati, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Bhubaneswar. The three-day annual meeting takes stock of the work carried out by the wings in the sphere of social service, communication, public relations and logistics. The meeting also takes up issues that are in the news, or are ideologically relevant for the Sangh. The issue of Dalit unrest following the Hathras incident -- of an alleged rape by four upper caste men of a Scheduled Caste (SC) teenager (19) and her subsequent death on September 29 -- is also likely to be discussed. The Sangh carries out samajik samarasta, or social harmony campaigns, to eradicate casteisms and the Hathras incident, which has stoked unrest among the Dalits, has set off alarm bells. A second functionary aware of the details said, the Sangh is of the view that the issue was not “handled properly and with sensitivity”. “There is a feeling that the Uttar Pradesh (UP) administration handled the situation badly,” said the second functionary. The second functionary said the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) has underlined the areas of concern about issues such as the minimum support price (MSP) not being included in the new farm laws following nationwide protests over the legislations.The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the labour arm of the Sangh, has also announced that it would protest against the three new labour codes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-to-hold-its-executive-council-meeting-in-11-zones/story-WIfUsZ8QJStRsOjIdKgUoK.html
07-10-2020||India||Covid-19: Tripura High Court steps in, wants status report on recommendations of central team||The Tripura High Court on Tuesday asked the state government to detail the steps implemented on recommendations of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) team who visited the state in September to find out the cause behind rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The two-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Subhasish Talapatra had taken suo motu notice of the case in September after a series of allegations about poor health services at Tripura’s first dedicated Covid hospital, Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) hospital in Agartala.Tripura has recorded a total of 27,308 Covid-19 positive cases and 298 deaths. Two others died by suicide. A central team sent to the state had pointed out some shortcomings, including ventilators, X-ray and CT chest machines that had either not been installed or weren’t working.The state had initially struggled to procure medical equipment in the initial phase of the coronavirus outbreak and were reported to have been overcharged for supply of face masks and personal protective equipment.At Tuesday’s hearing the court noted that the number of daily tests conducted had declined substantially from an average of 3,500-4,500 tests between 10 and 25 September. But the figure of daily tests dwindled to 2,000 after September 25. As per government records, 1,997 tests were conducted on 3 October, 2,173 tests on 4 October and 1229 tests the next day.“....the positivity rate of the recent past is quite high and mostly it seems to be above 10% of the samples tested. When compared with the overall positivity rate of the beginning of around 6.75%, this rate is higher. Therefore, if the total number of positive cases detected per day in the recent past is correlated with the reduced testing, the people of the state should not get a false idea that there is a dramatic improvement in the coronavirus spread and that the life should go back to normal. This would be a serious mistake with serious consequences, “ the court order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/covid-19-tripura-high-court-steps-in-wants-status-report-on-recommendations-of-central-team/story-qF2yykHPn9xIQQbnZg26jL.html
07-10-2020||India||Global shares rebound from Donald Trump’s shock stimulus talks cancellation||European shares rose on Wednesday, as initial dismay at U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel fiscal stimulus negotiations with lawmakers in Washington was replaced by optimism about an aid package after the U.S. elections.Trump broke off talks with Democrats in a tweet, saying that negotiations will stop until after the Nov. 3 election, when he promised a major stimulus bill if he wins.The news quickly rattled Wall Street but Asian investors became less concerned overnight on the grounds that whoever wins the election will still introduce a fiscal stimulus bill.Asian stocks hit two-week highs and European shares, which opened slightly in the red, quickly rose, helped by upbeat earnings reports.The STOXX 600 was up 0.2% on the day by 0757 GMT and London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.1%.MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries and had climbed to a three-week high before the stimulus talks were cancelled, was up 0.1%.U.S. stocks were also set to rebound when Wall Street opens, with S&P 500 futures up 0.6%, helped by later tweets by Trump where he called for more fiscal support.“Even if a pre-election deal cannot be reached, Biden’s widening lead in the election polls is making it likelier that more substantial stimulus can eventually be agreed on,” UBS strategists wrote in a note to clients.“Indications of a more decisive election result may also reduce investors’ concerns about a protracted and contested outcome,” they added.A poll on Monday showed Democrat Joe Biden with his widest lead in a month, as a majority of Americans said Trump could have avoided coronavirus.Deutsche Bank strategists also wrote that markets were instead focusing on the prospect of more fiscal stimulus in the case of a clean sweep Democratic victory.“Further evidence that this election will result in a definitive result will offset any short term stimulus disappointment,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid.Trump’s tweets came shortly after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated warnings about the economic recovery, saying that the U.S. economy could slip into a downward spiral if the coronavirus is not controlled and growth sustained.German industrial output fell unexpectedly in August, indicating that the recovery from the coronavirus recession in Europe’s largest economy could be less powerful than hoped.The dollar - which initially rose when the talks in Washington were cancelled - fell as European markets opened on Wednesday, down 0.1% against a basket of currencies at 93.705 at 0736 GMT.Minutes from the Fed’s September meeting will be published at 1800 GMT. Euro-dollar was up 0.2% at $1.1756, while the Australian dollar, a liquid proxy for risk, was up 0.5% against the U.S. dollar.The Australian government pledged billions in tax cuts and measures to boost jobs on Tuesday, but traders say that the Aussie faces downside risks as the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut rates in November.The pound was up 0.4% at $1.2919.Brussels is gearing up to extend Brexit negotiations until at least mid-November to avoid a no-deal scenario when Britain’s status-quo transition period with the European Union ends on Dec. 31, sources said.Oil prices extended their decline. With West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures down 48 cents at $40.18 a barrel by 0748 GMT.Gold was up 0.7% at 0748 GMT, at $1,890.91 per ounce.The benchmark 10-year Bund yield was down by about 1 basis point at 0.516%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-shares-rebound-from-donald-trump-s-shock-stimulus-talks-cancellation/story-JjQ4M5ZSTGVlRax8ooxxlK.html
07-10-2020||India||Over 93,500 data science jobs vacant in India: Study||Over 93,500 data science jobs were vacant in India at the end of August 2020, a study conducted by EdTech company Great Learning said. Despite Covid-19, the enthusiasm and optimism around the analytics function continues to remain high with India contributing 9.8 per cent of the total global analytics job openings in August 2020 compared to 7.2 per cent in January this year, it said. While the sector did witness a decrease in vacancies (from 109,000 vacancies in February to 82,500 vacancies in May 2020), the demand has continued to be fairly consistent across key industry sectors. The factors contributing to the increased demand include a year-on-year increase in funding in Indian analytics startups, investment in the development of enhanced analytics capabilities in India, and a greater proportion of jobs outsourced to firms based in India owing to the pandemic, it added. The current demand is dominated by MNC and domestic IT & KPO organisations that are shifting jobs to India and are recruiting in large numbers. The study tracked data science job landscape in 2020, including the impact that COVID 19 has had on the vacancies in the sector. It revealed the growing demand for mid and senior level professionals with over seven years of experience in 2020. “While 2019 was dominated by young professionals in terms of the number of jobs available, this is the year when the industry is pulling all the stops for the mid-level and senior counterparts,” the study said. Bengaluru continues to create the maximum number of jobs, contributing around 23 per cent of analytics jobs in India, a marginal increase from last year, followed by Delhi/ NCR at 20 per cent and Mumbai at approximately 15 per cent. Despite the BFSI sector continuing to be the largest recruiter of analytics and data science talent (outside of IT), creating around 35 per cent of all analytics jobs in the country, the contribution of the sector has been going down year on year from 41 per cent in 2018 to 38.3 per cent in 2019 and 35 per cent in August 2020. Interestingly, pharma sector has seen an increase in the proportion of analytics jobs at 16.3 per cent, an overall increase of 3.9 per cent over the last year. “This is due to the focus on developing vaccines and other cures for the Covid-19 virus”, the study said. The 10 leading organisations with the most number of analytics openings this year are dominated by the IT and KPO players -- Accenture, Mphasis, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Capgemini, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, IBM India, Dell, HCL, and Collabera Technologies. The study further revealed that the median salary for data science professionals in India stands at Rs 9.5 lakh/annum in 2020 as per the listed job openings (the actual salary is generally higher than the listed salary). For those with more than a decade of experience, packages are in the range of Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh depending on the role and expertise, it was stated. The demand for ‘Python’ professionals continues to remain the highest among recruiters with almost 27 per cent of the jobs requiring Python as the core skill. It is closely followed by Java/JavaScript that is witnessing a 22 per cent demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-93-500-data-science-jobs-vacant-in-india-study/story-B1v8xdzk0js7FBENTJxsQP.html
07-10-2020||India||Employees in India face increased burnout at work during pandemic: Report||Employees in India are facing increased burnout due to lack of separation between work and personal life as well as concerns of contracting Covid-19, a report said on Wednesday. According to Microsoft’s latest Work Trend Index, that surveyed over 6,000 information and first-line workers across eight countries globally, India had the second highest percentage of workers facing increased burnout in Asia at 29 per cent. Moreover, India came out top with over 41 per cent of workers citing the lack of separation between work and personal life as negatively impacting their wellbeing, resulting in increased stress levels, the report said. “In the last six months, we have seen how Covid-19 has created an era of remote anywhere. It has led to the evolution of a new workplace – from a physical space to one residing in a virtual world,” said Samik Roy, Country Head, Modern Work, Microsoft India. Roy further noted that “as businesses adapt to a new way of working, it is important to examine the multifaceted impact that the new working conditions are having on employees. This is helping us provide relevant and timely solutions to all our customers and users”. The pandemic increased burnout at work, in some countries more than others. In India, 29 per cent of workers are experiencing increased burnout at work, owing to its increase in workday span by 1 hour. While, workers in Germany saw very little change to workday span or feelings of burnout, the report said. Data showed that, globally, even six months past the first work-from-home orders, people are in significantly more meetings, taking more ad hoc calls and managing more incoming chats than they did before the pandemic. “As people adjusted to remote working, after hours chats, or chats between 5 pm and midnight, have also increased,” the report said. Further, for remote workers in Asia, no commute is hurting and not helping productivity, the report said adding that for years, Microsoft’s research group has been studying how commute has helped maintain work-life boundaries — and worker’s productivity and wellbeing. Microsoft said a series of updates have been launched within Microsoft Teams to support employee wellbeing. These include a virtual commute experience that helps users prepare for the day and mindfully disconnect in the evening. Microsoft has also partnered with Headspace to bring a curated set of mindfulness and meditation experiences into the Teams platform and launched new Teams experiences for first-line workers to support them with the tools they need to work more safely. This Work Trend Index report looks at how the pandemic has impacted wellbeing at work globally. It studied how productivity patterns in Microsoft Teams have shifted since early this year and surveyed over 6,000 information and first-line workers in eight countries including Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, India, Singapore, the UK, and the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/employees-in-india-face-increased-burnout-at-work-during-pandemic-report/story-Fn3qM78T4BXMuw4QDArjSO.html

On August 14, Zurich International was given time till October 15 for signing of the agreement in view of restrictions on air travel.“Once the agreement is signed, Zurich will start work at the site in the next six months as it needs time to mobilize the workforce and also rope in required agencies,” said Singh.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has acquired 1,334 hectares of land under phase 1 out of the total 5,000 hectares required for the airport project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zurich-international-to-sign-deal-today-to-build-jewar-airport/story-rEOfi9arsfSnsowWKpHpJM.html

Rhea was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on September 8 for her alleged involvement in procuring marijuana for Rajput, also her boyfriend.Rhea’s brother Showik will, however, continue to remain behind bars after his bail plea was rejected. The court also refused to grant bail to Abdel Basit Parihar, a final year student of architecture, who is accused of supplying narcotics to Sushant Singh Rajput, allegedly through Showik.Justice Kotwal granted bail to Rhea on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and one or two sureties in the same amount. She has, however, been granted time to furnish sureties, paving the way for the immediate release of the 28-year-old actress.ALSO WATCH | Sushant case drugs angle: Rhea Chakraborty gets bail; no relief for Showik The high court has directed Rhea to surrender her passport to the investigating officer and not to leave India. She is also restrained from leaving the jurisdiction of the special NDPS court in Mumbai without submitting itinerary to the special court. She will also have to report to the NCB office on the first Monday of every month for the next six months.After the order was pronounced, additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought a stay on the order for at least one week. “This matter involves a number of questions of law and therefore we want to test this order (before the Supreme Court),” said Singh.Justice Sarang V Kotwal refused to stay the order. “What do you want to test,” the judge asked Singh. “I have held that all offences under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act are non-bailable,” the judge added while rejecting the request.Also Read: In Sushant Singh Rajput case, CBI to summon eyewitness who saw him with Rhea Chakraborty on June 13After Singh’s request, HC ordered Rhea to visit the nearest police station everyday for the next ten days, so that she is easily available for re-arrest in case the NCB succeeds in its challenge to the order.“We are delighted by the order of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court granting bail to Rhea Chakraborty. Truth and Justice have prevailed and ultimately the submissions on facts and law have been accepted by Justice Sarang V Kotwal,” said advocate Satish Maneshinde, who represented Rhea.“The arrest and custody of Rhea was totally unwarranted and beyond the reach of law.

They too are ordered to surrender their passports and not to leave the jurisdiction of the special NDPS court in Mumbai.NCB had started investigation into the drug angle to Rajput’s suicide after a trail of WhatsApp chats came to the fore revealing sale and purchase of drugs.Arrested on September 4, Showik was accused of being in regular touch with two drug peddlers, Abdul Basit Parihar and Kaizan Ebrahim, from whom he allegedly procured contraband material for consumption of the deceased actor. Rhea too was accused of procuring drugs and at times paying for the contraband material as well.The siblings were, however, booked under stringent provisions like sections 8(c) read with 20(b)(ii) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport, ware-house, use, consume, import, export or tranship cannabis other than ganja), 27A (financing illicit trafficking into drugs and harbouring offenders), 28 (attempt to commit offences under the Act) and 29 (abetment) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-gets-bail-but-court-sets-4-key-condition/story-KTte0nxLy7vKnkGW7OwbmI.html
07-10-2020||India||China’s ‘gross aggression’ driving members of Quad: US official||China’s actions across the region and its “sudden turn toward gross aggression” are the factors currently driving the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, a senior US state department official has said. The official’s remarks, made during a background media briefing, followed the meeting on Tuesday of the foreign ministers of the four countries in the informal grouping—India, Australia, Japan and the US. The Quad members, during their discussions, pushed for a rules-based world order and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Referring to the Quad ministerial meeting and secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s interactions with his counterparts from the three other countries, the state department official, who wasn’t named, said that “there’s no avoiding the fact that it’s China and its actions in the region that make the Quad actually matter and function this time around”. Also Read: India makes China point, US hints at ‘formal’ QuadAsked by the media about the fact that Pompeo was the only one of the four foreign ministers who explicitly named China in his opening remarks at the meeting, the official responded by saying that “the single thing that’s driving all this [is] a sudden turn toward gross aggression by the Chinese government in its entire periphery”. The official referred to the five-month border standoff between India and China and said: “I mean, if you look at the conflict...in the Himalayas between China and India, something that has been in the past handled according to unspoken or unwritten rules...to prevent these things from getting out of control, and then you look at what happened here recently, where you’ve got actually people beating each other to death...” The official was referring to the June 15 clash at Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and resulted in unspecified Chinese casualties. The two sides have been unable to move forward with the disengagement of troops at friction points despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. The official further said that China’s aggressive activities were witnessed in many areas. “I mean, you take it all the way around the Indo-Pacific and its western borders, you’re seeing things that you haven’t seen before, and these are responding to that,” he remarked. Also Read: 4-nation Quad gets cemented at Tokyo meet, sends stern message to ChinaDuring their second ministerial meeting, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterparts from Australia, Japan and the US discussed the post-Covid-19 world order and sought a coordinated response to challenges, including financial problems, emanating from the pandemic. They also focused on increasing the resilience of supply chains, and enhancing access to affordable vaccines. The ministers also discussed connectivity, humanitarian assistance, maritime security, health security and counter-terrorism, and reiterated their support to the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their readiness to work towards realising a common vision for the Indo-Pacific. Pompeo said in an interview on Tuesday that the US wants to formalise and expand the Quad, with other countries joining the grouping at an appropriate time to “counter the challenge that the Chinese Communist Party presents”. A second US state department official present at the briefing said Pompeo had spoken earlier about “results-oriented multilateralism” and “voluntary groupings of like-minded nations [which] share common values of democracy, the rule of law, a respect for human rights and individual freedom”. “So this is a piece of a much larger vision...for multilateralism that really works—effective multilateralism,” the second official added. The second official further said the issue has to be framed correctly: “This isn’t about a US-China dispute. This is about the free world versus Chinese authoritarianism. And [Pompeo] speaks frequently about that, and that’s the way he framed his discussions, and there was a lot of agreement around that table.” The Quad remains a loose and informal grouping and there was no joint statement after Tuesday’s meeting, with the four countries issuing separate read-outs on the discussions.

The Indian stand was firmly conveyed by joint secretary (East Asia) to his Chinese counterpart at the 19th round of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs.While the Chinese side had dug out the 1959 LAC maximalist claim on the eve of the WMCC meeting, the Indian side made it clear that it had rejected the cartographic claim immediately after it was made by then Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai to then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru through a letter on November 7, 1959.The Indian diplomat firmly made the point that China was already in occupation of over 33,000 km of land in Aksai Chin area and another 5,180 square km of Shaksgam Valley was illegally handed over by Pakistan in 1963. The Chinese side had no cogent reply to the Indian rejection.Also Read: China’s PLA complicates troop disengagement over Ladakh.

The Chinese side will be represented by the South Xinjiang military commander.There is no sign that the Western Theatre Commander of People’s Liberation Army, General Zhao Zongqi, will also demit office. He has already crossed the retirement age of 65 years this April. Gen Zhao’s tenure has seen PLA aggression at Doklam in 2017 and in Ladakh this year.Also Read: 4-nation Quad gets cemented at Tokyo meet, sends stern message to ChinaAccording to top military commanders, there is no change in ground situation in Ladakh with both armies facing each other at the contested points and no pull-back from the depth positions.The PLA psychological warfare, however, is in full-swing with articles about armoured personnel carriers and artillery guns being paradropped near the LAC. “This begets a question as to why did the PLA build roads to their last posts on the perceived LAC if they still have to paradrop military hardware,” said a former Indian Army chief.China watchers believe that the continuing psy-ops are part of a plan to pressurise the Indian Army to withdraw from the Chinese perception of the LAC in the south bank of Pangong Tso. While the Indian Army is calmly holding its positions, it is also alert to any PLA pre-emption on the LAC before the snows take over at the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-india-border-ladakh/story-o8k99DJZVQcR8cifu2aUcI.html

It also said it is not aware of the secret ongoing proceedings against Mallya as the Indian government is not party to the process.“The government says no data is available when the Opposition demands any information. Government lawyers say not aware when the court demands details. How many times and in how many cases is the government going to say ‘don’t know’,” an editorial in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said.“The government machinery claims to know each and every detail of an actor’s suicide, Bollywood’s drugs connection and the alleged conspiracy behind the Hathras case, but claims it is not aware of action in the case of Mallya, who has swindled India of thousands of crores of rupees,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-govt-claim-it-has-no-info-on-mallya-extradition-sena/story-kIRmkBFwj73U2CDjxFPMYK.html

Many, including Vikas Singh, lawyer of Sushant Singh Rajput family, claimed that AIIMS forensic team head Sudhir Gupta had made a U-turn. They claimed that Dr Gupta had earlier indicated possibility of homicide.Following this, social media was flooded with claims that the Union health ministry has asked AIIMS to submit a report on this apparent ‘flip-flop’, as AIIMS comes under the ministry. It was also claimed that the Union health minister is now looking into the easy. All these speculations are fake, the minister himself has clarified.The Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the case which sought the inputs of the AIIMS forensic team on the autopsy report of the actor.

07-10-2020||India||The growing challenge of economic offences in India||India’s criminal justice system is struggling to deal with growing economic offences according to the latest Crime in India report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which works under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The report has crime statistics for 2019. While the number of such offences has been increasing in the past few years, arrests and convictions have been coming down. Annual growth in economic offences fastest since 2014 The number of reported economic offences in 2019 was 165,000, a growth of 6.1% over the 2018 number. This is the highest annual growth in the number of economic offences since 2014. These crimes grew at double-digit rates in 2013 and 2014. The NCRB classifies economic offences into three broad categories: criminal breach of trust; counterfeiting; and forgery, cheating and fraud. The third category has the largest share of economic offences. Case pendency rising, arrests and convictions coming down While the number of economic offence cases has been rising, the police’s track record in dealing with them has been patchy. This is evident in a fall in the number of arrests and convictions, and a rise in pendency of cases. Even conviction rates, which rose in 2017 after a fall in 2016, have fallen for two consecutive years now. A report in this newspaper (https://bit.ly/3leQdUV) in January pointed to an increase in trial pendency in courts along with falling conviction rates for economic offences in recent years. The charge-sheeting rate – share of cases investigated by police in which charge sheets were filed – increased between 2014 and 2017, and has remained largely unchanged in the last three years. The criminal justice system is wanting in terms of dealing with economic offences A comparison of economic offences with other crimes in India shows that the criminal justice system is less capable when it comes to dealing with the former. In 2019, police investigation was pending in 54.6% of cases related to economic offences, compared to 29.3% of all cases registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). And the conviction rate was less than half the rate for all IPC crimes. Why faster resolution of economic offence case is important The Reserve Bank of India in its annual report for 2019-20 revealed that bank frauds amounting to ₹1.85 lakh crore were reported in the year 2019-20, an increase of over 159% from the previous year. This is in keeping with the recent rise in such frauds. To be sure, bank fraud is only one of the 24 types of economic offences, a list that includes tax evasion, money laundering, insurance frauds, and stock market manipulation. The increasing number of economic offences along with fewer arrests and poor conviction rate could encourage unscrupulous elements to indulge in more such activities. This will entail growing losses to both private and public wealth and erode India’s image as a rules-based economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-growing-challenge-of-economic-offences-in-india/story-CC1uaeBv1vQCuFKd3fkVtL.html

Her brother Showik Chakraborty’s bail plea was rejected.Rajput’s employees Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda were also granted bail by the court. Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on September 8.Showik and Samuel Miranda were held by the agency on September 4.Justice SV Kotwal granted the actor bail on a personal bond of Rs1 lakh and one or two sureties in the same amount. She has, however, been granted time to furnish sureties, which means she can come out of jail immediately. She was kept in Byculla jail cell since her arrest one month ago, reportedly without a bed or ceiling fan. “We are delighted by the order of the Honourable Bombay High Court granting bail to Rhea Chakraborty. Truth and Justice have prevailed and ultimately the submissions on facts and law have been accepted by Justice Sarang V Kotwal,” said Rhea’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde.“The arrest and custody of Rhea was totally unwarranted and beyond the reach of law. The hounding and witch hunt by three central agencies .. the CBI, ED and NCB of Rhea should come to and end” he said. “We remain committed to Truth. Satya Meva Jayate,” he added.Maneshinde had earlier said that the agency’s allegations against the actor were based on one incident that took place on March 17, when she gave Miranda her credit card and the latter withdrew Rs10,000, allegedly to purchase contraband material for Rajput.Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-rhea-chakraborty-rejects-bail-plea-of-her-brother-showik/story-zQKdHt1pPnhphAChMcyj7K.html

07-10-2020||India||Occupying public place for protests not acceptable: Supreme Court on petitions on Shaheen Bagh protests||The right to protest in public places is not absolute and public places cannot be occupied indefinitely for such protests, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday in a case highlighting the troubles faced by general public due to the road blockade at Shaheen Bagh in south Delhi by protestors who were opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).Dissent and democracy go hand in hand but protests must be carried out in designated areas, a three-judge bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul ruled.“Occupation of public places for protests is not acceptable. Authorities must ensure removal of occupation of public places,” the bench which also comprised justices Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari held.However, the manner in which occupants should be removed to clear public places is to be decided by government authorities and they should not hide behind or wait for court orders in order to carry out their functions, the top court added. The ruling came on a plea by filed by advocate Amit Sahni in February seeking lift of road blockade in the Shaheen Bagh – Kalindi Kunj stretch due to protests at Shaheen Bagh by those opposing the CAA.The CAA, which was passed on December 12, 2019, amended Section 2 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 in a manner which made any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan eligible to apply for Indian citizenship by naturalization even if they were illegal migrants.However, the Muslim community was excluded from the purview of this amendment, thereby, preventing Muslim illegal migrants from availing the opportunity to apply for Indian citizenship, a benefit which was extended to illegal migrants from the other six communities by the amendment. The exclusion of Muslim triggered widespread protests across the country, as did the linking of citizenship with religion.Shaheen Bagh was the epicentre of such protests in the national capital. The protests at Shaheen Bagh started on December 15, 2019 and continued for more than 3 months. Sahni stated that while people have the right to protest, the same is subject to reasonable restrictions and protestors cannot be allowed to occupy public roads indefinitely. He contended that right to protests it should not inconvenience public at large.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the central government also concurred with the petitioner stating that right to protest cannot be absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions.“Every right is qualified,” Mehta had argued.During the hearing of the case, the court had on February 17, attempted to resolve the issue by sending two lawyers, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran to mediate with the protestors. However, the talks did not yield any results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-places-cannot-be-occupied-indefinitely-supreme-court-on-petitions-on-shaheen-bagh-protests/story-BTyccB3Ef98KSuRIsHooyM.html

They added that the 800-km range subsonic (below the speed of sound) Nirbhay cruise missile will be tested in the next couple of weeks and be inducted into both Indian Army and Navy shortly after.HT learns that a limited number of Nirbhay missiles have already been deployed in response to the Chinese build-up in Tibet and Xinjiang.Also Read: India tests missile-assisted system to target submarines at long rangesThe tests and the deployments need to be seen in the context of the ongoing impasse between Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control.In the past month, the government has tested the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV), the pre-cursor to building missiles that can travel at a minimum of five times the speed of sound (September 7), the extended range version of the supersonic cruise missile BrahMos (on September 30; with a range of 400 km, up from the existing 290 km); the nuclear-capable Shaurya supersonic missiles that can travel at twice to thrice the speed of sound (October 3); and the supersonic missile assisted release of torpedo that targets submarines (October 5). BrahMos is also a supersonic missile.The Shaurya missile is the land version of submarine launched BA-05 missile and has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). The land version was discreetly tested for the final time before induction and as part of user trials from Balasore on October 3. It will be soon deployed at locations identified by the Indian Strategic Forces Command under guidance from National Security Council. The missile has a warhead weighing around 160 kilogramsAccording to top missile experts, Shaurya is a delivery system stored in a composite canister for rapid deployment and minimum interaction with the elements. The strategic missile flies within the atmosphere at a height of 50 kilometres. The experts added that the government’s decision to go for land version is significant as the missile can be launched by a single vehicle.Also Read: India conducts successful flight test of SMART; ‘Game-changer,’ says DRDO chiefDRDO is also making rapid strides in the development of 5,000 km version of the submarine launched ballistic missile of SLBM. With a range equivalent to Agni-5 land based ballistic missile, the K-5 will be deployed on-board the Arihant class of nuclear submarines. While the missile scientists are tight-lipped about the K-5 SLBM, the weapon system is expected to be tested in the next 15 months and subsequently deployed on the INS Arihant and the INS Arighat a new class of heavier submarine which is under harbor trials. INS Arighat is expected to be commissioned within the next six months and INS Arihant is already deployed in forward positions.Analysts said that coming at a time when India is engaged with a belligerent Chinese Army in the Ladakh sector, the testing and deployment of short-range delivery platforms clearly conveys the Modi Government’s intention of not backing down to any aggression or cartographical expansion plan of any adversary in the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bolsters-strength-with-missile-tests-deployment/story-LcaxZngN0mvJ31JxTvJXQO.html

In the absence of a large number of manufacturers, it would be impossible to meet the needs of the medical products required for the Covid-19 response. The government should act to put an end to the greed of pharmaceutical transnational corporations,” the letter, signed by SJM’s national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan, said.Also Read: Waive property rights from vaccines, India, South Africa urge WTO. All you need to knowEarlier this month, India and South Africa made a formal submission to the WTO, seeking a waiver on certain provisions of the international agreements that regulate intellectual property rights to speed up efforts to prevent, treat and contain the Covid-19 pandemic.In the communication, the countries said there were several reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering the timely provisioning of affordable medical products to Covid-19 patients. They added that a particular concern for countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity were the requirements for the cumbersome and lengthy process of the import and export of pharmaceutical products.The SJM has referred to the variation in the price of Remdesivir which costs less than USD 1 but is sold in India between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,400 as an example of how licenses incapacitate Indian companies to supply in middle-income countries. Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine: Finger-pointing will not save a single life, says WHO“Various initiatives to facilitate access to medical products for Covid-19 responses such as ACT-Accelerator, COVAX facility or CTAP so far failed to ensure technology transfer and local production. Instead of facilitating technology transfer, ACT-Accelerator and COVAX Facility reinforce the IP regime and delay the disseminating of technology,” the letter further stated.The SJM has urged the Prime Minister to reach out to all “like-minded countries” for the support of the proposal and create a broad coalition for the adoption of the waiver of certain provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement.“SJM also requests you to initiate measures under Section 66 of the Patents Cat for the cancellation of the patent on Remedsivir, which was granted against the provisions of the Indian Patents Act,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swadeshi-jagran-manch-backs-india-on-waiver-of-intellectual-property-provisions/story-WkhItHAB352TRQlzsq007O.html

With 986 deaths reported in the same time, the total death toll has already crossed 1 lakh-mark as it stands at 1,04,555.On recovery front, India is topping the chart in the world with a recovery rate of 84.7 per cent, the health ministry data showed. “India’s Total Recoveries have crossed 56.6 lakh. This has boosted the national Recovery Rate to 84.7%. This sustained high figure is fuelled by 17 States/UTs reporting Recovery Rate higher than the national average,” the ministry said. “New recoveries have been more than new cases over the last two weeks. New cases being reported in last 14 days are below from previous highs of 90,000 cases per day,” the health secretary said on Tuesday. As far as death toll is concerned, health ministry data reveals that almost 1 in 2 of total Covid-19 deaths in the country are concentrated in 25 districts of 8 states, out of which 15 districts are in Maharashtra. The Ministry of AYUSH on Tuesday dismissed claims that prolonged consumption of ‘’kadha’’ — a decoction made from basil, cinnamon, black pepper, dry ginger, and raisins — damages the liver, saying it is a “wrong notion” as ingredients used for preparing it are used in cooking at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-crosses-67-lakh-mark-in-number-of-cases-over-56-6-lakh-recovered/story-93LvMzDPT6aXaWRJCTcxEM.html

All you need to know||The Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on the rights to protest encompassing issued like whether a protest like that of Shaheen Bagh blocking a public road should adhere to some limitations. A three-judge bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul will deliver the verdict.Here’s all you need to know:1. The Shaheen Bagh protest against the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act started on December 14, 2019. It ended on March 24, 2020 — after a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 was imposed.2. The protesters blocked a stretch of the road for several months.3. On February 17, the Supreme Court had tasked senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran to mediate with the protesters. Several rounds of consultations were held. The protest was not withdrawn, but a stretch of the blocked road was opened for traffic.4. As the protest was withdrawn after lockdown was imposed, the case pertaining to Shaheen Bagh has become infructuous but the apex court will deliver a verdict on protests of similar magnitude.5. Of later, farmers across the country have been protesting the passage of three farm laws.

07-10-2020||India||Farm Laws were long-waiting reforms, MSP to continue: Nirmala Sitharaman||Amid protests over the recently enacted farm Laws in different parts of the country, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday termed them as long-waiting reforms in the agriculture sector. While interacting with farmer leaders and agricultural experts in Chennai on farmer issues and recently enacted agriculture Laws, Sitharaman said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops will be continued.“The reforms brought out by the Modi government were waiting for a long time. Now, agricultural produce in India can be sold anywhere at a price suitable for them with profit. Now, farmers can decide where and whom they should sell and where. A farmer can sell his products anywhere and no confusion in it. There is a free hand to them,” Sitharaman said.“If a farmer wants to sell his produce through the Agricultural Marketing Committees (APMCs), tax comes 8 to 8.5 percent. Now because of this new law, this 8.5 percent tax will be no more. In the new laws, the agreement of traders with farmers will be only for products but not on their land. Farmers will get a good rate and get value addition for his products. For the last 25 years, these reforms were under consideration and recommendations,” she added.Sitharaman said that MSP will be continued which is recommended by various committees like the Swaminathan committee.“There are 24 items that are covered under MSP. But, it was only given only to paddy and wheat. Those who are raising voices against the farm laws did not bother about it earlier. Since MSP is not a fixed rate and keeps fluctuating. Now we made the laws which will provide farmers to get good rate of their produce,”she added.“Congress ruling Punjab state in their 2019 election manifesto stated that APMCs will be ruled out. I am surprised by their protest. Farmers are clear on these laws. The political parties want to cheat farmers for political gain. It is a strategy of Congress,” she added.Sitharaman said that there is a change in the Essential commodities act, in which damages on products will be less and the rate will be fixed.“If state and central government both join hands, farmers will be benefitted or else middlemen will get the benefit. We have a plan to meet people in their city and explain farm laws. In this coronavirus time, farmers who could not sell their farm products physically, have sold their products through the digital platform of eNam,” she said.“Prime Minister will not fear reform in economic development. To give opportunity, our PM goes and seeks for an opportunity to bring in reforms. In spite of fear in Covid-19, the farmers sowed their crops and because of their hard work and the rural economy was less affected due to pandemic. Farmers who waited for reforms for long years, were given rights amidst lockdown,” she said.The three laws - Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020; and Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act - were passed recently by Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-were-long-waiting-reforms-msp-to-continue-nirmala-sitharaman/story-24lljxnPjDfKFroqaPv4eP.html

There should also be a pre-identified space to isolate suspected cases near each event venue.Close circuit cameras will also have to be put at multiple locations in the venue to monitor the compliance of physical distance norms. Also Read: India’s high Covid-19 recovery rate due to 17 states and union territories, says health ministry“In case of events that go on for days or weeks, the crowd density doesn’t remain the same throughout and usually peaks around certain hours of the day and some auspicious days. Planning the event should specifically factor this so that crowds are regulated and physical distance and frequent sanitisation are ensured,” state the health ministry’s guidelines.“In case of rallies and immersion processions, the number of people should not exceed the prescribed limit and proper physical distancing and wearing of masks must be ensured. In any case, the number of such rallies and the distance covered by them may be kept within manageable limits.”Having an ambulance facility in place has been made mandatory for events such as long-distance rallies and processions.Experts say that it is important to be extra careful during the festive season as crowding could lead to a spurt in cases.Also Read: Pandemic protocol should not be violated during Durga Puja, says Bengal CM“Wherever there is mass gathering during a pandemic, and people do not observe appropriate behaviour, there is a risk of spurt in cases. If people do not take precautions, the numbers will likely see a rise in the coming weeks as the virus spreads faster when people are in close contact with each others in large numbers,” Dr Srikant Sharma, Moolchand Hospital, said. Apart from these measures, the ministry has prohibited any such event in containment zones,.Persons above 65 years of age, persons with comorbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years are advised to stay at home. This applies to the event managers and staff as well.However, the state authorities have been given a free hand to make changes based on local requirements.“The competent authority may implement additional measures within their jurisdiction as per their local assessment and in line with activities permitted by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),” the advisory further reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-issues-sops-for-festive-season-to-control-covid-19-transmission/story-Uu2bfxcL7wcMLO2dYsBQcJ.html

The antibodies from animals, or animal-derived sera, are also called antisera. The ICMR will be conducting clinical trials on antibodies derived from horses. Also read: India’s high Covid-19 recovery rate due to 17 states and union territories, says health ministryICMR along with Hyderabad-based Biological E. Limited have developed highly purified antisera to treat Covid-19 patients.“We have developed equine sera and developed a horse sera with Biological E, which may also be considered. We have completed some studies on horse sera, where we have a predictive dose of antibodies in an ampoule, which is a small sealed glass capsule containing the dosage that can be injected. We are awaiting a clearance for a clinical trial with the horse sera,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, ICMR, at the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s (MoH&FW) Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday.Earlier, equine sera was tried to treat several viral and bacterial infections such as rabies, hepatitis B, vaccinia virus, tetanus, botulism and diphtheria.“Although, plasma recovered from Covid-19 patients could serve a similar purpose, the profile of antibodies, their efficacy and concentration keep varying from a patient to another. As a result, it makes an unreliable clinical tool for Covid-19 patient management,” ICMR had earlier said in a statement.“Standardisation achievable through equine sera-based treatment modality stands out as yet another remarkable public health initiative supported by the ICMR in the time of Covid-19,” it added.ICMR’s study on determining efficacy of plasma therapy in treating Covid-19 patients was conducted on 464 patients across 39 hospitals in India, with at least 350 doctors participating in the study.“…and it clearly demonstrated no benefit in reducing mortality in moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. It also did not arrest the progression of disease from moderate to severe. This was well established. This publication has been reviewed and has been accepted as a full paper in the British Medical Journal, one of the most prestigious journals in the world. At the moment, a pre-print has been published, but the entire article will be published soon,” said Dr Bhargava.“However, following the cue from that we have developed the equine sera to be used in Covid-19 treatment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-icmr-receives-clinical-trial-approval-for-animal-derived-antibodies-treatment/story-q0wEQJ9CHQYVwGz3wGHJBI.html

But the government has extended the deadline by 10 more days, reports said.Based on the preliminary finding of the SIT, the Yogi Adityanath government suspended Hathras SP and four other police officers for their ‘handling’ of the case. The SIT, headed by Uttar Pradesh home secretary Bhagwan Swaroop, also recommended lie-detector tests for all those who are involved, including the family members of the victim. Deputy inspector general of police Chandraprakash and IPS officer Poonam are the other two members of the SIT.On September 14, the woman was allegedly gang-raped and assaulted. She was taken to Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College for where she was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital after her condition worsened. On September 29, she succumbed to her injuries in Delhi. Her body was hurriedly cremated at night with nobody from her family being present, though Hathras police denied all charges. The brutality of the crime and rushed action of the Hathras police drew nationwide criticism while the police proceeded to sequester the village — no politicians were being allowed, the family members were barred from talking to media.Amid nationwide protest, the UP government took some ‘corrective measures’ and relaxed the restrictions. On Tuesday, the SIT team went to the village, examined the spot where the women was cremated. The Yogi Adityanath government has asked the Supreme Court to order a court-monitored CBI probe into the gang-rape case. It has also said the midnight cremation was done to avoid large-scale violence, which was apprehended next morning. “The district administration took the decision to convince the parents of the victim to cremate her with all religious rites at night to avoid large scale violence in the morning. Once the post mortem of the deceased victim was already conducted at Safdarjung hospital, New Delhi, there cannot be any bad intention on the part of anyone to expedite the cremation except to obviate the political violent situation resulting from planned caste divide by certain vested interests,” the affidavit filed by the state government before the Supreme Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gang-rape-case-sit-gets-10-more-days-to-submit-probe-report/story-VXNhzTtGT1LsokG2MWKeEJ.html
07-10-2020||India||Eight decisions of the GST Council to impact businesses: EY||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Monday could not resolve the vexed compensation cess issue and deferred the matter for the next meeting that will be held on October 12. However, the Council took some other decisions that will have an impact on businesses. Consultancy firm EY India summarises the other decisions taken by the Council on Monday1. Levy of GST compensation cess to be extended beyond the transition period of five years, for such period as may be required to meet the revenue gap.2. Allowing taxpayers having turnover of less than Rs 5 crore to file GST returns on a quarterly basis with monthly payment with effect from January 1, 2021. Such persons shall have an option to pay 35% of their net cash tax liability of the previous quarter using an auto-generated challan for the first two months of the quarter.3. The due date of furnishing quarterly GST returns (GSTR-1) to be changed to 13 of the succeeding month with effect from January 1.Also Read: GST dispute: 21 states may have legal route4. Liability in GSTR-3B to be on auto-populated basis of GSTR-1 with effect from January 1. Input tax credit to be auto-populated through GSTR-2B from January 1 for taxpayers filing monthly returns, and from April 1 for quarterly return filers. GSTR-1 to be filed mandatorily before GSTR-3B with effect from April 1.5. The present GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B return filing system to be extended until March 31. GST laws to be amended to make it the same as default return filing system.6 From April 1, taxpayers having turnover of more than Rs 5 crore shall be required to mention six digits Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN)/ Servicing Accounting Code (SAC) on invoices.

Refund to be disbursed in a validated bank account linked with Permanent Account Number (PAN) and Aadhaar of the registrant with effect from January 1.Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY, commented on the Council’s decisions. He said: “Aligned to the expectations of most, the increased tenure of cess levy’s been finalised as an option for compensating states, but it would entail continuation of increased prices for these goods for another couple of years. While an ad-hoc release of funds and an increased tenure should provide some comfort to states, the modus operandi on borrowing still remains a huge bone of contention without any consensus building up.”At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured state governments a 14% increase in their annual tax revenue for five years and the Centre committed to meeting any shortfall in revenue through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-decisions-of-the-gst-council-to-impact-businesses-ey/story-eKS28XQL0XSqbvUngIhPwM.html

They were later sent to 14-days in preventive detention after being booked under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) on Tuesday, police said.Those arrested were identified as Masood Ahmed of Bahraich, Atiq-ur-Rehman of Muzaffarnagar, Alam of Rampur and Sidhique Kappan (a journalist) of Malappuram (Kerala).“They were moving from Delhi to Hathras and one of them claimed to be a journalist. On finding material with them linking them to CFI, they were taken into preventive detention,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mathura, Gaurav Grover.“A laptop and some literature that is being studied for its contents were recovered from their possession,” police said.The officials in Lucknow said the four accused have links with CFI while and one of them -- Masood Ahmed – also had links with some active members of PFI who were arrested on September 7 from Bahraich.Also Read: ‘Hathras case of huge importance’, Supreme Court tell UP: Key highlights of hearingA senior police official, privy to the investigation, said PFI’s involvement had surfaced in “supporting and raising funds to create communal divide and incite violence” during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) violence in different districts of UP in December 2019. He said as many as 133 PFI members were arrested in 13 districts of the state for violent anti-CAA protests earlier this year in January and February.

The Special NDPS Court on Tuesday extended the judicial custody of the brother-sister duo and 18 others, arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau, till October 20. The actor had moved the high court in September after her first bail plea was denied by a special court in Mumbai on September 11.Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty, who was in a relationship with actor Sushant Singh Rajput, was arrested by the NCB on September 8, on charges of being an active member of a drug syndicate operating in Mumbai. Her brother Showik was arrested on September 4.The NCB is probing a drug angle related to the death case of Sushant Singh Rajput who was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14. The agency, according to Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde, is basing the allegations against Rhea from one incident from March 17, when Chakraborty gave Miranda her credit card and the latter withdrew Rs 10,000, allegedly to purchase some contraband material for Rajput. While Maneshinde argued that Rajput was known to have consumed drugs before meeting Rhea Chakraborty, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, on behalf of NCB, had submitted that the NDPS Act does not state that offences are bailable based on the quantity of drugs involved.After the forensic team of AIIMS asserted that Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide, demands to release Rhea Chakraborty have been gaining ground. Apart from several Bollywood personalities, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Rhea should be released without being subjected to further political conspiracy. “We are all pained by the expiry of Sushant ji but he cannot be honoured by falsely implicating a lady as an accused, I have earlier said that Rhea Chakroborty was an innocent lady, she should be released without further harassment to her, she has been the victim of Political conspiracy (sic),” he added.Since her arrest, Rhea Chakraborty has been in Byculla jail cell, reportedly without a bed or ceiling fan. Her cell is adjacent to the one occupied by Indrani Mukerjea, who was accused of murdering her daughter, Sheena Bora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-probe-bombay-high-court-to-pronounce-order-on-rhea-chakraborty-s-bail-plea/story-bC9VuXabdUw8NikAcBI8bL.html

07-10-2020||India||Amreen Zaidi: Her world revolved around her children||Hours before Amreen Zaidi, 35, a resident of Bareilly, succumbed to complications caused by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on September 26, she spoke to her 13-year-old daughter Afreen. “Beta hamesha khush rehna. Apne bhai ka khayal rakhna aur padhai mat chodna (Always stay happy, child. Take care of your brother and don’t leave your studies)....” Zaidi said, and hinted to her to expect the worst. “Mujhe lagta nahi ki main tum se fir mil paungi (I don’t think I will be able to meet you again).” Twelve hours later, the family was informed by the hospital where Zaidi was admitted that she had died. Her family, which had been placed under quarantine in its home on the outskirts of Bareilly, could not attend Zaidi’s last rites. Besides Afreen, Zaidi had a nine- year-old son Murtaza. Her husband, Irshad (40) works as a truck driver. Every day, Zaidi got up at 6am, prepared tea and woke Afreen up to get some hours of study. By the time Murtaza woke up, breakfast would be ready. Zaidi accompanied her children to school, carrying their school bags. She would also pick them up and help them with homework in the evening. Around 12 years ago, Zaidi fainted while preparing lunch. It turned out that she had diabetes and her doctor advised her to take care of her health. But Zaidi paid little heed. A few years ago, the doctor prescribed insulin to manage her irregular sugar levels. Diabetes is one of the co-morbidities that increases the vulnerability of Covid-19 infected persons. “Amreen was the sort of person who would bring you tea and place it in your hands when you visited her home, instead of just asking if you wanted some,” Samreen, her neighbour said. “Daru aur cigarette ke paiso se bachchon ke liye kuch le aya karo zada khushi milegi (Buy something for the children from money you would spend on alcohol or cigarette. It will make you happier),” Zaidi would tell Irshad, he recalled. The couple got married in 2005. At the time, Zaidi was 20 and in her second year of college, enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts course. Though Zaidi wished to work, Irshad’s parents did not permit it. Zaidi accepted the sanction, but regretted it and did not want the same fate for her daughter, Irshad said.“Don’t buy new things for me. We need the money to admit Afreen to a good college,” she told me when I bought her a new dress for Eid two years ago,” Irshad said. The couple had already saved up a tidy sum for Afreen’s higher education but their plan went off the rails after Zaidi got Covid-19. She was admitted to a private hospital in September when she complained of breathlessness. A week later, she tested positive for the coronavirus infection and moved to a Covid-19 hospital where she passed away. Irshad locked himself in his room and cried for hours, when he was told about the death. Murtaza, too young to understand the implications, became quiet. But Afreen remembered her mother’s wish and braced herself for her new responsibility. At night, she studies for two hours before sleeping near her father’s cellphone. With her mother gone, the phone alarm now wakes her up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amreen-zaidi-her-world-revolved-around-her-children/story-6IYfdFDcOxIHOyOl3mGwwL.html
07-10-2020||India||Rahat Indori: Simple verses, deep resonance||For poet, professor and lyricist Rahat Indori, the lockdown felt oppressive. He disliked the solitariness. It wasn’t the kind that inspired an artist, he told friends and family. He missed being out in his beloved Indore and he longed for the mushairas, those public poetry readings that had made him something as rare as a unicorn— a popular, contemporary Urdu poet. Born Rahat Qureshi, Indori’s love for the written word began with the Urdu newspapers that his father, a mill worker, would bring home. At the age of 19, Indori participated in his first mushaira in Indore, organised in the neighbourhood of Ranipura, which would become a muse for the poet. He’d return to its streets and people again and again, in person and in verse. “My Delhi is my Ranipura,” he wrote in a poem, referring to the capital’s reputation for inspiring legendary Urdu poets. By March this year, Indore and Ujjain accounted for nearly 70% of Madhya Pradesh’s Covid cases. Ranipura was declared the epicentre of the outbreak in Indore. Indori and one particular poem of his — Agar Khilaaf Hone Do [if they oppose, let them] — became a rallying cry during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. The poet had been performing the poem for years, at events held in different parts of the world; but its belligerent swagger resonated deeply with those who registered their protest against the law that provides citizenship to minority religious identities from neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, on grounds that it was discriminatory towards Muslims. The poem quickly commanded a wider audience as in the months before the pandemic struck, Indori was invited to recite the poem on popular television shows. The performances were always theatrical. Restraint was not Indori’s style. He would wring every possible drop of drama out of his words, in sharp contrast to the simple and direct style of his writing, which was frowned upon by many Urdu literary critics for being populist. In recent years, his poetry had become more politically-charged and this made Indori all the more contemporary and popular. “Aasman laaye ho? Le aao. Zameen pe rakh do.” [Have you brought the heavens with you? Bring it in. Set it down upon this earth.] “Sarhadon par bahut tanaav hai kya Kuchh pata karo chunav hai kya?” [Is there a lot of tension on the border? Ask around, is there an election coming up?] Before Indori became a professor of Urdu literature at Indore’s Devi Ahilya University, he’d earned his livelihood as a commercial artist. In later years, he would dabble with writing lyrics for mainstream Hindi cinema, but it was a source of satisfaction to Indori that his couplets were more popular than his Bollywood film lyrics. “Rahat Indori’s poetry is absolutely relevant to the times. He always had a comment on anything that was happening around him,” said lyricist Swanand Kirkire, who grew up hero-worshipping Indori as a child in Indore. The unease that Indori had felt at the start of the lockdown came to its tragic end on August 11, when hours after he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 and pneumonia, Indori, aged 70, suffered two heart attacks and passed away. He was 70, and is survived by his wife and four children. The poet may have left us, but his words are not lost. “Sabhi ka khoon hai shaamil yahan ki mitti mein, Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai?” [This soil is soaked with all our blood You think India is anyone’s father’s property?]||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahat-indori-simple-verses-deep-resonance/story-pLnsuEA7JaqiPRI7YKVtVP.html
07-10-2020||India||Let cinemas open from Oct 15: Delhi govt to L-G||The Delhi government on Tuesday sent a proposal to Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, urging him to allow theatres, cinema halls and multiplexes in the Capital to open from October 15 as per the central government’s guidelines, a senior government official said.The matter, the official said, was briefly discussed in Tuesday’s Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting without any conclusion.The need for a revised Covid-19 management strategy and modalities of an intensive awareness campaign in the light of the festive season ahead was also discussed in detail in Tuesday’s meeting.The DDMA is chaired by Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.“These discussions will continue in the authority’s next meeting likely to happen in another week,” the senior DDMA official quoted above said. The next DDMA meeting, the official said, is likely to see detailed discussions on Ramlila celebrations, Durga Puja and further relaxations of lockdown norms, especially regarding cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes.The government’s proposal came after the Centre on Tuesday issued guidelines on cinema halls and multiplexes that have been allowed to open under the fresh reopening guidelines from October 15, after remaining shut for more than six months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The proposal on cinema halls was only briefly discussed in the meeting of the DDMA but there was no decision. The Delhi government has already sent a proposal to the L-G, urging him to allow cinema halls to open as per rules laid down by the Centre. The same proposal includes a demand to allow all weekly markets to open in every zone,” said the government official, who did not wish to be identified.Last month, the government had sent a proposal to open all weekly markets but the L-G allowed only a small relaxation by allowing two weekly markets per day per zone instead of the one at present.On September 18, Baijal had directed the government to draft a fresh strategy for containment zones, which is yet to be finalised, several senior officials confirmed. The present strategy under discussion requires districts to have area-specific containment plans to suit planned localities, unauthorised colonies, rural areas, etc., said a senior official in the revenue department without elaborating further.After Tuesday’s meeting, Baijal tweeted: “Discussed the recent trends of Covid-19 situation in Delhi and revised strategy as suggested by experts, including prospective planning for the management of Covid-19 in the coming months.”The meeting was attended by Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, revenue and transport minister Kailash Gahlot, chief secretary Vijay Dev, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and director of the national centre for disease control, Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, said Baijal in another tweet.The chief minister’s office, however, did not comment on the developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-cinemas-open-from-oct-15-govt-to-l-g/story-qqXmGR99xVlDrDNSuhfghN.html
07-10-2020||India||Aadhaar-‘plus’ on anvil for migrant workforce||The Centre is set to issue Aadhaar-linked unique registration numbers to migrant workers, months after millions of them, left in the lurch without jobs (and in some cases, a roof over their head), returned home amid a federal lockdown imposed to slow the coronavirus pandemic — triggering one of the biggest humanitarian crises of independent India. The numbers are expected to help maintain the first-ever data base of the country’s migrant workforce, something that will help push targeted welfare measures more effectively. In a May interview, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke of the difficulty of targeting welfare measures at migrant workers when no one, not the Centre, nor the states, had a database. The Social Security Code—one of the three key labour reform laws passed during the last monsoon session—included a key provision to register “every unorganised worker, gig worker or platform worker”. The original version of the bill didn’t have any such provision, but after the standing committee on labour stressed on the importance of doing this in the wake of the migrant workers crisis, the government reworked the law. Clause 113(2) of the Social Security Code said: “Every eligible unorganised worker, gig worker or platform worker shall make an application for registration in such form along with such documents including Aadhaar number as may be prescribed by the Central Government and such worker shall be assigned a distinguishable number to his application.” Also Read | Govt to disburse compensation cess worth Rs 20K cr to all states tonight, announces Nirmala SitharamanIndeed, even in the just-ended monsoon session of parliament, because it lacked any independent headcount of migrant workers, the labour ministry could not furnish any data to queries by MPs on how many workers lost their jobs, or how many died on the way back home. Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar replied “no such data is maintained” leading to furious protests by Opposition parties. The minister also stated that 10.4 million migrant workers returned home, but maintained that the ministry had only railway ministry data to go by and didn’t have a count of the workers who tried to return by bus, trucks and other means. According to news reports, many workers and their family members died while trying to walk or travel in overloaded trucks in their desperate effort to reach home. Pitching for a unique number for workers, the labour standing committee pointed out that this would help the state clearly identify unorganized sector workers including migrant workers. It also asked for a wider definition of migrant workers to include those who are hired through contractors, come to their place of work independently, and even long-term labourers as opposed to seasonal migrants. Also Read | Open to one more stimulus if necessary: Nirmala SitharamanThe linkage with Aadhaar will help maintain portability of the registration number and ensure the workers receive government assistance, no matter where they are. “As migrant workers move frequently, it is necessary to link their registration with Aadhaar,” said Bhartruhari Mahtab, the chairman of the standing committee of labour in parliament. The Centre has already rolled out schemes for the unorganised sector including unemployment benefits and free ration apart from ₹50,000 crore worth of work across 25 schemes. Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra feels merely having a new law is not good enough. “There had been many recommendations that unorganised workers should be registered and the government should know who they are. But just having a new law is not good enough. We can only hope that there will be effective implementation and even if the government can register 80% migrant workers, it will do a good job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-plus-on-anvil-for-migrant-workforce/story-w1byu0JG4kQ19jfR2FtPQP.html
07-10-2020||India||Gulmarg Gondola opens for tourists after six months||Gulmarg Gondola, one of Asia’s largest and highest cable cars surrounded by pine forests and Himalayan mountain peaks in the ski resort of Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir, has opened for tourists this week after remaining shut for six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Officials said that tourists have started trickling in amid proper Covid-19 protocols of social distancing and masks, to enjoy the breathtaking beauty offered by the mountainous meadow. The first phase of the Gondola was opened for a day on September 27, World Tourism Day and then it resumed daily operations from Saturday taking tourists to Kongdori Mountain at a height of 8,530 ft.“We had decided to operate the Gondola on weekends but then the government decided to open the first phase everyday from Saturday,” said Assistant Manager Gulmarg Gondola Project, Fayaz Ahmad.He said that the tourists both locals and visitors from different states of the country have started coming in. “On an average, around 50 people ride the ropeway every day. Over the weekend, the number was around 150. Around 30 percent of visitors were from different states of the country,” he said.The Gondola was closed after the government imposed lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 in mid-March. On normal days, the cable car records a daily footfall of 2000 to 3000 people generating daily revenue of Rs 35 to 40 lakh. Each ticket costs Rs 740 per person for the first phase and Rs 950 for the second phase which takes a person to a height of 12,293 ft. Proper Covid-19 protocols are in place to avoid any congestion or close contact of the visitors with each other. Instead of six in normal days, only three tourists are allowed to ride in a single Gondola car. There is sanitization of cabins before and after boarding and de-boarding of passengers besides compulsory wearing of masks.The tourism industry nosedived in Kashmir since August 5, 2019 when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked and restrictions imposed on movement of people and communication shut for months. Two days before the revocation of Article 370, around 20,000 to 25,000 tourists were present in Kashmir and they all were asked to leave the Valley along with Amarnath pilgrims. The situation was then aggravated by the Covid-19 lockdown since March 2020.Ahmad said that the Gondola project has been facing a slump since August 5, 2019. “Later Covid-19 shut it completely,” he said.He hoped that the number of tourists would increase in the coming days. “Gulmarg and Gondola have become synonymous and people have started coming despite Covid-19. Winter is approaching and travel agents have told us that bookings are being made for October end. Let’s hope for the best,” he said.The tourism department has also started campaigns to woo tourists. “Tourism is now open in Kashmir and gradually moving towards revival,” said tourism director, Nisar Ahmad Wani during a Nature Walk event at Dachigami National Park on Monday.“The Directorate has started its publicity campaigns primarily focused on communicating a message that tourists can come here hassle free, as all Covid-19 related SOPs are in place. The visitors can enjoy our hospitality and experience nature in all its beautiful shades and manifestations,” he said.Gulmarg –the meadow of flowers – is located in the Pir Panjal mountain range in the western Himalayas some 50 km from Srinagar and is defined by a cup-shaped valley with virgin peaks, dry curry powder snow and meadows.“Our vast green meadows, enchanting valleys, majestic mountains and our pristine streams and lakes is what brings joy to the visitor and fills him with awe,” Wani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gulmarg-gondola-opens-for-tourists-after-six-months/story-OfO6jRegDJOrcwWUo9hDLP.html
07-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||October is festive season in India, but there’s one more reason to celebrate this year — the end of the first wave of the coronavirus disease.It’s evident in one of the charts accompanying this 176th installment of Dispatch — a return of the seven-day average of daily cases to levels last seen in early September.The reasons for this are not clear, and the pattern of daily case numbers is still a bit too volatile for my liking, but the downslope of the curve is clearly there to see. Inadequate testing doesn’t seem to have caused this — the seven-day average of tests conducted every day has continued to rise — although a closer analysis of the break-up between RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests is needed before this can be conclusively said.There has also been a slight fall in the number of daily deaths and a significant fall in the seven-day average positivity rate (number of people testing positive expressed as a percentage of the number of those tested).This is the first time that the number of cases of Covid-19 — both daily and seven-day average — has declined consistently for at least a fortnight, perhaps more. Other countries have seen clear first waves (the US has also seen a second, and is now on its third), but, until now, not India. In late August and September, as cases climbed, a few experts erroneously referred to it as the second wave in the country, but as evident from the chart referred to in the first instance, it was merely a continuation of the same upward curve. That has changed — since the third week of September, the seven-day average of daily cases has been on a downtrend. And this, even after accounting for the Monday factor (the number of cases typically sees a dip on account of low testing over the weekend). On October 5, it was 59,980; on September 28, 69,685; on September 21, 74,693; on September 14, 81,801; on September 7, it was 77,816; on August 31, 67,484; and on August 24, 59,051. The pattern is clear.      And so, to repeat what I said at the beginning of this column, it is time to celebrate — cautiously, in a social-distanced way, and with the complete awareness that the curve could go north again, and things south. After all, in both the US and in European countries such as France and Spain, the second wave was stronger than the first in terms of number of daily cases, although the deaths were far fewer.For much of the first wave, Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu accounted for a significant proportion of the infections in the country, although that’s changed in the past few months.Among these, the trajectory of the pandemic in Delhi shows that the Capital has actually seen two waves and that in Maharashtra shows that the western state, the worst hit by the coronavirus disease in the country, may be seeing the end of its first wave. Maharashtra’s positivity rate is still a bit too high (a seven-day average of 18.7% on Monday) to say this with certainty, but even that number is at least eight percentage points off its recent peaks indicating some sort of turnaround.Tamil Nadu presents an interesting study though. The number of cases in the state has been on a long (and high) plateau since early August — it isn’t clear why — although its positivity rate seems well under control. The testing in both Delhi and Maharashtra appears to have dropped off a bit, while Tamil Nadu continues to remain a (positive) outlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-s5EFG2uNrOF9jwTkiqnNTN.html
07-10-2020||India||Night cremation for law, order: Uttar Pradesh to Supreme Court in Hathras case||A 19-year-old Dalit gang rape victim was cremated in the dead of the night last week to avert an extraordinary law-and-order problem posed by protesters and political parties intent on stoking caste clashes, the state government told the Supreme Court, which on Tuesday described the incident as “horrible” and “extraordinary”.A three-judge bench of the apex court was hearing a public interest litigation seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case.The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, directed the state government to place on record the steps taken to ensure protection of witnesses even as the UP government acquiesced to a top court-monitored CBI probe into the September 14 incident and the woman’s death on September 29 that triggered nationwide protests. “It is a horrible incident. It is extraordinary. We want to know from you whether witness protection plan is in place. File an affidavit,” CJI Bobde told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing the UP government. The court also asked the state to ascertain whether the family engaged a lawyer and sought details of the scope of proceedings relating to the incident before the Allahabad high court. The next hearing is on October 8.  The court proceedings came a day after the state government ordered a probe into an “international conspiracy” to destablise the administration. In a 129-page affidavit, the state government contended “intelligence inputs” pointed to political parties and organisations trying to exploit the situation on September 30 – a day after the victim died at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, triggering street protests. “Intelligence inputs were specifically received late at night on September 29 that lakhs of protestors of both communities (communities of the accused and victim) along with supporters of some political parties and media will assemble in the morning of September 30 at the village which is likely to turn violent and will lead to major law-and-order problems. The [Hathras] district administration took the decision to convince the parents of the victim to cremate her with all religious rites at night to avoid large scale violence in the morning,” the affidavit said. Also Read | Rahul Gandhi accuses PM Modi of ‘not saying a word’ on Hathras gang-rapeThe affidavit also noted that the district was on high alert because of the Babri Masjid demolition verdict, which was pronounced on September 30, and large gatherings were banned under central government guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19. “In such extraordinary and severe circumstances, the district administration took the decision to convince the parents of the deceased to cremate her with all religious rites at night to avoid large scale violence in the morning,” the affidavit contended. The victim’s family has repeatedly said their consent was not taken before the cremation and that no member was present at the last rites, which was conducted at 2.30am without traditional rituals. Along with the affidavit, the state attached screenshots and materials recovered from a website it is investigating for criminal conspiracy. The attachments, allegedly recovered from justiceforhathrasvictim.carrd.co, showed details of protests, trending hashtags, and resources to avoid detention and police action —which made several references to Black protesters, American cities such as Phoenix and New York, and asked protesters to wear ski masks — appeared to have been lifted from the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. The affidavit also said that there could not have been any “bad intention” in hastening the cremation because the victim’s post mortem examination was already done at Safdarjung hospital. Activists and opposition politicians have alleged that the police cremated the body to destroy evidence of the crime. The affidavit went on to blame a “vicious propaganda” unleashed on social media and by sections of the media and some political parties to “deliberately mislead” the public and to create caste and communal disharmony. “There have been orchestrated efforts to malign the image of government on social media by attributing baseless comments and building up a distorted narrative on the Hathras case,” the affidavit read. The state also sought a CBI investigation into the alleged criminal conspiracy to spread caste conflict, instigate violence, and into the propaganda unleashed by certain sections of media and political parties. Also Read | UP police arrest ‘PFI-linked’ men on their way to Hathras from Delhi: All you need to knowThe Dalit woman was allegedly gang raped by four members of the Thakur caste on September 14 and the assault left her partially paralysed. She was rushed to the hospital in Aligarh town, and when her condition deteriorated, shifted to Delhi on September 28. She died the next day. The state government’s handling of the case has come under sharp criticism from activists and opposition parties, who alleged that the victim’s kin were intimidated. The state government has denied the woman was raped, citing a forensic report, though experts have raised doubts about the examination conducted eight days after the crime. The Allahabad high court took suo motu cognisance of the incident on October 1 and ordered the state’s additional chief secretary/principal secretary (Home), director general of police, additional director general, law and order, district magistrate, Hathras, and superintendent of police, Hathras, to appear before it on October 12. “What is the present scope of the proceedings before the high court and how can we widen it and make it more relevant?” asked the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, directing Mehta to respond to the same at the next hearing. Mehta told the top court the state government was not opposing the plea for CBI probe but requested that it should be done under the supervision of the SC. “We (UP government) are not treating this as an adversarial litigation. There are different narratives in the public domain. One innocent life has been lost. It should not be sensationalised,” Mehta said. Senior counsel Indira Jaising, representing a few woman lawyers, asked the SC to ensure that witnesses are protected. She also pointed out how certain lawyers were trying to secure the brief of the victim’s family and asked the top court not to allow that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-cremation-for-law-order-uttar-pradesh-to-supreme-court-in-hathras-case/story-0BO9IMrYPjVPFkLhO9R2tM.html

07-10-2020||India||Scientists Penrose, Genzel and Ghez get Nobel Prize for revealing universe’s ‘darkest secrets’||Even if everything you know about black holes comes from Hollywood flicks — remember Matthew McConaughey journeying into the collapsed star Gargauntua in Interstellar? — the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics announced on Tuesday should give you some reason to cheer.The $1.1 million prize was shared by three scientists credited with unraveling some of the trickiest mysteries of black holes, a point in space with a force of gravity so strong that even light cannot escape. Britain’s Roger Penrose — whose popular science books on the physics of the universe inspired a generation of young stargazers — won one half of the prize for proving that black holes are a direct consequence of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the major building blocks of modern physics that connects law of gravity to space-time geometry.Reinhard Genzel of Germany and Andrea Ghez of the US won the other half of the prize for discovering that an invisible and extremely heavy object — a supermassive black hole — governs the orbits of stars at the centre of our galaxy.“It was an extreme honour and great pleasure to hear the news this morning in a slightly unusual way — I had to get out of my shower to hear it,” said Penrose, paying tribute to his late colleague Stephen Hawking, who he said deserved a share of the prize. Ghez — only the fourth woman to be awarded the Nobel physics prize — said she hoped it would inspire others to enter the field. Genzel was on a Zoom call with colleagues when the phone rang. “Just like in the movies, a voice said: ‘This is Stockholm’,” the 68-year-old astrophysicist told Reuters. “I cried a little bit.” India’s scientific community rejoiced at the news. Padma Bhushan SM Chitre, mathematician and astrophysicist, Penrose’s schoolmate at Cambridge and longtime friend, said the accolade came “at long last” and capped many awards Penrose picked over his almost 70-year career. “He’s now 89 and still working just as hard,” said Chitre. “His work is on the most obtuse of subjects, and as with the singularity theorems he developed with Stephen Hawking, he has found unexpected ways to work out the mathematical details.” Black holes have fascinated scientists for decades because understanding them is crucial to exploring the origin of matter and galaxies.In 1915, Einstein predicted that space and time could be warped by the force of gravity. Yet he did not actually believe in black holes, and finding a way to prove their existence baffled scientists for another 50 years.It was not until a seminal paper in 1965 that Penrose proved that black holes can really form — describing them in detail and stating that, at their centre, there is a singularity where time and space cease to exist. Because they suck in light, black holes — often formed when a star is dying where a large amount of matter is squeezed into a tiny space — are invisible, except with special telescopes. Genzel and Ghez have been looking through those special telescopes for decades, said Varun Bhalerao, assistant professor at IIT-Bombay’s department of physics. They’ve studied images of star positions in the Milky Way year after year and eventually realised those stars were orbiting something in the centre of our galaxy,” he said. By space standards, that orbit is small, but still has a mass many million times the sun. “The only available explanation is that it is a black hole.” It’s not close enough to suck us in, assured GC Anupama, president of the Astronomical Society of India. Penrose’s work, on the other hand, is hard for anyone to see as boring. His theories have influenced the fields as varied as quantum cosmology, the science of consciousness and artificial intelligence. His interests in geometry, the way non-overlapping flat shapes form finite and infinite symmetries, have resulted in mathematical experiments named after him: Penrose tiling. Most famous, perhaps, is his Penrose stairs — with four landings that loop into each other so the steps rise higher but the staircase appears to stay on the same level. “He’s one of our greatest mathematicians,” said Chitre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-penrose-genzel-and-ghez-get-nobel-prize-for-revealing-universe-s-darkest-secrets/story-iIiDeFdZbbDCqx9oP7tAgM.html
07-10-2020||India||BJP leader attacked in Bengal allegedly by TMC workers; phone, gold chain snatched||Samik Bhattacharya, a former legislator of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was attacked, allegedly by workers of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), in the Falta area of Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district on Tuesday afternoon. The windshield of Bhattacharya’s car was completely shattered by bricks thrown by the attackers. Bhattacharya was allegedly kicked and thrashed and his mobile phone and gold chain were snatched. The BJP alleged that his driver was thrashed too and left with bleeding injuries. Bhattacharya is one of the oldest and most known faces of the present leadership. Known for his oratory skill, Bhattacharya regularly takes part in debates on prime television channels on behalf of the party. The BJP leader was on his way to attend an agitation led by party state president Dilip Ghosh when the car was stopped by more than 100 people, the party alleged. Ghosh, too, was shown black flags by TMC workers at Diamond Habour. “Our party leaders are being selectively targeted,” said BJP state vice-president Ritesh Tiwari and referred to the murder of BJP leader Manish Shukla at Titagarh in North 24 Parganas district on Sunday night. Bhattacharya was unwell and could not be contacted. Officers of Falta police station refused to divulge details of the alleged attack. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee is the Lok Sabha member from Diamond Harbour. Urban development minister Firhad Hakim said, “We have to find out the details and see if TMC men were involved or whether it was a fallout of intra-party rivalry in the BJP.” Saukat Mollah, TMC’s youth wing president in South 24 Parganas, told the local media that Bhattacharya witnessed the outburst of people’s anger against the BJP following the murder of a Dalit woman at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. “People have broken the car now. Next time they may break bones,” said Mollah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-attacked-in-bengal-allegedly-by-tmc-workers-phone-gold-chain-snatched/story-6XzCChWVoZud7xneJQfZxL.html
07-10-2020||India||India makes China point, US hints at ‘formal’ Quad||Members of the Quad on Tuesday pushed for a rules-based global order and peaceful resolution of disputes in the face of China’s growing aggression across the Indo-Pacific, even as the US indicated it wants to formalise and expand the informal grouping that includes India, Australia and Japan. Though US secretary of state Mike Pompeo was the only one of the four foreign ministers to name China in his opening remarks, it was evident the shadow of Beijing’s assertive actions hung large over the second ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in Tokyo.Against the backdrop of the five-month border standoff with China, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in his opening remarks that India and the other members of Quad remain committed to a rules-based international order, “underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, and peaceful resolution of disputes”. Pompeo was particularly scathing in his criticism of China, saying it was critical for partners in the Quad to collaborate to “protect our people and partners from the [Chinese Communist Party’s] exploitation, corruption, and coercion” that had been witnessed in the South and East China Sea, “the Mekong, the Himalayas [and] the Taiwan Straits”.He also said the crisis created by the “pandemic that came from Wuhan” was made “infinitely worse by the Chinese Communist Party’s cover-up”. The US will support the others in the Quad to counter the pandemic and rebuild their economies, Pompeo added. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, in her opening remarks, said her country believes in a “region governed by rules, not power”. She added: “We believe in the fundamental importance of individual rights and in a region in which disputes are resolved according to international law.” In a separate statement issued after the meeting, Payne said the ministers reiterated that “states cannot assert maritime claims that are inconsistent with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)” – a reference to China’s actions in South China Sea.Ahead of the foreign ministers’ meeting, Pompeo said in an interview with Nikkei Asia that the US wants to formalise and expand the Quad. “Once we’ve institutionalised what we’re doing — the four of us together — we can begin to build out a true security framework,” he said, adding that the Quad is a “fabric” that can “counter the challenge that the Chinese Communist Party presents to all of us”.Other nations can become part of this fabric at “the appropriate time”, he suggested. Pompeo also said that China’s actions in the region amounted to “bullying”. He added, “This is the Chinese using coercive power. This isn’t how great nations operate. So our mission is to reduce that.” Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi’s remarks at a news conference on Tuesday, too, hinted at the possible expansion of the Quad. Japan wants a free and open Indo-Pacific based on rule of law and freedom of navigation, and “like-minded countries [which] share these values can participate in this vision”, he said. “This time we are having a quadrilateral meeting, Japan, US, Australia and India... if [other] countries can share these values and rules, I think we can expand the framework,” Motegi said. The remarks of the Quad ministers are certain to irk China, whose officials have likened the grouping to a “mini NATO” and said its activities are aimed at targeting third parties. A statement issued by China’s foreign ministry in Mandarin on Tuesday evening called for peace and win-win cooperation instead of “forming exclusive cliques”. It said multilateral cooperation should be open, inclusive and transparent, as well as conducive to mutual understanding and trust between regional countries instead of targeting third parties. “We hope the relevant countries can think more of the regional countries’ common interests and contribute to regional peace, stability and development rather than doing the opposite,” the Chinese statement added. Despite the US push to formalise the Quad, the grouping continues to be loose and informal in nature, which has raised questions among experts as to whether it can effectively work as a counterweight to China. Following Tuesday’s meeting, there was no joint statement and the four countries issued separate readouts. Jaishankar said in his opening remarks that the events of 2020 have demonstrated how “imperative it is for like-minded countries to coordinate responses to the various challenges that the pandemic has brought to the fore”. He added, “As vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values, our nations have collectively affirmed the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.” The significance of the four foreign ministers meeting in person, at a time when foreign travel by world leaders is rare, was highlighted by Jaishankar, who said the gathering in Tokyo is “testimony to the importance that these consultations have gained, particularly in recent times”. A statement issued by the external affairs ministry said the foreign ministers discussed the post-Covid-19 world order and sought a coordinated response to the challenges, including financial problems, emanating from the pandemic. They discussed the sharing of best practices to combat Covid-19, increasing the resilience of supply chains, and enhancing access to affordable vaccines, medicines and medical equipment, the statement said. The ministers exchanged views on regional issues, connectivity, humanitarian assistance, maritime security, health security and counterterrorism, and reiterated their support to the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their readiness to work towards realising a common vision for the Indo-Pacific, the statement added. A readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said that during the three-hour meeting, including a working dinner, the ministers agreed on broadening cooperation with more countries for a free and open Indo-Pacific as well as practical cooperation quality infrastructure and maritime security. The four sides also agreed to hold regular consultations. Former ambassador Neelam Deo, director of the foreign policy think tank Gateway House, highlighted the significance of the Quad foreign ministers holding a second meeting within a year as well as Japan’s new government hosting the event. “As an expert pointed out, China was the godfather of the Quad at the time of its inception and it remains the motivating factor for the Quad even today, since it has been going everywhere picking a fight,” she said. “But now the parties in the Quad are not the only ones who realise China has become more difficult to deal with. This meeting will result in greater focus on economic cooperation and collaboration on issues such as critical materials to reduce over-dependence on one source, and all of this is good for India,” Deo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-makes-china-point-us-hints-at-formal-quad/story-c7ptK8v8MgDygLojE5s6oK.html
07-10-2020||India||‘Would’ve thrown out China in less than 15 mins’, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday sharpened his attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on India’s border standoff with China, saying had the UPA been in power, the neighbouring nation would not have dared to look at our country with an evil eye.He also claimed that China had “dared to enter India and kill our soldiers” as Modi has “weakened” the country.Further targeting the government over the nearly five-month-long military standoff in eastern Ladakh, Gandhi said during the led UPA’s rule, “China would not dare to take a step inside our territory”, adding had UPA been in power, “we would have evicted and thrown out China and it would not have taken 15 minutes to do so”.The former Congress president, who reached here from Pehowa to address his final public gathering as part of his ‘Kheti Bachao Yatra’, said none of the policies of the Modi government during the last six years were meant to benefit the poor, farmers or labourers.“Modi said China has not entered Indian territory. Then how were our 20 jawans killed? Who killed them?” he asked while addressing a gathering at Anaj Mandi here late this evening.“There is only one nation in the entire world whose land has been usurped and that is India and they call themselves patriots. The prime minister calls himself ‘desh bhakt’ (patriot) and the whole country knows that China’s forces are inside our territory, what kind of patriot he is?” said Gandhi.The government had earlier termed as “mischievous interpretation” the Congress’s claims that China had occupied Indian territory in eastern Ladakh region.Continuing his attack, Gandhi said, “China came inside our territory four months back and how much time will it take to throw them out. I feel till the time the UPA government is not formed, China will continue to occupy the territory, but the day our government (will be in power) we will throw them out,” adding “Our Army, Air Force would have pushed them back by 100 km.” He claimed that the prime minister does not realise the power of the country, its farmers and labourers and is only concerned about his image. “He clicks photos and you must have seen the empty tunnel he is waving (referring to inauguration of Atal tunnel a few days ago,” he said.Gandhi, who held a series of tractor rallies in Punjab since Sunday to protest the Centre’s new farm laws, drove a tractor to Haryana, where he held two gatherings, the previous one being in Pehowa.Senior Congress leaders including Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Kumari Selja, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Kuldeep Bishnoi, Kiran Choudhary, Ajay Singh Yadav and Deepender Singh Hooda also accompanied Gandhi during his programmes in Haryana.The Haryana leg of his tractor rally got delayed by more than two hours after state authorities stopped a large number of Congress workers from Punjab who were accompanying him from Patiala to the inter-state border.However, later Gandhi along with few Congress leaders was allowed to enter Haryana, where a large number of party workers accompanied him during his tractor rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/would-ve-thrown-out-china-in-less-than-15-mins-says-rahul-gandhi/story-xTERnZ1Qt2aUdFo0G9s8OM.html
07-10-2020||India||Ashram crossing descends into chaos; commuters, residents suffer||Peak hour or off-peak, the Ashram intersection has turned into a nightmare for commuters and residents who cram into a stretch barely wide enough for a bus, navigate crumbling, cratered and often flooded roads, with construction activity to ease a decades-long choke point only leading to more chaos.The problem is acute along Mathura Road, where authorities are now creating an underpass beneath the intersection with Ring Road. The work, carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD), is part of a two-stage project to decongest the both arterial stretches that are used every day by hundreds of thousands of vehicles crossing from one part of the National Capital Region to another. But poor planning and road management is dogging the project. Roughly 20 metres of the 30-metre wide Mathura Road, where the 750m long underpass will take shape, has been barricaded for diggers and earthmovers to function. A potholed 175m stretch between Ashram and Bhogal is the most squeezed. When HT visited the spot, jams extended for over a kilometre on either side of the intersection and the air hung heavy with dust from construction and smoke from idling vehicles. “Pedestrians have to move along the traffic hoping nothing untoward happens to them. If by any chance a bus or any other vehicle breaks down on the roads to and from Bhogal, it would easily lead to a logjam of 2-3 hours,” said Vijender Singh Chaudhary over the cacophony of impatient honking by motorists nearby.  Chaudhary, 48, uses the stretch as part of his daily commute. “During peak hours, it now takes one hour or more to cross the intersection. In non-peak hours, it takes 20-30 minutes. The actual time that such a short stretch takes is hardly 2-3 minutes,” he added. The area is now so tightly packed that pedestrians, shop owners and those on two-wheelers are also exposed to the risk of getting infected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Data released by the traffic department shows that since the Covid-19 lockdown was eased and construction work on the stretch resumed with preliminary diversions, the intersection has been recording 280,000 vehicles a day, amounting to 11,600 vehicles on an hour. The busy intersection did not have traffic police personnel deployed during the afternoon on Tuesday, when HT visited the spot. With the old road now taken over for the underpass, authorities widened the stretch by eating into the footpath. The resulting space is still little for vehicles, while potholes, leaking water pipelines, debris and construction material impede the traffic flow. “There are broken water pipelines of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) that are right under these makeshift roads, leading to ankle-deep waterlogging at the time of regular supply, which unfortunately falls during the peak traffic hours. This is the worst I have seen in 40 years of living in the area,” said Deepak Dubey, the owner of a cybercafe on Mathura Road. Residents HT spoke to said the resulting construction dust now blows into their homes, covering their floors and furniture in thick layers every day. The part of Mathura Road on the Friends Colony side of Ashram Chowk is in a relatively better state. PWD has nearly finished construction of the ramp for the underpass on that side. Apart from the underpass, the decongestion project also includes the extension of the Ashram flyover till the mouth of the DND Flyway.The estimated cost of the underpass is ₹78 crore while the cost of the flyover extension is ₹128 crore. The initial deadline of the project was December 2020 which now has been shifted to March 2021 due to Covid-19.Delhi’s PWD minister Satyendar Jain and Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to calls and queries seeking comments.Officials in PWD, however, said it has set a target of 10 days in which the barricade on the Bhogal/Nizamuddin side will be reduced by 1-1.5 metres on either side of the carriageways. “The department has received several complaints of severe traffic jam in the area. A meeting was convened recently and it was decided that the ramp on the Bhogal side will be expedited. Also, the ramp on the Faridabad side is 99% complete in record time and only boundary works are currently being carried out there,” said a senior PWD official, asking not to be named. The chaos at Ashram has also been a recipe for uneasy road-rage confrontations, risky as they are at a time when people avoid close contact with each other. “It was just two days ago that a four-wheeler driver abused me and pushed me off my bike for inadvertently touching his bumper. The road is so bumpy and cramped that everyone starts shouting or honking even if there is a few seconds delay in turning on the vehicle after the traffic signal turns green,” said Naved Hassan, 38, who travels for work to Connaught Place from Molarband every day on his two-wheeler.Experts said the problems are a reflection of bad planning. Dr S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, CSIR-CRRI said it appeared that hardly any guidelines of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) are being followed at the Ashram intersection. “The IRC rules say that if there is any construction happening, the road that is made open for vehicular movement should have the wearing course set up. But in this case, the roads, especially the one on the side of Bhogal, are in such bad shape that we cannot even call them potholes. There are craters on that road. There are no signages and no stop markings on the road. The only good thing is that they have put traffic signals now at all sides of the intersection,” he said. SD Mishra, the additional commissioner of police (southern traffic range), said that signboards have been placed at multiple junctures to warn motorists about congestion at Ashram Chowk and the alternative routes to take.“But we can’t force the private motorists to not take a road. We have written to the DTC to make their buses take diversions that will allow them to avoid Ashram Chowk. That will help us avoid some congestion on Mathura Road,” said Mishra.But it is up to the DTC to take a final decision on that and the decision is awaited, said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashram-crossing-descends-into-chaos-commuters-residents-suffer/story-MVAqbUs9b9L1gy7aAg1JwJ.html
07-10-2020||India||Facebook called in as witness, not accused: Delhi Assembly to Supreme Court||The Delhi legislative assembly told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it had summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on whether it contributed in any way to the build-up of the February, 2020 communal violence in the Capital.The Delhi Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee wanted to elicit suggestions on how social media platforms could be used to strengthen unity among citizens in the future and Facebook executives were summoned as witnesses, not as accused, an affidavit filed by deputy secretary Sadanand Sah said, adding that no coercive action was intended.“It is the inherent right of the legislature to examine matters of public importance and for that purpose to require the presence of persons who are performing a duty of public importance or who has expertise in the matter, before the committee,” the affidavit said.Consequently, Mohan cannot claim right to remain silent or to be left alone in response to the summons to depose before a lawful committee of an empowered legislature, and such right is not a fundamental right except when the person is an accused under Article 20 of the Constitution, it added.Article 20 states that no person can be compelled to be a witness against himself.“Petitioner No.1 (Ajit Mohan) is not an accused. The right to remain silent is relevant only in a criminal investigation. The proceedings before a committee are not criminal or judicial proceedings. There is no accused before a committee. All persons who appear before it are witnesses and are subjected to the examinations by its members as per rules of the house,” it was submitted.The affidavit was in consonance with the stance of the Delhi assembly during the hearing of the case on September 23, when senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi representing the Delhi assembly, had clarified that Mohan was not summoned as an accused.Also Read | Facebook set to tighten rules on what its staff can discuss“He was called as a witness, not as an accused. No coercive steps were intended. It had come to light that Facebook was misused (in connection with communal riots). So, we want to get suggestions from them and devise mechanism so that Facebook is not misused,” Singhvi had submitted during that hearing.Mohan and Facebook moved the Supreme Court on September 22 challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the Delhi Legislative Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee. The summons stem from the committee’s decision to look into Facebook’s role following several foreign media reports that purported to show the social media company may have acted in a political partisan manner.The first of such reports showed Facebook refused to act against a Telangana BJP MLA who made Islamophobic remarks. He has since been banned from the service. Mohan had submitted in his petition stated that the subject matter under investigation by the Delhi assembly falls within the exclusive domain of the Union government and a state legislative assembly cannot compel witnesses to appear and provide evidence on such subjects.He was first summoned by the committee for its meeting of September 15 in connection with the complaints alleging deliberate omissions and inaction by the social media company in removing hateful content and posts. The committee earlier said that in its meeting of August 31, it had prima facie found Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead and over 400 injured.The Delhi assembly affidavit filed on Tuesday also claimed that various witnesses who deposed before it had alleged inaction by Facebook against hateful material on its platform during Delhi riots.“They pointed out among other things that Facebook essentially refuses to take down the hateful and divisive content off its platform but at the same time deliberately removes or lowers the visibility of content which aims at promoting unity and amity amongst communities,” it was submitted.Mohan has maintained before the top court that a state legislative assembly cannot compel non-members to appear before it for an investigation into a subject matter which is beyond its jurisdiction.The affidavit by Delhi assembly, however, pointed out that Mohan has already deposed before the Parliament on some other issues and employees and representatives of Facebook regularly depose before legislatures across the world including in the United States of America where Facebook is incorporated.“Therefore, the attempt to press and engage some fundamental rights in the present facts is prima-facie not genuine or bonafide (in good faith), and the fundamental rights claimed are not at all engaged in the present facts. The petitioners cannot be allowed to pick and choose which Constitutionally empowered body they will appear before, as per their own convenience,” the affidavit stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fb-called-in-as-witness-not-accused-delhi-assembly-to-supreme-court/story-qmROzL2yEf4zqjhhGO4INP.html
07-10-2020||India||2 men held for murder of Bengal BJP leader||The West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested two men in the early hours of Tuesday in connection with the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manish Shukla at Titagarh in North 24 Parganas district on Sunday night. The father of Muhammad Khurram, one of the arrested men, was murdered 10 years ago, said BJP leaders and police. Shukla, 39, an outgoing councilor of Titagarh municipality, was one of the accused in the murder case registered in April 2010. The charges against him were later dropped. Sheikh Gulab, the second man arrested by CID, is suspected to have followed Shukla’s movements and passed on information to the hitmen. In Shukla’s murder, nine people have been named in the First Information Report (FIR) on the basis of the complaint lodged by his father Chandramani Shukla, who is a doctor. The outgoing chairman of Barrackpore municipality, Uttam Das, and his counterpart in Titagarh municipality, Prashanta Choudhury, have been named in the complaint. The two Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders denied the allegation, saying the BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh was blaming them because they campaigned to stop the BJP from making further inroads in the district before the 2019 assembly election in the constituency and 500 BJP supporters recently rejoined the TMC.“There was an internal squabble in the district BJP unit because Shukla aspired to contest the assembly polls,” said Das. Dismissing the claim, Singh said: “It is not true at all. In the BJP, top leaders select candidates. People like us do not take such calls.” The CID is pursuing the “personal enmity angle in Shukla’s murder, but not ruling out the involvement of powerful people, an officer told HT on condition of anonymity. Arjun Singh has alleged that the CID itself is involved in the conspiracy. “We have evidence that Shukla’s movements were monitored by some officers at the CID headquarters at Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata on Sunday. We will move the Calcutta high court on Wednesday, seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” said Singh. Singh and Shukla both left the TMC and joined the BJP in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Singh made news by defeating TMC’s sitting MP Dinesh Trivedi in the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat in 2019. To prove Khurram’s connection with the TMC, Singh showed the media the accused man’s old photos with minister Bratya Basu, former minister Madan Mitra and Panihati legislator Nirmal Das. While Das denied having any link with the accused, Mitra and Basu could not be contacted despite several efforts. Khurram’s father Muhammad Islam, who was a cloth merchant, was gunned down in April 2010 near Titagarh railway station. “Khurram was very young at that time. Shukla was arrested and released after a few days. Police will find out whether Khurram is involved or not. I always told him revenge cannot be the answer to anything. Now that Shukla has been murdered our next generation will be in danger. There is no end of this,” said Khurram’s cousin, Raju Khan. “Khurram, I and all members of our family are supporters of the TMC,” said Khan. Attempts were made on Shukla’s life four times since 2009, the year he joined the ruling party, leaving the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He survived without a scratch in the attacks carried out in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-men-held-for-murder-of-bengal-bjp-leader/story-CNm5vVludwWWrEZcyEqWKN.html
07-10-2020||India||Supreme Court summons chief secretaries in stubble-burning case||Concerns over stubble burning turning out to be a potent killer in times of the Covid-19 pandemic echoed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday with a bench moving swiftly to post two applications and a separate petition on the issue for October 16 and asking the chief secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to remain present in court that day.The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said: “It is an important issue or else the whole air will go bad.”The Court was hearing a petition filed by two young environmental activists – a Class 12 student, who under his own initiative of “Plant A Million Trees”, has planted 150,000 trees in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), and a third-year law student who is an active campaigner against single-use plastic. The petition demanded that the court stop the stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana which poses a health risk to citizens of Delhi-NCR by enveloping the region in a dense, smoggy fog during the winters .Along with the petition, the court heard two applications as part of the MC Mehta case that deals with environmental pollution in Delhi-NCR. Vikrant Tongad, a member of the Zila Samiti on the issue of crop burning in Gautam Budh Nagar district of UP demanded that Happy Seeder machines meant to mechanically remove crop stubble be mandatorily issued to farmers either free or at subsidized rates. For preventing crop fires, he suggested satellite-based geospatial technology that is already in use by the Centre for mapping and preventing forest fires. Although in the past, the Supreme Court had ordered the states of Punjab, UP and Haryana to provide cash incentive to farmers who do not resort to crop burning, Tongad suggested that the court consider making payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers subject to verification that they have not resorted to stubble burning. The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said: “Let Union of India file reply…Let the chief secretaries of the states viz., Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, be present before this Court on the next date of hearing.” The second application was filed by a Supreme Court lawyer, Manali Singhal, who through her plea sought immediate curbs on stubble burning. She produced international research which showed how air pollution can “exacerbate” the spread of the Covid-19 infection, posing high risk to senior citizens, children and people with respiratory illness. The application suggested appointment of an officer or Commissioner to enforce Court’s past orders to end stubble burning. Such powers are available to an officer so appointed under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the application stated. The bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta if such an officer has been appointed. Mehta said he will seek instructions and inform the court. Senior advocate Aparajita Singh. who is assisting the Court as amicus curiae (friend of the Court), responded by saying that over the past years, the court was getting assistance on stubble burning and related environmental issues from a statutory authority called Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, in short EPCA, which has been submitting regular reports to the court. Just prior to Tuesday’s hearing, EPCA filed a report showing how the state governments assured the Supreme Court in November 2019 that all measures are in place. This assurance was recorded by the Court in its order of July 30 and August 24 this year. “The chief secretaries of the neighbouring states are present here. The court must ask them as to why despite repeated assurances in the past, stubble burning continues to happen?” The court was of the view that the issue required an expert to deal with. “Suggest impartial people who can examine this issue. How can courts go into this,” the bench remarked. One of the applicants suggested appointing former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur. amicus curiae; the applicant informed the court that EPCA is the expert body constituted under Section 5 of Environment Protection Act. The Delhi government, represented by advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, informed the court that the issue need not require a separate agency to supervise as the court had been “hand-holding” the issue over the past many years. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the two young environmental activists, told the court that he will suggest the names of few independent experts. In his petition, Singh argued, “The consequence of allowing any stubble burning to take place in the times of this pandemic will be catastrophic…enhanced pollution level can offer direct pathway for airborne transmission” of the Covid-19 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-summons-chief-secretaries-in-stubble-burning-case/story-oJPuiegStYVVcki3bsGmxJ.html
07-10-2020||India||Bihar election: Congress defers 3 nominations over charges of sexual exploitation||The Congress has put on hold at least three names suggested for selection as party candidates in the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar, pending further scrutiny following objections by some leaders over their alleged involvement in sexual exploitation cases, people familiar with the development said. The move is seen as an immediate fallout of last month’s Hathras gang-rape and murder case in Uttar Pradesh on which the Congress leadership has taken a strong stand, a party functionary said on condition of anonymity. “We have further tightened our nomination process. The names had been forwarded by our state poll panel. We have decided to keep these on hold till we conduct further scrutiny,” said the functionary, a screening committee member. He said there were objections to these names from some sections of the party after which it was decided to put them on hold pending greater scrutiny. He refused to disclose the names. “We are going through each and every name that is coming to us in a detailed manner and these will be cleared only after proper scrutiny. It is a longstanding resolve of the Congress leadership to keep those with criminal background and also rape accused out of the nomination process,” added the person quoted above. At a press briefing on Tuesday, Congress leader Sushmita Dev said political parties should not field rape accused in elections. “As the Mahila Congress president, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that I am totally against giving nomination to anybody who has been accused of any serious moral turpitude. I feel that we should have a veto power against such people. That’s my view and I have spoken about it internally in the party,” she said. A screening committee shortlists the party candidates and forwards the list to the central election committee (CEC) for final selection. On Monday, a meeting of the CEC, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, is said to have cleared some names for the Bihar polls. Party’s screening committee chairman Avinash Pande said the CEC discussed the names of candidates for 46 seats on Monday. “These will be cleared after further scrutiny and the CEC will meet again soon in this regard,” he added. Bihar will go to polls in three phases. While the first phase of elections will be held on October 28, the second phase is on November 3. The third and final phase of polling will be held on November 7; votes will be counted on November 10. As per the seat-sharing agreement among the constituents of the mahagathbandhan, or grand alliance, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will contest 144 seats, the Congress 70 and the Left parties 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-defers-3-nominations-over-charges-of-sexual-exploitation/story-WDwtmY0W2MloJf8u4lubVL.html
07-10-2020||India||142 drug syndicates, heroin trade under NCB’s scanner||142 operational drug syndicates, heroin trade of $19 billion (Rs 140,000 crore), and 2 million heroin addicts -- these are some of the staggering numbers presented in an analysis by the country’s Narcotics Control Bureau that comes at a time when investigations by various agencies into drug-use and the drug trade has roiled both the Kannada and Hindi film industries. According to the analysis, which has been reviewed by HT, the syndicates play a key role in the multi-billion dollar trade and have links to Western Europe, Canada, Africa, Australia, South American and countries in West Asia. NCB has estimated that 360 metric tonnes (MT) of retail-quality heroin and about 36 metric tonnes (MT) of wholesale-quality heroin, which is purer, are smuggled into different cities in India every year. The 2 million users consume almost 1,000 kg of high quality heroin every day, it adds. Punjab continues to be an epicentre of drug smuggling with 15,449 persons arrested from the state last year -- out of a total of 74,620 arrests across 36 states and union territories under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Thus far in 2020, 5,299 of the 18,600 total arrests are from the state. The federal agency recently shared its findings with home minister Amit Shah, who is learnt to have directed it to go after the syndicates. The crackdown on bigger drug syndicates is being spearheaded by NCB chief Rakesh Asthana, who probed several high profile cases including the VVIP chopper case, the fodder scam, and the bank fraud by Vijay Mallya during his stint in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Asthana was not available for comment.Sharing details of the country’s top 142 syndicates, currently being watched closely, a senior official who didn’t want to be named said that as many as 25 of these operate from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and parts of Haryana. Rajasthan alone has nine , as do Maharashtra and Goa combined. Also Read | With cops on overdrive, cannabis seizure in Odisha likely to cross 1,000 quintals this yearSome of the top syndicates have found to be connected with Afghanistan’s Taliban and Pakistan’s spy agency ISI -- and procure heroin through them -- while some have direct/indirect business dealings with Colombian cartels through their associates in Europe, Canada and Mexico for supplying cocaine, the first officer said. Traditionally, major trafficking of heroin in India takes place through the India-Pakistan border, mainly in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, from where it is further transported to other states. The NCB analysis adds that Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep have around 10 big drug syndicates with the Kasargod and Kannur networks considered to be the most prolific ones. A Qatar-based syndicate is primarily linked with smugglers in Kasargod, Kannur (Kerala), Kodagu, Mangaluru (Karnataka), Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Goa, Chennai, and Delhi for supplying cocaine, high quality heroin and psychotropic substances, it said.  NCB has already registered at least 14 cases in connection with this Qatar network. “The members of this network communicate directly with the kingpins lodged in Qatar central jail. The cartel uses people looking for jobs in the Gulf as carriers, some of whom are lured by offering free tickets, hotel or honeymoon packages etc. The drugs are concealed in check-in or carry-on luggage kept with dry or wet food items, groceries, clothes or in custom made concealments,” said K P S Malhotra, deputy director NCB.Also Read | With cops on overdrive, cannabis seizure in Odisha likely to cross 1,000 quintals this yearFor cocaine, NCB is keeping an eye on traffickers based in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai Bengaluru, and Chennai. Malhotra added that “India’s proximity to South east Asian countries Myanmar, Laos and Thailand (known as the Golden Triangle) and South West Asian countries i.e. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran (called the Golden Crescent) provides the major context for drug trafficking here. Also, unhindered air and sea linkages with other countries make India vulnerable to drug trafficking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/142-drug-syndicates-heroin-trade-under-ncb-s-scanner/story-yPbfCbo9rRemM9ooZzp9kO.html
07-10-2020||India||SIT visits Hathras village; victim’s kin get police cover||A three-member special investigation team probing the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman visited her village in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district on Tuesday even as police accepted the family’s request for round-the-clock security and claimed the victim’s relatives feeling safe again. Union minister of state for social justice Ramdas Athawale and a delegation of left parties met the family of the victim, whose death and subsequent forced cremation a week ago sparked widespread protests. Athawale offered Rs 5 lakh as monetary help to the family and promised to take up the issue with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “This incident is heart-wrenching. This puts humanity to shame. We told the family that we are with them. Whatever CM has assured them should be implemented. The culprits should be hanged,” Ramdas said. A joint delegation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) spent around two hours with the family. “We have been told about the brutal gangrape... and that her cremation was done in the middle of the night without informing the family. These sort of things are unheard of in the 21st century and are a blatant violation of the Indian Constitution and the guarantees it gives to our people. We expressed our solidarity with her family,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said. On September 14, the victim was raped by four members of the Thakur caste in Hathras district when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She was partially paralysed in the attack. Also Read | Hathras fallout: Yogi Adityanath smells ‘international’ plot to destabilise UP govtAs her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29. At 2.30am the next day, the police forcibly cremated the body without the family’s consent in a field near the village. Since then, political leaders have made a beeline to the village even as the government has denied she was raped, citing the forensic report. Five police officials have also been suspended in line with preliminary recommendations of the special investigation team (SIT). On Tuesday, the SIT, which visited the village earlier, went to the site where the victim was cremated at 2.30am on September 30. The team – comprising home secretary Bhagwan Swaroop, deputy inspector general of police Chandra Prakash and commandant of the Agra provincial armed constabulary Poonam-- also went to the site of the crime and interacted with people in the village. Superintendent of Police (SP) Vineet Jaiswal said two women sub-inspectors (SIs) and six women constables have been stationed at the victim’s house. “Two security personnel have been deployed for the security of the victim’s brother.” He said all aspects of the family’s security were being looked after by the police.

The officer said he personally met the victims and assured them that all their security concerns, even if it arises in the future, will be taken care of. “They seemed confident after our assurances, I also gave them my personal mobile number to reach out at any time,” he added. He said that the police department will not allow holding any meetings, or panchayat in the village and its immediate vicinity in view of the security concerns. This came days after Brahmin and Thakur communities held a mega gathering or mahapanchayat two kilometres from the village and expressed support for the four men accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-visits-hathras-village-victim-s-kin-get-police-cover/story-oqDDur7ooDd8SLyAPWUsVI.html
07-10-2020||India||Shaheen Bagh stir: SC to decide on Wednesday scope of right to protest||The Supreme Court will pronounce its judgment on Wednesday regarding scope of right to protest in public places and whether or not there can be limitations to such right.The verdict will be delivered by a 3-judge bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul in a batch of petitions concerning road blockade at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi by protesters who were opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).While the issue concerning Shaheen Bagh itself was rendered infructuous (pointless) since the protests ended after the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and lockdown was imposed, the court heard the parties on the larger issue of right to protests in public places and to what extent it can be regulated and balanced with the right of general public to move without hindrance.“The right to protests should be balanced with the right to movement of public. In a parliamentary democracy, there is a right to protest. But can a public road be blocked for a long time? When and where can protests be held? We will think about how it can be balanced,” the bench which also comprised justices Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari had remarked during the hearing of the case on September 21.The petition before Supreme Court was filed by advocate Amit Sahni in February, seeking removal of road blockade on Shaheen Bagh–Kalindi Kunj stretch.The protesters at Shaheen Bagh were opposing the CAA, which was passed on December 12, 2019. The CAA amended Section 2 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 in a manner which made any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan eligible to apply for Indian citizenship by naturalisation even if they were illegal migrants.However, the amendment excluded Muslim illegal migrants from availing the opportunity to apply for Indian citizenship, which triggered widespread protests across the country.Shaheen Bagh was the epicentre of such protests in the national capital. The protest started on December 15, 2019 and continued for more than three months.The Supreme Court had tasked senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran, on February 17, to mediate with the protesters and come to a constructive solution to resolve the issue but no solution could be arrived at.Most of the protesters, however, left the site by March 23 due to the lockdown imposed in Delhi because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) threat. But the stage and other structures which had been put in place during the protests were retained and a few men and women remained at the site as a symbolic continuation of the protests. Later, the police had dismantled it.Sahni stated that while people have the right to protest, the same is subject to reasonable restrictions and protesters cannot be allowed to occupy public roads indefinitely. He contended that right to protests it should not inconvenience public at large.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta representing the central government also concurred with the petitioner stating that right to protest cannot be absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions.“Every right is qualified,” Mehta had argued.Abid Sheikh, one of the organisers at the Shaheen Bagh protest site, said, “If right to protest is scuttled or limited in anyway, it will be akin to killing democracy. It is a step closer to dictatorship. As far as protesting in public spaces is concerned, our sit-in agitation was not to trouble citizens. It was to put forward our concerns before the world. That is why we had occupied only one carriageway of Road 13A. The other routes were barricaded by authorities causing trouble to public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shaheen-bagh-stir-sc-to-decide-on-wednesday-scope-of-right-to-protest/story-WsT3TM0j0EuJnDkkJP4PxI.html
07-10-2020||Editorials||On public protests, the SC is right | HT Editorial||The Supreme Court (SC) has qualified the right to protest, and said that while dissent and democracy go hand-in-hand, protests in public places for an indefinite period of time are unacceptable. A three-judge bench has also said that authorities must ensure the removal of the occupation of public places, and that they must not “hide behind court orders”. The order comes in response to a petition on the Shaheen Bagh protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA. The SC was, in effect, dealing with the tension between the right to protest of a set of citizens and the right to mobility and convenience of other citizens and has come up with a formulation which respects protests, but within limits.This newspaper was critical of CAA, and recognised the symbolic importance of Shaheen Bagh — of peaceful dissenters, primarily Muslim women, who had the support and solidarity of a range of other groups, critiquing a law with the language of constitutionalism and secularism. But it was also critical of the blocking of roads, for the Shaheen Bagh protests — and a range of similar protests elsewhere — caused disruption and inconvenience for citizens. This also ended up deepening the communal divide. And what some saw as an effort to replicate Shaheen Bagh became the immediate trigger for the Delhi riots. All of this suggests that Indian democracy is best served when citizens freely express their views, mobilise and protest, but do so without undermining the rights of fellow-citizens. This will help keep the trust between differing constituencies and enhance the legitimacy of dissent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-public-protests-the-sc-is-right-ht-editorial/story-6fX0J8eVnvGkqHeHrdqSkL.html
07-10-2020||Editorials||Hathras: UP is on the wrong track, again||There is now a growing opinion — including among some in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — that the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has handled the Hathras case poorly. This could be due to political patronage to members of a caste group deemed loyal; it could be due to administrative incompetence; it could be due to the patriarchal mindset that governs both social and institutional attitudes towards women; it could be due to the prejudice with which Dalits are viewed in this country; or it could be due to all these factors.What the UP government needed to do was ensure correctives — both in the immediate context to hold perpetrators as well as administrative officials in Hathras accountable and in the medium-term by instituting structural reforms in the criminal justice system and its intersection with political power.Instead, it has decided to order a probe into an “international” conspiracy and plot to defame the Yogi Adityanath government and foment caste violence. The UP police has also filed 19 FIRs against both named and unnamed individuals on charges ranging from sedition to promoting enmity between castes and communities. This is outrageous. The outcry against the injustice in Hathras was because citizens were shaken and angry and wanted action. Not only did the UP government fail in its task of protecting the life, liberty and dignity of a young Dalit woman, it first sought to cover up the incident and is now using the controversy to attack critics and construct conspiracy theories, invoking the proverbial foreign hand. The state should stop looking outside, and look within its own administration. That is where the fault lies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/hathras-up-is-on-the-wrong-track-again/story-yd8oWi4VvIYYA2MdtVNsSK.html
07-10-2020||Editorials||Air pollution: Delhi is taking the right steps. But a more comprehensive approach is needed||Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Monday, announced a seven-point action plan to tackle air pollution, ranging from measures to control dust and mitigating hot spots to a mobile application for complaints and a “war room” for monitoring. He also requested the neighbouring states to come up with an alternative to stubble burning and to implement anti-pollution measures suggested by the Supreme Court in 2019 for 11 thermal power plants operating within a 300 km radius of Delhi. The Capital is inching towards an air pollution spike, with winds slowing and the mornings getting colder, and a large number of crop stubble fires being detected over northwestern India. In mid-September, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority wrote to Punjab and Haryana, asking the states to control crop stubble burning cases. On its part, the Centre has talked about “airshed manag-ement” — which means scientifically identifying regional airsheds that have common airflows due to topography and meteorology — to tackle the problem holistically.The Delhi government’s steps are much needed. According to University of Chicago’s Air Quality Life Index, a pollution index that translates particulate air pollution into its impact on life expectancy, residents of Delhi could see 9.4 years added to their lives if pollution was reduced to meet the World Health Organization guidelines; 6.5 years if pollution met India’s national standard. This year, Covid-19 exacerbates the challenge. Several studies have suggested that people whose lungs are affected by air pollution over the years are at higher mortality risk.However, promises are not enough. Delhi and other states need to implement their policies and strengthen monitoring systems. A new real-time source apportionment study of Delhi’s air pollution by IIT-Kanpur shows that key particulate matter sources in Delhi are dust, inorganic constituents (chloride), carcinogenic (chromium, nickel, arsenic, lead) and other elements (chlorine, zinc, copper, manganese). The presence of these shows that the sources are not just local but also regional. The study points towards the need for three reforms (move away from fossil fuels for cooking; a rapid transition towards electric vehicles; and shifting towards less-polluting technologies). But only one state taking these measures will not have the desired impact because air pollution is not just Delhi’s problem. It is a regional problem, and, indeed, a national crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/air-pollution-delhi-is-taking-the-right-steps-but-a-more-comprehensive-approach-is-needed/story-2foYlLoujO5ug8xaHh24LP.html
