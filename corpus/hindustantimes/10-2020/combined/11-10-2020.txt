That the QUAD partners chose to hold a physical meeting with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne going into a 14-day mandatory quarantine after her return from Tokyo, indicates the seriousness of the dialogue. It is quite evident that the dialogue is there to stay with all the four democracies quite comfortable with each other even though each has a different score to settle with Beijing. If Ladakh’s military standoff is a threat to India, the Chinese aggression on Taiwan are a matter of serious concern to both Japan and US with Australian at the receiving end on trade issue with Beijing.While former US president Barack Obama’s much promised Asian pivot never fructified, the Trump administration has been able to open diplomatic doors in the Indo-Pacific with QUAD partners and key ASEAN nations. In contrast, Beijing’s wolf warrior diplomacy has hardly yielded any friends except for client states like Pakistan, Cambodia and North Korea. Even though China is the second largest importer of defence hardware from Russia, the latter is deeply suspicious of Beijing’s intrusion into Moscow’s traditional area of influence like in Central Asia, Belarus, Armenia, Azerbaijan and continuing friction with an old and firm ally India. New Delhi is the largest importer of Russian defence equipment.To complicate matters, China has expressed concern over Russia supplying S-400 missile system to India while at the same time asking for the latest S-500 missile system to protect its borders. While the range of S-400 system is 400 kilometres, the S-500 has 600-kilometre range and it is not difficult now to fathom China’s adversaries across land and sea.While India, Japan and Australia do have a power differential with China, events of the past eight months have fundamentally changed the relationship of QUAD partners with Beijing. Even if there is a change of administration in US next month, America has taken a 180 degree turn from the days of Richard Nixon-Mao Zedong bonhomie. The Chinese aggression in Ladakh in May this year has ensured that informal dialogue diplomacy at the apex level has come to an end for a long time to come with India not afraid to name the adversary and stand up to it. The QUAD meeting made it clear that Japan under Yoshihide Suga and Australia under Scot Morrison have no intentions of succumbing to Chinese pressure.Under the circumstances, it won’t be surprising if India invites Australia for the Malabar naval exercise in Bay of Bengal next month with Japan and US being other participants. China has only itself to blame for pushing the QUAD partners to join hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-has-itself-to-blame-for-strong-quad-analysis/story-aJDXH0f5Om1SpnW1u6bFnI.html

The accused is absconding, and we have charged him under sections 380 (theft), 454 and 457 (trespass) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said Vilas Chowgule, senior inspector, Waliv police station. Prior to losing his job with the logistics company, Gadigaonkar used to load the money into the ATMs and knew the password of the DCB centre, said Chowgule. Due to the lockdown and unemployment, Gadigaonkar decided to loot the ATM centre. The faulty ATM was to be replaced on Saturday by the logistics company. The matter came to light when staffers of the logistics company reached the ATM to take custody of the money but found that the machine had been opened and the cash stolen. The CCTV cameras installed inside the ATM kiosk had stopped working two days before the theft and were taken for repairs. “The thief knew about the development, and hence we suspected it was an inside job,” said Chowgule. The ATM had not been working for two weeks and Ajay Gaikwad, area manager of CMS Logistics, who reached the spot, said that his technical team was supposed to remove the money and replace it. He said there was around ₹11 lakh in the machine at the time of the theft.“As the ATM centre was closed, we suspected that the thief may have entered the kiosk disguised as a technical staffer,” said Chowgule, adding that police are now on the lookout for Gadigaonkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-employee-booked-for-11-lakh-theft-from-vasai-atm/story-CycWF45OdTpq3ZoBnJCbuK.html

Amrik Singh Kadian, who is heading the farmers’ protest at Ladhowal toll plaza, said, “The NHAI has deliberately initiated the construction work now to make it look like the farmers are causing the traffic jams. We have urged them to postpone the project for a few days but the authorities did not pay heed to our request. Finally, we were forced to deploy some of our supporters to help the local police in regulating the traffic.”Commuters meanwhile are thanking the farmers. Karanpreet Kaur, a city resident who was returning from Amritsar today, said, “The traffic has been restricted at Ladhowal and Phillaur side of National Highway. And it gives an impression that farmers have blocked the toll plaza. But on reaching the toll plaza, we found that farmers actually helping to ease the traffic chaos.” Another commuter Akshit Taneja said, “I am thankful to the farmers for not letting the toll authorities stop the vehicle. First of all, it takes half-an-hour from Ladhowal village to reach the toll plaza at Sutlej Bridge. If the toll would have been operational, it would have made the matter worse and the vehicles would have to stop which would have further compounded the problem.”When contacted, Chanchal Rathore, in-charge of the Ladhowal toll plaza, said that he was sitting in a meeting and did not answer HT’s query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-farmers-lay-siege-to-ladhowal-toll-barrier-force-free-passage-of-vehicles/story-cKHFxqIfO16a9wJ9VjejYO.html

11-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Raghopur, Hasanpur seats to decide fate of Lalu’s two sons||With the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) issuing symbols for the candidates for the second phase of Bihar assembly polls, all eyes are on two constituencies, Raghopur and Hasanpur, from where jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s sons, leader of the opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav and his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav will contest. Reliable sources said Tejashwi will file his nomination papers from Raghopur assembly seat on October 14 while Tej Pratap Yadav will file his papers from Hassanpur seat on October 13. “Tejashwi will file his papers on October 14 and also address a public meeting in his constituency, as per schedule so far,” said a senior RJD leader, wishing not to be quoted. This time, Tej Pratap, a sitting MLA from Mahua assembly seat in Vaisali district, has changed his constituency to Hasanpur assembly seat in Samastipur district probably to ensure a safe win as the constituency is considered an RJD stronghold with sizeable number of Yadav and Muslim voters. Sources said the RJD has given ticket to Dr Mukesh Roshan from the Mahua seat this time. The party has not released the official list of candidates for the second phase yet. Sources said the RJD is contesting 64 seats out of 94 constituencies going to polls on November 3.Also read: In Bihar, a battle between the old and the newThe contest in Raghopur will be a keenly fought one between Tejashwi and BJP’s nominee Satish Kumar who had been defeated by the 30-year Yadav scion in 2015 assembly polls. Satish, however, had shot to fame in 2010 assembly election when he had defeated former chief minister Rabri Devi by a margin of 13,006 votes. Insiders in the RJD said the leader of the opposition has high stakes in the poll given the Yadav scion is the face of the Grand Alliance (GA) and the chief ministerial candidate of his party. The exit of senior RJD leaders in the constituency, like former minister Uday Narayan Rai alias Bhola Rai, and a large number of RJD junior leaders at the block level a month back to join the ruling Janata Dal (United) has caused trouble for the RJD. Rai is considered a grassroots leader with a good hold among political workers and organisational set up in Raghopur constituency. Sources said, the JD(U) was eyeing the seat to field its own candidate but it went to the BJP. The JD(U) is contesting four seats in Vaisali district. “The contest is tough this time in Raghopur for Tejashwi as the BJP and the JD(U) are again fighting together this time. The traditional vote base of the RJD, especially Yadavs votes, will be crucial and any division in the core vote base could spell trouble for the party,” said a senior RJD leader. BJP candidate, Satish Kumar, also belonging to Yadav caste, is also banking on caste votes apart from that of the EBCs, minorities and upper castes. On the other hand, the contest in Hasanpur assembly seat would be also interesting to watch as Tej Pratap is pitted against Janata Dal (United) sitting MLA Raj Kumar Ray. Ray had won the seat in 2015 election by a margin of 29,600 votes by defeating his nearest rival Binod Choudhary of BLSP. Tej Pratap had indicated his plans to contest from Hasanpur seat in Samastipur district by holding a roadshow in the constituency last month. RJD leaders admit the poll outcome of the two seats, Raghopur and Hasanpur, is important for the party as a loss of any of the Yadav scions would cause embarrassment for jailed RJD chief and raise a question mark on party’s hold among its core voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-raghopur-hasanpur-seats-to-decide-fate-of-lalu-s-two-sons/story-2dCLW6h1rBCwhEu3zjnSaL.html

This indicates a lot about working of the new system,” he said.The former minister said the government should buy paddy, millet, maize and cotton as soon as possible and give farmers the benefit of MSP. “On one hand, BJP MLAs are protesting against the chaos in the mandis and on the other, their party leaders are holding rallies in Gohana. This shows everything is not well in the BJP,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-cm-hooda-slams-haryana-govt-for-tardy-paddy-procurement-in-mandis/story-mwsNy2cmk9pdbcKX4SS4NP.html

These are now being taken to a sugar mill in Naraingarh for power generation.As part of the project, farmers will be encouraged to sell their paddy stubble to the mill in Banondi village through a private firm.Deputy director of agriculture (DDA) Girish Nagpal said the project had been started in the village panchayats of Bada and Ugada in Ambala district.“Stubble worth Rs 1,800 per tonne is being delivered to the sugar mill under a contract, after which the profit will be given to the farmers after deducting the expenses of the baler machines. Broadly, farmers will get a profit of around Rs 500 per acre from this project,” Nagpal said.Bara Village sarpanch Vikas Behgal said that a baler, cutter and stringer (to tie the bales) were available in the village.“Farmers are exhibiting interest in the machines as they had no option to manage the stubble and no one was happy to burn it.

11-10-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Why we need to act now to save juvenile delinquents||They are young, just beginning life, so the figures released by the National Crime Records Bureau related to juvenile crimes and Chandigarh Police apprehending eight juveniles for rape and registering 117 cases against others in the city for various offences in 2019 are definitely a cause for concern. The number of rape cases had come down last year as against five in 2018 and seven in 2017, and other offences too showed a dip from 137 in 2018 and 159 in 2017. But the fact that 209 juveniles were arrested last year is a telling commentary on the negative influences on youngsters today. Last year, one juvenile was apprehended for outraging a woman’s modesty and two for kidnapping, against five caught for the former offence and three for the latter in 2018. In 2017, police had detained seven juveniles for rape, three for outraging modesty and five for kidnapping. Thirty six others had been caught for theft, 14 for burglary and three for murder. Refraining from commenting on sexual offences a senior Chandigarh police official on condition of anonymity said, “Minors take to thefts to make easy money.” Many of those apprehended admitted to having committed thefts to buy expensive phones or branded clothes and shoes, while a few were lured into crime to fund their craving for drugs. In fact, the ones involved in robbery and murders were also doing it to buy drugs, he added. The police are making efforts to mainstream many of these offenders by training them in various skills under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana to improve their lives and keep them away from crime and drugs. NGOs had also been roped in to help the police survey 22,000 children, 3,000 of whom from six peripheral areas were identified as high-risk. They have been enrolled with police help in vocational courses. For an understaffed police force that’s also under tremendous pressure to handle rising crime rates in the city, these are commendable efforts, but a lot more needs to be done to save these young lives.

The government has considered our agitation and called for a meeting. However, in an earlier invitation the government was trying to convince us about the benefits of anti-farmer laws. But the farmers’ protest forced the government to call for a meeting.”The farmers have also organised a meeting on October 13 of all the 30 farmer organisations in Jalandhar to discuss the campaign against the farm laws. “We will also discuss the matter at the meeting,” Singh added.

The incident occurred, when two home guards were deployed for his security at the temple’s entrance. He said he was also attacked by the goons last year and a police investigation was still in progress. Initially, two constables were deployed for his security but the security detail was removed under Singh’s influence.

11-10-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rare day-flying moth sighted in Uttarakhand’s Garhwal Himalayas for first time||Achelura bifasciata, a rare day-flying moth, was spotted last week in Uttarakhand’s Garhwal Himalayas. Experts said that the moth was last spotted in the Kumaon region in the 1890s following which the sighting occurred last week in Tehri Garhwal district’s Sreedev Suman Titli Park, a habitat for butterfly created by local residents. Sanjay Sondhi, the co-author of “Butterflies of Uttarakhand --- A Field Guide” and a trustee of Titli Trust, a nature conservation organisation, said that the moth was never reported to have been spotted in Garhwal. Also read: Brahma Kamal flowers bloom in Chamoli, Uttarakhand“There are old records of the insect to have been spotted in Nainital by GF Hampson, a Britisher, who had compiled a book on moths in 1893. However, this is the first time the moth has been sighted and that, too, in such large numbers in the Garhwal Himalayas in Uttarakhand. The moths are bitter in taste for predatory birds. As a result, the insects are free to fly around during the day,” said Sondhi.The experts also spotted a rare butterfly called Tawny Rajah. This large orange coloured butterfly is rarely seen in the Garhwal Himalayas and there have been a handful of published records in Uttarakhand in the last few decades. Arun Gaur, director, Devalsari Paryavaran Sanrakshan Samiti, who was one of the first few persons to have spotted the moth , said, “A different kind of moth in large numbers was seen hovering in and around the park for the past 15 days. We did not know that it was a rare moth. But, we had never seen the insect before and that’s why we decided to seek the experts’ opinion.” Sondhi, too, weighed in on spotting the moth. “The moth is found in the north-eastern parts of the country. However, it has been spotted in Uttarakhand after almost over a century. This has been possible due to the efforts of the local community, who has worked tirelessly to conserve many such small species to whom no one pays attention to on a daily basis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-rare-day-flying-moth-sighted-in-uttarakhand-s-garhwal-himalayas-for-first-time/story-qqu6ZdNw3y7DjwH9WPQOHM.html

It will continue in the same manner for the next 48 hours,” said Anupam Kashyapi, India Meteorological Department, Pune.At Singhad road and Bavdhan, few tree felling incidents were reported due to rain and since it was only heavy rain and no presence of thunderstorm, there were no major trees falling activity in other areas.Moderate rain is expected in the city on October 14 and 15 while in few places at ghat areas there are also chances of heavy rain. “Basically, one system is followed by one more in the Bay of Bengal so for the next four five days, its impact will be seen in Maharashtra, Pune district, the city with rain associated with thunder activity,” added Kashyapi.The maximum temperature of the day was 33.8 degree Celsius and minimum temperature of the day was 22.4 degree Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/city-receives-11mm-rainfall-in-30-minutes/story-YhAL7cLXPuXJPLmgYv4tLJ.html
11-10-2020||Pune||Maratha leaders, organisations split on MPSC postponement||The Maratha organisations and leaders are now divided over the issue of cancelling the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) preliminary examination which was scheduled for October 11. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray postponed the MPSC examination on the request of various Maratha organisations on Friday. Sambhaji Brigade’s former leader Pravin Gaikwad, said, “I was of the view that MPSC examination should be conducted as per schedule because students have been preparing for it since the past six months. More than 23 per cent of students from the Maratha caste are getting selected in these examinations, instead of blocking their future in 11 per cent reservation, let them give the examination.” Gaikwad said, “I am of the view that in the next five to ten years, a lot of opportunities are going to open in the industrial sector. We should prepare our students in a way that they can get chances in the industrial sector easily based on their skills. We offer to give protection to students if the examination was conducted, but now the state government has postponed it.” BJP MP Sambhaji Raje Bhosale and MLA Vinayak Mete welcomed the state government’s decision to postpone the MPSC examination and demanded that now the state government must concentrate on getting a reservation for the Maratha caste. Meanwhile, OBC leader and Cabinet Minister Chhagan Bhujbal criticised the state government’s decision and said that ideally, the examination should be conducted at the right time. Maratha organisations had warned the state government that if the MPSC examination wasn’t postponed, the exam will face disturbances. Thackeray’s decision of postponing the exam hasn’t gone down well with the students who were set to appear for it on Sunday. Ramesh Desale who is preparing for the examination, said, “As the examination was scheduled, I decided to stay in Pune and prepare for it. There are many difficulties to manage food and other things in this Covid-19 situation, but we were preparing for the exams. If there was a problem with the reservation issue, the government can keep the exam and put results on hold. They can announce the results as per the new reservation policy.” Another MPSC aspirant, Kishor Sanap said the postponement is disturbing news for him. “ Actually, it is very disturbing if the examination got cancelled two days before the scheduled date. It would be very difficult to start again with preparations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/maratha-leaders-organisations-split-on-mpsc-postponement/story-Il61bAjZOzdA4JzkFjVhWK.html
11-10-2020||Kolkata||Sikh turban row: Bengal home dept accuses BJP of communalising issue||The West Bengal home department on Sunday afternoon said that a certain political party was adding communal colour to the October 8 incident in Howrah, where a Sikh man’s turban came off ,when the police were trying to arrest him on charges of carrying a pistol.The incident occurred during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) march to Nabanna, the state secretariat. Videos of the jostling and the Sikh man’s clothes being pulled by policemen have since gone viral. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh and several members of the Sikh community have raised their voice against the incident. They have said it was an insult to the Sikh community and the accused, Balvinder Singh. The BJP has started a campaign on this issue. “Our Sikh brothers and sisters live here in West Bengal in perfect peace and harmony, in happiness and tranquility, with respect from all of us for their faith and practices. A recent incident when one isolated individual got caught with one illegally carried firearm in an agitation that was not authorised and is now being twisted out of context, distorted and given communal colours in fractious and partisan interests,” tweeted the state home department. “One political party is giving communal colour to the subject in narrow partisan interests in a manner that Bengal does not believe in. Policing was done as per law, but highest respect for the Sikh panth and ways from the state government is affirmed,” the tweet added. Bengal BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Tweets will not help. The nation has seen the videos. The police have hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community.” Earlier, Ghosh had said that Singh is the bodyguard of a BJP youth front leader and works for a private security agency. He has a valid licence for the pistol, Ghosh had claimed. However, police have found that the licence was issued in Kashmir and it is not valid in West Bengal. “The Sikh community has been insulted. We saw in the videos that the man was isolated from the rest of the people and dragged along the ground. The turban did not fall off by accident,” Union minister of state Babul Supriyo told a TV news channel. “From lawlessness to the arrest of al-Qaeda terrorists, there is every reason to impose President’s rule in Bengal,’’ he said. Saugata Ray, a Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member and a party spokesperson, said, “Babul Supriyo is new to politics. He has not studied the Constitution. Before enforcing Article 356, an advisory has to be issued under Article 355. That has not been done.” The October 8 incident has triggered an uproar. “Please look into this matter @MamataOfficial this isn’t done,” former Indjan cricketer Singh had tweeted on Friday evening, tagging Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. He had also posted tweets and news video clippings tweeted by BJP’s Delhi unit secretary Impreet Singh Bakshi. The same tweets and videos were also shared by BJP national secretary Arvind Menon and other party leaders. “In Bengal, is there no respect for people from other religious faiths except for a specific one?” tweeted Menon. Members of the Sikh community have also staged two protests in Kolkata. The agitation was marked by “unprovoked” baton charge and use of tear gas by the police that left 1,500 people injured, the BJP has alleged. At least 24 BJP leaders, including the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Menon, have been booked for violating the Central government’s guidelines on gatherings and political rallies owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The agitation was organised by the party’s youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM). It was marked by pitched battles between the police and the party workers in parts of Kolkata and Howrah, where Nabanna is located. The BJP leaders were also charged for destroying public properties and violating prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/sikh-turban-row-bengal-home-dept-accuses-bjp-of-communalising-issue/story-GUwwvzDKFubojiLH3J2YbP.html
11-10-2020||City||Centre’s bid to impose property tax in J&K raises parties’ hackles||The Centre’s decision to impose property tax in the union territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) has evoked sharp response from political parties. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had empowered the UT administration last week to impose the property tax following an amendment to the J&K Municipal Act, 2000 and J&K Municipal Corporation Act, 2000 through the J&K Reorganisation (Adaption of State Laws) order, 2020.The property tax will be levied on all lands and buildings or vacant lands or both that fall within the jurisdiction of civic body areas unless exempted under this act or any other law.Ali Mohammad Sagar, general secretary, National Conference (NC), lashed out at the Central government for the imposition of property tax amid a coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced downturn in economic activities and soaring unemployment. “Far from doling out fiscal help and other supportive measures, the Central government wants to suck the life and blood of people.The measure will push the people to the wall,” he alleged at a meeting held at the party headquarters in Srinagar on Saturday.Other leaders branded the policy decision as a great injustice by the Central government, when the public is struggling to make both ends meet.Mohammad Khurshed Alam, a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader and a former lawmaker, compared the Central government’s decision to the exploitative taxation regime during the erstwhile monarchical rule in J&K.“The property tax order smacks of the despotic and anarchic rule that the people of J&K had suffered for hundreds of years. This decision is nothing but a revival of that dark, dreadful and disastrous era of Kashmir’s blood-soaked history,” Alam said.“Is this the roadmap of Naya Kashmir, which the government had unveiled in Parliament on August 5, 2019?” he questioned.MY Tarigami, a leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPI (M), questioned the Central government for its haste to impose property tax “undemocratically”, when it “owes the UT GST (Goods and Services Tax) money”.“Why is the Central government in such a haste to take such measures in absence of a democratic process? The people’s representatives must be given an opportunity to discuss these issues. It has become a habit of those in power in Delhi to issue orders, irrespective of their impact or public opinion,” he said.“The CPI (M) objects to the Central government’s decision amid the Covid-19 pandemic. We are facing several key challenges such as an acute shortage of oxygen in Kashmir, which have been glossed over,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-s-bid-to-impose-property-tax-in-j-k-raises-parties-hackles/story-Qqg2eN8rkLmjVn1dXDiLGI.html

A visit to the spot revealed that the ramp constructed at a cost of Rs 12 lakh had the surface coating of tiles which were slippery and could endanger the lives of the visitor.Also, the ramp has two manhole covers located at a short distance which puts a serious question mark on the overall safety and security of the end user. The ramp was constructed in 2019 after the civic body came under heavy criticism from different human rights organisations calling for immediate construction of a wheelchair ramp for handicapped persons.Also, the disabled person who wants to visit the municipal commissioner finds it difficult to reach the lift as it is located far away from where the ramp ends. Similarly, a number of regular visitors park their vehicles near the ramp entrance jamming the access route. There is no dedicated space for wheelchair parking as the existing spot does not have a roof as a result, the chair gets wet during the rainy season and hot during the summers.Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan spokesperson Rafique Khan, said, “The current ramp is fraught with defects and a single person cannot use it unless he or she is accompanied by an assistant. There is every possibility of a physically disabled person skidding off the ramp, if the anti skidding measures are not put in place at the earliest. Similarly, a sound roof is needed to protect the end users from heat and rain. We have been facing serious difficulties while using the ramp and the administration must take strong steps to mitigate our grievances.”Radhika Suryavanshi, a disabled person who visits the PMC regularly, said, “We need direct access to the municipal commissioner, but the current ramp is away from the entrance and causes a lot of difficulties. The PMC has provision for only one wheelchair and the number of disabled persons visiting the building are more in number. Also, the parking being done by the general public increases our woes as we have to virtually crawl through the cramped space to reach the building. It seems that the ramp was constructed just to show that they have complied with the ministerial orders, but actually, it is causing more harm to us than providing relief.”City engineer Prashant Waghmare, said, “We have instructed the building planning department to look into these issues and accordingly take strong and immediate steps to provide relief to the physically disabled persons by removing the barriers and addressing their woes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/defective-wheelchair-ramp-at-pune-civic-body-causes-inconvenience-to-end-users/story-GvXNb0nHS2fAWmyHCiycSJ.html
11-10-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Hold protests but follow Covid-19 regulations, say Pune residents||While the authorities have relaxed restrictions as part of India’s fifth round of unlock regulations for October, holding protests by political parties, organisations and social bodies pose risk of Covid infection as social distancing norms are often ignored. As health experts warn of a likely rise in Covid-19 cases, should there be a ban on mass protests? Readers share their views...Protests needed to bring change Mass protests need to be aggressive in nature for it to have an effect. Online protests do not even get registered, let alone make any difference. For example, if the authorities physically see residents supporting a cause, it has a direct impact. Slogans have an impact. On the issue of online university exams, we organised many protests. Over 1,000 students supported our cause, but we took adequate steps to ensure that protestors follow social distancing norms, and we succeeded. We followed the rules. After all, the collector or vice-chancellor will not pay attention to a Google Meet call or a Zoom meeting for a protest. Dayanand Shinde Nothing is precious than life At the time when the world is fighting Covid-19 and our economy is touching a new low, I do not think mass protests should be allowed. A deadly virus is killing people. Making space and fulfilling requirements for medicine and hospital beds is of utmost importance. A more formal process needs to be followed to make your demands heard. Risking each other’s lives is of no use. No topic is more important than a person’s life. Even if one decides to hold a protest, precautions should be taken. There will be few people who will come together while prescribing to the social distancing norms and use masks. But an emotionally charged mob is bound to flout these rules. The students’ protests in universities are bound to happen too as the exam process has had multiple glitches, but one must take ample precaution to check the spread of virus. Rushi Pardeshi Hold agitation by following precautionsAccording to information regarding Covid-19, precaution is the best way forward right now. There are various points of reference. In various countries, many ways have been adopted to tackle the coronavirus. In India, the people who live hand-to-mouth coupled with a government that cannot provide for everyone, there are various unique problems. From March 22, everyone has been a patient and over 90 people have died while travelling on Shramik special trains launched for migrants. Maratha reservation, Hathras are topics that cannot be expected to go unheard under the guise of Covid-19, it is not possible. We used the “chatri (umbrella)” pattern to protest for rickshaws in July and maintained social distancing. Most of our meetings have also shifted to a place where social distancing is possible. Likewise, there are various ways in which we can hold protests. Next week, we are going to sing abhangs in front of Shiv Sena office while maintaining social distancing to get our message across. We need to be creative, but saying no to protests is not correct. Nitin Pawar Social distancing, mask should be the norm In the Covid-19 times, protests against injustice have been going on for some time. Democracy gives us the right to protest, but the pandemic has spread and affected people across the world. Many were infected forcing authorities to declare lockdowns with the most affected being slum dwellers and daily wage labourers. Once jobs were lost, their protests began. Food is a necessity and job loss directly affected the capacity of providing food. Still, the first and foremost requirement should be using mask and following social distancing norms. One must follow these norms. The aim of some political protests has only been to be visible on visual media. In some other protests, the use of masks and social distancing is often ignored. Even the relaxations of lockdown rules have led to a large number of people on the streets. Residents on streets are often seen not wearing mask which could pose risk of virus spread.

11-10-2020||Chandigarh||Lawrence Bishnoi aide and former student leader shot dead outside Chandigarh mall||In a suspected case of gang rivalry, Gurlal Brar, 26, former state president of the Students’ Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU), was gunned down in his Toyota Fortuner SUV outside the Playboy Nightclub at City Emporium Mall in Industrial Area, Phase 1, on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. Three motorcycle borne assailants fired at Brar, known to be a close associate of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.Soon after, gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group took to social media, owning responsibility for the killing “to avenge” the murder of their associate Lavi Deora. Members of Bishnoi’s gang had killed Deora at a fair in Faridkot’s Kotkapura on July 15, 2017, in which Brar had reportedly played an active role.“Brar was a close associate of Bishnoi. We are looking into rivalry of gangs,” said senior superintendent of police, Kuldeep Singh Chahal. Four persons were detained for questioning in connection with Brar’s death, including a bouncer at a disco near the crime spot. Sources said he was a member of Bambiha’s gang. Brar was shot dead as he was waiting to hand over his SUV to a friend. He had first visited Playboy Nightclub on Saturday night and left briefly to go to Para Club close by for a woman friend’s birthday party, returning to the Nightclub after the cake cutting ceremony, police said. Before leaving Para Club he had asked a friend to pick him up as he was to hand over his SUV to another friend. Past midnight, at around 12:30 am, he was in his white Fortuner SUV outside the mall when the motorcyclists pumped bullets into him and sped away.Brar was taken to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), where doctors declared him “brought dead”. A case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Arms Act has been registered at the Industrial Area police station against the unidentified assailants on the complaint of Vikas Tiwari of Hallomajra, an eyewitness to the shooting.Tiwari, a driver, said he and three other drivers were at the Playboy Nightclub on valet parking duty and had seen three men on a motorcycle. Two had walked up to Brar’s SUV and fired before all three fled.Man who arranged for gunmen lives abroadThe post, allegedly by Bambiha’s gang is in Punjabi in English script. It says: “Lucky got Brar killed to avenge Deora’s death and that he had spoken against the gang members (Bambiha) at a club in Chandigarh.” Sources say Lucky lives abroad and that he had arranged for the gunmen to kill Brar. The post has a number of hashtags, including #Respect women and #avoid drugs. Seven shells recovered from the spot, body had six injuries Brar’s body had six bullet injury marks, said superintendent of police (City) Vineet Kumar. These were on the head, chest, neck and arm. Police recovered seven shells from the spot. Brar’s weapon missing Police sources revealed Brar was fond of weapons (many of his social media posts show him brandishing a few). Strangely however, no weapon was recovered from the crime scene even though Brar never travelled without a gun. “The licence of a weapon was found but no firearm,” said a senior police officer. Became party president with Bishnoi’s support Brar and Bishnoi worked closely in student politics and it was because of the latter’s support that Brar was elected state president of SOPU in 2016. From Kotkapura in Faridkot, Brar was helping out his family with farming but living in Mohali. He was very fond of body building and weapons and was friends with gangsters Bishnoi and Sampat Nehra. Was recently booked for misbehaving with girlsBrar had, a few days ago, been booked for assaulting and threatening a group of girls outside another nightclub in the area where he was gunned down. Accompanied by another person named Mohit and a woman, he had, on September 27, misbehaved with a group of girls outside Para Nightclub. A 30-year-old woman from Panipat district in Haryana had complained that the trio had slapped and threatened her, her sister and friends and police had registered the case.  Gang violence in the pastThere have been a number of incidents of gang violence in the city. On March 16 this year, Surjit Singh, who used to supply bouncers, was gunned down in Sector 38. His name had cropped up in the murder of another bouncer Amit Sharma, alias Meet, who was shot dead in a gang war in Panchkula in 2017. On September 28 last year, property dealer Sonu Shah was shot dead at his office in Burail, in another alleged case of gang war||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-panjab-varsity-student-leader-shot-dead-outside-chandigarh-mall/story-8ud5eHhZCoBIV8HyktdAWK.html

It set a 10-day deadline for the abolishment of health trade licences.The corporations have alleged that the decision is a “ploy” to weaken the civic bodies and said they will seek legal opinion to “counter” the move.“Restaurants contribute to Delhi economy and taxes in a big way. They face harassment due to license raj. All governments should work together to remove harassment. Centre (central) government body FSSAI has directed MCDs to stop issuing food licenses. I hope MCDs will comply soon with Centre’s directions,” Kejriwal said in a tweet on Sunday.The Delhi government’s decision to abolish licences for restaurants was taken at a meeting chaired by Kejriwal. It was attended by restaurant owners.In the meeting, the restaurateurs had said the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) already issues food safety and hygiene licences. Issuing of health trade licences by local bodies duplicated the task and was irrelevant.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash had said he has sought legal opinion to counter the government’s move.South Delhi Mayor Anamika alleged that the AAP government is doing politics over the issuing of health trade licences.“They are misleading people by saying no licence should be there to run restaurants. The licences are issued by the corporations under the DMC Act 1957 to ensure the safety and comfort of people by ensuring adherence to various parameters,” she said.The health trade licence is issued online for ease of doing business and there is no interference by any officer. The entire process is transparent, she added.Anamika said these licences cover various parameters like structural safety of a restaurant building, safe drinking water to prevent water-borne diseases, health check-up of waiters and delivery boys, solid waste management and sanitation.Restaurateurs have welcomed the government’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/restaurants-in-delhi-face-harassment-due-to-licence-raj-arvind-kejriwal/story-EbIOn6BJUmEjAwI8YgwjaM.html

Under the scheme, land parcels in rural areas were mapped using drones. Addressing the beneficiaries, the prime minister said, “One lakh property cards (SVAMITVA) have been distributed among the beneficiaries today. Efforts are on to provide property card to each house in every village in the next four years.” Also read: PM’s top quotes from SVAMITVA eventOf the one lakh property cards, 39,989 were distributed in 346 villages in 37 districts of UP. Beneficiaries were also handed over the hard copies after getting a soft copy. “When one becomes the owner of his house, one’s self-respect is restored. One feels secure and strong,” PM Modi said, while interacting with the beneficiaries.Calling the distribution of property cards another historic step towards a self-reliant India, the prime minister pointed out that the day also marked the the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and social reformer Nanaji Deshmukh, two leaders who worked tirelessly for rural development.“Nanaji used to say that when the people of the village remain trapped in disputes, neither will they develop nor the society. I believe that the ownership plan will also be a great means of ending many disputes in our villages. Raising the voice of the villagers and the poor has been a shared pledge of Jayaprakash Babu and Nanaji’s life,” he said.The scheme’s pilot project is being implemented in 763 villages which comprise 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and two from Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/svamitva-scheme-to-end-disputes-in-villages-pm-modi/story-mAU7PROL58MSVk5AM39VWK.html

11-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Don’t issue licences to restaurants, CM Kejriwal tells civic bodies||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged the national capital’s civic bodies to comply with the directives of the Central government and discontinue issuing food licences to restaurants. “Restaurants contribute to Delhi’s economy and taxes in a big way. They face harassment due to licence raj. All governments should work together to remove harassment. The Centre government body, FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India), has directed the civic bodies to stop issuing food licences. I hope the civic authorities will comply with the Centre’s directions soon,” Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.Earlier, the Delhi government had announced the abolition of police and health trade licences that are issued by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations for restaurants. It set a 10-day deadline for the abolishment of health trade licences. The decision to do away with the “licence raj” for restaurants was taken at a meeting chaired by Kejriwal last Wednesday. Representatives of Delhi’s restaurant owners had attended the meeting.Also read: Restaurants in Delhi may open 24x7 soonThe restaurateurs had said the FSSAI authorities were the issuing authority of food safety and hygiene licences. However, the issuance of health trade licences by local bodies duplicated the task and was redundant, the restaurateurs had cited.However, Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), countered the Delhi government’s allegations on Saturday and said the latter was playing politics over the issue.“Health licence is crucial to ensure hygiene standards of the premises and the safety of visitors to restaurants. The process of granting licences is online and transparent. The public health department ensures if an establishment is safe,” she said. She pointed out that the licence helped ensure an eatery is equipped with the supply of potable water supply and also disposal of solid waste in a bid to prevent any kind of contamination.“We ensure that operational measures are looked after by local civic bodies and are not overlapping with FSSAI’s requirements,” the mayor said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday had said that the FSSAI, a statutory body under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW), had sent a letter to the commissioners of all three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs). “It is informed that with the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, … and Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Rules 2011, the sole authority for issuance of licence/registration of food business operators in India vests with the registering authorities/central or state licencing authorities duly appointed under the provisions of the said Act by the respective commissioner of food safety,” the letter stated. “In view of above legal position, it is requested to immediately look into the matter and ensure that no separate/additional food licences are issued by your offices and any food business operator who is doing business under your jurisdiction or is planning to start new food business may be directed to obtain the same from FSSAI,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-don-t-issue-licences-to-restaurants-cm-kejriwal-tells-civic-bodies/story-UpnEZR8JY6ncHSU0oKGyHO.html

Neither the chief minister is ready to do anything, nor the Prime Minister of the country is ready to do anything.”He further added, “It is very sad that the central government has not yet found a way to resolve these laws (agricultural laws) in collaboration with farmer organisations or other political organisations. I request the PM to call a meeting of all organisations and listen to their doubts.”The passage of the bills saw SAD ending its 25-year-long friendship with Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and its leader and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigning from her cabinet post.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had criticised Badal on several occasions despite SAD moving out of the NDA. He called the exit from the alliance a compulsion. “The SAD decision to quit NDA was just the culmination of their saga of lies and deception, which eventually led to them being cornered on the issue of the bills,” Singh had said.He had said that SAD leaders should beg for forgiveness from the nation’s farmers for supporting the passage of these bills.The Centre passed three bills to push agrarian reforms in the monsoon session of Parliament. The government has come under criticism from farmers’ organisations as well opposition parties after the passage of these bills. Several protests and rallies have been held in Punjab, Haryana and other states by farmers to voice their grievances against the new laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/neither-cm-nor-pm-talking-to-stakeholders-badal-on-protests-against-farm-bills/story-M9PEUE0HHnuPbgvZk3ajQI.html
11-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Education minister Sisodia reviews content of upcoming ‘Deshbhakti curriculum’||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday reviewed the content of the upcoming Deshbhakti curriculum and the progress of the new education board. The Delhi government had announced last year about the introduction of the new education board and Deshbhakti curriculum. The curriculum and Delhi Examination board committees were constituted in July to recommend a new curriculum for students up to the age of 14 years and the setting up of the board. Both committees are likely to submit their recommendations by mid-November.“A 360-degree assessment will be the basis of the Deshbhakti curriculum. A student’s deshbhakti will be judged by a teacher on the basis of the following parameters such as inclusiveness, gender, different forms of discrimination, integrity, care for public property and natural resources,” said Sisodia.The Delhi Examination board would look at the 360-degree assessment, including self and peer group. “I have often come across teachers and parents only talking about subjects and marks obtained by students during parent-teacher meetings (PTMs). The conversation between parents and teachers will encompass an all-round growth and development of a child as per our new curriculum and assessment model,” he said.“The era of one-time assessment through an examination is being done away. We require a system, where we can track the journey of a child, a 360-degree view, capturing different aspects of learning. It is possible to implement such a system through an effective use of technology,” he added. Sisodia has asked the committee members to create tools for parents that would enable them to track the progress of their children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-education-minister-sisodia-reviews-content-of-upcoming-deshbhakti-curriculum/story-qaO4uxlP8k0AzOafTIznnJ.html

The clock, which resembles the Big Ben of London, has been dead for nearly two decades. Now the building works committee of the central university has approved a proposal worth Rs 1 crore to get the clock repaired and back in working condition.The task of repairing this iconic clock would be given to the Indian national trust for art and cultural heritage (INTACH) based in Delhi, which will get it repaired by an expert agency, said AU officials.AU registrar, NK Shukla said, “The building committee has approved the proposal, which, when passed by finance committee and executive council, would be sent to INTACH for getting the clock repaired by an expert agency.”The clock, manufactured by JG Bechtler Son & Company, Allahabad was installed atop the senate hall building in 1912. When it stopped working in 1999, an expert from the local Katra market, Mustaffa Bhai, repaired it. But, after a few years, the clock again stopped working. Also Read: Hathras gang-rape case: CBI registers case, begins investigationIn 2012, Prof CK Dwivedi and his team from JK institute of applied physics had successfully replaced the mechanical parts of the clock, converting it into a single-chip computer including a micro-processor, input-output interface, timing circuit etc. The main machinery was fitted with new gears and micro-motors which were systematically upgraded so that the time piece would give accurate time. Quartz crystal, widely used in time pieces for giving accurate frequency in clocks, was also fitted in the repaired clock.Also Read: Jabalpur medical college doctor served notice for taking part in Hathras protestLater, the varsity authorities also gave it a facelift by covering its four sides with polycarbonate sheets, replacing the old glass sheets and there were further plans to add LED lights to all the four sides apart from cleaning of the huge bells and to revive the system of hourly, half-hourly and quarterly ringing of bells as it used to be in its prime form.However, despite all the efforts, the clock failed to function.

11-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Soon, traffic police to levy parking fine, not BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities, which had initiated a penalty for parking vehicles within the radius of one kilometre (km) of the civic body’s Public Parking Lots (PPLs) in July last year on the grounds of encroachment, are set to withdraw the fine. The BMC is in the process of entrusting the responsibility of levying the fine to the Mumbai Traffic Police (MTP) and also towing away of vehicles that are found parked illegally. MTP will tow away the vehicles that have been declared as scrap and are found parked by a roadside. Initially, the fine amount was fixed at Rs 10,000, later it was brought down to Rs 4,000, which would remain unchanged, BMC officials said.Also read: BMC looks for more space near 8 PPLsPraveen Pardeshi, the former commissioner of BMC, had justified a year ago that the civic authorities would tow away vehicles that are found parked illegally. The BMC authorities had introduced the fine in a bid to reduce congestion on Mumbai’s roads and also promote the use of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses.However, the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation has also led to an acute staff crunch. “We are overburdened with work for the past seven months because of Covid-19. We have taken the decision to hand over the responsibility of slapping fines on errant vehicles to Mumbai Traffic Police. The talks have been progressing for the past month and the handover is likely to take place in the next 10 days,” said a BMC official, requesting anonymity. In September, the BMC had prepared a document to this effect. “It was observed that the manpower at the ward level of BMC for effective enforcement against unauthorised parked vehicles is inadequate. There is no dedicated wing for executing said works at the ward level. However, dedicated personnel is available with the traffic police department. The department may be assigned for towing away vehicles that are parked illegally,” the civic body had stated. The BMC had introduced the fine on July 7 in Mumbai’s four major arterial roads such as Link Road, SV Road, LBS Road and Maharshi Karve Road. Later, the rule was relaxed and parking vehicles within the radius of a km of the civic body’s PPLs was reduced to 500 metres.The slapping of the exorbitant fine had led to an uptick in the usage of PPLs. HT had reported on January 11 that BMC’s implementation of fines for illegal parking near 26 PPLs showed positive results.According to the civic body’s data, the occupancy rate of PPLs last December had increased up to 40%-50%. Sunil Sardar, deputy chief engineer, solid waste management (transport wing), BMC, said the transfer of the responsibility to Mumbai Traffic Police is likely to take another 10 days. Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Matunga, spoke up on behalf of the Mumbaikars. ‘The public does not care much about which authority is levying a fine.

The drive has been announced in the backdrop of the uproar over a 19-year old Dalit woman’s alleged gang-rape and murder in Hathras. The state government has since set up a special investigating team (SIT), recommended investigation by CBI and arrested all the four accused. Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said the special awareness drive will aim to boost the morale of women and children and empower them by making them aware of their rights. The idea is to also highlight the state government’s sensitivity in handling cases related to them while ensuring the strictest action against the culprits.Also Read: Hathras gang-rape case: CBI registers case, begins investigationAwasthi said that along with the director general of police Hitesh Chandra Awasthi, he held a meeting to prepare an outline for the drive.

11-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi air quality remains poor for fifth consecutive day on Sunday||Despite a forecast of marginal improvement, Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘poor’ zone on the fifth consecutive day on Sunday morning. The air quality index (AQI) was at 220, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data at 8 am; hardly a drop from Saturday when the 24-hour average at 221. Air quality enters the poor zone between 201-300 mark. Delhi’s average AQI has been in the poor zone since Wednesday, for the first time since June 28.Also read: Air Quality Index witnesses sharp spike in Mumbai, is highest since before lockdown began in MarchThe System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecast wing, had said that AQI could see a slight improvement on October 11 and 12.“AQI is forecasted to marginally improve to the moderate category for Saturday; further AQI is forecasted to improve by October 12, but in the moderate category. The low pressure formed over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify to depression and move west northwestwards and influence the circulations in North and central India. A shift in Delhi surface wind direction, northwesterly to southeasterly by October 12 is forecasted. This could influence air quality positively in the coming week. Stubble burning fires observed Friday around Punjab, Haryana, and neighboring border regions with SAFAR synergized fire count estimated as 253 on October 10 but with marginal impact in Delhi AQI,” it said.Air quality in the capital worsens every year from October due to various factors, including a drop in temperature, change in wind speeds and direction, and smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab, and local sources of pollution.Experts note that though faster winds play a major role in dispersing pollutants, they are not strong enough through the day to help Delhi currently.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department said that even though the average wind speed is 15-16 kmph during the day, the north-westerly winds bringing in fumes from stubble burning of crops in Haryana and Punjab are adding pollutants in the atmosphere to the northwestern region, including Delhi-NCR. However, the wind speed is low from evening to morning -- thus, not allowing dispersion of pollutants -- and a drop in night temperature permits the pollutants to settle in the atmosphere.“The air quality may improve slightly on October 11-12 because of thunderous developments likely in the region. The wind direction will also change to southeasterly during this time. However, this pattern will again change from October 15, with a return of northwesterlies and a dip in both night and day temperatures,” said an IMD scientist, adding that a significant deterioration in air quality is not likely in the next 10 days.On Saturday, the minimum temperature settled at 21.5 degrees C, one notch below normal while the maximum temperature was at 35.2 degrees C, a notch above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-remains-poor-for-fifth-consecutive-day-on-sunday/story-OQs8b6BI8GdyS4F34ZMOFL.html

11-10-2020||City||Uttarakhand: Police question guards posted at ex-CBI director Ashwani Kumar’s residence||Police have recorded the statements of three security guards, who are posted at the residence of the former director of the Central Bureau of investigation (CBI) and ex–Nagaland governor Ashwani Kumar (69), who died by suicide at his residence in the posh Brockhurst locality in Shimla last week. Police have taken into possession of Kumar’s mobile phone, which will be sent to the Junga-based Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) for examination.They have also preserved his viscera for forensic investigation. Police have recorded the statement of his son Abhishekh, who is a vice-president in a Mumbai-based multinational company, and his daughter-in-law. The family members have denied any foul play in his death, but investigators are probing all angles to ascertain the circumstances that led him to take the drastic step. Kumar was known for his “integrity” “and “professionalism”. Police have also got hold of his medical records. Also read: On ex-CBI chief’s ‘suicide,’ Shiv Sena asks why no one interested in knowing exact reason behind his deathKumar was said to be suffering from depression and had also been on medication. His purported suicide note also hinted at depression. “I am fed up with my disease and disability. I don’t want to be a burden on my family. There is no point to carry on with life. My soul will soon embark upon a new journey. No weeping, no crying over my demise. No rituals and no ceremonies. Call the police and handover my body for medical experimentation. God bless you all .Bye-bye forever,” he had written in the one-page suicide note, which will be examined by handwriting experts. “All the relevant statements are being recorded. We have taken consent from the family to examine the medical records of the ex-Governor ‘’said Mohit Chawla, superintendent of police (SP), Shimla.“The case is under investigation. It is clear that no outsider barged inside his house,” he said.The daughter in-law has reportedly told the police that Kumar had gone up to the attic of his three- storey house for meditation in the evening when he died by suicide. Later, his family members found the door of the attic bolted from inside after he didn’t come down from there for a while. They found him dead after they broke open the attic door. Kumar was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. His mother, too, had suffered from the similar ailment. Earlier, on the day that Kumar had died by suicide, he had gone to the mall in Shimla for a stroll. The Himachal Pradesh government had provided security guards at the former Governor’s residence. The guards, who were questioned, had reportedly told the police that they stayed outside the house and rarely visited his residence. Kumar, a 1973-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, had held many senior positions in Himachal Police, the CBI and the Special Protection Group (SPG). He was the CBI director between August 2008 and November 2010. In March 2013, he was appointed as the Governor of Nagaland. He was also the Governor of Manipur briefly the same year.Kumar was the CBI director, when the agency had arrested Amit Shah in connection with the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter killing case in Gujarat. He had also dealt with the Arushi Talwar-Hemraj murder case during his tenure as the central probe agency chief. Kumar had also served as the vice-chancellor (V-C) to the Alakh Prakash Goyal (APG) University, which is located on the outskirts of Shimla, but had quit the post two years ago. APG university is under the scanner for selling fake degree certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttarakhand-police-question-guards-posted-at-ex-cbi-director-ashwani-kumar-s-residence/story-EvKehITKs5sHY7WwbKvngO.html
11-10-2020||Kolkata||Manish Shukla murder case: BJP MP Arjun Singh says Bengal CID plotting to frame him||BJP’s Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh on Saturday alleged that the West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is “plotting” to frame him in the Manish Shukla murder case.BJP councillor Manish Shukla, who was a close aide of Singh, was shot dead in Titagarh on October 4.“I got hold of a chat of senior CID officers where they were discussing whether Arjun Singh has been framed.Going by this conversation, I am sure they (CID officers) are conspiring to frame me in the case,” Singh said.The BJP lawmaker accused the CID of not nabbing the “culprits” who are “roaming freely” in the area.Senior Trinamool Congress leader Nirmal Ghosh dismissed Singh’s claims and said the investigation agency is doing its best and Shukla’s murderers and the conspirators behind the killing will soon be behind the bars.“We have better things to do rather than reacting to what Arjun Singh is saying. He is a ‘bahubali’ (strongman) in the area. The CID is on the right track. Soon, people behind this murder will be brought to the book,” Ghosh said.CID sleuths are planning to go to Bihar’s Nalanda in search of other people involved in Shukla’s murder, sources said.The agency has arrested three persons so far in connection with the killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/manish-shukla-murder-case-bjp-mp-arjun-singh-says-bengal-cid-plotting-to-frame-him/story-wR6BsYDjuYJq6MGNfupRqN.html
11-10-2020||City||CBI begins investigation as Lakshadweep sees 3rd largest sea cucumber seizure this year||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) began its probe into illegal sea cucumber trade in Lakshadweep on Saturday as 10 fresh consignments were traced and seized by the local forest department.This is the eighth case and third largest seizure this year involving 220 large processed (taxidermied) sea cucumbers worth Rs 1.56 crore seized by the Lakshadweep forest department at south Agatti Islands.Also read: 22 dead sea cucumbers worth Rs 20 lakh seized in LakshadweepWith Saturday’s haul, 2,500 sea cucumbers weighing 1,500 kg and worth Rs 7 crore have been seized so far this year. Forest officials said the illegal trade skyrocketed in 2020. Damodhar AT, secretary environment, forest and chief wildlife warden, Lakshadweep administration said, “What we have caught so far this year is meagre quantities. There are huge consignments getting transported weekly by other means directly from international waters adjacent to our uninhabited islands.”He added that a CBI team had begun investigations after reaching Kochi on Saturday. “We expect at least 20-24 people to be arrested as the team makes their way to Kavaratti Island on October 13,” said Damodhar.Sea cucumbers are single branched marine organisms (invertebrates) high in demand across south-east Asia, mainly China, for food and traditional medicine. They are protected under Schedule I under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972 so their trade is banned. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change imposed a total ban on harvesting and transporting sea cucumbers in 2001.The latest case was busted following a tip-off. Forest department officials were told to be on high alert for the movement of boats near Agatti Island between October 7 and 9. “On Friday, a team led by Agatti range officer in-charge Mohammed Sinan Yafus, ten fresh consignments weighing 155.5 kg were found packed in fish presentation boxes after processing sea cucumbers in preservatives. They were ready for transportation on fish export vessels from a fish landing jetty at Agatti to China and other south-east Asian countries,” said Damodhar.The forest department suspects that sea cucumbers were poached from Vellakkara near Bitra, Perumalpar, Thinnakara and Suheli, all uninhabited islands. “Most of such illegal trade consignments from various Islands come to Agatti where boats travelling in domestic waters supply ice to local fishers and in exchange, corrupt fishermen fill up those boxes with dried and processed sea cucumbers,” said Damodhar.While a first information report (wildlife offence report) has been filed at Amini court, all suspects have escaped the island, the forest department said. “Due to inclement weather conditions, inadequate manpower and non-availability of patrolling vessels to move our central flying squad with adequate forces, the department is facing difficulties in preventing such large scale poaching, and needs immediate support,” said Damodhar.According to Hong kong-based non-profit environmental group OceansAsia, sea cucumbers are typically sold dried, canned, frozen, or as powders and extracts. With a spike in demand and prices over recent years, a kilogram of dried sea cucumber is sold for as high as Rs 65,000-68,000 per kg in international markets.“As there is a huge economic value involved, these poachers have all the modern boats and weapons to hunt sea cucumbers in Lakshadweep waters. Lack of trained investigation team and the legal expertise in dealing with criminal cases at different courts has had a demoralising effect on efforts by our frontline staff to nab such criminals,” the chief wildlife warden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbi-begins-investigation-as-lakshadweep-sees-3rd-largest-sea-cucumber-seizure-this-year/story-0xXY6nISP7D0Rf0zjCCWyM.html

11-10-2020||City||Locals in Haryana’s Kanalsi village flag fresh mining violations across Yamuna||Residents of Yamunanagar’s Kanalsi village have claimed that mining contractors are constructing illegal bunds across the Yamuna, in blatant violation of environmental norms, so as to reach the riverbed to carry out sand excavation. This even as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has formed a joint committee under the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) after receiving similar complaints of illegal mining activities in July this year. Pictures and videos released by river activists and residents of the village purportedly show contractors using heavy machines and trucks to carry out mining in the flowing river. When contacted, Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said, “The pictures from the site are extremely shocking. Contractors are violating several norms by carrying out midstream mining, constructing a bund (partial), plying heavy vehicles inside active current and deploying heavy machines in the river channel. They also did not install closed-circuit television cameras at the mining site, which is mandatory.” “These activities will have an adverse impact on the aquatic biodiversity and also destabilise the river banks, leading to erosion,” he said. When contacted, Yamunanagar deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said, “The matter was highlighted by some people and teams have been formed to look into the matter but as of now there are no reports of violations of the norms.” Earlier in July, while hearing a complaint on large-scale mining on Yamuna banks, filed by a local farmer Kiran Pal Rana, the NGT bench headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel ruled that with regards to the area under Haryana, the joint committee, comprising CPCB, Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) and Yamunanagar district magistrate, should furnish a factual and action-taken report within three months, and scheduled the next hearing on January 6, 2021. In the complaint, Rana had alleged that illegal mining activities have not only changed the course of the river but in the last two years, six children have died by falling into the deep mining pits in Yamunanagar, Panipat of Haryana and Shamli of Uttar Pradesh. Reacting to the fresh violations, HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “I have directed the regional officer to take immediate action. He has taken up the matter with the district administration, mining and irrigation department for action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/locals-in-haryana-s-kanalsi-village-flag-fresh-mining-violations-across-yamuna/story-IR4R5DsHXxruLrvMw7tx4K.html
11-10-2020||Chandigarh||Malpractices in property registration: Divisional commissioners asked to complete probe by October 16||Following the expiry of the six-week deadline to probe malpractices in the registration of sale deeds in Haryana, the revenue department has asked the divisional commissioners of Ambala, Karnal, Rohtak, Hisar, Gurugram and Faridabad to complete the probe and submit their reports by October 16. The inquiry is being conducted into the violation of Section 7-A of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act during registration of sale deeds from April 3, 2017 to December 31, 2019. The six-week deadline expired on September 24. Additional chief secretary (ACS), revenue, Sanjeev Kaushal in separate communications to the six divisional commissioners and principal secretary, town and country planning, has asked for the inquiry to be completed by coming Friday. The inquiry was to be conducted from April 3, 2017, the day an amendment in the Section 7-A was notified by the BJP government in the state, to water down the HDRUA provision. The detection of widespread malpractices in execution of sale deeds had cast a shadow on the functioning of the revenue department headed by deputy chief minister, Dushyant Chautala. The state government had got criminal cases registered against six serving and one retired revenue official for executing registration of sale deeds of properties without obtaining no-objection certificates (NoC) in notified urban areas of Gurugram district. Subsequently, it was decided that a statewide probe should be conducted for registrations done with effect from April 3, 2017. The town and country planning (TCP) department was also asked to conduct an inquiry into the role of its officials. The stipulations in Section 7-A of HDRUA Act pertained to grant of a NoC by TCP before registration of land in notified urban areas. The 2017 amendment of Section 7-A of HDRUA Act led to two modifications in the provision. First, it decreased the size of notified urban area land holding for which NoC is required from less than one hectare (2.5 acres) to less than two kanals. Also, the definition of land for which the NoC was required was changed from vacant land to agricultural land. The 2017 amendment, officials said, worked to the advantage of real estate developers who were able to circumvent the requirement of NoC by converting agricultural land into uncultivable (gair mumkin) in revenue records.Amendment in urban area law undone As a corrective measure, the assembly during its one-day monsoon session in August had passed a Bill to undo the 2017 amendment in the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act. The amended law entailed a change in definition of notified urban area land and size of the holding for which the NoC was required. The land holding for which NoC is required is now less than one acre instead of less than two kanals and the notified urban area land definition has been changed from agricultural to vacant again. Vacant land has been defined as land wherein either no construction of any nature exists or such construction was in existence which is either uninhabited or not fit for human habitation and stands constructed without following the due course of law. Also, now NOC will be required for transfer of land through gift deed. Meanwhile, suspended naib tehsildar Jagdish Chand was reinstated on October 6 as no evidence was found against him by the Gurugram divisional commissioner. On being asked about the technical glitches affecting the registration process post incorporation of safety measures in software, the ACS, revenue, said most of the snags have been sorted out and registrations were being done in a smooth hassle-free manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/malpractices-in-property-registration-divisional-commissioners-asked-to-complete-probe-by-october-16/story-eEAFA4l89NqCPcIcOJxIIL.html
11-10-2020||Election:||Sachin Pilot, Ghulam Nabi Azad among Congress’ star campaigners for Bihar||Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of the 23 dissenters who wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking an overhaul of the party’s organisational structure, and Sachin Pilot, who revolted against Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, are among the 30 star campaigners of the party for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. The list of star campaigners, submitted by the Congress to the Election Commission of India on Saturday, also includes Sonia Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh, former party chief Rahul Gandhi and general secretary incharge of UP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.In their letter to Sonia Gandhi on August 7, the 23 dissenters had called for an introspection behind the “steady decline” of the 135-year-old organisation while outlining an 11-point action plan. Two other signatories of the letter, Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Raj Babbar, also feature on the star campaigners list.Apart from three chief ministers – Captain Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan) and Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) – the Congress star campaigners also include former Bharatiya Janata Party leaders Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad and Udit Raj. The three leaders had joined the Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Former Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam and poet Imran Pratapgarhi, who contested the last Lok Sabha elections from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, are the other star campaigners. A Congress functionary, familiar with the matter, said it is unlikely that Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh will visit Bihar for campaigning, but did not rule out the two leaders addressing virtual rallies. He said Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi are likely to campaign in Bihar and some other states where by-elections will be held on November 3, including Madhya Pradesh. In view of the risk of transmission at election rallies amid the coronavirus disease pandemic, the EC has reduced the maximum number of campaigners for recognised parties from 40 to 30. For unrecognised parties, the number has been fixed at 20. The Congress is contesting on 70 seats as part of the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ or ‘Grand Alliance’, playing a second fiddle to Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which is fighting on 144 of the total 243 seats. The other constituent of the ‘Grand Alliance’ -- Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or CPI(ML) -- are together contesting on 29 seats. Bihar will vote in three phases between October 28 and November 7. The results will be announced on November 10. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday partially modified its latest Covid-19 guidelines to allow political rallies in 12 states where elections are scheduled to be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/sachin-pilot-ghulam-nabi-azad-among-congress-star-campaigners-for-bihar/story-6qYHIJRO7At3tzF2y5ZPYL.html

Earlier, many positions were left vacant as no suitable candidate was found, he said. “Majority of the positions being offered are new vacancies, and dozens of those, which we were not able to fill the last time.”With this, the number of faculty members is expected to reach 661 from the present strength of 581. “In the last two and a half years, the faculty strength has doubled from just 280 to the present 581. Last year, 80 doctors were recruited and the process is expected to continue as we open new departments and increase research work. Also, the number of patients have increased manifold, so more recruitments are important to sustain the system,” said Dr Jagat Ram.The institute spends around 70% of its total budget on staff salaries, which means of the total ₹1,551 crore sanctioned in this year’s budget, ₹1,076 crore will be spent on them. In fact, the institute has sought ₹100 crore more in the supplementary budget from the Centre to pay all the salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-recruit-80-more-faculty-members-in-30-departments-by-year-end/story-0aF7TD7faIGY0IjJykoyjO.html

11-10-2020||Mumbai||209 villages in Thane rural keep coronavirus at bay||Dalkhan village in Shahapur Taluka (more than 60kms from Kalyan city) does not have any Covid positive case since the last 20 days. However, in August, they had 53 positive cases.This was possible after several villagers and social organisations pooled in funds to set up a small health care centre with two beds, oxygen facilities and an ambulance, helping in early testing, isolation and timely treatment. The villagers who had to visit other towns or villages for medical facilities could now get it in the village itself.Like Dalkhan village, there are 208 more villages within Thane rural that are now Covid-free due to various such initiatives.Dr Rupali Satpute, chief executive officer (additional charge), Thane Zilla Parishad, said, “More than 250 villages exist within Thane rural. Among these, 209 villages do not have a single Covid positive case for more than a month. Any area with a positive case would immediately be declared as a containment zone and sealed. For the next 14 days, regular screening and contact tracing were done in these zones. There are around 428 more containment zones within the rural areas where screening is going on.”In Dalkhan village, every positive patient was immediately rushed to the hospital. They have a doctor who visits the health centre twice a week. Here, those with fever or any other health problems get consultation and medicines. If anyone has fever-like symptoms for more than two days, he/she is sent to the hospital at the earliest, thus arresting the spread of the virus.Bhagwan Mokashi, sarpanch (additional charge), Dalkhan village, said, “We did not demand funds from the government to set up a health centre during the lockdown but used various other sources and managed to provide a facility within the village. This helped in providing timely treatment. All our social health workers helped in contact tracing and screening of the villagers. As soon as we found any patient with symptoms, he/she was immediately taken to a hospital in the ambulance. Having such basic facilities at our service helped ensure that the cases do not spike.”A team was formed for conducting screening and testing across rural areas of Thane. This team included medical officers, social health workers, teachers and anganwadi helpers. They visited these villages and conducted screening of all those who have symptoms. The villagers were also advised as to how to maintain hygiene and keep mouth and nose covered during this pandemic.Youngsters spread awareness Kon village in Bhiwandi involved youngsters to create awareness about the pandemic. The Sarpanch of the village being a doctor helped the social health workers to train.“We conducted regular checks of the market places and involved vigilant residents of the villages to ensure social distancing was followed. Moreover, all the poor or destitute who were finding it difficult to get food during the lockdown were provided with food grains and basic essentials. Apart from tracing, screening and testing, our main focus was also for the people to understand the pandemic, gauge the symptoms and follow the norms. These were observed well,” said Dr Rupali Karale, sarpanch, Kon village, Bhiwandi rural.The village set up a website for all the Covid-related updates and information during the lockdown. This helped people staying indoors to get Covid updates on their smart phones. People were informed about the positive cases so that whoever came in contact could isolate immediately.“If any cluster of cases was noticed or any particular village had a spike in the number of cases, we immediately conducted a testing camp in these areas. In these camps, each person who had come even remotely in contact with a positive patient and those with any kind of symptoms were tested. If anyone tested positive, he/she was immediately shifted to the hospital,” said a senior officer from Zilla Parishad.Green flag flying highThe zilla parishad had asked villages in July to hoist a green flag in the gram panchayat if they did not have a single Covid case in 28 days. Currently, there are 209 villages in Thane rural areas that have hoisted green flags, “Special efforts were taken to remove the fear in the minds of the residents regarding Covid. Creating awareness and efforts to trace, track and test as soon as possible helped us hoist 209 green flags across Thane rural,” said Satpute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/209-villages-in-thane-rural-keep-coronavirus-at-bay/story-Cfgjei9Sf6Y6NYMjrugthO.html

11-10-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body warns schools over fee demands||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) commissioner Abhijit Bangar has warned schools of strict action on receiving complaints of parents over not allowing children to attend online classes. A meeting between NMMC and private school management was held recently after the civic body received complaints from parents.Bangar said, “Education is a basic right and as per Section 16 of RTE, no child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education. Hence, if any school denies any child from attending exam, attending online classes or receiving mark sheets over non-payment of fees, action would be taken.”He added, “We have sent several notices to schools in the past but a direct communication was needed. The management brought forward their issues. They said that they have to pay salaries and maintain laboratories. We asked them to have a meeting with their contractors and amicably find a solution. We have asked the management to see the whole situation in an empathetic way as each household is undergoing financial crunch during the pandemic.”Some parents had complained of schools asking them to take loans to pay fees. This was not acceptable by the NMMC chief.Meanwhile, due to a stay by the High Court on the issue of reduction of the fees by school during the pandemic, NMMC did not ask the schools to reduce fees. But, it appealed to schools not to pressurise parents for fees and to give them time for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-warns-schools-over-fee-demands/story-mPfjKssZWZzUPSwteraytO.html

11-10-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: The Social Dilemma is actually personal||Dilemmas of various kinds perennially dot our lives. Relationships, careers, pass-times, pursuits, interactions and even our personal spaces allow us the liberty, and often create the necessity, of having to take decision after decision. Mundane matters – which route to follow to a destination, which menu item to choose, which clothes to wear and which friend to chat with, also provide us with the opportunity to flex our decision-making muscles, so to say. The recently popular Netflix film, The Social Dilemma, highlights the specific quandary that we the people face in today’s social media driven time capsule. Privacy issues as well as mental health and specifically addiction related issues have been raised by this film. The documentary highlights the so called terror that users face due to their own browsing habits. The film cautions virtually the whole world to back off in its usage of those social media power houses, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the like. Big Brother is always said to be watching. Our every move, our every choice, is known to these big bad guys, according to The Social Dilemma. This is a film based on damaging video statements given by former employees of Facebook, et al, against the social media world. Thus, advertisers are said to be sharks waiting to swoop upon us the moment we click a button. Algorithms which are used by these social media giants are alleged to be designed to extract every fraction of monetary resources that we possess. Political and financial bigwigs are supposed to be biding their time until we divulge our true nature. The Social Dilemma has truly set the cat among the pigeons and deflated the cushy bubble of virtual reality that several people were living in before they viewed the film. One youngster I know well, and I dare say there are many like him, has actually deleted his beloved social media accounts, so petrified was he by these scary ‘revelations.’ The film has jolted the millennial in particular. That young person who was born with technology in his palm now discovers that technology can harm him no end. His beloved Instagram, where he virtually lives, is supposedly inhabited by monsters disguised as advertisements, leading links, suggestions etc. which can gobble up his peace and his freedom. The Netflix film has thus rattled and shaken a large number of people across the world. The response of Facebook to these forceful allegations has been to send out a typically pointed denial which virtually scoffs at the main thrust areas of The Social Dilemma. Facebook also points out that Netflix is using algorithms similar to its own to target potential viewers who would be keen to view a film like The Social Dilemma! There are always two sides to a coin. Shades of grey everywhere. Just how much danger am I in, if Instagram knows that I love idlis, cricket, coffee, and books, not necessarily in that order? Let us therefore take a reality check here, unencumbered by being obsessive users, or alleged perpetrators of stress creating models, in the social media realm. The fact remains that our own choices determine how we interact with the world. When we choose to eat a burger and drink a Coke, we know that they’re not good for us, unless we consume them infrequently. Similarly, we should be able to control the time we spend on the internet, and the desire to overdo our involvement with it by avoiding the urge to post personal pictures etc. which need not be posted. Even if there is a whirlpool, a mass of quicksand, waiting everywhere in the virtual world, to pounce upon our weaknesses, we can avoid it. We must choose not to overdo anything. We must choose to be disciplined. We must choose to distance ourselves from our smartphones for large amounts of time, every day. Balance, as always, is the key. Very few people can remain devoid of social media usage today. I am to attend an online birthday party for a childhood friend, tonight. The social media world is not really demonic in nature, unless we allow it to be. The choice is ours. Be sensible, or be taken for a ride. vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-the-social-dilemma-is-actually-personal/story-0NFoi7ioJ81WwNlkp3D0DM.html
11-10-2020||Pune||Traffic violations rise in September on Pune-Mumbai Expressway||There has been a substantial surge in traffic violations on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway after the e-pass travel restriction was suspended by the state government since September 1. The highway police took action against 15,187 violators and Rs 4,61,900 was collected in fines in September, while in August, action was taken against 9,619 violators and Rs 1,12,300 was collected in fines. In July, when most activities were shut due to lockdown, 9,265 people were penalised and Rs 1,57,300 was collected in fines. Fines from people were collected for crossing the speed limit, overtaking from the wrong side, driving on the wrong side and no seat-belts. Many were also fined while not having e-pass during the lockdown. The rise in fine, according to the highway police, is mainly attributed to increased traffic movement on the expressway after the government revoked all the restrictions. As railway service was suspended during September, most people chose road transport, say, officials.“People flout traffic rules even after confiscating their licence or imposing fine on them. Police patrolling on the expressway is taking stringent actions, still, people are reckless while driving,” said Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police, traffic, Mumbai. The fine collected in September is equivalent of February when Covid pandemic was yet to affect India. In February, 15,781 violators were fined to the tune of Rs8,84,500.By March, when Maharashtra started witnessing Covid cases, as a result of which government invoked curbs, the traffic violations were also reduced drastically (see box).Of the nine months starting January till September, least number of violations were recorded in April when only 94 people were fined. It was during April, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) demolished the British-era iconic Amrutanjan bridge near Khandala as it was causing hindrance to traffic. “In India, we still don’t have rules like other countries where people who violate traffic rules are banned from filling petrol or they have to pay extra taxes. The condition has improved in the last ten years, but people need to be more respectful to traffic rules,” said Upadhyay. Jagdish Pardeshi, assistant police inspector, highway police, Dasturi, which looks after a 12km stretch on the expressway, said, “Traffic has increased after the suspension of e-pass. People argue with traffic police after violating the rules and hesitate to pay fine. There are also many cases where people are yet to deposit their fine amount.” “During lockdown, people in the name of essential services also tried to drive between Mumbai-Pune route who we caught red-handed,” added Pardeshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/traffic-violations-rise-in-september-on-pune-mumbai-expressway/story-wE3RtssuEApTJ3REN4B3aK.html

Priyank Sukhija of First Fiddle Restaurants says, “This not only gives us benefit to earn more revenue but also this generates more employment.We have always admired the nightlife culture of other countries because of such free spirited rules, getting timings restrictions ease in our own Delhi will surely give elevate industry. Echoing the same thought, Zorawar Kalra, Massive Restaurants Pvt Ltd feels that the ease of doing business will ensure more people opening their restaurants. He adds, “We welcome the opportunity to operate 24x7. Keeping in mind the safety of our patrons and our team we will study our various locations and choose where all this new opportunity can be implemented.”Apart from providing job opportunities, the massive step will directly contribute in increased income for the grappling industry.

We will be taking safety measures and more health measures in check so that our staff remains happy.”READ: Maharashtra announces guidelines for timings of restaurants, barsFor a restaurant, the operational timings currently are from 11am to 11pm and 11am to 1am for bars, but will the time extension impact the functioning of fine-dining restaurants and small establishments? “As far as timings are concerned, we being fine dining anyway, won’t open for whole night but this move is really encouraging. We will extend the timings may be to 2 am so that we can cater to the crowd that likes to eat out late in the night, says Amit Bagga, founder Daryaganj. Chef Radhika Khandelwal, owner, Fig & Maple also believes that being open 24x7 might not help smaller businesses, “A small establishment like ours won’t go for a 24 hour operation. We will instead look at extending hours of space, especially if the bars can be open post 1am but easing of license will be a big help.” For Nikhil Arora, co-founder, The Tummy Section, this might be an opportunity to come up with disruptive ideas in the restaurant sector. He says, “This decision will help in to get some more unique concepts by young restaurateurs and entrepreneurs in F&B industry which will be great to watch in coming months.”Yangdup Lama, founder of Sidecar and Cocktails and Dreams, Speakeasy too welcomes the positive move but states, “This help in ease of doing business during difficult times but one needs to understand that with 24 hours concept, it might not boost sales but add to the high cost of running operation which also goes up.”Interact with author/sanchita_kalra.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/are-restaurants-all-set-to-bounce-back-as-delhi-gets-ready-to-eat-drink-and-repeat-24x7/story-gXz459ljOhGrDC0Bnin5HK.html
11-10-2020||World||UK at ‘tipping point:’ England braces for more restrictions||Millions of people in northern England are anxiously waiting to hear how much further virus restrictions will be tightened as one of the British government’s leading medical advisers warned Sunday that the country is at a crucial juncture in the second wave of the coronavirus.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said the UK is at a “tipping point similar to where we were in March” following a sharp increase in new coronavirus cases.“But we can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now,” he said. “Now we know where it is and how to tackle it — let’s grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating itself.”All across Europe including the UK, there have been huge increases in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks following the reopening of large sectors of the economy, as well as schools and universities. Infection levels, — and deaths — in the UK are rising at their fastest rates in months.Without quick action, there are fears that UK hospitals will be overwhelmed in the coming weeks at a time of year when they are already at their busiest with winter-related afflictions like the flu. The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,825, up another 65 on Sunday.Although coronavirus infections are rising throughout England, northern cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen a disproportionate increase. While some rural areas in eastern England have less than 20 cases per 100,000 people, major metropolitan areas such as Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham have recently recorded levels above 500 per 100,000, nearly as bad as Madrid or Brussels.As a result, national restrictions such as a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants have been supplemented by local actions, including in some cases banning contacts between households. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have already closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.In response to the virus’ resurgence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a new three-tier local lockdown system for England on Monday, which could temporarily close pubs and restaurants in the virus hot spots. The speculation is household mixing, indoors or outside, will be banned in those areas put under the tightest restrictions. Liverpool’s local leader has said he expects his city to face the most onerous restrictions from Wednesday.He is briefing members of the Cabinet by conference call Sunday.Local leaders in northern England have vented their fury at the Conservative government over what they see as an “inadequate” wage support scheme that it announced Friday and for not properly telling them about the upcoming restrictions. The wage plan aims to help employees in companies that are forced to close because of virus restrictions, but mayors say it’s not generous enough in paying only two-thirds of employees’ wages and doesn’t compensate those indirectly hit by any business closures, such as drink suppliers to pubs.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick on Sunday sought to assuage concerns that the government was being overly hierarchical in its approach. He also indicated that local authorities will be given more control over the national test and trace program, which has struggled to live up to Johnson’s prediction that it would be “world-beating.”“In addition to the national infrastructure which is developing and increasing with every passing week, we’re also going to be making use of local councils to do contact tracing in particular, because there is clear evidence that local councils are good at that, as you’d expect,” he told the BBC.As well as facing questions over its coronavirus strategy, government members were having to respond to accusations of potential wrongdoing.Jenrick, himself, denied there was anything wrong in the fact that he and a junior minister in his department approved payments to towns in each other’s constituencies from a government fund earmarked for deprived areas. He insisted there was a “robust and fair” methodology behind the allocations.Separately, Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied claims that he broke the government’s drinking curfew after the Mail on Sunday newspaper claimed he was seen having a drink in a House of Commons bar after 10 p.m.“The proposed timeline of events is false and no rules have been broken,” a spokesman for the health secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-at-tipping-point-england-braces-for-more-restrictions/story-G3nH5gOaRiK1qMhTWvuoqM.html
11-10-2020||World||Courts ‘should not try’ to make policy: Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to senators||Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett will tell senators that courts “should not try” to make policy, leaving those decisions to the political branches of government, according to opening remarks for her confirmation hearing obtained Sunday by The Associated Press.The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, set to begin begin Monday as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country, are taking place three weeks before Election Day and after millions of Americans already have voted. President Donald Trump nominated the federal appeals court judge soon after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died.“I have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat, but no one will ever take her place,” Barrett will tell the committee, according to her opening remarks.Barrett says she has resolved to maintain the same perspective as her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was “devoted to his family, resolute in his beliefs, and fearless of criticism.”She speaks extensively of her family in the statement, and says she will never let the law define her identity or crowd out the rest of her life. She says a similar principle applies to the courts, which are “not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life.”“The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People,” she says. “The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.”Barrett will tell the senators that “courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life.”Republicans who control the Senate are moving at a breakneck pace to put the 48-year-old judge on the Supreme Court before the Nov. 3 election, in time to hear a high-profile challenge to the Affordable Care Act and any election-related challenges that may follow the voting.Another reason for moving quickly: It’s unclear whether the election results would make it harder to confirm Barrett before the end of the year if Democrat Joe Biden were to win the White House and Democrats were to gain seats in the Senate.The hearing is taking place less than a month after the death of Ginsburg gave Trump the chance to replace the liberal justice and entrench a conservative majority on the nine-member court. Barrett would be Trump’s third Supreme Court justice.The country will get an extended look at Barrett over three days, beginning with her opening statement late Monday and hours of questioning Tuesday and Wednesday.Democrats have pressed in vain so far to delay the hearings, first because of the proximity to the election and now the virus threat. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/courts-should-not-try-to-make-policy-supreme-court-nominee-amy-coney-barrett-to-senators/story-mnJ2g6oQrd0qI4V0z9pvCO.html

11-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un throws down gauntlet with huge new ICBM: Analysts||The gargantuan new missile North Korea put on show at a military parade is an explicit threat to US defences and an implicit challenge to both the current and next American president, analysts say, warning Pyongyang could test the weapon next year.Leader Kim Jong Un watched the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) roll through Kim Il Sung square -- named after his grandfather -- in Pyongyang at the climax of an unprecedented night-time parade on Saturday.Analysts concurred that it was the largest road-mobile, liquid-fuelled missile anywhere in the world, and was highly likely to be designed to carry multiple warheads in independent re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies said it was “clearly aimed at overwhelming the US missile defense system in Alaska”. If the ICBM carried three or four warheads, he added on Twitter, the US would need to spend around $1 billion on 12-16 interceptors to defend against each missile.“At that cost, I am pretty sure North Korea can add warheads faster than we can add interceptors.”The missile was estimated at 24 metres long and 2.5 metres in diameter, which specialist Markus Schiller said was big enough to carry 100 tonnes of fuel, which would take hours to load.It was so big and heavy that it was practically unusable, he added: “You can’t move this thing fuelled, and you can’t fill it at the launch site. “This thing makes absolutely no sense at all, except for threat equation games, like sending the message of ‘we now have a mobile ICBM with MIRVs, be very afraid’.”North Korea watchers regularly caution that the devices Pyongyang puts on show at its parades may be mock-ups or models, and there is no proof they work until they are tested.But the missile was carried on an enormous and previously unseen 11-axle transporter-erector-launcher, far larger than the eight-axle Chinese-made vehicles the North has employed so far.“The truck may be a scarier story than the missile,” said Melissa Hanham of the Open Nuclear Network. “If the DPRK is indigenously producing their own chassis, then there is less of a constraint on the number of ICBMs they can launch.”- Red lines -Shortly before being inaugurated in 2017, Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea developing a weapon capable of reaching parts of the US “won’t happen!”.He spent the first year of his presidency -- which saw the North launch an ICBM with the range to do exactly that -- in an escalating war of words with Kim before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance developed between them.But nuclear negotiations have been deadlocked since the collapse of their Hanoi summit early last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.The ICBM was proof that the North had continued to develop its arsenal throughout the diplomatic process, analysts said, and gave Pyongyang greater heft to demand a return to the negotiating table.“Like it or not North Korea is a nuclear power and is probably the third nuclear power which is capable of striking American cities, third after Russia and China,” Andrei Lankov of Korea Risk Group told AFP.Kim was sending the US a message that the North’s capabilities were improving and that “if you don’t want to make a deal now, sometime later you will have to make a deal which will be worse for you, the international community”, he added.More than 12 hours after the end of the parade broadcast on North Korean state television Trump had not yet tweeted about it -- and nor had his Democratic rival Joe Biden.Trump has made much of Kim’s promise not to carry out any further ICBM or nuclear tests, and Shin Beom-chul of the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy said that by displaying the missile rather than launching it, Pyongyang had stopped short of crossing his red lines.“But it also signals that North Korea could carry out a launch if Trump is re-elected and ignores the North Korean issue,” he said, adding: “If Biden is elected and he doesn’t listen to North Korea, it will carry out a launch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/kim-jong-un-throws-down-gauntlet-with-huge-new-icbm-analysts/story-use8epW9gsaxbtNHAaoxKI.html
11-10-2020||World||Lithuania holds national vote, coalition talks expected||Polls opened Sunday for the first round of Lithuania’s parliamentary election, where voters will choose 141 national lawmakers and the ruling four-party coalition is facing a stiff challenge from the opposition.Pre-election polls in the Baltic nation show the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, which now leads the coalition government, marginally ahead of the opposition conservative Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats, the populist Labour party and the center-right Liberal Movement.A recent surge in Covid-19 cases, soaring virus-related unemployment and economic challenges are the major issues that have sparked criticism of the current coalition government.Five or six parties are expected to cross the 5% threshold to enter the Seimas assembly but none is likely to get more than 20% support, so horse-trading talks to form a new governing coalition are very likely after the election.The recent sharp rise in coronavirus infections in Lithuania and new restrictions to fight the spread of Covid-19 may affect turnout among the country’s 2.4 million registered voters. Some 7.3% have already cast their ballots in an early voting, according to the Central Electoral Commission.A second round of voting has been set for October 25 in constituencies where no candidate gets a majority.Many Lithuanians complain that government did not do enough to help companies during the nation’s coronavirus lockdown, as the unemployment rate jumped from 9% in February to more than 14% in October. Others say the strict health regulations focused on fighting the virus left thousands of other patients without proper access to health services.Supporters of the ruling coalition say this coastal Baltic country has suffered relatively lightly in the pandemic. So far Lithuania has seen 5,963 confirmed coronavirus cases and and just above 100 deaths.Lithuania has kept strong democratic traditions since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. It has also played a major role as the protests in neighboring Belarus unfold against that nation’s authoritarian leader.Lithuania has granted shelter to Belarus opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus after challenging President Alexander Lukashenko in the country’s August 9 presidential vote. Officials said Lukashenko won a sixth term in office but opposition members say the election was riddled with fraud.Together with its Baltic neighbors Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania swiftly imposed sanctions against Belarusian leaders, and the European Union — a 27-nation bloc that includes the three Baltic nations — eventually followed suit with sanctions. Belarus is not an EU member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lithuania-holds-national-vote-coalition-talks-expected/story-agZkpcC5kd27ubF44CBYvN.html

11-10-2020||World||One held for vandalising Hindu temple in Pakistan||One person has been arrested after a Hindu temple was desecrated in Pakistan’s southeast Sindh province.Local police registered an FIR on the incident at the Shri Ramdev Temple in Kario Ghanwar area of Badin district and arrested Muhammad Ismail Sheedi, a local, who was named by complainant Ashok Kumar as the person believed to have caused the desecration. Police officer Badin Shabir Sethar told local media that he had ordered an investigation and sought an inquiry report within 24 hours. He also said that he suspected the accused was of unsound mind. “We are yet to confirm if he (Ismail) is mentally stable and intentionally destroyed the murtis (idols),” he said, adding that Ismail is also a drug addict. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.The community mainly resides in the Sindh province. Kario Ghanwar is home to the Hindu Kolhi, Menghwar, Guwaria and Karia communities.According to the official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan.Incidents of violence against the minority community in Sindh have frequently been reported. Condemning the vandalism, London-based Pakistani human rights activist and spokeswoman for Justice for Minorities in Pakistan Anila Gulzar said only 20 temples out of 428 are left.“I strongly condemn the brutal act of vandalism committed against Shri Ram Mandir in Badin Sindh Pakistan on 10 October. Out of 428 only 20 mandirs are left in Sindh,” Gulzar said in a Facebook post.In May, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had condemned the razing of houses of people from the Hindu and Christian communities in Punjab province’s Bahawalpur city.A video of a similar incident had surfaced on the internet earlier this year in which a basti of a minority Hindu community in Bhawalpur was demolished. The demolition exercise was carried out under the watch of Tariq Bashir Cheema, the housing minister in the Imran Khan government, and the country’s principal Information officer Shahid Khokhar.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-held-for-vandalising-hindu-temple-in-pakistan/story-cmprJhpbhkcXi2nkZ6cOdP.html
11-10-2020||World||Amid tensions with India, China holds event to remember Indian doctor Kotnis||University students from India and China participated in an online event hosted by a Chinese association with close links to the government to mark the birth anniversary of Dwarkanath Kotnis, an Indian doctor who died in China during the Sino-Japanese war in 1942.In 1938, a medical team of five doctors comprising M Atal, M. Cholkar, Kotnis, BK Basu and D. Mukerji came to China as part of the Indian medical mission team’ uring the war with Japan to aid Chinese soldiers. Among the five, all, except Kotnis, returned to India.Hosted by the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the event on Saturday saw the release of short documentaries on Kotnis to mark his 110th birth anniversary and a discussion on the Indian doctor’s legacy.It was held in the backdrop of the ongoing India-China border tension in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to its worst levels.Speaking on the occasion, CPAFFC chairperson Lin Songtian, who until March was China’s ambassador to South Africa, said there have been temporary difficulties in Sino-Indian relations recently, but the young students of the two countries did not stop making the documentaries because of this. Instead, they incorporated their deep hope for peace and friendship between China and India into short video works, using their own way to commemorate Kotnis, he added.Students and professors from two Indian universities, the Doon University and the Central University of Gujarat besides several Chinese universities including Peking University, which co-organised the event, Beijing Foreign Studies University and Communication University of China took part in the event.A senior diplomat from the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Ma Jia, participated. The CPAFFC describes itself as a “national people’s organisation engaged in people-to-people diplomacy of the People’s Republic of China…In launching its activities, it has support from the government and assistance from all sectors of the society.”A separate webinar was held on Friday in Mumbai where the Chinese consul general Tang Guocai spoke on the Indian doctor’s impact on ties.Speaking at the webinar organised by Dr. Kotnis Memorial Committee, Tang remembered Dr. Kotnis’s contribution that exemplified India and China’s friendship tradition.“The culture and tradition of India and China have several commonalities just as Dr Kotnis is seen as an Indian in China and as Chinese in India,” Tang was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua.He also called upon China and India to join hands in vaccine research and manufacturing as well as in the public health field for the benefit of their people and the world as a whole.In August, Chinese official media had announced that a bronze statue of Kotnis erected outside a medical school named after him in north China’s Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei’s province, was to be unveiled later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-tensions-with-india-china-holds-event-to-remember-indian-doctor-kotnis/story-CpvGJ6uvarkrJhUqeVYeLO.html

Most of the countries have resumed international flights in a staggered manner but these central and south American countries have so far not allowed international flights since March.Panama: Panama will welcome international tourists from October 12. A negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test from within 48 hours will be required to get an exemption from quarantine. On March 23, Panama suspended all international passenger flights.Argentina: Argentina is likely to resume international flights from October 12, or a few days later, but by mid October, the government has said. This South American nations has been observing one of the most stringent lockdowns. Guyana: This South American country will resume international flights from October 12.British Airways will start its London-Lahore flights from October 12. At present, British Airways flies between London and Islamabad. Global airlines body International Air Transport Association has recently predicted that the global airline industry will burn through USD 77 billion in cash during the second half of 2020 despite the resumption of flight services. “The cash drain continued during the summer months, with airlines expected to go through an additional USD 77 billion of their cash during the second half of this year and a further USD 60-70 billion in 2021. The industry is not expected to turn cash positive until 2022,” it said. The aviation sector in India has also been significantly impacted due to the pandemic. In July, the country’s largest airline IndiGo declared a net loss of Rs 2,884.3 crore for the first quarter of 2020-21.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-flights-these-countries-are-welcoming-foreigners-from-october-12/story-wPNJfSyRW1toD9TVcZ3cJI.html

11-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un shows off military might but refrains from threatening US||North Korea’s unprecedented nighttime military parade on Saturday showcased an unusually broad array of new weapons, from a show-stopping “monster” ballistic missile to previously unseen battle tanks.The hardware, likely still in varying stages of development, offered leader Kim Jong Un a chance to show the world his cutting-edge military power while adding practical capabilities to the North Korea’s already formidable nuclear and conventional forces, experts said.Kim is walking a fine line, seeking to increase pressure on the United States to ease sanctions while not destroying rapport with US President Donald Trump or Pyongyang’s partners in China.“Kim Jong Un’s speech was not threatening to the United States, instead labelling North Korea’s nuclear forces as self-defensive,” said Bruce Klingner, a retired CIA North Korea analyst now at the Heritage Foundation. “The clear message was that, counter to US claims, the North Korean nuclear threat has not been solved.”Video from the parade suggested a huge intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) potentially more lethal either because of multiple warheads or a bigger payload, larger missile carriers, a next-generation submarine-launched missile, and advances in conventional weaponry, military analysts said.Multiple warheads?The star of Saturday’s show was a massive, previously unseen ICBM carried on an equally huge “transporter-erector-launcher” (TEL) vehicle with 11 axles.Estimated to be 25 to 26 metres (82 to 85 feet) long and 2.5 to 2.9 metres (8 to 9.5 feet) in diameter, the unidentified missile would be the largest road-mobile ICBM in the world, military analysts said.Given that the Hwasong-15, the largest missile ever test-flown by North Korea, can already target anywhere in the United States, the most likely practical use for the new ICBM would be the ability to carry multiple warheads, said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.It is much cheaper for North Korea to add warheads than for the United States to add interceptors, said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).“If each new North Korean ICBM can carry 3-4 warheads, we would need about 12-16 interceptors for each missile,” he said on Twitter. “The last time the US bought 14 interceptors, it cost $1 billion.”Other analysts said the missile could simply be designed to carry a single, larger warhead.“A bigger warhead doesn’t necessarily mean multiple warheads, a technology I believe North Korea has not secured yet,” said Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who is now a professor at Kyungnam University’s Far East Institute in Seoul.Missile carriersAnalysts said it was also notable that North Korea appeared to have built the huge new TELs to carry the new missiles.“They have a very limited supply of long TELs they acquired from China,” said another CNS researcher, Dave Schmerler, adding that the lack of vehicles has limited the number of ICBMs that could be deployed. “So the longer TELs we saw were indigenously produced.”But the massive size of the new missile and its carrier also has drawbacks, said Markus Schiller, a missile expert based in Europe.“Only special roads and bridges could support this in fuelled condition,” he said. “No sane person would drive this ticking bomb through the North Korean countryside.”It would likely take as much as a half a day to fuel such a large missile, making it difficult to quickly deploy in a war, meaning the missile’s main purpose is likely a political warning, Schiller said.Submarine missileNorth Korea also unveiled what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), labelled the Pukguksong-4.“If the new SLBM is intended to be deployed, it may be intended for the new conventionally powered ballistic missile submarine that North Korea hinted at building in July 2019,” analysts at 38 North, a US-based think tank, said in a report.At least some parts of the missile’s motor case appeared to be filament-wound, which would reduce the missile’s structure weight and allow greater range and payload capability, the report said.Conventional weaponsThe parade featured what appeared to be new or updated weapons for North Korea’s conventional military, one of the largest in the world.The North displayed rows upon rows of multiple launch rocket systems and short-range ballistic missiles that were heavily tested over the past year.“My biggest concern was the solid-fuel, short-range tactical missiles that North Korea had focused on developing over the past year or so,” said Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator.The parade also displayed new mobile air-defence radar vehicles and what appeared to be an entirely new tank with anti-tank missiles and smoke grenade launchers more closely integrated into the design

11-10-2020||World||Heavy shelling and civilian casualties dash hopes for Karabakh ceasefire||Hopes that a Russian-brokered ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan might hold were further dashed Sunday, with both sides accusing the other of intense shelling on civilian areas and escalating two weeks of fierce clashes.Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry said that overnight shelling by Armenian forces on the country’s second largest city, Ganja, had left seven people dead and 33 wounded including children, less than 24 hours after the halt to fighting was supposed to take effect.Rescuers in red helmets dug through piles of debris with their bare hands in search of signs of survivors, an AFP journalist in the city reported.They retrieved one nearly naked body and gingerly put it in a white bag to be taken away in an ambulance while several horrified residents watched on and wept.One witness said they were woken by a huge blast that levelled an entire square block of one- and two-floor houses in the early hours of the morning, leaving nine apartments destroyed.“Everything I’ve worked for my entire life has been destroyed,” said resident Zagit Aliyev, 68.The agreement to pause hostilities in order to exchange prisoners and the bodies of people killed after two weeks of fighting over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region was approved by Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in marathon Russia-brokered talks in Moscow.- ‘An absolute lie’ -The truce officially entered into force at noon on Saturday but both sides almost immediately accused each other of violations.On Sunday, the defence ministry in the breakaway region insisted Armenian forces were respecting the humanitarian ceasefire and in turn accused Azerbaijan of shelling civilian-populated areas. Claims that Armenian forces were responsible for shelling Ganja were “an absolute lie,” it added.The leader of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Arayik Harutyunyan, described the situation as “calmer” on Sunday, but warned that the truce was precarious.An AFP journalist in the administrative capital of Stepanakert, which has been subjected to heavy bombings since the fighting erupted and is pockmarked with deep craters and unexploded ordnance, reported hearing loud explosions throughout the night.Vahram Poghosyan, a spokesman for Karabakh’s leader, said the overnight shelling on Stepanakert was “a disrespect of the agreements reached in Moscow,” and called on the international community to recognise the province’s independence as a way to end the fighting.New fighting broke out late last month, stemming from a long-simmering disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh.The disputed territory is an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, home to about 150,000 people, which broke from Azerbaijan’s control in a war in the 1990s that killed some 30,000 people. Its separatist government is strongly backed by Armenia, which like Azerbaijan gained independence with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. - A ‘temporary’ ceasefire -The most recent bout of fighting has been the heaviest since the 1990s war, with more than 450 people reported dead, thousands forced to flee their homes and fears the fighting could escalate into a devastating all-out conflict.The return of fighting has stoked fears of a full-blown war embroiling Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military treaty with Armenia.Armenia and world leaders including Russian leader Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have denounced the deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to bolster Azerbaijan’s army.France, Russia and the US -- known as the “Minsk Group” -- have for decades sought a lasting solution to the Karabakh conflict, but have failed to stop sporadic outbreaks of fighting, and Baku with Turkey’s backing appears set on continuing with its military intervention.A senior Azerbaijani official said Saturday the truce was only meant to be “temporary,” and said Baku had “no intention to backtrack” on its effort to retake control of Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavy-shelling-and-civilian-casualties-dash-hopes-for-karabakh-ceasefire/story-CQ9JwVhKJEXnsH0tnjcPAJ.html
11-10-2020||World||South Korea allows relaxations in social distancing rules as cases decrease||South Korea will relax some rules on social distancing from Monday, allowing nightspots to re-open and spectators to attend sports events, after new coronavirus cases edged lower in recent weeks, authorities said. Daily infections have fallen largely into the double-digit range in the past two weeks, down from 440 during outbreaks at a church and a political rally in August that prompted clampdowns on gatherings and some businesses.“We will lower the level of social distancing nationwide but maintain controls on risk factors such as the door-to-door sales industry,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting on Sunday. “Many citizens are feeling fatigue over prolonged distancing, and we also took its negative impact on the economy into consideration.” The relaxation means places of entertainment, such as nightclubs, karaoke bars and buffets can re-open, and audiences of up to 30% of stadium capacity will be allowed at sports matches such as the popular Korea Baseball Organization League, as long as they comply with anti-virus guidelines.But high-risk activities such as door-to-door sales businesses and small religious gatherings remain banned, with new limits on guests and spacing at nightspots and indoor sport venues in the heavily populated Seoul area, the government said. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo warned against complacency, saying the country still faced the dangers of what he called a “twindemic” of the virus and a winter seasonal flu.“We all know from past experiences that any slight carelessness could lead to another large-scale spread of the virus,” he told a separate briefing. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 58 cases by midnight on Saturday, taking total infections to 24,606, with 432 deaths. Of the new cases, 46 were domestically transmitted, most of them in the greater Seoul region, where small clusters continue to emerge from churches, door-to-door sales firms and medical institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-allows-relaxations-in-social-distancing-rules-as-cases-decrease/story-cDW6lOdytmwfWDkeAlZEmM.html
11-10-2020||World||Malaysia detains 60 Chinese citizens for trespassing into territorial waters||Malaysia’s maritime authority detained six Chinese fishing vessels and their crews for allegedly trespassing in waters off one of its southern states.The vessels, registered in Qinhuangdao, China, were believed to be sailing toward Mauritania in northwestern Africa to fish but had to stop and anchor off Johor state due to a malfunction, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said in a statement Saturday evening. There were six captains and 54 crew members, all Chinese nationals and between the ages of 31 and 60, it said.All were arrested after failing to produce permits from authorities to conduct activities or anchor in Malaysian waters, the agency said. It added the vessels, which didn’t have any cargo, were seized.Territorial tensions in the South China Sea have been on the rise with countries such as Vietnam pushing back against China’s maritime claims. Malaysia recently joined the fray by submitting to the United Nations its claim to rights over the remaining portion of a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the country’s baselines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-detains-60-chinese-citizens-for-trespassing-into-territorial-waters/story-8bmOsWn70QvCQsYaKLSsFL.html
11-10-2020||World||Covid-19: New curbs from Monday as UK back at ‘tipping point’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will outline tougher measures to deal with Covid-19 on Monday after two top government advisers described the situation in UK as “precarious” and a “tipping point” similar to the situation in March.Peter Horby, chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, told the BBC the country is in a “precarious” position, adding that another national lockdown is possible.Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, also said on Sunday: “In our national fight against Covid-19, we are at a tipping point similar to where we were in March; but we can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now”.As of Saturday night, there were 15,166 new coronavirus cases – three times the daily peaks in April and May. There were 81 deaths in the last 24 hours, with hospitals reporting a surge in patients admitted. Overall, there have been 57,347 deaths and 590,844 cases.Johnson is unlikely to announce a second national lockdown, but tougher rules under a new three-tier system of restrictions in north England are due to be announced in the House of Commons on Monday. Some of the toughest restrictions are likely in Liverpool, where there has been a surge in recent infections. London is also expected to be placed under new restrictions, mayor Sadiq Khan warned.Van-Tam said: “Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks. The good news, is that we are much more certain now that children are usually not badly affected by this virus.”“We now have much-improved testing capabilities, we know in more detail where the disease is, and we have better treatments. Earlier in the year we were fighting a semi-invisible disease, about which we had little knowledge, and it seeded in the community at great speed. Now we know where it is and how to tackle it – let’s grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating itself”, he added.Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced the extension and expansion of a job support scheme from November 1, to last until April 2021, indicating that the government is now assuming that the new set of measures would need to be in place for at least the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-curbs-from-monday-as-uk-back-at-tipping-point/story-oVCzyrObrAMquKecLOAwFJ.html
11-10-2020||World||Inhaled vaccines aim to fight coronavirus at Its point of attack||The Covid-19 vaccines closest to the finish line are designed to be injected into the arm. Researchers are looking at whether they can get better protection from inoculations that fight the virus at its point of attack — the nose and mouth.Most vaccines in human testing require two shots for effectiveness, and developers still aren’t even sure if they’ll prevent infections. Scientists are hoping to generate superior immune responses with inhaled vaccines that directly target the airway cells the virus invades.An alternative to conventional jabs, sprayed and inhaled immunizations under development in the U.S., Britain and Hong Kong could play an important role in helping society escape restrictions that have upended economies and everyday life. Among their goals is to prevent the pathogen from growing in the nose, a point from which it can spread to the rest of the body, and to other people.“Local immunity matters,” said Frances Lund, a University of Alabama at Birmingham immunologist working with biotech Altimmune Inc. on an early-stage nasal inoculation. “The vaccines that can be delivered to generate that will have some advantages over vaccines that are delivered systemically.”Most early vaccine developers focused on a familiar route — injections — seen as the fastest to protecting the world from disease. Inhaled vaccine makers are counting on some of the unique features of the lungs, nose and throat, which are lined with mucosa. This tissue contains high levels of immune proteins, called IgA, that give better protection against respiratory viruses.Activating these immune weapons, they theorize, can protect areas deeper in the lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 does the most damage. They also may improve vaccines’ chances of blocking transmission.“The first generation of vaccines are probably going to protect a lot of people,” said Michael Diamond, an infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. “But I think it’s the second- and third-generation vaccines — and maybe intranasal vaccines will be a key component of this — that ultimately are going to be necessary. Otherwise, we’ll continue to have community transmission.”In a study of mice in August, Diamond and his team found that delivering an experimental vaccine via the nose created a strong immune response throughout the body; the approach was especially effective in the nose and respiratory tract, preventing infection from taking hold. India’s Bharat Biotech and St. Louis-based Precision Virologics last month obtained rights to the single-dose technology.Vaccines that are sprayed into the nose or inhaled may hold other practical benefits. They don’t require needles, may not need to be stored and shipped at low temperatures and can reduce the need for health workers to administer them.“When you’re thinking about trying to deliver that across the world, if you don’t need to have an injectable vaccine, your compliance goes up because people don’t like getting shots,” according to Lund, the Alabama-based researcher. “But secondly, the level of expertise needed to administer that vaccine is significantly different.”Read More: Second-Generation Covid Vaccines Are Built for Impact Over SpeedAltimmune, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, plans to enter human testing with a nasal vaccine in the fourth quarter after positive studies in mice. Scientists at the University of Oxford, where a promising shot under development at AstraZeneca Plc was designed, and Imperial College London are also planning studies of slightly different inhaled vaccines.The experimental immunizations in Britain would be delivered through a mouthpiece in an aerosol, similar to some asthma therapies. Imperial researchers point to evidence that delivering influenza vaccines via a nasal spray can protect people against illness and help reduce transmission; they’re keen to explore if that’s also the case for SARS-CoV-2. AstraZeneca makes the FluMist nasal spray vaccine.Data from studies of the inhaled Oxford vaccine could come early in the new year, followed by Imperial results in the second quarter, according to Robin Shattock, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College.“We don’t know whether it will work well, but if it does, then it could be very important,” he said in an interview.Imperial College in recent months has been advancing studies of a Covid vaccine using RNA technology that would be delivered via conventional shots and plans to expand its trials to 20,000 people by year-end. Oxford, one of the front-runners in the global quest for an inoculation, is in the final stage of tests for a shot that uses a harmless virus to carry the genetic material of the pathogen into cells to generate an immune response. Both techniques may be conducive to inhalation, Shattock said.“This is a virus that’s transmitted through your respiratory tract, so if you want a vaccine that will really prevent infection and onward transmission you want to have an antibody response in your nose, in your lungs,” Shattock said. “The most efficient way to induce that is by inoculating through that route.”Researchers in Hong Kong are aiming for an intranasal vaccine that would simultaneously offer influenza and Covid-19 protection. The first phase of human tests will start next month, said Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology.The ambition is to come up with the “vaccine of choice,” as the world looks to build on the first wave of products, he said.Questions about the durability of nasal vaccines have yet to be resolved, and they’re at an early stage. Despite the advantages, the delivery devices are also more complex, according to Nick Jackson, head of programs and technology at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.“A needle and syringe work very well,” he said.Still, researchers said targeting the airways may pay off down the road. Oslo-based CEPI has provided funding to the Hong Kong project and is open to further investments in vaccines that are taking unconventional approaches as part of an effort to supply billions of doses to every corner of the world, Jackson said.“Whether it’s our vaccine or another one that goes through an intransasal route that actually is successful at disrupting transmission and disrupting the pandemic, I take my hat off,” Diamond said. “If we contribute by compelling or nudging these companies to think about an alternative route for what may be a successful platform, then we’ve done our job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inhaled-vaccines-aim-to-fight-coronavirus-at-its-point-of-attack/story-gdobAQr3aw6MhrKMrDYN8H.html

Prime Minister Imran Khan termed it “an attempt by India to create sectarian conflict across the country,” though no immediate evidence was given that India was behind the attack.Khan is the son of late prominent scholar Maulana Saleemullah Khan, who founded the grand seminary, Jamia Farooqia, decades ago. The seminary adheres to the Sunni Muslim teachings of the Deobandi sect, whose scholars have been the target of killings in the past.Khan held a doctorate in religious studies, received training in his father’s seminary and had taught in Malaysia.Police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon said the cleric and his driver were both killed in the attack Saturday evening, which took place in the middle class neighborhood of Shah Faisal Colony.Police said that when the cleric’s vehicle stopped in front of a busy shopping area, gunmen opened fire targeting the driver before firing three bullets that struck Khan’s head, neck and chest. The three attackers then fled on the back of a shared motorcycle.Khan was rushed to a private hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival, said the hospital’s spokesperson Anjum Rizvi. Police said the driver died before reaching a government hospital.Pakistan has a history of sectarian enmity between Sunni and Shiite extremists. Attacks by both sides have claimed hundreds of lives, including those of religious scholars.Counter-terrorism police officer Raja Umar Khitab said the attack appeared to be a “conspiracy to trigger sectarian violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-cleric-murder-imran-khan-blames-india-for-triggering-sectarian-rift-but-fails-to-provide-evidence/story-A75AcWUI3ZLs2cX1hnNHdN.html

11-10-2020||World||Trump returns to campaign with WH event, says Covid-19 ‘disappearing’||US President Donald Trump returned to campaigning with a speech from the White House on Saturday, saying he was “feeling great” and the Covid-19 pandemic was “disappearing”. He is scheduled to address a rally in Florida on Monday, and in Pennsylvania and Iowa later in the week.His Democratic challenger Joe Biden was in Pennsylvania for the 11th time, wooing the battleground state that will play a critical role in deciding the election.Trump was no longer a transmission risk to others, his physician Sean Conley declared in a statement, adding the president had been without fever for 24 hours, all his symptoms had improved and there was no “longer evidence of actively replicating virus” in his body.“First of all, I’m feeling great. I don’t know about you. How’s everyone feeling? Good?” Trump said from a White House balcony overlooking his supporters who stood around below. He went on to claim the pandemic was disappearing and vaccines and therapeutics were on their way.Billed as a “peaceful protest in support of law and order,” the event marked the resumption of campaigning by the president a break forced by his illness. “We’re starting very, very big with our rallies…because we cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation,” Trump said.Trump trails Biden by 9.6 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and by 10.1 points in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average of national polls. The gap is narrower in battleground states, which eventually determine the outcome in presidential elections because of electoral college.Biden was in one of them on Saturday, making his case with a promise of jobs and unity in Pennsylvania. “My plan is about making the kinds of investments that will stimulate the economy, to get us back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before,” Biden said in Erie.He added, with a reference to a campaign event in historic Gettysburg, also in Pennsylvania, recently, “As I said earlier this week on the sacred ground of Gettysburg, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’ll govern as an American president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-returns-to-campaign-with-wh-event-says-covid-19-disappearing/story-y5rcIgOAoeHRC0HSAob0XI.html

An official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has publically pledged that an effective coronavirus vaccine may be available by the end of the year.State pharmaceutical giant China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and US-listed Sinovac Biotech are developing three of the vaccines under state’s emergency use programme while CanSino Biologics is developing the fourth.Also Read: China joins COVAX coronavirus vaccine allianceOn October 11, China also announced that it is joining the Covid-19 vaccine alliance known as COVAX. The country signed an agreement with GAVI, the co-leader of the alliance. China is joining the alliance to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. “We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,” she said, according to news agency Associated Press.As list of countries with which China has promised to share its vaccines continues to grow, scientists question whether it will be able to produce enough doses even if the vaccine is ready soon, said a report published on science journal Nature.The COVAX alliance, together with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, is aiming to provide 2 billion doses of vaccine to the most vulnerable people in poor countries, the report said, pointing out that the country’s drug regulator would need to wait till data proves that the vaccines are safe and effective before granting them full approval.Also Read: China coronavirus vaccine may be ready for public in November: Official“Until then, there are still uncertainties,” Wu Guizhen, the chief biosafety expert at CDC told Nature.According to Zheng Zhongwei, the head of the Chinese government’s Covid-19 vaccine task force, China will have capacity to produce 600 million vaccine doses by the end of the year, and one billion next year. However, since the country has a largely unvaccinated population of 1.4 billion people, there would not be many doses left for export. In addition to the mismatch of demand and supply, a problem of approval by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is persists. If China commits doses of vaccines, they would need to be approved by these organisations and currently not one of the four leading vaccine candidates are on the list of vaccines supported by the CEPI, according to the science journal report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-question-china-s-ability-to-produce-enough-covid-19-vaccine-doses-for-export/story-aGGJlSiniqt7VquDsbjRzI.html

11-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un reveals largest liquid-fuelled missile designed to carry multiple warheads: Report||The gargantuan new missile North Korea put on show at a military parade is an explicit threat to US defences and an implicit challenge to both the current and next American president, analysts say, warning Pyongyang could test the weapon next year.Leader Kim Jong Un watched the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) roll through Kim Il Sung square -- named after his grandfather -- in Pyongyang at the climax of an unprecedented night-time parade on Saturday.A consensus rapidly emerged among analysts that it was the largest road-mobile, liquid-fuelled missile anywhere in the world, and was highly likely to be designed to carry multiple warheads in independent re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies said it was “clearly aimed at overwhelming the US missile defense system in Alaska”. It was “much cheaper for North Korea to add warheads than for the US to add interceptors”, he added on Twitter.If the ICBM carried three or four warheads, he explained, the US would need to spend around $1 billion on 12-16 interceptors for each missile.“At that cost, I am pretty sure North Korea can add warheads faster than we can add interceptors.”The missile was estimated at 24 metres long and 2.5 metres in diameter, which specialist Markus Schiller said was big enough to carry 100 tonnes of fuel, which would take hours to load.It was so big and heavy that it was practically unusable, he added: “You can’t move this thing fuelled, and you can’t fill it at the launch site. “This thing makes absolutely no sense at all, except for threat equation games, like sending the message of ‘we now have a mobile ICBM with MIRVs, be very afraid’.”North Korea watchers regularly caution that the devices Pyongyang puts on show at its parades may be mock-ups or models, and there is no proof they work until they are tested.But the missile was carried on an enormous and previously unseen 11-axle transporter-erector-launcher, far larger than the eight-axle Chinese-made vehicles the North has employed so far.“The truck may be a scarier story than the missile,” said Melissa Hanham of the Open Nuclear Network. “If the DPRK is indigenously producing their own chassis, then there is less of a constraint on the number of ICBMs they can launch.”- Red lines -Shortly before being inaugurated in 2017, Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea developing a weapon capable of reaching parts of the US “won’t happen!”.He spent the first year of his presidency -- which saw the North launch an ICBM with the range to do exactly that -- in an escalating war of words with Kim before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance developed between them.But nuclear negotiations have been deadlocked since the collapse of their Hanoi summit early last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.The ICBM was proof that the North had continued to develop its arsenal throughout the diplomatic process, analysts said, and gave Pyongyang greater heft to demand a return to the negotiating table.The spectacle was aimed at the next administration, whoever headed it following next month’s presidential election, said Suzanne DiMaggio of the Carnegie Endowment.“Kim relayed -- and demonstrated -- that North Korea’s nuclear deterrent is at its strongest,” she said. “His key messages: There isn’t a viable military option against us. Deal with us on this basis.”More than 12 hours after the end of the parade broadcast on North Korean state television Trump had not yet tweeted about it -- and nor had his Democratic rival Joe Biden.Trump has made much of Kim’s promise not to carry out any further ICBM or nuclear tests, and Shin Beom-chul of the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy said that by displaying the missile rather than launching it, Pyongyang had stopped short of crossing his red lines.“But it also signals that North Korea could carry out a launch if Trump is re-elected and ignores the North Korean issue,” he told AFP, adding: “If Biden is elected and he doesn’t listen to North Korea, it will carry out a launch.”sh-slb/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-reveals-largest-liquid-fuelled-missile-designed-to-carry-multiple-warheads-report/story-AXRBApwfAWeeje43s8wGEJ.html
11-10-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases hit two-month high, 10 states report record increases||New cases of Covid-19 in the United States hit a two-month high on Friday with over 58,000 infections of the coronavirus reported and hospitalizations in the Midwest at record levels for a fifth day in a row, according to a Reuters analysis. Ten of the 50 states reported record one-day rises in cases on Friday, including the Midwestern states of Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio. Wisconsin and Illinois recorded over 3,000 new cases for a second day in a row - a two-day trend not seen even during the height of the previous outbreak in the spring, according to Reuters data. The Western states of Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming also reported their biggest one-day jumps in cases, as did Oklahoma and West Virginia.Nineteen states have seen record increases in new cases so far in October. Amid the resurgence in cases across the nation, President Donald Trump, who recently contracted Covid-19, addressed his supporters from the balcony of the White House on Saturday, a prelude to restarting his re-election campaign.He is scheduled to travel on Monday to Florida.Also Read: Trump no longer at risk of transmitting Covid-19: White House doctorTrump and his administration have faced criticism for their handling of the pandemic that has claimed over 213,000 lives in the country, as well as for a lax approach to mask-wearing and social distancing in the White House.While deaths nationally continue to trend downward, the United States is losing on average 700 lives a day. Three states reported a record one-day increase in fatalities on Friday: Arkansas, Missouri and Montana. Health experts caution that deaths are a lagging indicator and usually rise weeks after cases climb.The number of people who succumb to Covid-19 is expected to accelerate this winter.The country’s daily death rate is projected to more than triple by mid-January to 2,250, with an overall 395,000 fatalities by Feb. 1, 2021, according to a new update of the University of Washington’s widely-cited model.But if Americans increase their wearing of masks to the level seen in Singapore, the Feb. 1 death toll would drop to 316,000, saving 79,000 lives, according to the University’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, whose model has been cited by the White House Coronavirus Task Force.Currently, there is no federal mandate to wear a mask, and 17 states do not require them, according to a Reuters analysis.In addition to rising cases, hospitals in several states are straining to handle an influx of patients.Seven states on Friday reported record numbers of hospitalized Covid-19 patients: Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. In the Midwest, hospitalizations rose to nearly 9,000, continuing a streak of records that began on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-hit-two-month-high-10-states-report-record-increases/story-eSvlYPILnqoqMEFyMz2CiK.html
11-10-2020||World||‘Element of instability’: UAE on Turkish Army’s presence in Qatar||Turkey’s army in Qatar is an element of instability in the Gulf region, a senior official of the United Arab Emirates has said, adding that it contributed to negative polarisation.The UAE and its Arab allies have imposed a boycott on Qatar since mid-2017 and had demanded that Doha close a Turkish military base, among their conditions for ending the rift. Abu Dhabi and Ankara also back opposing sides in Libya’s conflict.“The Turkish military presence in the Arab Gulf is an emergency,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s state minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter on Saturday.“It reinforces polarisation, and it does not take into account the sovereignty of states and the interests of the Gulf countries and its people.”The United States, seeking a united Gulf front against Iran, has tried to resolve the row in which Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-Gulf Egypt severed political, trade and travel links with Qatar over accusations that it backs militants and is cosying up to regional foe Iran.Doha, which hosts the region’s largest U.S. military base, denies the accusations and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty.On Sept. 9, the State Department’s top diplomat for the Middle East, David Schenker, said there may be some progress in resolving the rift within weeks, citing signs of “flexibility in negotiations”, ahead of U.S. elections.Diplomats and Gulf sources have confirmed talks between Riyadh and Doha after negotiations that broke down early this year, but there have been no signs yet of a breakthrough.In a recent documentary on Al Jazeera television, Qatar’s state minister for defence accused boycotting nations of having planned to invade Qatar, a charge they have denied in the past.Riyadh’s former intelligence chief, in televised remarks this month, described Qatar as a “tick on a camel”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-official-says-turkey-s-army-in-qatar-destabilises-region/story-yQvyDMjrFJKCoesQnHI4FN.html

Police say they are investigating.The bus passengers were traveling from Samut Prakan province to a Buddhist temple in Chachoengsao for a merit-making ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/17-dead-as-bus-collides-with-train-in-thailand-s-chacheongsao/story-IH39q90ncri7PuGh3LbpML.html
11-10-2020||World||Pakistan opposition parties accuse army of meddling with polls||For the first time, Pakistan’s two major Opposition parties have come out openly against the country’s powerful military, accusing it of rigging the 2018 elections that brought Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party to power. In the past, political leaders have only indirectly pointed to the involvement of the military establishment in the country’s political affairs but this is the first time that the leaders of the two main Opposition parties -- the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) have openly criticised the military. Former prime minister and PML-N supremo Sharif, who is in London since November last year and facing a number of corruption cases, fired the first salvo at the inaugural meeting of the Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance formed by Opposition parties last month to oust Prime Minister Khan. Sharif alleged that the military rigged the 2018 elections to bring Prime Minister Khan to power. He said interfering in politics in uniform amounts to treason under the country’s Constitution. His allegations sparked an angry response from Khan, who said Sharif was “playing a very dangerous game” by humiliating the military and intelligence services. He dismissed the allegations of rigged elections as baseless. Sharif served as Pakistan’s prime minister three times, first removed by a president in 1993, then by military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 1999. A court in 2017 ousted him from power over corruption allegations. Khan, a former cricketer, came to power in 2018. After Sharif, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday accused the military of rigging the 2018 elections. Bilawal warned that any interference in the coming legislative assembly elections in Gilgit-Baltistan would lead to a strong reaction from his party, including a siege of Islamabad and a sit-in in the city. “Such things were never witnessed even in dictatorships of General Zia and Gen Musharraf,” Bilawal was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper. “I wonder how you deploy a soldier inside and another outside the polling station. That was so strange. Even if you (military establishment) have done something wrong or not, you would be blamed either way. This should not happen,” he said. He said the “PPP would not allow anyone to steal the peoples mandate in the coming elections in Gilgit-Baltistan.” Pakistan has announced that the once-postponed election for the legislative assembly of Gilgit-Baltistan will be held on November 15, amidst India’s strong objection to Islamabad’s move to alter the status of the militarily-occupied region. India also clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country. Pakistan’s military top brasses have in recent times advised political parties to stop dragging them into politics and making baseless accusations against them. Prime Minister Khan on Friday said the Opposition’s real issue with the military is that they remained unable to control the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) unlike other institutions after the agency found out about their corruption. On September 20, the leaders of 11 major Opposition parties formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to launch a three-phased anti-government movement under an “action plan” starting with countrywide public meetings, protest demonstrations and rallies before a “decisive long march” towards Islamabad in January 2021. The Opposition parties will hold their first combined rally against the Imran Khan-led government on October 16 in Gujranwala city in Punjab province, demanding to oust the “selected” prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the powerful military in the country’s politics. The Opposition leaders had announced that they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek “the selected prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the establishment in politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-parties-accuse-army-of-meddling-with-polls/story-Ab1QB6iYwiHgerzmdiLUyM.html
11-10-2020||World||Brazil reaches 150,000 deaths from Covid-19 milestone||Brazil’s count of Covid-19 deaths surpassed 150,000 on Saturday night, despite signs the pandemic is slowly retreating in Latin America’s largest nation.The Brazilian Health Ministry reported that the death toll now stands at 150,198. The figure is the world’s second highest behind the United States, according to the tally maintained by John Hopkins University.The milestone has rekindled the pain of Naiane Moura, a sales consultant, who lost her father Elivaldo to Covid-19 in April. The 58-year-old postman had no prior illness and battled Covid-19 for seven days in a public hospital in Manaus, Brazil’s largest city in the Amazon.“When I see 150,000, I see my father alongside many other faceless bodies,” Moura said by phone. “I didn’t imagine that we would reach that number. I don’t believe that we will ever be able to totally overcome this.” Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro played down the severity of the virus while deaths mounted rapidly in Brazil. The 65-year-old president flouted social distancing at lively demonstrations and encouraged crowds during outings from the presidential residence.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBolsonaro rejected governors’ and mayors’ lockdowns and other tough measures to contain the virus’ spread, even after he contracted it himself in July, and insisted that shutting down Brazil’s economy would pitch the nation into chaos.“Life goes on. Brazil needs to produce,” he said on July 7 in Brasilia when he announced he was infected.Moura’s hometown of Manaus became a horror show early on in the pandemic. Between April and May, the health system collapsed in the city as patients were turned away from full hospitals and overwhelmed cemeteries were forced to dig mass graves. The capital of Amazonas state has had 122 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, far above the national average of 71 per 100,000. The nation of 210 million people surpassed 5 million confirmed infections on Wednesday, according to official data.There have been recent signs of relief in Brazil. Over the last month and a half, the viral curve has dropped. The average number of deaths sat at 598 over the last seven days, the lowest level since the beginning of May.The mayors of large cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro continue to reopen activities like cinemas and schools, even as public health experts warn of possible new outbreaks.Manaus, where restrictions were relaxed, registered an increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks that led to speculation of a possible second wave. Local authorities reinstituted restrictions on commerce and activity, and shut down the riverside beach.Moura said she holds federal authorities responsible for the massive death toll.“A lot of lives could have been saved if our leaders had taken rigorous measures in the beginning,” she said.Bolsonaro has faced fierce criticism of his handling of the health crisis, and changed health ministers twice in the midst of the pandemic.Yet his popularity is at its highest since he took office in January 2019, which political analysts attribute to his distribution of emergency cash to help tens of millions of poorer Brazilians withstand the economic downturn.Some 40 per cent of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Ibope rate their government as good or excellent, according to a poll published on September 24 that has a margin for error of two percentage points. “Bolsonaro helped the population to open their eyes. Health has to go hand in hand with the economy,” said Paulo Gomes, 54, a taxi driver who supports Bolsonaro.In Sao Paulo, Ricardo Vieira, a doctor working in one of the city’s largest working-class neighbourhoods known as favelas, said the government’s Covid-19 cash transfer program wasn’t enough to shield the poor, who often have scarce access to healthcare.To remedy the lack of support in the Paraisopolis favela, an NGO called G10 hired three private ambulances and eight health professionals, among them Dr Vieira, who has been there since March.“We are dealing with lives, and when we came to a poor community we saw that the government cannot reach these people.” Vieira told The Associated Press.Despite the difficulties and the lack of resources, Vieira continues to fight to contain the pandemic’s devastation.“I do what I can, I do my best,” Vieira said, as tears welled up then rolled down his cheek. “And I don’t know what else I could do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-reaches-150-000-deaths-from-covid-19-milestone/story-sbALp8LwIV5bOZIxMKmQhN.html
11-10-2020||World||Trump no longer at risk of transmitting Covid-19: White House doctor||President Donald Trump’s doctor said Saturday the president is no longer at risk of transmitting the coronavirus.In a memo, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley says Trump meets the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation and that by “currently recognized standards” he is no longer considered a transmission risk.The memo follows Trump’s first public appearance since returning to the White House after being treated for the coronavirus. Hundreds of people gathered Saturday afternoon on the South Lawn for a Trump address on his support for law enforcement from a White House balcony.Trump took off a mask moments after he emerged on the balcony to address the crowd on the lawn below, his first step back onto the public stage with just more than three weeks to go until Election Day. He flouted, once more, the safety recommendations of his own government just days after acknowledging that he was on the brink of “bad things” from the virus and claiming that his bout with the illness brought him a better understanding of it.Also Read | Donald Trump makes first public appearance since hospital release; White House won’t say if he’s still contagious with coronavirusHis return was a brief one. With bandages visible on his hands, likely from an intravenous injection, Trump spoke for 18 minutes, far less than at his normal hour-plus rallies. He appeared healthy, if perhaps a little hoarse, as he delivered what was, for all intents and purposes, a short version of his campaign speech despite the executive mansion setting.Though billed as an official event, Trump offered no policy proposals and instead delivered the usual attacks on Democrat Joe Biden while praising law enforcement to a crowd of several hundred, most of whom wore masks while few adhered to social distancing guidelines.“I’m feeling great,” said Trump, who said he was thankful for their good wishes and prayers as he recovered. He then declared that the pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans, was “disappearing” even though he is still recovering from the virus.In either an act of defiance or simply tempting fate, officials organized the crowd just steps from the Rose Garden, where exactly two weeks ago the president held another large gathering to formally announce his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. That event is now being eyed as a possible Covid-19 superspreader as more than two dozen people in attendance have contracted the virus.Trump had hoped to hold campaign rallies this weekend but settled for the White House event. But even as his health remained unclear, he planned to ramp up his travel with a rally in Florida on Monday, followed by trips to Pennsylvania and Iowa on subsequent days. It was not clear if Trump posed a risk to those he would fly with on Air Force One or encounter at the rally sites.Before the speech, White House officials said they had no information to release on whether the president was tested for Covid-19, meaning he made his first public appearance without the White House verifying that he’s no longer contagious.Security was stepped up around the White House before the event, which was called a “peaceful protest for law & order” and predominantly attended by Black and Latino supporters. Police and the Secret Service closed surrounding streets to vehicles and shut down Lafayette Square, the park near the White House that has long been a gathering place for public protest.As questions linger about his health — and Democratic opponent Joe Biden steps up his own campaigning — Trump has more frequently called into radio and TV programs to speak with conservative interviewers, hoping to make up for lost time with just over three weeks until Election Day and millions already voting.Biden’s campaign said he again tested negative on Saturday for Covid19. Biden was potentially exposed to the coronavirus during his Sept. 29 debate with Trump, who announced his positive diagnosis barely 48 hours after the debate.The president had not been seen in public — other than in White House-produced videos — since his return five days ago from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he received experimental treatments for the coronavirus.On Saturday, all attendees were required to bring masks or were provided with them, and were given temperature checks and asked to fill out a brief questionnaire. Some in the crowd removed their mask to listen to Trump.Trump’s Monday event in Sanford, Florida, what he’s described as a “BIG RALLY,” was originally scheduled to be held on Oct. 2, the day after he tested positive. Ahead of his Saturday event, Trump used Twitter to share news articles about problems with mail-in ballots in New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that universal mail-in voting is beset by widespread fraud.Trump’s return to public activity came as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, cautioned the White House again to avoid large-scale gatherings of people without masks.He said of the Barrett event in an interview with The Associated Press, “I was not surprised to see a superspreader event given the circumstances.” That means “crowded, congregate setting, not wearing masks. It is not surprising to see an outbreak,” he said.District of Columbia virus restrictions prohibit outdoor gatherings larger than 50 people, although that rule has not been strictly enforced. Masks are mandatory outdoors for most people, but the regulations don’t apply on federal land, and the Trump White House has openly flouted them for months.Confined to the White House as he recovers, Trump spent sizable chunks of the past few days making the rounds of friendly conservative media, calling in to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night and spending two hours live on air with radio host Rush Limbaugh on Friday in what his campaign billed as a “radio rally.”Holding court on his reelection battle, his fight against the coronavirus and revived negotiations with Democrats to pass an economic stimulus bill, Trump made a direct appeal to his base of loyal supporters, whom he needs to turn out to the polls in droves.In a Friday night interview on Fox’s Tucker Carlson’s show, Trump was asked if he has been retested for Covid-19. “I have been retested, and I haven’t even found out numbers or anything yet. But I’ve been retested, and I know I’m at either the bottom of the scale or free,” he said.White House officials, however, have declined to answer when Trump last tested negative for the virus before his diagnosis or release detailed information about lung scans taken while Trump was hospitalized.Aides to the president insist that it is safe for Trump to return to his regular activities, including campaigning. CDC guidelines call for the infected to wait at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms, Fauci noted in the AP interview. That onset for Trump was Oct. 1, according to his doctors.Conley added that Trump was showing no evidence of his illness progressing or adverse reactions to the aggressive course of therapy he has received.While reports of reinfection in Covid-19 victims are rare, the CDC recommends that even people who recover from the disease continue to wear masks, stay distanced and follow other precautions. It was unclear if Trump, who has refused mask wearing in most settings, would abide by that guidance as he resumes his campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-no-longer-at-risk-of-transmitting-covid-19-white-house-doctor/story-YXlgzcLBNUiTRoZmC3omUL.html

She positioned three trash cans over her bed to catch the water.“We were debating whether to leave or not but my husband has got orthopedic issues and I do too and we’re just too exhausted to even get up and evacuate,” Pastrano said. “Last night it was terrifying, the whistling and whistling.”Delta brought widespread flooding of streets and riverbanks, mostly in southwestern Louisiana, tracking the path of destruction left by Laura but causing damage over a larger swath of the Gulf Coast.“Even if it wasn’t quite as powerful as Hurricane Laura, it was much bigger,” Governor John Bel Edwards told a briefing in Baton Rouge.Some 3,000 National Guard troops had been called up to distribute relief supplies, clear roads, maintain security and conduct search and rescue operations, the governor said.600,000 WITHOUT POWERWhile no deaths have so far been linked to Delta, Edwards said storm-related fatalities often occur in accidents such as falls, during clean-up operations, or from carbon monoxide poisoning from residents using home generators.About 600,000 of the state’s electric customers, 25% of the total, were without power at midday, Edwards said. But restoration was progressing faster than it did after Laura because Delta’s winds were less damaging to the infrastructure, he said.Also Read: With whipping winds, Delta drenches Louisiana, MississippiLaura’s winds damaged tens of thousands of homes, leaving roofs across the region dotted with blue tarpaulins. More than 6,000 people were still living temporarily in hotels when Delta struck.Delta spared many of the rooftop tarps that were still up, but deluged some streets and littered others with downed trees and branches.“Laura was much worse,” said Lake Charles resident Matthew Williams, 49. “This was more rain than wind.”Williams, who had just gotten his power back about a week and a half ago after the outage left by Laura, said he rode out the storm at his home.With the sun shining brightly, Frederick Hannie, 35, surveyed the water damage to his gym, CrossFit Lake Charles, which had already sustained wind and roof damage from Laura.Between two hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic, Hannie said, “it definitely takes a little financial gymnastics” to run a business this year.As Delta made its way over the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, energy companies cut back US oil production by about 92%, or 1.7 million barrels per day - the most since 2005’s Hurricane Katrina.While the storm is expected to continue weakening, it is forecast to bring rain though Tennessee, Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley through early next week.Delta was the tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season to make US landfall this year, eclipsing a record dating to 1916.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-leaves-louisianans-reeling-and-out-of-power-as-the-clean-up-begins/story-OgOfaWmG4X4Nz0Xylpw73L.html

11-10-2020||World||28 arrested, tear gas used in Wisconsin protests||Police used tear gas on demonstrators and arrested 28 people during a third straight night of protests over the lack of charges against a suburban Milwaukee police officer who fatally shot a Black teen, authorities said, as they took to Twitter on Saturday to outline what they called an “escalation in force by the protesters.”About 100 people gathered outside City Hall on Friday past Wauwatosa’s 7 p.m. curfew and refused multiple orders to disperse, according to police. Police said they used tear gas on the crowd, after bottles were thrown at officers.On Saturday, the Wauwatosa Police Department posted on Twitter that people have been asking valid questions about the police response over three nights of protests. Police posted a picture of bottles they said were found in a backpack, including a bottle of lighter fluid, noting that the materials can be used to start fires.Also Read | Alvin Cole killing: No charges for Wisconsin police officer“Over the past three nights, we have seen an escalation in force by the protesters. Our law enforcement response is in reaction to this escalation,” police tweeted. They said that on Friday night, protestors had Molotov cocktails and other fire starting supplies and guns were spotted in the crowd.Protesters have gathered every day since prosecutors announced Wednesday that they would not charge Officer Joseph Mensah in 17-year-old Alvin Cole’s death. Mensah, who is Black, shot Cole after a foot chase outside a Wauwatosa mall in February.The police department’s tweets come as some have chastised authorities for the way they have handled the protests. During Thursday night’s demonstration, police arrested Alvin Cole’s mother, Tracy Cole, and his sisters. Family attorney Kimberly Motley criticized the way police treated the family, noting Tracy Cole had to be treated for injuries.In a tweet addressing the police chief and mayor on Friday, Motley said “due to your failed leadership you have turned Wauwatosa into a war zone!’About an hour after Friday’s curfew went into effect, law enforcement began advancing toward the crowd. Police said they used chemical irritants, which they described as tear gas, as well as pepper balls and paint balls after bottles and rocks were thrown at them. Video posted to Twitter by local reporters showed heavy smoke in the air as police advanced, and multiple people taken into custody.Windows were broken at a Snap Fitness center, police said.Police said two of Friday’s 28 arrests were for felonies, one was for a misdemeanor and 25 were for municipal citations. Police noted that some of the people arrested were blocking traffic, others had tried to start fires, and one person had materials to start a fire. Another person in the group posted a picture of himself with a handgun, authorities added, though it was not clear if he was among those arrested.Two people arrested were evaluated for minor injuries, police said.One of the arrestees was driving in one of three vehicles that had come to the Wauwatosa Police Department early Saturday. The vehicle almost hit an officer, according to police. The driver got into a second vehicle, and police arrested the person after a short chase, authorities said.“We can appreciate the anger and frustration that exists among those closely affected by recent events,” police said in a statement Saturday. They asked people to continue to comply with the 7 p.m. curfew, which was to be in effect again on Saturday and Sunday nights. The National Guard is assisting local police.The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck as Floyd gasped that he couldn’t breathe.The co-founder and publisher of The Daily Caller said two of his reporters were beaten and detained by police in Wauwatosa on Thursday as they were videotaping Tracy Cole’s arrest. Numerous journalists have been injured or arrested while covering protests nationwide in recent months.Neil Patel, who founded the conservative news outlet with Tucker Carlson, said in a statement that reporters Shelby Talcott and Richie McGinniss “were brutally beaten with clubs for no reason,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.A message seeking comment from the Wauwatosa Police Department was not immediately returned to The Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/28-arrested-tear-gas-used-in-wisconsin-protests/story-eMsZifGjLKbAjzOy3u83WL.html
11-10-2020||World||US slams China’s LAC deployment||China has sent 60,000 troops near India’s northern border, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said while citing a previously unreported number as he sharply criticised Beijing for its “bad behaviour” and threats it posed to the Quad nations, a remark that comes amid heightened tensions between India and its neighbour over a standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group – India, the US, Japan and Australia – met in Tokyo on Tuesday in first such talks since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic began earlier this year. Members of the Quad pushed for a rules-based global order and peaceful resolution of disputes in the face of China’s growing aggression across the Indo-Pacific.“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo told The Guy Benson Show in an interview on Friday after returning from Tokyo. He also commended India for “diplomatically” pushing back by banning Chinese apps and ending government procurements of supplies made in China. “I was with my foreign minister counterparts from India, Australia, and Japan – a format that we call the Quad, four big democracies, four powerful economies, four nations, each of whom has real risk associated with the threats imposed – attempting to be imposed by the Chinese Communist Party. And they see it in their home countries, too,” he said.Pompeo said US President Donald Trump vowed “to take seriously the threat from General Secretary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, and we’re no longer going to allow them to run around cost-free and impose their vision for the future upon the West”. He also criticised China’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its telecommunication infrastructure, and said the country steals intellectual property. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials on Pompeo’s latest remarks on Chinese troop deployment.Against the backdrop of the five-month border standoff with China, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in his opening remarks at the Tokyo meet that India and the other members of Quad remain committed to a rules-based international order, “underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes”. At the meet, Pompeo said it was critical for partners in the Quad to collaborate to “protect our people and partners from the [Chinese Communist Party]’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion” that had been witnessed in the South and East China Sea, “the Mekong, the Himalayas [and] the Taiwan Straits”. Tensions have spiked on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake, where troops from the two sides are within close range of each other and where there have been several instances of firing since late August. Sharp divergences remained between the two countries even after they framed a five-point roadmap for easing tensions on the disputed border and speeding up the disengagement of troops.Pompeo met Jaishankar and they underscored the need to work together to advance, peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. He described his meeting with Jaishankar as “productive.” “They see, the people of their (Quad) nations understanding that we all slept on this for too long. For decades, the West allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us. The previous administration bent a knee, too often allowed China to steal our intellectual properties and the millions of jobs that came along with it. They see that in their country too,” he said in the interview. The US secretary of state spoke of the India-China conflict along with other issues in a string of interviews that were the first since he travelled to Japan for the meeting of the ministers of the Quad.Underscoring the need for America to be engaged in the region and to stand with allies and friends, the US secretary of state said on the Larry O’Connor show: “They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight. But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India – right? – the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north.”On the Hugh Hewitt show, Pompeo spoke of India’s pushback. “The Indians have banned dozens and dozens of Chinese apps, and the Indians have stopped having their government purchase any product from China. That’s remarkable. It’s work that has been done diplomatically, and then there’s the security issues too.” The US, which has since banned several Chinese apps, has strongly condemned Chinese aggression along the Indian border, and has been supportive of New Delhi.In an interview to Fox News, Pompeo said the US has begun to build out all the edifice of the structure and the allies and the coalition to push back against China. “Look, they’ve stacked 60,000 soldiers against the Indians in the north. When the Australians had the temerity to ask for an investigation of the Wuhan virus... something that we know a lot about, the Chinese Communist Party threatened them. They bullied them,” Pompeo said. With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slams-china-s-lac-deployment/story-6Si2if2ixqWEgnGL0WGdfM.html
11-10-2020||World||Five things to know about court nominee Amy Coney Barrett||Confirmation hearings begin Monday for President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. If confirmed, the 48-year-old appeals court judge would fill the seat of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month.Ginsburg’s replacement by Barrett, a conservative, would shift the balance on the court significantly right, from 5-4 in favor of conservatives to 6-3. Here are 5 things to know about her:EDUCATION:Barrett was born in Louisiana and attended Rhodes College, a liberal arts school in Memphis, Tennessee, as an undergraduate. She went to law school in Indiana, at Notre Dame, on a full scholarship. She’d be the only justice on the current court not to have attended either Harvard or Yale for law school.Barrett was a law professor at Notre Dame for 15 years before Trump nominated her to become a federal appeals court judge in 2017.JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY:Barret has said that her judicial philosophy is the same as that of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whom she worked for after law school and has called a mentor. Scalia described himself as an “originalist,” interpreting laws and the Constitution based on what they were understood to mean when they were written.“Judges must apply the law as written,” Barrett said when she spoke at the announcement of her nomination in the White House Rose Garden last month. “Judges are not policymakers.”RECORD:Barrett’s short tenure as a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has led to few noteworthy or controversial opinions. She has, however, signed onto several decisions that she is sure to be questioned about during her confirmation hearing.In 2018, a three-judge panel ruled that Indiana laws requiring that funerals be held for fetal remains after an abortion or miscarriage and banning abortions because of the sex, race or developmental disability of a fetus were unconstitutional.Barrett was among four judges who wanted the full court to weigh in and suggested that the laws might be constitutional. And last year, after a three-judge panel blocked an Indiana law that would make it harder for a minor to have an abortion without her parents being notified, Barrett voted to have the case reheard by the full court.In a dissent in a 2019 gun-rights case, Barrett argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony shouldn’t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun. Also in 2019 Barrett wrote a unanimous three-judge panel decision making it easier for men alleged to have committed sexual assaults on campus to challenge the proceedings against them.FAITH:Barrett would be the seventh member of the court either to be Catholic or have been raised Catholic. But she’s been somewhat more vocal about her faith than other members, and faith became a flashpoint during her confirmation to be an appeals court judge.At Notre Dame, a Catholic university, Barrett was a member of University Faculty for Life. And in 2006 she signed her name to a newspaper ad sponsored by an anti-abortion group in which she said she opposed “abortion on demand” and defended “the right to life from fertilization to the end of natural life.” Barrett’s membership in a Christian group called People of Praise has also drawn scrutiny, as has a law review article she co-authored decades ago that concluded that Catholic judges are “morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty.”At Barrett’s 2017 confirmation hearing, Democrats questioned whether her personal views would color her legal judgment, especially with respect to the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at one point told Barrett she was concerned “that the dogma lives loudly within you.” That remark prompted an outcry from Catholic leaders.FAMILY:Barrett has joked that the president asked her to be the ninth justice and that she’s used to being in a group of nine: her family.“While I am a judge I’m better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver and birthday party planner,” Barrett said in September.Barrett and her husband, Jesse, a lawyer, are the parents of seven children: Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet, and Benjamin. Vivian and John Peter are adopted and were born in Haiti. And Benjamin, their youngest child, has Down syndrome. Barrett has said that Benjamin’s “brothers and sisters unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-things-to-know-about-court-nominee-amy-coney-barrett/story-KmA0hAeyJbwCQf08lyjR0I.html
11-10-2020||World||White House coronavirus aid offer is panned by Pelosi, Senate GOP||A new White House coronavirus aid offer got bad reviews from both ends of the political spectrum on Saturday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., rejected the most generous Trump administration plan to date as “one step forward, two steps back.” The Republicans who control the Senate dismissed it as too expensive and a political loser for conservatives.Pelosi said she is still hopeful that progress can be made toward a deal but it’s as clear as ever that GOP conservatives don’t want a deal on her terms.The White House had boosted its offer before Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke on Friday afternoon. President Donald Trump is eager for an agreement before Election Day, even as his most powerful GOP ally in the Senate said Congress is unlikely to deliver relief by then.“Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!” Trump said Friday on Twitter.The new offer totals about $1.8 trillion, aides familiar with it said, with a key state and local fiscal relief component moving from $250 billion to at least $300 billion. The White House says its most recent offer before that was about $1.6 trillion. The aides were not authorized to publicly discuss private negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity.Pelosi’s most recent public offer was about $2.2 trillion, though that included a business tax increase that Republicans won’t go for.In a letter Saturday to colleagues, Pelosi said, “This proposal amounted to one step forward, two steps back. When the president talks about wanting a bigger relief package, his proposal appears to mean that he wants more money at his discretion to grant or withhold.”She said that while his administration attempted to address some of the Democratic concerns, disagreement remained on many priorities and Democrats are “awaiting language” on several provisions.“Despite these unaddressed concerns, I remain hopeful that yesterday’s developments will move us closer to an agreement on a relief package that addresses the health and economic crisis facing America’s families,” Pelosi’s letter said.Mnuchin’s latest offer also got a roasting from GOP senators, who weighed in on a conference call Saturday morning, according to a Republican familiar with the call who was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Many conservatives are skeptical of so much deficit-financed aid in the first place, and Pelosi-sought provisions such as expanding eligibility for the Affordable Care Act landed with a thud.Pragmatists such as Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio and politically endangered Republicans including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina appear willing to “go big” as Trump wants. But rank-and-file Republicans — Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Rick Scott of Florida, and John Barrasso of Wyoming, for example — are adamantly opposed to another relief bill that’s so generous.GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remains skeptical of the chances for an agreement, having told an audience in Kentucky on Friday that he didn’t see a deal coming together before Election Day.“I think it’s unlikely in the next three weeks,” McConnell said Friday. He said later that “the first item of priority of the Senate is the Supreme Court,” suggesting there isn’t time to process both a relief bill and the high court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the Nov. 3 election.President Donald Trump has been all over the map, first as one of the forces in favor of a deal, then killing the talks on Tuesday, only to revive them by weeks’ end.On Tuesday, he ordered an end to the weekslong talks after being told that few Republicans in Congress would end up voting for a possible Pelosi-Mnuchin deal. Now, after a political beating, Trump is pressing hard for a deal, motivated by the prospect of sending $1,200 direct payments to voters before November.It’s clear from Saturday’s Senate GOP conference call that the skepticism or outright opposition hasn’t changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-coronavirus-aid-offer-is-panned-by-pelosi-senate-gop/story-eA4qgECtUlBg5q92jVgxOJ.html
11-10-2020||World||Dr Anthony Fauci calls White House event ‘superspreader’; Donald Trump to resume campaigning||Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious-disease expert in the US, said on Friday that an event hosted by the White House last month was a “superspreader” as a number of attendees tested positive for Covid-19, including some US senators and members of President Donald Trump’s staff and campaign team.The US president and first lady Melania Trump, who had attended the event, also tested positive for the coronavirus disease, but their infections were not traced back to the White House event held on September 26. At least 34 members of the White House staff and contacts have so far been infected, according to multiple news reports.“I think the data speak for themselves,” Dr Fauci said in an interview on CBS News on Friday. “We had a superspreader event in the White House, and it was in a situation where people were crowded together and were not wearing masks. So the data speak for themselves.”Fauci’s characterising of the event as a “superspreader event” came on the day the White House announced Trump’s return to election campaigning with a speech from the White House scheduled for later on Saturday and a rally in Florida on Monday.Meanwhile, the second presidential debate between Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, scheduled for October 15, has been cancelled by the independent body that conducts the debates. It had earlier announced that the debate would be held virtually, which was rejected by the US president who had demanded that it should be held in-person but later. Dr Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who has not hesitated to call out the Trump administration’s missteps in combating the Covid-19 pandemic, was referring to a Rose Garden event hosted by the White House on September 26 for the US president to announce judge Amy Coney Barrett as his pick for the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Among attendees of the September 26 event who went on to test positive for Covid-19 were Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped the US president prepare for his debate with Biden, Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis, Trump’s spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, adviser Stephen Miller and former adviser Kellyanne Conway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dr-anthony-fauci-calls-white-house-event-superspreader-donald-trump-to-resume-campaigning/story-oFKrIuF8SW9zBBAG5wKVcK.html
11-10-2020||World||Indian-origin academician Srikant Datar named dean of Harvard Business School||Srikant M Datar, an alumnus of Mumbai University and IIM Ahmedabad, has been named the new dean of Harvard University’s business school.Datar will succeed Nitin Nohria, another Indian-American, and will be the second dean of Indian origin at Harvard University, with Rakesh Khurana, who heads Harvard College.“Srikant Datar is an innovative educator, a distinguished scholar and a deeply experienced academic leader,” Harvard University president Lawrence Bacow said while announcing the appointment on Friday, as cited in a post on the Harvard Business School’s (HBS) website. “He is a leading thinker about the future of business education, and he has recently played an essential role in HBS’s creative response to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.”Datar will be the 11th dean of the prestigious school. He joined the HBS faculty in 1996 after teaching stints at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford. He started his higher education at University of Mumbai - it was called University of Bombay at that time - and his next stop was the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad.“I am humbled and honoured to take on this role,” said Datar. “Harvard Business School is an institution with a remarkable legacy of impact in research, education and practice. Yet, the events of the past year have hastened our passage to an unforeseen future. I look forward to working with colleagues and friends of the School - including throughout Harvard, in our Boston community, and around the world - to realise our mission in what undoubtedly will be an exciting new era.”Nohria, who also studied in Mumbai, had been HBS dean for more than 10 years, starting in 2010. Nohria had announced plans to step down last November, but stayed on in view of the pandemic.“Srikant is an outstanding choice as Harvard Business School’s next dean,” Nohria said. “He has thought deeply about the challenges and opportunities facing management education, and has a proven record of collaboration, innovation and leadership - not only within HBS, but across Harvard and at other organisations.”The HBS post called Datar “a prominent thinker and innovator” on the future of business education. He has co-authored Rethinking the MBA: Business Education at a Crossroads, and has developed courses on “Developing Mindsets for Innovative Problem Solving” and “Managing with Data Science”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-academician-srikant-datar-named-dean-of-harvard-business-school/story-IRgDILe2kBu2nUQV4N4oSJ.html
11-10-2020||World||China has deployed 60,000 troops on India’s northern border: Mike Pompeo||US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Friday said China was amassing “huge forces” along the border with India and had already deployed 60,000 troops there, citing a previously unreported number that significantly scaled up the magnitude of the threat.He also commended India for “diplomatically” pushing back by banning Chinese apps and ending government procurement of supplies made in China.The US secretary of state spoke of the India-China conflict along with other issues in a string of interviews since he travelled to Japan for a meeting of the ministers of the Quad - an informal group comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia.Pompeo and India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar also met separately on the sidelines of the meeting.“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo said on The Guy Benson Show and added in a separate interview with Larry O’Connor, “The Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north.”The top American diplomat mentioned the size of the existing Chinese deployment of 60,000 troops along the border with India in several of the interviews as he spoke broadly of the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the world – touching upon issues ranging from security to health, including the Covid-19 pandemic.“A million people now dead because the Chinese Communist Party didn’t respond to the Wuhan virus in a way that they should have. Economies destroyed as a direct result of that,” Pompeo said on The Guy Benson Show.“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border. The Australians saw that, and when they had the temerity to simply ask for an investigation about the virus, the Chinese began to exert economic power against them to try to coerce and bully them.”Underscoring the need for America to be engaged in the region and stand with allies and friends, the US secretary of state said on the Larry O’Connor Show, “They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight. But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India - right? - the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north.”On the Hugh Hewitt Show, Pompeo spoke admiringly of India’s pushback. “The Indians have banned dozens and dozens of Chinese apps, and the Indians have stopped having their government purchase any product from China.

11-10-2020||World||Judge throws out Donald Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania lawsuit||A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Saturday threw out a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign, dismissing its challenges to the battleground state’s poll-watching law and its efforts to limit how mail-in ballots can be collected and which of them can be counted.The ruling by US District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan — who was appointed by Trump — in Pittsburgh also poured cold water on Trump’s claims that election fraud will work against him.Trump’s campaign said it would appeal at least one element of the decision, with barely three weeks to go until Election Day in a state hotly contested by Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.The lawsuit was opposed by the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, the state Democratic Party, the League of Women Voters, the NAACP’s Pennsylvania office and other allied groups.“The court’s decision today affirms what we’ve long known, that Pennsylvania’s elections are safe, secure, and accurate, and residents can vote on Nov. 3rd with confidence that their votes will be counted and their voices heard,” Wolf’s office said in a statement. “The ruling is a complete rejection of the continued misinformation about voter fraud and corruption, and those who seek to sow chaos and discord ahead of the upcoming election.”However, Trump’s campaign said in a statement that it looked forward to a quick decision from the appeals court “that will further protect Pennsylvania voters from the Democrats’ radical voting system.”The lawsuit is one of many partisan battles being fought in the state Legislature and the courts over mail-in voting in Pennsylvania, amid concerns that a presidential election result will hang in limbo for days on a drawn-out vote count in Pennsylvania.In this case, Trump’s campaign wanted the court to bar counties from using drop boxes or mobile sites to collect mail-in ballots that are not “staffed, secured, and employed consistently within and across all 67 of Pennsylvania’s counties.” Trump’s campaign said it would appeal the matter of drop boxes.More than 20 counties — including Philadelphia and most other heavily populated Democratic-leaning counties — have told the state elections office that they plan to use drop boxes and satellite election offices to help collect the massive number of mail-in ballots they expect to receive.Trump’s campaign also wanted the court to free county election officials to disqualify mail-in ballots where the voter’s signature may not match their signature on file and to remove a county residency requirement in state law for certified poll watchers.In guidance last month, Wolf’s top elections official told counties that state law does not require or permit them to reject a mail-in ballot solely over a perceived signature inconsistency. Trump’s campaign had asked Ranjan to declare that guidance unconstitutional and to block counties from following it.In throwing out the case, Ranjan wrote that the Trump campaign could not prove their central claim: that Trump’s fortunes in the Nov. 3 election in Pennsylvania are threatened by election fraud and that adopting the changes the campaign sought changes will fix that.Ranjan wrote Trump’s campaign could not prove that the president has been hurt by election fraud or even that he is likely to be hurt by fraud.“While plaintiffs may not need to prove actual voter fraud, they must at least prove that such fraud is ‘certainly impending,’” Ranjan wrote. “They haven’t met that burden. At most, they have pieced together a sequence of uncertain assumptions.”Ranjan also cited decisions in recent days by the US Supreme Court and the 11th Circuit US Court of Appeals in hot-button election cases, saying he should not second-guess decisions by state lawmakers and election officials.The decision comes as Trump claims he can only lose the state if Democrats cheat and, as he did in 2016′s campaign, suggests that the Democratic bastion of Philadelphia needs to be watched closely for election fraud. On Friday, Trump’s campaign lost a bid in a Philadelphia court to force the city to allow campaign representatives to monitor its satellite election offices.Democrats counter that Trump is running on the conspiracy of election fraud because he cannot run on his record of fraud and mismanagement. They also accuse Trump of trying to scuttle some of the 3 million or more mail-in votes that are expected in the November 3 election in Pennsylvania, with Democrats applying for mail-in ballots by an almost three-to-one rate over Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-throws-out-donald-trump-campaign-s-pennsylvania-lawsuit/story-oNaN4Nyb47e2iKIlM1vegK.html
11-10-2020||World||Donald Trump makes first public appearance after hospital release; White House won’t say if he’s still contagious with coronavirus||President Donald Trump made his first public appearance on Saturday since returning from a three-day coronavirus hospitalization, telling supporters assembled on the White House’s South Lawn that “through the power of American science and medicine, we will eradicate the China Virus once and for all.”“I want to thank you all for the prayers,” Trump said from a White House balcony before hundreds of invited guests.The appearance was designed to show the president has recovered from Covid-19 and is ready to resume work and his race against Democratic nominee Joe Biden. But the president appeared without certification from his doctors that he’s no longer contagious with the deadly virus, and despite the White House not releasing a formal update on his recovery since Thursday.Still, the president sat for at least three hours of radio and remote television interviews with conservative media personalities on Friday, and is expected to resume a heavy campaign travel schedule this week with rallies in Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa. Trump has been itching to return to public events following his battle with the coronavirus, aides say -- an impatience only heightened by the president falling further behind Biden in polls.Still, Saturday’s event risks deepening concern among voters about Trump’s handling of a pandemic that has left more than two dozen of his close associates infected and more than 210,000 Americans dead.After the president’s last outdoor event -- a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony to announce his pick of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court -- at least 11 attendees tested positive for coronavirus. While the White House had a testing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and attendees mingled and sat in close proximity to one another both indoors and outdoors.Trump’s physician said Wednesday that the president had been free of symptoms for the previous 24 hours. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump “will be clear to go” on Saturday, when “he wants to talk to the American people.” There are medical tests underway to ensure he doesn’t transmit the virus when he returns to the campaign trail, she said on Fox News, adding that she’d conferred with White House doctor Sean Conley. McEnany, who herself has tested positive for Covid-19, is working remotely.Virus ScreeningOn Saturday, White House guests were required to bring masks with them and wear them on the grounds, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that they also have to undergo a Covid-19 screening on Saturday morning that will include a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. But those rules were put in place not by the White House but by the organizer of the event, the Blexit group, led by Candace Owens, a Trump ally, the person said.Trump’s first trip outside of D.C. will be to Orlando on Monday, where he’s expected to hold an outdoor airport hanger rally. He’ll follow that on Tuesday with a rally at an airport outside of Pittsburgh, and a similar event Wednesday in Des Moines. His campaign is negotiating a town hall on network television on Thursday, according to CNN.Trump’s challenge to win over voters has only intensified in recent days. His vacillations on a stimulus bill and second presidential debate have fed a developing narrative that he’s flailing as a second term slips from his grasp.Earlier in the week, Trump -– to the dismay of fellow Republicans -- said he was cutting off talks on an additional coronavirus stimulus bill, only to rapidly reverse course after the announcement rocked markets.But subsequent days saw a flurry of different and often contradictory statements from the White House. First, officials said they would resume talks -- but only on standalone bills to bolster the airline industry and small businesses.Reversing CourseThen Trump said not only did he want a sweeping bill, but was open to levels beyond even what Democrats had proposed. By Friday afternoon, the administration was preparing a proposal for a $1.8 trillion deal that fell below what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described as her floor, but exceeded levels Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said would be acceptable. Both House Democrats and Senate Republicans expressed skepticism over the proposal earlier Saturday.Trump and his campaign team -- which, like the White House staff, has suffered coronavirus infections at the highest levels -- are searching for ways to reverse the president’s slide in polls.Trump pulled out of the second debate because the bipartisan commission organizing the event said it would be held virtually following his diagnosis. Trump’s efforts to force the debate commission to reverse course or reschedule the remaining debates fell flat. As a result, Trump will either be deprived of one of the final marquee opportunities to reach voters before Election Day or forced to publicly reverse himself.That’s left the president eager to return to the campaign trail, with hopes that his signature rallies can offer him a chance to reconnect with voters and rekindle enthusiasm for his candidacy.The president told Fox News host Sean Hannity that his team was looking to organize a rally Saturday night in Florida -- the earliest possible date his medical team said he might be able to resume public appearances -- and a second event Sunday in Pennsylvania.Virus SymptomsWhite House aides said logistical challenges prevented organizing such events on short notice. But the president also acknowledged Friday he’s still experiencing some symptoms from his brush with coronavirus. Trump was seen struggling to catch his breath after walking a flight of stairs during his return from the hospital on Monday, and occasionally lost his voice during his interview with Hannity on Thursday.Still, Trump sought to underscore his health Friday through his marathon of interviews with conservative media figures.That included a two-hour uninterrupted conversation on Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio show. On that program, Trump ranked Fox News hosts by how favorable they were to him personally, expressed alarm that Attorney General Bill Barr might not release the findings of a politically charged investigation into the origins of its Russia probe and delivered an expletive-charged warning to Iran.Trump followed that up with several more interviews, including an appearance on Mark Levin’s talk show. The president is expected to be interviewed again Sunday morning by Fox Business Network.“I feel really good, I feel very strong, I know a lot of people who have had the Covid—or the China virus as I call it because it came from China,” the president said in an interview on Fox News Friday. “But I feel really, really strong and a lot of people don’t feel that way sometimes for a while afterwards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-makes-first-public-appearance-since-hospital-release-white-house-won-t-say-if-he-s-still-contagious-with-coronavirus/story-4fvx2HpXTQv5fvGVVjMKMN.html

11-10-2020||India||Supreme Court to return to near full strength hearings from Monday||Twenty eight of the 30 judges of the Supreme Court will sit on Monday to hear cases through video conference, the highest since March 2020, when the court sat at its full strength through physical hearings. The top court has been functioning in a restricted manner since March 23, when it started hearing cases through video conference in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Eight benches sitting on Monday will comprise 3 judges while 2 benches will have 2 judges each. Two single-judge benches will also sit to hear transfer petitions. Those two single-judge benches will, however, have judges who are already part of the 3-judge benches.Two judges, Justices Vineet Saran and Mohan M Shantanagoudar will not be sitting.This trend will continue the entire week with most days having nearly 10 benches sitting each day.This will be the first time that nearly the entire strength of the apex court is sitting to hear cases simultaneously ever since video conference hearings started.Initially, the court used to hear 15 to 20 cases per day with only 1 or 2 benches sitting each day. The number was steadily increased and currently, 5 to 6 benches sit everyday and hear more than 200 cases per day.These numbers still don’t match up to normal times when at least 500 to 700 cases are heard by the apex court on a single day alone.The court issued a circular on March 23 suspending entry of lawyers and litigants to the court premises and directing that only extremely urgent cases would be taken up for hearing through video conferencing during the lockdown period.The summer vacation which is usually seven weeks long was cut short to two weeks this year so as to make up for the reduced number of cases which are being heard through video conference.The hearings in Supreme Court are conducted through the Vidyo app which can be downloaded on mobile phones and desktop. The platform is hosted on the servers of the National Data Centre of National Informatics Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-return-to-near-full-strength-hearings-from-monday/story-yI9JwtyzQruN7upycMVBJL.html
11-10-2020||India||Bengal CID trying to implicate BJP leaders in Shukla murder, party tells Governor||Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged before West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday that the state police’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is trying to implicate leaders from the party in the Manish Shukla murder probe. A BJP team led by national vice-president Mukul Roy met Dhankhar in the afternoon at the Raj Bhawan and said the CID probe was not moving in the right direction. Manish Shukla, 39, an outgoing councillor of the Titagarh municipality in North 24 Parganas district was gunned down by motorcycle-borne hitmen on the night of October 4. Five people have been arrested till Saturday but the CID and state government have so far made no official statement on the investigation. Police have also seized some firearms and three motorcycles. “I have had personal experience with CID probes in Bengal. I have seen several cases in the past. CID investigations in Bengal never go in the right direction. We have reasons to believe that the CID is trying to implicate BJP leaders,” said Roy, who was a Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha member till 2017 when he left the ruling party and joined the BJP. “BJP delegation led by National Vice President Mukul Roy @MukulR_Official demanded CBI investigation in the politically targeted killing of Manish Shukla. The delegation alleged CID @MamataOfficial was misdirecting investigation to falsely implicate political opponents in BJP,” tweeted Dhankhar after he met the BJP leaders. Shukla, too, was a turncoat. He joined the BJP from the TMC after the saffron party won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. One of these seats is Barrackpore, of which Titagarh is a part. Barrackpore’s BJP MP Arjun Singh, who also switched camp from the TMC in 2018, has accused the chairpersons of two civic bodies in the district and TMC lawmaker from Panihati, Nirmal Das, of masterminding the murder with the help of some police officers.“I do not want to react to what a strongman like Singh says. The police will get to the truth,” said Das. The detective department of Barrackpore police is assisting the CID in the investigation. The police want to question a man lodged at Nalanda jail in Bihar, said an officer linked with the probe. In Shukla’s murder, nine people have been named in the First Information Report (FIR) on the basis of the complaint lodged by his father Chandramani Shukla. The outgoing chairman of Barrackpore municipality, Uttam Das and his counterpart in Titagarh municipality, Prashanta Choudhury, have been named in the complaint. The two TMC leaders have denied the allegation, saying Arjun Singh is blaming them because they built up movements to stop the BJP from making further inroads in the district before the 2019 assembly election. On Thursday, Priyanka Tibrewal, a lawyer, filed a petition at the Calcutta high court seeking CBI investigation into Shukla’s murder. The CBI probe should take place under the supervision of the high court, the petition said. It may come up for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cid-trying-to-implicate-bjp-leaders-in-shukla-murder-party-tells-governor/story-w1qcCw03lhEqTX1G9dbjvO.html

The health ministry has increasingly become important because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis with Karnataka registering the second highest number of cases in the country after Maharashtra.Sriramulu, an OBC leader who has been eyeing the Deputy CM’s post has been uncomfortable with the health portfolio and is believed to have been lobbying to be shifted out. Sudhkar a trained doctor by qualification, who currently holds the medical education portfolio, will get the health and family welfare ministry too. Sriramulu is likely to be given the social welfare department which is currently with PWD minister Govind Karajol as additional charge.Earlier there were murmurs of disagreement in terms of Covid-19 handling strategy between Sriramulu and Sudhakar. A miffed chief minister BS Yediyurappa had even named primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar as the chief government spokesperson for all matter related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sudhakar had then denied any rift calling Sriramulu his ‘elder brother’.A minister in the Yediyurappa government confirming the imminent change of portfolio however said, “It is being done at the request of Sriramulu himself. The larger reshuffle and expansion of the cabinet may now take place only after results of the Sira and RR Nagar assembly bypolls are declared next month.”Karnataka on Sunday registered 9,523 coronavirus cases and till now cumulatively has recorded more than 7 lakh cases with nearly 10,000 deaths due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-minor-rejig-karnataka-likely-to-get-new-health-minister-b-sriramulu-to-be-transferred/story-yoh5dkbjkjLBDlAWCPemmI.html
11-10-2020||India||After alumni found in various terror groups, Shopian school comes under radar||A religious school in Shopian district of South Kashmir has come under the scanner of investigating agencies after 13 of its students were found to have joined terror groups, officials said here.The institution’s students include Sajjad Bhat, an accused in the February 2019 suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that left 40 personnel dead.The school’s students mainly hail from Kulgam, Pulwama and c districts of South Kashmir, considered by intelligence agencies to be the hotbeds of militancy and breeding grounds for recruitment of locals into various terror groups, officials said.It also had outstation students from Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana, but their number dropped to almost nil after abrogation of Article 370 last year, the officials said.According to an official, since most students and faculty at the school hail from the terror-infected districts of Shopian and Pulwama, the ideology of terrorism may be flourishing there and in turn affecting the students belonging to other places too.He feels at the same time, the outside environment, local population, terror-related activities and regular encounters of militants also play an effective role in propagating the ideology of terrorism.During investigation of the ghastly attack of February 14 last year when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy killing 40 personnel, the intelligence agencies found that Bhat, whose vehicle was used used in the attack, had done his schooling from this same religious institute in Shopian district.The list of the institute’s students involved in terrorism started expanding with the death of Zubair Nengroo, a so-called commander of the banned Al-Badr terror organisation, in August this year. Nengroo too was a student of the same religious school.According to an internal report, there are at least 13 listed terrorists and hundreds of over ground workers (OGWs) who are either students or alumni of this institute.Recently a youth from Baramulla went missing while returning to the school from his home after vacations. It was later found that he had joined the terrorist ranks. “Most of these 13 terrorists are natives of Shopian and Pulwama,” the report said. Besides Bhat and Nengroo, the list of 13 alumni also includes Hizbul Mujahideen militant Nazim Nazir Dar, and Aijaz Ahmad Paul who was gunned down by security forces in an encounter on August 4 in Shopian. The officials feel that institutions such as this school become breeding grounds for recruitment into terrorist outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al-Badr and Lashker-e-Taiba as stories of killed terrorists depicting them as heroes are spread around through various means.“These factors leave a strong print in the minds of the students and when influenced by the society and friends lead them to joining terrorist ranks. It has been found in certain cases that the education of these kinds of religious institutions is encouraging the students to join terrorist ranks,” said an official.The report pointed out that many day scholar students have been found to be involved in stone pelting, agitations and law and order situations against the security forces. “These students may spread the message of separatist ideology, hate against the government while glorifying the acts of terrorists,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-alumni-found-in-various-terror-groups-shopian-school-comes-under-radar/story-kNpurompdOCdt8MN6i8bFP.html

He said DGP asked the police officers to spread awareness among the public about the impact on air quality. The officials were also directed to engage people from other departments like the local administration, municipal corporations, its other bodies and village panchayats to sensitise people and ensure proper waste management.Also read: Punjab sees six-fold rise in incidents of stubble burning in first 20 days of harvestingThe police officers should ensure that combined harvesting machines should be allowed only along with straw reaper to ensure no stubble is left behind, which is later burnt by farmers to clear the fields.He said the DGP asked the officers to impose fines on farmers and people involved in burning stubble and garbage.Pollution in Uttar Pradesh increased to pre Covid-19 levels as major cities have recorded ‘poor to ‘very poor’ air quality, as per data released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recently.Major cities of Uttar Pradesh, including Noida, Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Kanpur recorded AQI (Air Quality Index) between 201 and 310 for the first time since the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March.

The CM & his police say no one was raped because for them, and many other Indians, she was NO ONE,” Gandhi wrote on Twitter this morning and shared a news report about why the police were denying the rape when the woman repeatedly reported the assault.  The shameful truth is many Indians don’t consider Dalits, Muslims and Tribals to be human.The CM & his police say no one was raped because for them, and many other Indians, she was NO ONE.https://t.co/mrDkodbwNCThe woman from Hathras’ Bulgarhi village was allegedly raped by four “upper caste” men earlier in September. She died at a hospital in Delhi later and on the following day she was cremated by the UP police at 2:30am even as her family protested.The state police have denied that the woman was raped saying her postmortem report did not confirm rape and that it states that she died due to a neck injury. Hathras district magistrate (DM) Praveen Kumar also made similar claims.“Postmortem report says the victim died due to her neck injury. FSL report hasn’t found sperm in samples, making it clear that some ppl twisted the matter to stir caste-based tension. Such people will be identified & legal action will be taken,” ADG Prashant Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The report has been prepared by the Aligarh Muslim University Medical College, where the woman was being treated before she was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now taken over the gang-rape case, which was being probed by Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the UP government.Gandhi had earlier slammed the UP administration over the case and while visiting the victim’s family he assured them of support in seeking justice for their daughter. Earlier this week, Gandhi also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “not saying a word” about the assault.“It is interesting that the woman was raped and murdered and the entire UP administration targeted her family but the Prime Minister hasn’t said a word on the issue,” he had said while speaking with reporters in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-rape-victim-is-no-one-for-them-rahul-gandhi-latest-jibe-at-yogi-govt-up-police/story-oMNJ3fXL47ObBS2QG9Pt7M.html

Not only that it was fun because we have been sitting at homes under lockdown for months now,” said Rubab, one of the participants in the junior category.“Even if anybody is able to do any activity these days, it is done in isolation. Today, we enjoyed ourselves as we met people, even though we followed all the SOPs… More of such events should be held,” she said.J&K Director-General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh was also happy over the participation of youth in various sporting activities in the past 10 days and called them ‘change-makers’ and the police as a ‘catalyst’.“Unfortunately we had Covid-19 situation going around and there was some break in physical activities. Some relaxation has now taken place and now we have resumed sporting activities. These kinds of activities take youth towards positivity,” he said.He hoped that the youth of Kashmir will utilise their energies in a positive direction. “We are sure that the youth will happily participate in such activities and no one wants violence. Our youth especially would shun violence and be on the path of peace,” he saidWhen specifically asked about militancy in south Kashmir, he said that “action and silences” go together there.“We would rather want to have longer spells of silence than exchange of fire but unfortunately we have a good number of active terrorists in that area,” he said.“So whenever they come with weapons or fire at the forces or when we get information, we try to see if they would surrender.

11-10-2020||India||Congress demands resignation of Karnataka CM over reported graft allegations against kin||The Congress on Sunday attacked the BJP over reported allegations of corruption against some family members of Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa in connection with a housing project and demanded a time-bound judicial probe into the matter. When Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah had made the allegations against the chief minister in the Karnataka Assembly last month, Yediyurappa had dismissed them as “baseless” and challenged the Congress leader to prove the charges. Citing media reports, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi on Sunday alleged that the BJP government in Karnataka is “engulfed in the clutches of corruption with dented, tainted leaders ruling the roost”. “If the chief minister has the slightest sense of shame, he must resign or be sacked,” Singhvi said. He also questioned the “silence” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda over the reported allegations of corruption and kickbacks against the son, son-in-law, and grandson of Yediyurappa. The matter relates to a Rs 662-crore construction of an apartment project in Bengaluru, Singhvi said and claimed media reports have “disclosed direct involvement of close relatives like son, son-in-law and grandson in corruption and bribery in connection with the project”. “It has shocked the consciousness of the entire country, but it appears that the BJP has no conscience,” Singhvi said. The Congress leader cited a purported communication between a close relative of Yediyurappa and another person referring to a bribe paid by a contractor to a top Bengaluru Development Authority official. Singhvi claimed that an additional bribe was sought and paid through shell companies in Kolkata. He said the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act must be invoked and the allegations probed. “The most remarkable and virtually admitted allegations of unabashed corruption and we don’t even find a criminal investigation,” Singhvi said, adding that even an FIR was not filed over it. “We demand...appoint a sitting Supreme Court (judge) or a sitting Chief Justice of a High Court as an inquirer for two months,” he said. This is “fraud, fakeness and fiddling” which has made BJP a party of “jugglers” who are indulging in “jiggery-pokery”, he said in a swipe at the ruling party.

11-10-2020||India||UP govt ‘playing tricks’ to keep Hathras victim’s family away from fact-finding team: Left Parties||Left parties on Sunday accused the Uttar Pradesh authorities of “playing tricks” to keep the family of a Dalit woman, who allegedly died after being gang-raped in Hathras, away from its fact finding team, which had to call off its visit after being informed that the family was being shifted to Lucknow for a court appearance.In a joint statement, the CPI, CPIM and LJD alleged that the UP authorities were not in favour of their visit.The fact-finding team comprised of Elamaram Kareem (CPI(M)), Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya (CPI(M)), Binoy Viswam (CPI) and M V Shreyams Kumar (LJD).In the statement, the parties said the team had spoken to the victim’s family and the District authorities about their visit and fixed it for Sunday morning. The District Magistrate and District Police Superintendent had also agreed for a meeting with the team about the visit, it said. “But on Saturday late evening, we got an information from police sources that the family had to be taken to Lucknow for a hearing in the high court on Monday. It is to be noted that Lucknow is only 6-7 hours away from Hathras and they can reach there comfortably by Sunday evening even if the family leave from there at noon time. “We were looking forward to see the family on Sunday morning around 11 am. After repeated communication from our offices regarding the visit, it was quite clear from the attitude of the authorities that they were not in favour of our visit and wanted to avoid us meeting the family,” the statement said.The team, however, decided to still go ahead with their plans but on Sunday when they were to start for Hathras, the team was informed that the family will be taken to Lucknow in the morning itself. “When we checked up with the family, they said that they have no idea about it and the police have instructed them to be ready to leave Hathras before 10 am. So, in the air of uncertainty of meeting family, we had to drop the plan to visit Hathras. “We seriously doubt that the Police, who are just obeying the orders of the BJP government, did not want us to meet the family and understand the facts. They intentionally misguided us about the family’s Lucknow journey citing court engagement,” it said. It further added that “authorities in Hathras are still playing tricks to keep the family away from public glare.” The statement said the authorities feared that the team’s visit will be another occasion to highlight the incidents and the failure of this government in dealing with the case. The statement said now, it has been made known to the team that the family is scheduled to leave for Lucknow on Monday at 5.30 am.“So, it is undoubtedly clear that the authorities intentionally gave wrong information to us, the media as well as the victim’s family regarding their Lucknow journey. We strongly doubt that all these exercises were carried out only to avoid the fact-finding team meeting the victim’s family. “The ugly face of BJP regime in UP is being unveiled through this. We hereby urge the people of this country to unite and come forward against this anti-democratic government in UP. We will continue our fight against these forces and stand in solidarity with the victim’s family,” it said. The family members of the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died at a Delhi hospital after allegedly being raped by four men in Hathras will appear before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court on Monday.“Shocked” by the murder and alleged gang-rape of the Dalit woman and the subsequent forcible cremation, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had on October 1 summoned top government officials.Taking suo motu cognisance of the case, which has triggered widespread outrage, a division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Jaspreet Singh had ordered the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary, state police chief and an additional director general of police to appear before it on October 12 to explain the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-playing-tricks-to-keep-hathras-victim-s-family-away-from-fact-finding-team-left-parties/story-Y0FPMk3jKqvRbOPUqIwLXL.html

This season, the country received above normal rainfall for the second consecutive year.The normal withdrawal date of monsoon from west Rajasthan is September 17. However, this year the monsoon retreated from parts of west Rajasthan and Punjab on September 28, 11 days after its normal withdrawal date.The monsoon usually withdraws from large parts of Karnataka and Telangana and parts of Andhra Pradesh by October 15. It also marks the commencement of northeast monsoon which brings rains over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.By the first week of October, the monsoon had withdrawn from several parts of north India, parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.“The withdrawal line of the southwest monsoon continues to pass through Faizabad, Fatehpur, Nowgong, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Vallabh Vidyanagar and Porbandar,” the IMD’s bulletin said on Sunday.The withdrawal of monsoon from the country was delayed even last year.“There has been a trend that the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon is getting delayed. Also, after the monsoon hits Kerala, it has been observed that its progress over north India has slowed,” M Rajeevan, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences said.From this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has revised the onset date of monsoon over some parts of the country and also the withdrawal date from west Rajasthan.PTI PR SRY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/depression-over-bay-of-bengal-delays-withdrawal-of-monsoon-imd/story-YisvSTkneOlTxVhfgZAKSO.html

The cases are definitely rising. But the mortality rate is not as high as other states. The ultimate aim is to reduce the mortality rate,” Shailaja was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“We could contain cases when there was lockdown. But now measures are eased. We can’t blame the government for easing restrictions because people need to work and earn or else they will starve to death. But people need to follow all precautions,” Shailaja added.Kerala reported the country’s first case of Covid-19 on January 30 after a medical student, who came back from China’s Wuhan, tested positive.

11-10-2020||India||Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Committee demands action against Bengal cops on turban issue||A delegation of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee on Sunday met West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and alleged that Balwinder Singh, whose turban fell off while he was arrested in Howrah for carrying a pistol at a Bharatiya Janata Party agitation on October 8, was assaulted without provocation and is being detained illegally. “A Sikh man’s turban was pulled off his head and he was pulled by his hair. The pagri (turban), kesh (unshorn hair) and kirpan (dagger) are an integral part of the Sikh faith and form the core of our brief. By defiling the turban and unshorn hair of a Sikh, these policemen have insulted the faith of the entire Sikh community,” S Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the committee, said after meeting the governor.“We demand legal action against these policemen under Section 295-A of the Indian Penal Code. If legal proceedings can be initiated against Sardar Balwinder Singh, who served in the army and was honourably discharged, why can’t there be proceedings against the policemen who insulted his faith. We request chief minister Mamata Banerjee to take action against them. She is not at fault here. Those policemen are,” said Manjinder Singh Sirsa. Section 295 A of the IPC deals with deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage reli¬gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli-gious beliefs. The punishment is a jail term of up to four years or fine or both. “As Governor I asured the delegation that all steps would be taken for such outrage @MamataOfficial. In no civilised society such blatant abuse of police power @WBPolice in disregard of Supreme Court directives in the case of DK Basu can be countenanced or condoned,” Dhankhar tweeted shortly after meeting the delegation. Balwinder Singh, who was in police custody in an Indian Arms Act case, was produced before a Howrah court on Sunday and remanded in custody for eight more days. Manjinder Singh Sirsa dismissed the local authority’s claim that Singh’s firearms licence is valid only in Rajouri, Kashmir. “He has an ‘all-India’ licence and there was no ground for arresting him. He flew from Delhi to Kolkata with the firearm and details of the licence is recorded at both airports. And yet, the police have slapped charges that are brought against terrorists. This man fought for the country,” he said. Hours before the delegation met the governor, the West Bengal home department said that a certain political party was adding communal colour to the October 8 incident. “Our Sikh brothers and sisters live here in West Bengal in perfect peace and harmony, in happiness and tranquility, with respect from all of us for their faith and practices. A recent incident when one isolated individual got caught with one illegally carried firearm in an agitation that was not authorised and is now being twisted out of context, distorted and given communal colours in fractious and partisan interests,” tweeted the state home department. “One political party is giving communal colour to the subject in narrow partisan interests in a manner that Bengal does not believe in. Policing was done as per law, but highest respect for the Sikh panth and ways from the state government is affirmed,” the tweet added. On October 9, when videos of the incident triggered an uproar in Bengal and other parts of the country, the West Bengal Police tweeted, “The concerned person was carrying firearms in yesterday’s protest. The Pagri had fallen off automatically in the scuffle that ensued, without any attempt to do so by our officer (visible in the video attached). It is never our intention to hurt the sentiments of any community.” The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee reacted to this sharply. “The policemen who attacked and insulted a Sikh are junior functionaries. But the statement must have been written by senior IPS officers. How could they say the pagri fell off automatically when the videos clearly show how it was removed and how Balwinder Singh was dragged by his hair. Bengal and Pubjab have produced heroes who fought for the nation. How can this happen? We want justice,” said the committee president. Bengal BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Tweets will not help. The nation has seen the videos. The police have hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community.” Earlier, Ghosh had said that Singh is the bodyguard of a BJP youth front leader and works for a private security agency. In its letter to Dhankhar, the gurdwara management committee said Singh was deployed to protect BJP leader Priyanshu Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sikh-gurdwara-committee-demands-action-against-bengal-cops-on-turban-issue/story-6wzniBkum7KvO0u58GI8pI.html

11-10-2020||India||Haryana’s Baroda never elected a woman MLA in history||It may come as a surprise but the voters of Sonepat’s Baroda constituency have never elected a woman as their representative in the assembly elections since Haryana became a state. This rural constituency has elected 13 MLAs so far, all males and 9 out of 13 legislators were not permanent residents of this constituency.The seat fell vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda on April 12, who won from the seat in 2009, 2014 and 2019 assembly polls. The voting for the Baroda byelection will be held on November 3 and results will be out on November 10. Hooda hailed from Khidwali village in Garhi-Sampla Kiloi constituency from where he was elected thrice before shifting to this rural seat in 2009. Baroda was a reserved seat till 2005 and had been wrenched by the candidates belonging to Devi Lal and OP Chautala’s party from 1977 to 2005. The saffron party’s nominee has never won from the Baroda constituency, which has 54 villages. Half the voters here belong to the Jat community. In the 2019 assembly elections, Congress nominee Sri Krishan Hooda defeated wrestler-turned-politician Yogeshwar Dutt by 4,840 votes. Haryana assembly has only nine women MLAs.Also read: Haryana BJP poll panel meets in Sonepat to discuss Baroda byelection candidateWomen empowerment remains a distant dream in Haryana which, for years, has known for the skewed sex ratio and high rates of crime against women. Haryana has only nine women legislators in the state assembly. Five of them are from Congress, three from BJP and Naina Chautala is the only woman MLA from the Jannayak Janata party. In 2014, the house had the highest, 13 women MLAs, 9 in 2009, 11 in 2005 and 4 in 2000.In the last year assembly polls, the ruling BJP had brought down women’s representation from 15 to 12, the main opposition party, Congress, pitted only 9 against 10 in 2014 assembly polls. Similarly, the INLD has pitched 15 women candidates against 16 that the party had fielded in the last assembly polls and its offshoot the JJP had given tickets to only 7 females.Neerja Ahlawat, retired deputy director, women’s studies and research centre, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, said all the political parties betrayed women in Haryana and across the country too by making tall false claims of giving women representation in the assembly and parliamentary polls.“The political parties are of the view that the chance of winning an election of a female candidate is less than that of a male candidate, which is not true. The women are getting late exposure than men in terms of education, political and social scenario. Women’s issues can be raised strongly only by them and most of the active women leaders are an example of dynasty politics. It is very hard to believe that any party will give a ticket to a woman in the Baroda bypoll, which is dominated by the male community in terms of representation. The political parties prefer to pitch a woman whose ancestors remained active in politics,” she added.She further said that all the political parties betrayed women voters by reducing the number of women candidates in the 2019 assembly polls. She advocated for women representation at all levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-s-baroda-never-elected-women-as-their-mla-in-history/story-2anC2Wf6kOlQu7204Rh8aI.html
11-10-2020||India||4 men arrested in Uttarakhand for smuggling organs of bear, musk deer and poaching turtles||Uttarakhand forest department officials and police have arrested four people for allegedly smuggling organs of bear, musk deer and poaching Indian flapshell turtles, in two different incidents in the Kumaon region over the weekend. In Bageshwar district, police officials on Sunday arrested one person on the charges of smuggling body parts of a bear. Manikant Mishra, superintendent of police Bageshwar said “We had received a tip-off that a man was planning to smuggle the bile duct of a black bear along with organs of other animals. As the smuggler was in the Kapkot area of the district, we arrested him during an operation and recovered two bile ducts of bears and one musk gland of a deer.” He said the bile ducts weighted 230 grams and the musk gland weighed 23 grams. He said the approximate market value of the seized material is Rs 15 lakh in international markets. Bear bile which sells for a high price in the international market is used to make traditional medicine giving rise to the poaching of the animal for smuggling the organs. In US Nagar district, three persons were arrested from Rudrapur area with shells and meat of flapshell turtles. Umesh Chandra Tiwari, sub-divisional forest officer of Terai central forest division said “We had received a tip-off that wildlife smugglers were planning to smuggle a flapshell turtle. When we learnt that the smugglers were in Rudrapur on Saturday evening, we formed a team to nab them. Three persons were arrested from Rudrapur area in US Nagar on Saturday evening.” The team was led by Pankaj Sharma, range officer Rudrapur forest range. Tiwari added that the forest department team seized 4.6 kg of turtle meat and eight shells of the Indian flapshell turtles. The accused have been booked under Section 9 (prohibition of hunting) of The Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. The Indian flapshell turtle is found in freshwater ponds, rivers and drains and its meat is considered a delicacy, leading to an increase in incidents of turtle poaching in Terai region, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-men-arrested-in-uttarakhand-for-smuggling-organs-of-bear-musk-deer-and-poaching-turtles/story-CuuqE7OLWVn6S4SoqGN47K.html
11-10-2020||India||Holkar’s trust denies fraud in property sales, EOW of MP govt begins probe||A trust of the erstwhile royal family of Holkars managing properties in several states meant for charities has said the inquiry by the economic offence wing (EOW) of the Madhya Pradesh government is puzzling given the number of properties sold in the past 40 years and the transparent manner in which these were sold.The EOW which has initiated a probe in the wake of a high court directive has proceeded to collect documents from the trust as part of the inquiry.On October 5, a two-judge bench of the Indore bench of the Madhya Pradesh high court set aside an order by a single-judge bench of the same court in 2013 and said the sale of endowment properties by Khasgi (Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Charities) Trust, Indore was a fraud. The two-judge bench also declared the sale null and void and ordered an inquiry by the EOW. It also ruled that the properties managed by the Indore-based Trust will lie with the state government.On October 7, the state government issued an order for the EOW inquiry and constituted a 39-member team of police officials, including two superintendents of police to assist the investigation.The Khasgi Trust manages a total of 246 properties spread over 12,000 acre of land in various states including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu etc. The properties include 138 temples, 18 dharmshalas and 34 ghats among others.According to the Trust, the valuation of properties was never done as the religious structures like temples, ghats etc could not have been valued and that there was no occasion also for the same in the past six decades or so of its existence. The six trustees include Maharani Usha Devi (daughter of late Maharaja Yashwant Rao Holkar), her spouse Satish Malhotra, justice PD Mule (retd), two representatives of state government as ex-officio members revenue commissioner, Indore and superintending engineering, PWD, Indore and a representative of the central government BK Heerji. Satish Malhotra has refuted allegations of fraud and said all the money from the sales was deposited in the trust’s bank account.“The trust was created by Maharani in 1962. In all 7 properties were sold for Rs 6 to Rs 8 crore. Each and every rupee was deposited in the trust’s bank account, which remains intact in fixed deposits. The first property sold was about 40 years back and the last one about 10 years back. In fact, since the trust didn’t have money once for maintenance of its properties we invested Rs 5 to Rs 6 crore in the trust for the purpose.” He maintained that there was no illegality in the transactions and that the government had given its nod for the sales.“They can ask any question and take any document they want but ultimately they will find that no illegality has taken place. We decided to sell the properties, that too non-religious properties, only when the state government didn’t listen to our requests to increase the amount of financial assistance which is Rs 2.91 lakh per annum for maintenance of properties. The government had given its consent for the sale and then a supplementary trust was formed. Also, each and every sale had consent of all the trustees including the government representatives,” Malhotra said.EOW superintendent of police Dhananjay Shah said, “At this juncture, it is difficult to tell about the magnitude of the alleged fraud which we will be able to know only after gathering all the relevant documents from the trust and examining the same.” He said, “The SIT was constituted on October 7. Then, the trust was told to submit its documents. Once we have documents we will look into all the aspects.” A government official who didn’t want to be named said, “The then principal secretary to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Manoj Shrivastava had conducted a detailed inquiry in 2012 into the sale of properties and existence of all other properties. The revenue department too is gathering all the relevant documents to assist the EOW in its probe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holkar-s-trust-denies-fraud-in-property-sales-eow-of-mp-govt-begins-probe/story-qQ5IqngcAHFlDcUMc6ml8M.html

PM Modi on Sunday launched the physical distribution of property cards which will act as physical copies of property titles of the villagers’ homes and the surrounding areas owned by them. Here are the excerpts from the prime minister’s interaction with the two beneficiaries from Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh.PM’s interaction with Ram Milan of Barabanki:PM Modi: I was told you lost a hand in an accident. How do you earn your livelihood? Your life had a big crisis. Losing a part of one’s body also causes a big disappointment. But you managed yourself and the family.Ram Milan: Yes, about 14-15 years ago my right hand got severed while I was working on a cattle-feed machine. I do manage with this hand. For my livelihood, I have a grocery shop in the village and I also do farming on lease.PM Modi: Now that you have got ‘gharoni’ (ownership right) of your house, how would it affect you and your family? What problems did you face earlier?Ram Milan: It is heartening to get the ownership. All those neighbourhood disputes are over. Now, I can get a loan against it. Through that loan, I can expand my business.PM Modi: When the drone was at work, I am sure the entire village must have gathered? It is a very happy thing that you got the ownership and documents. Now, do people believe that a good arrangement has been made? You have the papers, disputes won’t happen. Most of the disputes happen due to house, land. Now, you are mentally free to work and progress. Do spread the word among people about the system.Ram Milan: Yes, when the drone was at work, the entire village, including children, had gathered. There was a kind of celebration, everyone was eager to watch the drone. Earlier, I did not have any document, now I have documents that establish my ownership on the house. Yes, everyone believes what has happened.

Modi said this while launching the physical distribution of Aadhaar-like property cards under Svamitva (survey of villages and mapping with improvised technology in village areas) scheme on Sunday through videoconferencing, which was attended by Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. Modi spoke about homestays during an interaction with one of the beneficiaries- Suresh Chand- from Pauri Garhwal. Suresh Chandra apprised PM Modi that people in his village would like to develop their homes into homestays with the help of bank loans. During the interaction, Modi wanted to know from Suresh Chandra, if villagers faced any problems in getting property cards; what was the population of his village; whether he believes the new scheme will bring transparency; what he intends to do after getting loan from a bank? Suresh Chandra thanked the PM and said the process of demarcating properties was conducted transparently without any dispute. He said after getting property cards, it would be easy for him and others in his area to seek loans. Talking about his love and association with the Himalayas, Modi said he has lived and travelled a lot in the Himalayas. “Your village abounds in natural beauty. As you have put curtains in the background, I am not able to view your beautiful Himalayan village. You are lucky to view such magnificent sacred peaks from your area,” the PM said, adding that it would definitely become a popular tourist spot. Suresh told the PM that residents in his village can view several sacred Himalayan peaks like Kedarnath and Chaukhamba. He said villagers like him would like to renovate their houses and develop them as homestays using bank loans, which should be accessible after the creation of an official record of his property under the Svamitva scheme. Also Read: SVAMITVA scheme to end disputes in villages: PM ModiFurther exploring the potential of developing homestays in the state, PM Modi suggested creating a website with all necessary details.“I would like to tell the minister (in the state), to develop a website for homestays where all details like the type of food, number of rooms, photos of rooms, contact details like phone numbers and email, how long the pilgrims and tourists want to stay are mentioned. When this is done, homestays will run in a very good way,” Modi said. In Uttarakhand, 6,804 people from 50 villages will get Aadhaar-like property cards by Sunday evening. PM Modi, Nitish Kumar changed political course in Bihar: BJP chief JP Nadda at election rally in GayaHC Semwal, director, directorate of Panchayati Raj in Uttarakhand, said that in the first phase, 10 villages from Pauri Garhwal and 40 villages from US Nagar were selected for the distribution of property cards.“After PM launched the scheme, the cards will be distributed to 6,804 beneficiaries in all the 50 villages in these two districts by Sunday evening,” he said. Semwal said all villages will be soon covered under the scheme. “These cards will ensure clarity in ownership of land and houses in the villages and help the villagers to avail loans and benefits of other schemes in an efficient and transparent way, besides reducing property-related disputes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/svamitva-launch-pm-modi-chats-with-uttarakhand-villager-tells-him-why-he-s-lucky/story-AMBQOw2KOg7TlPsigjCobO.html

The ministry clarified that the decision will only impact high speed trains and all existing mail and express trains with a maximum speed of up to 110 kmph will continue to ply with sleeper coaches.Also read: Railways to start 200 additional trains during holiday season“AC coaches become a technical necessity wherever the speed of the train is going to be above 130 kmph . Indian Railways is working on a massive plan to upgrade the railway network to high speed potential. Tracks on golden quadrilateral and diagonals are being upgraded to cater to speed of 130 km - 160 km / hour. Non-AC sleeper coaches would be replaced by AC coaches only for such trains which will be running at a maximum speed of 130/160 kmph. Speed potential of some of the corridors has already been upgraded to 130 kmph. Wind and weather factors demand that only certain type of coaches run on higher speed,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.At present, most mail and express trains have a maximum speed of 110 kmph. Premium trains like Rajdhanis, Shatabdis and Durontos are allowed to operate at 120 kmph on significant parts of the Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals. The rakes for such trains are fit to operate at 130 kph or above.Officials added that these new AC coaches will be “economical coaches” similar to AC-3 chair car coaches in Humsafar Trains that have a rationalised fare structure. “It will be ensured that while the price of tickets of modified AC coaches remains very affordable for the passengers , the comfort and conveniences increase manifold and there is substantial reduction in travel time,” the spokesperson said.A prototype of the new AC coach is being made at railways’ production unit at Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala, and should be ready in a few weeks. Compared to 72 berths in a sleeper coach, this new AC coach will have 83 berths, but the number of berths in a coupe will remain the same as there will be no middle berths between side-upper and side-lower berths. The coaches are being re-designed by moving the electrical units and removing the space reserved for storing blankets and bed sheets, since Railways will stop providing them due to coronavirus.“Presently, an 83-berth coach is being designed. Railways has planned 100 such coaches this year and 200 the next year. The coaches will be tested and evaluated,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-upgrade-high-speed-trains-with-only-special-ac-coaches/story-8bwzyJs7h3ODBTqS9BGTrO.html

The first vacancy in the Supreme Court arose following the retirement of Justice Ranjan Gogoi in November 2019 as the Chief Justice of India. Subsequently, three more vacancies arose in the top court following the retirements of justices Deepak Gupta, R Bhanumathi and Arun Mishra. With a sanctioned strength of 34, the apex court is functioning with 30 judges. The high courts of Gauhati, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand are functioning with officiating chief justices. Officiating or acting chief justices are appointed in the absence of a chief justice to ensure that the day to day administration of the court is not affected. The government has so far not received any recommendation from the collegium to fill up these vacancies in the SC and the three high courts, a senior functionary said. Vacancies keep arising in courts due to retirement, resignation or elevation of judges.  The government has maintained that appointment of judges in the high courts is a “continuous collaborative process” between the Executive and the Judiciary, as it requires consultation and approval from various constitutional authorities.  As per the procedure for the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the 25 high courts, the apex court collegium recommends the names of candidates to the government which, in turn, either accepts the proposal or returns it for reconsideration. The collegium comprises the CJI and four senior-most judges of the apex court. The combined sanctioned strength of the 25 high courts is 1,079 judges. As on October 1, there were 404 vacancies, with the maximum of 60 in the Allahabad High Court. As on September 1, there were 398 vacancies in the high courts and as on September 1, 48 new judges in various HCs have been appointed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-awaits-recommendation-for-4-supreme-court-vacancies-3-hcs-without-regular-chief-justices/story-6i8BfFofTkxJEm3to0usAI.html

Both the crimes were heinous in nature but (in Karauli) it was a land dispute and the accused was nabbed within 36 hours. Injustice was meted out in Hathras.”He further said, “At least the cremation of the Karauli person was done rightfully while the victim’s family was put under house arrest in Hathras. In Hathras, politicians and journalists were prevented from meeting the family. Did it happen in Karauli?”Babulal Vaishnav, a priest, was set ablaze by five young men in Karauli after he stopped them from encroaching lands that belonged to a temple on Wednesday. Vaishnav succumbed to his injuries on Thursday at a hospital in Jaipur. Two people have been arrested so far in connection to this case.Singhvi also criticised the UP government over comments made by political leaders regarding the Hathras gang-rape and said, “Did you hear any minister or lawmaker saying things which were inappropriate after the Karauli incident?”Singhvi was addressing a press conference where he lashed out at the Karnataka government over an alleged scam of Rs 662 crore and demanded that the central leadership of the BJP ask chief minister BS Yediyurappa to take accountability for the incident.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe the Hathras gangrape. The gangrape and murder of the Dalit girl in UP’s Hathras district has led to protests all over the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-not-compare-crimes-committed-in-hathras-and-karauli-congress-singhvi-targets-bjp/story-8ZnjmizVhViaTJSaDlsFSL.html
11-10-2020||India||Uptick in social media abuse following LAC standoff between India, China: Meity officials||The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) officials have said there has been an uptick in the number of social media abuse cases following the standoff between India and China along the Line of the Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.According to officials familiar with the matter, around 500 social media accounts, pages and websites were blocked in September, as compared to around 250 in the corresponding period last year. The government, in response to an unstarred question during the monsoon session of Parliament in September, had said that it had addressed 3,635 such cases last year. Also read: Facebook India exec files FIR over ‘violent threats’“We were blocking nearly 200-250 accounts, pages, websites on social media per month last year,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. “This year, the corresponding figure went up from around 250 in June, 300 in July, 400 in August and around 500 in September. These figures are indicative and dynamic, as they change daily,” he added. However, the official said that the exact number of social media accounts that were blocked was confidential. “We are certainly seeing an upward trend,” the official said. The ministry takes down information from the internet, when they are found them to be in violation of Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000.The Act empowers government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of national sovereignty and integrity, defence, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence. The ministry has also taken down over 200 applications between July and September, mostly of Chinese origin, following the LAC standoff on June 15. Union Minister for Electronics and IT and Communications Ravi Shankar Prasad had called the decision to block the applications (app), including TikTok, a popular video-streaming app, and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PBG), an online multiplayer battle royale game, as a “digital strike on China”. “These are regular clean-ups that the ministry does in cyberspace,” said a second official. On September 21, HT had reported that the ministry had told Parliament that it had taken down 3,635 websites/pages/accounts on social media last year for violating the IT Act, 2000. The answer was in response to an unstarred question about the ministry’s regulation of social media. The ministry had stated that 1,385 and 2,799 social media pages were blocked in 2017 and 2018, respectively. “With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for misuse of cyberspace and social media platforms for criminal activities is a global issue,” the ministry had said in its response. “In line with the increase of usage of internet as also the growth of social media platforms, there are an increasing number of incidents of reporting of such content having potential to incite violence and hatred. Government has a well-defined system of reporting and blocking for public access within the framework of section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000,” it had added. Social media platforms are also expected to remove any unlawful content related to Article 19(2) of the Constitution as and when they are brought to their knowledge either through a court order or via a notice by government. On June 15, 20 Indian soldiers were killed by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, triggering a tense standoff along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uptick-in-social-media-abuse-following-lac-standoff-between-india-china-meity-officials/story-4rTkOUxqRgfIF8mgyHATGJ.html

It is important to note that the rise in the number of new Covid-19 cases has been on the decline in the country since the past few days.“If we falter in following COVID-19 guidelines during the festivals then corona can again assume a dangerous shape and become big trouble for us. This is the truth, in any religion, no dharmic leader will say that people’s lives should be put at risk to celebrate festivals. No God has said that one needs to go to puja pandals to worship,” the minister said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Anyone can remember their God with a pure heart from anywhere. I would want people to celebrate their festivals with their family. Earlier also this used to happen, people used to celebrate festivals in small groups. I do not think there is any need for going to pandals and melas,” he added.The Union minister, however, added that as per the people’s beliefs if people wanted to go to puja pandals, they should maintain ‘2 gaz ki doori’ (maintain social distancing), wear masks at all times and urge others to do the same.“I am saying all this because being the country’s Health Minister, it is my duty to protect people’s lives,” he said.With a spike of 74,383 new cases and 918 deaths reported in the last 24 hours, India’s Covid-19 count crossed the 70-lakh mark on Sunday, as per the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).Click here for complete coronavirus coverage According to the MoHFW, the Covid-19 count in the country is at 70,53,807, including 8,67,496 active cases.The number of cured and discharged or migrated patients has also crossed 60-lakhs and is at 60,77,977 in the country.With 918 deaths, the toll due to the disease now stands at 1,08,334 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-can-assume-dangerous-shape-if-norms-are-flouted-during-festivals-harsh-vardhan/story-kRhBdFVUwIYqimLt1XvXnK.html

Dead virus is sometimes sequestered in various organs and intermittently shed for several weeks and months after recovery,” the minister said.“However, such a patient is considered recovered and non-infectious. Due to the inherent characteristic of the RT-PCR test to detect dead virus, intermittent period of positivity after a negative test report may be documented. Therefore, any lab-confirmed case, if tested over a duration of several weeks, may have intermittent positive, negative, and then again positive results,” the minister added.Recently, the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in Pune has claimed a resident doctor has tested positive for Covid-19 “a second time” in a three-month period. The doctor’s samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for a genome sequencing and antibodies test.The health minister said ICMR is investigating the cases of reported re-emergence of Covid-19 and the results will be shared in a few weeks.“A person during his path of recovery and having a low viral load may have a resurgence of ongoing infection due to immuno-compromised state or other secondary infections. It is necessary to differentiate between a mislabelled reinfection and an actual reinfection. An actual reinfection would mean a fully recovered person getting infected with a freshly introduced virus,” Harsh Vardhan said. Some hospitals in the national capital in August reported they were seeing recovered coronavirus patients returning to them with recurrence of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-of-these-covid-19-cases-are-misclassified-what-harsh-vardhan-says-on-reinfections/story-CYfgwbiSMyVPAlGFrku3OP.html

Likely, says Harsh Vardhan||Amid several reports indicating that the number of Covid-19 cases will increase during winter, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday confirmed that the possibility of the same in Indian context can’t be dismissed at all.“SARS Cov 2 is a respiratory virus and the transmission of respiratory viruses is known to increase during the colder weather. Respiratory viruses thrive better in cold weather and low humidity conditions. There is another fact that needs to be kept in mind. During winter, there is a tendency of overcrowding in residential dwellings which may increase transmission... So in Indian context, it would not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see an increase in the number of cases,” the minister said, addressing his weekly social media interaction programme Sunday Samvaad.Also Read: ‘Ayurveda has holistic approach’: Harsh Vardhan on Ayush-based Covid-19 treatmentThe minister also cited the examples of the European countries, especially the United Kingdom, where the number of infections has gone up with the advent of winter.“Hence, we are emphasising on the precautionary measures which are easy to follow. No need to fear and shudder. Wear the mask and maintain social distancing. Prevention is better than cure,” the minister said, sounding a note of caution.

In addition, with festival-related gatherings, there could be a sudden rise in cases. Therefore, it is recommended that Delhi should prepare for a daily surge of approximately 15,000 positive cases and make arrangements for inpatient admissions of patients with moderate and severe disease roughly amounting to 20% of this surge,” the NCDC said in a document related to the revised Covid-19 strategy for Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-covid-19-cases-increase-in-india-during-winter-likely-says-harsh-vardhan/story-OqnXFg8gsZGx8LEgZXxHhI.html

Raut, in his weekly column RokhThok in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said that Shah should take the initiative to clean up social media bots and that should start with his own party, the Bharatiya Janata Party.Raut referred to the 80,000 social media accounts, allegedly created using false identities to discredit the Mumbai police and Maharashtra government’s investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death to make his point. “Amit Shah is the home minister and he should acknowledge that the illegal use of cyber army can be destructive for the country and society. The use of this army for character assassination of opponents and to stifle dissent can backfire on the country,” Raut warned in the column. Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput case: Shiv Sena MP seeks probe into misuse of social media platformsHe alleged that the use of social media army and incessant attacks on its opponents have become a national policy for the BJP and a few others.“BJP won the last two general elections with the help of social media.

The social media, that found Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh to be useless, also made fun of our prime minister after a video of him seated in an army jeep waving his hands through an empty tunnel went viral.“This is not right...,” Raut went on, “In the Sushant case, 80,000 fake accounts were created to defame Mumbai police. 5 crore such fake accounts are active. Such illegal activities should be put to a stop by the help of law. Country’s home minister should take an initiative in this. And he should start with his party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-raut-seeks-curbs-on-fake-social-media-has-an-advice-for-amit-shah/story-Uql3742dANHpIPmrZ2kL6O.html

Addressing the fifth episode of his weekly Sunday Samvaad, Vardhan was asked by a person why Ayurvedic treatment was being advertised with various claims when the efficacy of Ayurvedic immunity boosters isn’t fully established for Covid-19 treatment yet. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The health minister addressed the query by saying, “Ayurveda has a holistic approach towards disease management wherein salutogenesis is a major approach towards treatment of a disease condition and its prevention.” Therefore, for prophylactic care against Covid-19, Ayurveda interventions are prescribed after in-depth study of literature, scientific studies, including, in silico studies, experimental studies, and clinical studies, he said.He added that the ministry has conceptualised and promoted public advisories about the use of time-tested and evidence based natural Ayush remedies for health promotion and immunity modulation of the people during the Covid-19 pandemic. The interventions advocated for Covid-19 like guduchi, ashwagandha, Ayush 64 and a guduchi and peepli combination have a substantial number of studies which prove their immunomodulatory antiviral, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties, Vardhan explained.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage These interventions have also shown a good binding affinity with Covid-19 virus in in silico studies, he added. Furthermore, on the recommendations of the interdisciplinary task force set up by the government, scientific studies have also been initiated with the aforesaid remedies to assess their impact in the prophylaxis,secondary prevention and management of Covid-19 afflicted cases, Vardhan said. His remarks come in the backdrop of questions being raised against the release of Ayush-based National Clinical Management Protocol earlier this week for the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 cases based on alternative therapies.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) had questioned the minister on whether the proponents of this claim and his ministry were prepared to subject themselves as volunteers to an independent prospective double-blind control study in prevention and treatment of Covid-19. The largest body of private practitioners in the field of allopathy had said that science demanded reproducibility of a claim elsewhere in non-conflict situations, and double blind control studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayurved-has-holistic-approach-harsh-vardhan-on-ayush-based-covid-19-treatment/story-6iQVCmLulUPibJHPaq7RBK.html

But it is also correct that villages were neglected. The people who were in power for a long time, they talked big, but left villages and poor uncared for, amid difficulties. I will not do this. I will work for you. For the Dalit, poor, oppressed and deprived. Because we don’t want them to be dependent on anyone,” he said.The prime minister said that people in villages did not have banking accounts, electricity, toilets, piped water supply or gas connections. Many were homeless and now 2 crore people have got concrete houses. “Those remaining will also get it and I am working towards it,” he said.“To keep villages deprived has been the basis of politics of some. We have started the campaign to free the poor of deprivation. Some people feel that if the villages, poor, farmers, tribals develop, who will bow before them? Their shop will shut down,” Modi said.He alleged that these were the people who wanted the problems to continue. “These people now have a problem with the historic agricultural reforms. They are worried but their worries are centered on their interests. Generation after generation, with a huge system of dalals and bribe-seekers, they had created their own ‘maya-jaal’(web of illusions). People of the country have begun dismantling their maya-jaal,” said the prime minister.Modi said the country has begun recognising those who looted it and as a result these people were blindly opposing everything. He, however, added that the farmers were not following such people because they had understood their reality.Speaking about the SVAMITVA scheme, the prime minister said despite having land and house, many people did not have the papers. Now they will get papers and can get loans from banks because of the Svamitva Yojana, he said. With technologies like drones, every village can get an accurate land record. It will also end disputes and further development, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-those-opposing-them-want-to-stall-progress-says-pm/story-y2yChPLh3BWSwiKcEVHt5H.html

More than 60 lakh people have recovered from coronavirus until Sunday, it said.India experienced a spike in cases in September and was recording more than 90,000 cases between September 6 and September 20. The number of fresh cases started dropping from September 21 onwards and India has seen a decline in the number of daily cases since.The country took 13 days to reach seven million cases from six million mark. Most of these cases were reported from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Barring Kerala and Karnataka, all the other states have seen their caseloads reaching their peaks.However, experts say that the festival season which is a week away from now has the potential to elevate the number of cases ahead of the winter season. The health ministry has issued a set of standard operating procedures to ensure that social distancing is maintained during the festivities.Doctors fear that if the number of cases rise after the festive season, as seen in Kerala after Onam, the gains made in the weeks leading up to the festivities could be lost.“We have to work aggressively to make sure that during winter months and during the festive season coronavirus cases don’t rise dramatically,” AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria told the Associated Press.

Under the scheme - HT first reported about it on October 8 - land parcels in rural areas were mapped using drones. This will help in revenue collection and ensure clarity on property rights in rural areas.“When one becomes the owner of their house, their self respect is restored. One feels secure and strong,” PM Modi said while interacting with beneficieries of the scheme.“The launch of physical distribution of property cards is another historic step towards a self-reliant India,” PM Modi said, adding that the day it is being launched on is also significant. “Today is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and social reformer Nanaji Deshmukh. These two leaders worked tirelessly for rural development,” PM said.SVAMITVA scheme is aimed at creating accurate land documentation, reducing property-related disputes and increasing liquidity of land parcels. “The scheme will also help villagers in taking loans. If they have proper documents of their land and properties, no bank can deny them loans,” PM Modi said.“Only one third of the world’s population has documents of their property... I cannot let the rural population be dependent on others, I have to work towards making them self-reliant,” he said, hailing the scheme for utilising modern means of technology to benefit millions of rural property owners. The scheme’s pilot project is being implemented in as many as 763 villages, including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and two from Karnataka.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat were also present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-property-cards-under-svamitva-scheme/story-knEHM47d5uBehZavyHwJBN.html
11-10-2020||India||MGNREGS to expand further; for second time this year||Officials said that they aim to provide 320 crore man days of work—about 40 crore man days higher than the first estimate after the world’s largest job scheme saw an unprecedented demand – because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Eight big states, including the most populous Uttar Pradesh (UP), have requested for more work allocation from the Centre under the MGNREGA, 2005. The demand coincides with the economy’s sharp contraction by 23.9% in the first quarter of this financial year. Also read: Unused rural funds hint migrants may be back at work in citiesMany economists have argued that the country may see a demand shock in the coming months due to increased unemployment and wage cuts. The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had predicted on Friday that the country could see its worst-ever recession this financial year, as the economy is tipped to contract by 9.5%. In May, the Central government had pumped in an additional Rs 40,000 crore to beef up the MGNREGS funds to Rs 1 lakh crore, as a part of its stimulus package. It had also raised the job target from the first estimate of 281 man days of work to 300 man days. Officials said 221.9 crore man days of work has been completed as on October 7 and more than Rs. 65,000 crore have been released until September 5, signalling a requirement for additional funds for the demand-driven programme. Internal notes of the Union ministry of rural development (RD) showed that since May, the average number of workers in every month has been substantially higher than the corresponding month in the last financial year. “Average number of persons to whom work was offered in May has been 2.51 crore per day, which was 73% higher than the one had offered in May last year, which was 1.45 crore persons per day. Similarly, work was offered to an average of 3.35 crore people per day in June, which was 92% higher than the corresponding period last year,” said the note. “The average in July (114%), August (97%), September (86%) and October (109%) was higher than last year,” it added.Officials said that even after the target was enhanced to 300 crore man days for work for this financial year, eight states have demanded more allocation of work. “Big states such as UP, Rajasthan, Telangana. Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal have asked for an additional labour budget. We are looking at generating 320 man days of work now,” said an official. Jugal Kishore Mohapatra, a former secretary in the RD ministry, said: “The enhanced target of 320 crore man days of work is doable. But the need of the hour is to focus on areas, where poverty levels are high but demand is low due to various reasons. For instance, UP has a poverty share of 20% but its MGNREGS share is 10%. This is not a reflection of demand but capacity constraints. Effort should made to augment demand in such places for a more equitable distribution of MGNREGS benefits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mgnregs-to-expand-further-for-second-time-this-year/story-MnIYnHkmXzUMMxpUSSRofN.html

Government medical college forensic department assistant professor Doctor Rajkumari Bansal had taken a leave of three days from October 4 to 6 and went to Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit victim, who died in a Delhi hospital on September 29 from injuries sustained when she was allegedly gang-raped. She denies having participated in any protest. The medical college dean PK Kasar said Rajkumari Bansal didn’t inform the medical college administration about the purpose of taking leave. “We came to know from media reports that Rajkumari Bansal participated in a protest in Hathras. According to service rules, she can’t take part in any protest as she is a government officer. The notice has been served to her and her reply has been sought within a week. Further action will be subject to her reply.” Talking to media persons Rajkumari Bansal said, “After the gang rape incident, I couldn’t sleep properly for two days. I decided to go to Hathras to console the family and to look into the medical reports of the victim. I stayed there for two days on the request of the family members.” “During my stay, Bhim Army president Chandrashekhar Ravan came to meet the family. Some people and media persons shot my videos, which are now going viral on social media and some people have even called me a Maoist. Scandalous and baseless allegations are being levelled against me,” she added. She further said, “I went there for the sake of humanity. I didn’t participate in any protest. I met Chandrashekhar for the first time and I am not a member of Bhim Army.”“I will reply to the notice. I am going to lodge a complaint to the cyber cell of police against those people who are circulating my videos with defamatory comments, said the doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jabalpur-medical-college-doctor-served-notice-for-taking-part-in-hathras-protest/story-Q0Fox8lZOnWCXeCWtXBhmI.html

11-10-2020||India||Hathras case exposes rift among local BJP leaders; its Rajvir vs Rajvir||The Hathras case has brought the differences among local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders out in the open in the western UP district, especially between two Rajvirs, both with divurgent views on the brutality the 19-year old Dalit woman was subjected to and whose death sparked a national outrage. Local MP Rajvir Singh Diler has courted criticism from some within the party for reaching out to the family of the Dalit woman. In fact, his daughter Manju Diler, too has been criticised for seeking justice for the victim. “My decision to reach out to the victim’s family is being seen by some narrow-minded people through the prism of caste. But I was guided by the simple principle that as a local MP, I will have to stand by the victim. Had the victim not been a Valmiki, I would have still gone out and raised my voice for them.As for the party, we have full faith in the government,” said the Hathras MP.Rajvir Diler belongs to the same Dalit sub caste (Valmiki) as the victim, a point that had been previously raised by the party’s former Hathras MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalwan, an upper caste Thakur, who accused the media of ‘sullying’ the image of Hathras and that of the government. Also Read: CBI handed Hathras case probePehalwan, who convened a mahapanchayat to defend the four accused, minced no words in denouncing the victim. “The victim had initially said that she was attacked by one person. Till that point even I felt, irrespective of his or her caste, it was not right to treat anyone this way. But, four days later, three more persons were added, then, a case of rape was added. How come the victim took four days to realise that?” Pehalwan asked. He also said, “I am following my ‘kshatriya dharam’ and standing on the side of truth, thus I have welcomed the recommendation for the CBI probe. The accused should be immediately released as it is a fabricated case.”About Rajvir Singh Diler and his daughter Manju, the former MLA said, “They were not aware of the facts in the beginning. Thus, they were swayed by emotions and took the side of the victim’s family, but are now silent after knowing the truth. In the initial week, everyone was in the dark, including the media.”“I blame the media, print and electronic, for sullying the image of Hathras and the government. The truth will come out and that’s when I expect the media to apologise. Everybody knows that the arrested accused are from a poor background and are innocent, thus deserving an immediate release,” he said without taking any further queries. Also Read: Centre asks states to act on rape lawThe MP’s daughter, Manju Diler, had written to the UP director general of police HC Awasthy on September 19, seeking action against the four ‘upper caste’ accused, Sandeep, Ravi, Ramu and Luv Kush, and accused them of gang rape and even sought suspension of the then station house officer of Chandapa police station in Hathras for not acting fairly in the case. She too has attracted criticism. While Manju couldn’t be reached, her father and local Hathras MP defended her. “Her only fault is that as a member of Safai Karmachari Ayog, she was approached by some people seeking justice and she forwarded their plea to the authorities. What’s wrong? I want to know whether helping the aggrieved is wrong in any way,” Diler asked. When asked who was behind this, Rajvir Diler said, “opposition parties.”However, aides of Rajvir Diler claim that Pehalwan has been attacking the MP and defending the accused to hog the limelight. Rajvir Diler hit out at Pehalwan for defaming the party. “Tell me when the chief minister promptly set up an SIT, recommended a CBI probe, where was the need for a mahapanchayat? Now, a narco test has been ordered too. We did what we could and now it’s the job of the agencies to inquire,” Rajvir Diler said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-exposes-rift-among-local-bjp-leaders-its-rajvir-vs-rajvir/story-gMJOrDz2ruhPNjHy9h3n7O.html

These cards are physical copies of property titles of the villagers’ homes and the surrounding areas they own (as opposed to the cultivated land).The SVAMITVA scheme, which was launched by the PM in April, enables rural masses to use property as a financial asset, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Friday.PM Modi will interact with some of the beneficiaries of the scheme as part of the event in which cards will be handed over to around 132,000 landowners. Union minister for panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar will be present in the programme. कल का दिन ग्रामीण भारत के लिए एक बड़ा सकारात्मक परिवर्तन लाने वाला है। सुबह 11 बजे स्वामित्व योजना के अंतर्गत संपत्ति कार्ड के वितरण का शुभारंभ किया जाएगा। यह योजना करोड़ों भारतीयों के जीवन में मील का पत्थर साबित होगी। #SampatiSeSampantahttps://t.co/OQUEPSGCjrAccording to the PMO, the beneficiaries are from 763 villages including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and two from Karnataka. Beneficiaries from all states except Maharashtra will receive physical copies of the property cards within one day but since the western state has a system of recovering the nominal cost of these cards, it will take a month’s time there, the PMO statement read.The scheme is being implemented across the country in a phased manner. It will cover 662,000 villages from 2020 to 2024 and pave the way for using property as a financial asset by villagers for taking loans and other financial benefits, the statement added.Millions of rural property owners will benefit from the first of its kind scheme that involves the most modern means of technology, the PMO claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-property-cards-under-svamitva-scheme-today/story-66gTsa9jzbZJfbPmlofk7I.html

11-10-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 7 million||Total cases of Covid-19 in India crossed seven million on Saturday and the total number of recovered patients surpassed six million, with an apparent slowdown visible in the rate of new infections across the country in recent weeks.The latest million infections have come in 13 days, compared to the previous million cases coming in 12 days – a statistic that highlights how new cases in the country are relenting. Over 107,000 people have lost their lives to the viral disease in the seven months since the outbreak started in India in early March.Click here for full covid-19 coverageAs of late on Saturday, there were 7,051,165 total cases of Covid-19, 108,374 deaths, while 6,074,507 people had recovered from the disease, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. The first wave of Covid-19, however, appears to be receding for the first time, with cases seeing a steady drop for three consecutive weeks now. Experts have, however, warned that with the festive season coming up, the curve may rise again if people let their guard down. The seven-day average of daily cases in India touched 93,617 on September 16, the highest till date. Since then, however, this number (also referred to as the daily case trajectory) has been dropping steadily and stands at 72,003 on Saturday — down around 23% from the peak.This drop in the rate of new cases is evident if the country’s seven million infections are broken into phases of million cases. While it took 137 days for the first million cases, the subsequent million new infections came in 21, 16 and 13 days. India touched five million cases on September 15, 11 days from the day it hit four million. From there, however, the duration has gradually increased – six million cases took 12 days, while the seven million mark was hit in 13 days. This reversal in trajectory has been led by the some of the states that have so far caused the national spike in cases — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi. Together, these four states have been responsible for 46% of all infections and new infections have dropped from peak levels in the first half of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-7-million/story-sHeZ60Ydcql4eVxr94DKEN.html
11-10-2020||India||Covid detection with CRISPR, phones in offing||Researchers in the US led by the 2020 Nobel laureate for chemistry Jennifer Doudna have used a CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop a rapid, portable, accurate, and low-cost mobile-based test that can detect the pandemic coronavirus (Sars-CoV2) in five minutes. This new CRISPR diagnostic method doesn’t amplify coronavirus RNA but uses multiple guide RNAs that work in tandem to increase the sensitivity of the test, said the research team in the yet to be peer-reviewed study published in the pre-print server medRxiv. The test does not require expensive lab equipment, and can be deployed for rapid point-of-care testing at doctor’s offices, schools, and office buildings. The diagnostic gold standard for coronavirus disease diagnosis is the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test, which takes five to six hours to produce result. CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilises RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate, said Doudna’s team. “The assay achieved ~100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Combined with mobile phone-based quantification, this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening to aid in the control of SARS-CoV-2,” write researchers. The test also quantifies the amount of virus in a sample, with the strength of the fluorescent signal proportional to the amount of virus in a sample. This cannot be done in standard Covid-19 tests that amplify the virus’ genetic material to detect it. Detecting a patient’s viral load can guide treatment decisions. The test needs validation before it is commercially available.CRISPR diagnosis work by identifying a sequence of RNA—about 20 RNA bases long—that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. They do so by creating a “guide RNA” that is complementary to the target RNA sequence so it binds to it in solution. The binding turns on the CRISPR tool’s Cas13 “scissors” enzyme that cuts single-stranded RNA to release a separately introduced fluorescent particle in the test solution. These fluorescent particles light up to when hit with laser light, signaling the presence of the virus. CRISPR diagnostics is already being used for Sars-CoV-2 detection, but the new test is the fastest CRISPR-based diagnostic yet. “I think this is an interesting new approach that is faster because it doesn’t have an amplification step. But, because it doesn’t have the amplification step, it cannot easily detect low viral loads unlike qRT-PCR or FELUDA. The five minutes result is only when starting from RNA with high amount of virus. For usual samples it will be more than 30 minutes. The device requirement is not zero but low - a constant temperature holder and a laser illumination optical box. I think CRISPR based tests will see a lot of innovation and it is a good sign for the fight against COVID-19,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), New Delhi. Scientist from CSIR-IGIB have also developed a precise and cost-effective strip test named after a popular Satyajit Ray detective FELUDA to detect Covid-19 in one hour, starting from RNA to giving a visual readout on the strip. FELUDA, which is an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Linked Uniform Detection Assay, uses CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It has been developed by CSIR-IGIB senior scientists Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty and Dr Souvik Maiti. FELUDA tests work by combining CRISPR biology and paper strip chemistry. A Cas9 protein, a component of the CRISPR system, is barcoded to interact specifically with the Sars-CoV2 sequence in the patient’s genetic material. The complex of Cas9 with Sars-CoV2 is then applied to a paper strip, where using two lines (one control, one test) make it possible to determine if the test sample was infected with Covid-19. Going forward, CRISPR-based tests have the potential for modification to detect the next emerging virus and rapidly scale up testing, if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-detection-with-crispr-phones-in-offing/story-AhGdupxyCIAQOfSiCnQ56O.html
11-10-2020||India||CBI handed Hathras case probe||The Centre on Saturday issued a notification handing over the probe into the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras in September to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). An official familiar with the development said the agency will re-register the FIR filed by the UP police in the gang rape and murder case. The notification has been marked to a suitable branch of CBI and probe teams, along with forensic experts, will be dispatched to the crime scene after the registration of an FIR, the official added.However, a senior CBI official who didn’t wish to be named, said that federal agency will not be taking over probe into the case related to alleged criminal conspiracy to spread caste conflict, instigating violence, incidents of vicious propaganda by sections of media and political interests. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court earlier this week, the UP government had said that a probe by central agency would obviate hindrance being created by certain vested interests in the fair and impartial investigation. It had added that a CBI probe will ensure that no vested interests will be able to create a fake and false narrative with oblique motives. In Hathras, elaborate security cover has been provided to the victim’s family members, who are slated to appear before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Monday.“The district administration and police are drafting a plan for the journey of the victim’s family to Lucknow so that they may appear before the court on October 12. Finer details are being worked out and it is to be decided when to leave Hathras for Lucknow and how many security personnel would accompany the family members,” said Hathras superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal.Police officials said the victim’s family has been provided a layered security cover. “For the purpose of documentation of those coming to meet the family, a register is being maintained and names of those reaching the house are being noted,” said deputy inspector general (DIG) of police Shalabh Mathur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-handed-hathras-case-probe/story-4x6yUeZQWRSpvkn1zPVY4N.html
11-10-2020||India||Centre asks states to act on rape law||The Union home ministry has issued a fresh advisory to states and Union Territories to ensure that investigations into crimes against women are completed within two months, and dying declarations are not discarded just because they were not recorded by a magistrate, a move that came shortly before the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was handed the probe into the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman in Hathras that has sparked national outrage.In the three-page advisory issued late on Friday evening, the Centre directed that there should be compulsory registration of an FIR in case of a cognisable offence under the CrPC (criminal procedure code), and any failure of the police to adhere to rules does not augur well for the delivery of justice. For crimes that are not under the jurisdiction of a police station, a “Zero FIR” should be registered as per the law, the advisory said. A “Zero FIR” can be filed at any police station irrespective of the place of incident or jurisdiction.The advisory said that officials who fail to file an FIR in relation with cognisable offences should be punished.According to the declaration of the Hathras victim, she was raped and badly beaten up by four men on September 14. She was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 28 in a serious condition and died early on September 29. At 2.30am the next day, the police cremated the body without the family’s consent in a field near the village.Opposition leaders and activists have held protests over the way the case was handled by the authorities, alleging negligence and delayed action in investigations. Five police officials have been suspended amid the outrage. On Saturday evening, the central government issued a notification for CBI to take over probe into the case, an official said. The home ministry told the states and UT administrations that the Section 173 of CrPC provides for completion of police investigation in relation to rape in two months and Section 164-A of CrPC provides that in rape or sexual assault investigation, the victim should be examined by a registered medical practitioner under consent within 24 hours from the time of receiving the information relating to the commission of such offence.“The statement, written or verbal by a person, who is dead, shall be treated as relevant fact in the investigation when the statement is made by a person as to the cause” of the death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction that resulted in the death, the advisory added.The Centre referred to a Supreme Court verdict dated January 7 in which the apex court said that a dying declaration that satisfies all judicial scrutiny cannot be discarded merely because it is not recorded by a magistrate or because a police officer failed to obtain attestation by any person present at the time of making of the statement.The advisory comes ahead of Monday’s hearing of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on the 19-year-old’s gang rape and her rushed cremation. The Supreme Court is also hearing a petition in the matter. At a hearing last week, an SC bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde described the crime as a “horrible” and “extraordinary”one. A special investigation team constituted by the UP government has been investigating the matter. Asking states and UTs to ensure that strict probe is carried out in such cases, the home ministry also advised them to use the national database on sexual offenders for identifying and tracking repeat criminal. “The Government of India has taken steps to strengthen legislative provisions to deal with incidents of sexual offences against women and girls. It is requested that States and UTs, may suitably issue instructions to all concerned to ensure strict compliance with the provisions in the law,” it added. “even with stringent provisions in law and several capacity building measures undertaken, any failure of police to adhere to these mandatory requirements may not augur well for the delivery of criminal justice in the country...” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-act-on-rape-law/story-U3OATxieVPq80ZbnEDPE7L.html
11-10-2020||India||Delhi gets its baseline for pollution due to impact of Covid-19 lockdown||Delhi’s baseline pollution level --- the minimum pollution when major polluting sources are shut --- is about a tenth of the peak pollution the capital witnesses, especially during the October-January period, a new study based on real time pollution data during Covid-19 lockdown this April, has found.Air quality of a place depends on overall pollution load from sources such as industries and vehicles and the local weather conditions, which impact dispersion of pollutants. Scientists from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) have published a paper in peer reviewed science journal, Current Science, providing baseline pollution level for six different pollutants for Delhi, after studying air quality levels at 34 locations in the capital, where real time pollution is monitored.“This is the first baseline pollution level data of Delhi. While background pollution is pollution which comes from outside or which would have been naturally present, baseline pollution is the minimum pollution level to which the population is chronically exposed and hence greatly relevant to epidemiological research. Such emission scenario was nearly impractical in a highly populated megacity like Delhi,” said MP George, a scientist with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and one of the team members who did the research.The study is based on average pollution levels for the city before and during the Covid-19 lockdown that kicked in pan-India from March 25, halting factories, construction sites, almost all vehicular movement and some other local sources that pollute Delhi’s air.While emission sources dropped by 85% - 90% resulting in sharp decline in pollution levels, the weather also favoured Delhi and pushed down the city’s pollution to rock bottom. “The baseline levels of PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be 38μg/m3 (± 8) and 22μg/m3 (± 6) respectively. The baseline value of NO2 was found to be 8ppb (± 3), which is considered to be very high,” states the research paper, published on October 10. The research was led by Gufran Beig, a senior scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, in Pune. Eleven researchers from IITM, DPCC, Utkal University and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) analyzed data from 34 automatic air quality monitoring stations in Delhi from February 20 to April 14 and prepared base level of seven pollutants including PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 among others. The data were compared with pollution levels of 2019 during the same period for reference purpose. The level of PM10 was found to shoot up occasionally in May despite lockdown because of dust storms bringing in pollutants from the sandy western parts of India. The findings show that even though PM10 levels remained mostly above the permissible limit of 100μg/m3 during the pre-lockdown period occasionally touching and crossing the 200μg/m3 mark, in the post lockdown period it remained much below the 100 μg/m3 mark. On Saturday at 5 pm, it was 232μg/m3, almost six time the pollution level of the baseline. The level of PM2.5 remained mostly above the permissible limit of 60μg/m3 in the pre-lockdown period and on one occasion it shot up to nearly 140μg/m3. Compared to this in the lockdown period it remained below the 40μg/m3 mark on most days and even touched 20μg/m3. On Saturday at 5 pm it was 95μg/m3, almost five times of the baseline. In winter, PM2.5 and PM10 breach their respective severe+ marks of 300ug/m3 and 500ug/m3, primarily because of poor dispersion and higher pollution load because of stubble burning in the farm rich states of Punjab and Haryana. It starts coming down from February as weather starts becoming warmer and burning also reduces. “Pollution level dropped sharply immediately after the lockdown and concentration of pollutants touched the saturation level within a few days, beyond which further decline was not possible. In the present case, each pollutant of Delhi reached the saturation level within 4–6 days after lockdown, beyond which a steady level was maintained,” the authors said in the paper. Experts have welcomed the study saying that it is this baseline pollution which the population is chronically exposed and hence greatly relevant to epidemiological research. “This is the first baseline data. Some pollution will always be there because of kitchen pollution and pollution triggered to operate emergency services, say an ambulance on the road or a thermal power plant. Such baseline-pollution scenario is practically impossible to achieve in a megacity like Delhi but the lockdown helped us to prepare the first set of baseline pollution data. We should now utilize this to redefine our air quality standards and also plan our pollution mitigation strategies,” said D Saha, former chief of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-gets-its-baseline-for-pollution-due-to-impact-of-covid-19-lockdown/story-WAEzEXq4cxC7AtlKIvLFbK.html
11-10-2020||India||Longer break may hit credit discipline: RBI to Supreme Court||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has told the Supreme Court that the moratorium on loan repayment cannot be extended beyond six months because that could affect “credit discipline”; requested the Court to lift the stay on classifying defaulting accounts as non-performing assets (NPA) because not doing so would affect the central bank’s regulatory powers; and pointed out that banking solutions cannot address the structural problems of the real estate sector. The banking regulator’s affidavit also highlighted the “proactive” steps taken by RBI in mitigating the economic impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread. It was filed in response to the ongoing case in the Supreme Court that was originally filed by Agra-based Gajendra Sharma seeking a waiver of interest on instalments deferred under the RBI’s six-month moratorium and in which several industrial bodies and associations have joined. Several experts believe that financial and banking issues are best left to the sector regulator and are not for the courts to weigh in on, especially given their complexity. RBI didn’t take this approach in its affidavit, but pointed out that a waiver could have “significant economic costs which cannot be absorbed by banks without serious dent to their financials” . It further added that the primary plea of petitioners such as Sharma has been addressed by the government’s recent decision to take on the compound cost of all loans, including retail ones, up to ₹2 crore.  In its Friday affidavit, RBI said that a moratorium exceeding six months will impact credit behaviour of borrowers and “increase the risk of delinquencies (defaults) post resumption of scheduled payments”. Continuation of moratorium will also not be in the interest of borrowers as it will exacerbate “repayment pressures”. This will further upset the overall credit discipline and impact credit creation in the economy, RBI said .The affidavit filed ahead of the Tuesday hearing on the case also urged the court to lift the stay on declaring accounts as NPAs as this decision undermines the regulatory mandate of the RBI. “An across the board stay on classification of any account as NPA…if not lifted immediately, shall have huge implications for the banking system,” RBI said. The top court on September 3 said: “The accounts which were not declared NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared NPA till further orders.”The central bank was also very clear that while it was willing to cut some slack for borrowers whose repayment abilities have been affected by the pandemic, it will do no such thing for others , and refused to offer relief to borrowers who have demanded extension of resolution plan for loans that were overdue beyond 30 days as on March 1, 2020. “An account which was impacted by pandemic as well as had a pre-existing financial has a different risk profile as compared to an account without pre-existing stress and to treat both borrowers on equal footing would be gross suspension of economic sensibilities,” it said. On October 2, the Finance Ministry informed the SC of its decision to waive off the compound interest accruing during the moratorium. This “interest on interest” waiver was applicable to loans of up to Rs 2 crore taken by individuals or micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). When the matter was last heard on Monday, a three judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said it could not find any notification by which this relief had been implemented. The bench, also comprising Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah asked the Union government and RBI to highlight this on affidavit and also desired to know what relief was in place to address sector-specific issues, for businesses such as real estate and power. RBI filed the KV Kamath Committee recommendations which lay down financial parameters for restructuring 26 industries. It stated that sectors such as power and real estate were already stressed even before the outbreak of the pandemic. “The travails of real sector cannot be solved through banking regulations,” RBI added, pointing to the burden of unsold inventories and stalled projects that is crushing the real estate industry.The central bank’s affidavit explained that by a September 7 notification, it had laid down the thresholds for the 26 sectors based on Kamath Committee recommendations. This specifically addressed the issues concerning power and real estate. The affidavit stated that even in respect of borrowers who were in financial difficulty when the pandemic broke out, there will be no bar on restructuring such accounts as the lending institutions will be free to make their own assessment. Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said the concern of RBI is genuine and well founded. “Further Extension of moratorium would have been catastrophic for the quality of banking portfolio and to the credit culture of the borrowers. Wish courts let regulators take decisions based on sound economic practices. We should also not forget that banks raise funds from small depositors and retail shareholders and any further extension would have put their stakes at risk,” Vijayasarathy added. Chartered accountant Vijay Kumar Gupta, former Central Council Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said, “The banking regulator should be allowed to take prudent decisions so that the sector should not fall sick, which will have larger and adverse implications for the economy. Borrowers must, however, be protected through fiscal stimulus and budgetary measures.” Along with the RBI, the Centre too filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court in the loan moratorium case. The ministry of finance, in its affidavit filed on Friday, told the Court that the decision to waive off “interest on interest” will have to undergo appraisal by the Expenditure Finance Committee and thereafter would be placed for approval of the Union Cabinet. Only then the decision will mature into an Office Memorandum or circular or order. The reply came pursuant to a query put by the Court on Monday asking the Centre when the notification announcing waiver on compound interest on repayment of loans during moratorium will be issued. Its only after the notification will be issued, the lending institutions will be in a position to implement the Scheme. Further, the Centre urged the Court not to entertain further judicial review on the petitions pending before it as “fiscal policy is the remit of Government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/longer-break-may-hit-credit-discipline-rbi-to-supreme-court/story-GEetGMjZjAcz362qH0XnoN.html
11-10-2020||India||Triple Talaq crusader Shayara Bano joins BJP in Dehradun||Triple talaq crusader Shayara Bano who was among the first petitioners in the Supreme Court against the practice of Triple Talaq or instant divorce in the Muslim community, joined the BJP at its state headquarters in Dehradun on Saturday. Bano, a resident of US Nagar district in the state joined the party in the presence of state president and MLA Bansidhar Bhagat and other senior leaders. Bano had shot into limelight in 2016 when she filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Triple Talaq, which the NDA government later made a punishable offence. Expressing her gratitude on joining BJP, Bano said she joined the national party as she was ‘influenced by its principles’.“Not only was I highly influenced with BJP’s principles, I also looked upon PM Modi as my ideal. These are the reasons that I decided to join BJP,” Bano said.She also said that she was impressed with the BJP-led NDA government’s fight against the Triple Talaq by bringing in a law against it. “What this party’s government did was for the welfare of crores of Muslim women in this country.”“In future I am ready to shoulder any responsibility given by the party leadership,” said Bano. BJP state unit president Bhagat who welcomed her into the party said, “The determination with which Bano fought the battle against Triple Talaq in Supreme Court, I am sure she will carry forward the principles of BJP with the same determination.”The Congress meanwhile called the development as BJP’s tactic to “divert the attention of the public from real issues”.“It is purely an attention diverting tactic by BJP. When they should talk about real issues like unemployment, price rise, falling GDP, they are busy raking up issues like Triple Talaq and enabling new joinees in the party like Shayara Bano,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, party state vice president. Calling Bano a mere ‘pawn’ in the hands of BJP he said, “BJP has been using such pawns to target minorities and appease the majority and harming the social fabric of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/triple-talaq-crusader-shayara-bano-joins-bjp-in-dehradun/story-GiVpWQBh5KhqKxLNjfz5sM.html
11-10-2020||India||Verifying authenticity of video claiming jawans have non-bulletproof vehicles: CRPF||Hours after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday tweeted a video in which some troops allege that they were being made to travel in a non-bulletproof vehicle for operational duties, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) issued a statement saying it was ascertaining the authenticity of the video. “The authenticity of the video is being probed into by CRPF. CRPF has adequate protective vehicles to meet varied operational requirements,” said DIG Moses Dhinakaran, spokesperson for CRPF in a statement. Gandhi attacked the government over the provision of non-bullet proof vehicles for soldiers while spending Rs 8,400 crore to procure aircraft for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Is this justice?” he asked on Twitter along with a video of a purported conversation among soldiers being transported in non-bullet proof vehicles.“Our jawans are being sent in non-bullet proof trucks to get martyred and Rs 8,400 crore aircraft is bought for the PM! Is this justice,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. The video shows a conversation between soldiers objecting to their transportation in a non-bullet proof vehicle, while their seniors were using bullet-proof vehicles.The jawans also complained that by doing so their lives were being compromised and the authorities were playing with their and their families’ lives.The government has recently brought two VVIP planes for travel of the President, Prime Minister and Vice President, even as it maintained that the process for procuring the two aircraft had begun under the UPA government, and the current dispensation has only brought it to a logical conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verifying-authenticity-of-video-claiming-jawans-have-non-bulletproof-vehicles-crpf/story-AB6B39m8irFLVYCkrt2HjP.html
11-10-2020||India||YSRC accuses high court, top court judge of trying to topple its govt||The Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday accused Supreme Court judge N V Ramana and the state high court of attempting to destabilise and topple the YSR Congress government in the state led by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy under the directions of Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu. The allegations, which could not be verified by Hindustan Times, were made in a press conference in Hyderabad late on Saturday evening. The state government also issued a statement to this effect. A letter written by Reddy to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, in which the chief minister detailed his allegations about the proximity of Justice Ramana to Naidu, and the adversarial stance taken by the high court against his government’s decisions as well as investigations into charges against judicial officers and their relatives, was also released at the conference. The letter had detailed annexures listing specific judgements, and naming judges of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. HT could not immediately reach Justice Ramana, the second senior most judge in the apex court after CJI Bobde. Neither he nor his assistant could be reached over phone; and the phone at his official residence was answered by a person who said the judge wasn’t at home. This is the first time that the Jagan government has made a direct attack on the higher judiciary, though his party leaders and ministers have been making statements against high court judges for stalling various decisions of the government, including the so-called three capitals plan. In his letter to CJI Bobde, Reddy accused the state judiciary of being biased in favour of the TDP and its interests in the nature of the orders passed staying investigation, staying enquiry, even in admitting cases for hearing. The press conference was addressed by the CM’s principal advisor Ajeya Kallam ; this is likely the first time a sitting chief minister has made an allegation of such a serious nature against one of the senior most judges in the Supreme Court. Also Read: Days after meeting Amit Shah, Jagan Reddy meets PM Modi; seeks Centre’s help for 3 capitalsThe government said in its statement that the state high court has entertained several writ petitions against the Reddy government’s decisions, including a bill on the creation of three capitals bills, in order to protect the vested interests in Amaravati, the new capital identified by the Naidu government that was previously in power in the state. The decision to shift the capital of Andhra Pradesh from Amaravati was taken by the Reddy government after it came to power. Nearly 30 public interest litigation petitions (PILs) were filed at various stages of legitimate government functioning, impleading the chief minister as a respondent, the statement pointed out. In his letter to CJI Bobde, Reddy referred to Justice Ramana’s proximity to Naidu. He also added that Justice Ramana as “influencing the sittings of the High Court including the roster .... and ... matters important to the TDP have been allocated to a few” judges. The annexures listed these cases and the orders issued by the judges.  Justice Ramana started influencing the judiciary in the state through chief justice Jitendra Kumar Maheswari, the statement by the state government claimed. “Justice Ramana influenced the roster of high court judges so that important matters of policy and protection for Naidu’s interests were posted before a few judges including Justice A V Sesha Sai, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy, Justice D V S S Somayyajulu and Justice D Ramesh,” the statement added. Reddy ended his letter to CJI Bobde by seeking him to initiate steps to ensure the neutrality of the state judiciary, and offered to substantiate all the details provided in the annexure to his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrc-accuses-high-court-top-court-judge-of-trying-to-topple-its-govt/story-gtoRFO8JMCWmgTYV3WCbcL.html
11-10-2020||India||Covid-19 tests in Delhi gradually declining again||Testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi appears to be slowly dropping from its peak levels again, even as new infections in the Capital continue to go down after a spike in cases a month ago forced the Delhi government to ramp up testing.The proportion of RT-PCR tests, considered the gold standard for Covid-19 diagnosis, however, has remained high despite the dip in overall tests.Delhi conducted 59,368 daily tests on average for the week ending September 20, what has been the city’s highest recorded rate of testing till date. Since then, this number dropped to 49,102 in the past week — down by around 17%. In the same period, the national average of daily tests increased from 1,021,881 tests a day to 1,135,471 — an increase of around 11%. To be sure, the national capital reported a near three-fold increase in testing in September from levels in July and August after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held an emergency meeting in the final week of August to address the resurgence of cases in the city. The CM said then that the government would at least double daily tests to 40,000 a day, but the government ended up boosting testing to nearly 60,000 a day at its peak. However, since September 20, the testing numbers have seen a near-steady decline.Despite this decline, the proportion of RT-PCR tests has not dropped. On average, nearly 20% of tests conducted in the last week have been RT-PCR. This is the highest this proportion has been in nearly a month – 21% of tests were RT-PCR for the week ending September 12.On Saturday, Delhi added 2,866 cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of infections in the city to 306,559. Daily deaths, meanwhile, continued to rise with 48 new fatalities reported on Saturday taking the total deaths in the city to 5,740.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said: “Delhi government has set up adequate number of test centres with all necessary facilities. We can assure you that no individual who wants to get tested for Covid-19 is sent back at any of these test centres. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has continuously been urging people to get tested. In the coming days, we are going to intensify the Covid-19 awareness campaign, aiming at encouraging more people to get themselves tested.”“As for the RT-PCR tests, we are following the ICMR guidelines. We are using the rapid antigen test in the containment zones, all the symptomatic patients who test negative are re-tested using RT PCR. Anyone who asks for it can also get it. The number of tests conducted will depend on the number of tests needed, no matter what our capacity is,” said Jain. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Delhi has a population of 20 million and the number of people who have had the infection is still very small. High level of testing has to be sustained till there is a low pool of susceptible population or a vaccine is available,” he said. “The general rule of thumb to check whether testing is adequate is a sustained positivity rate of 5% or less. What are you testing with matters as well? The ICMR testing strategy has to be followed. Anyone outside the containment zones have to be tested using RT-PCR which is much more accurate. Another thing we need to see is that how many tests are needed for us to find one positive cases. If that number is coming down, then we aren’t testing enough. In Delhi, this number stands at just about 17 to 18 per cent, this should at least be 30. Some of the countries conduct about 200 tests to get one positive case,” said Dr Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tests-in-delhi-gradually-declining-again/story-iGo7BqXt4pBB8L5ydcKfGK.html
