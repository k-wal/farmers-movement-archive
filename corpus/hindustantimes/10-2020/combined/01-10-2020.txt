01-10-2020||News||The Opposition must respect Parliament||Congress Member of Parliament (MP) Kapil Sibal, in an article in Hindustan Times on September 20, has made baseless allegations against the Narendra Modi government, when he called Parliament Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant), in that it did not need the Opposition voice. The monsoon session of Parliament was to have 18 sittings spread over 18 days without any break. All necessary arrangements were made in keeping with Covid-19 safety protocols. After consultations with the leaders of various political parties, a schedule was finalised which included dispensing with Question Hour. Unstarred questions, Special Mentions and other business were allowed by the chairpersons of the Houses. The leaders of various parties wanted the session to be concluded early keeping in mind the Covid-19 risk.The Opposition has repeatedly undermined the mandate given to Prime Minister (PM) Modi. They have been trying to block reform-related bills presented in Parliament. Important legislations such as the Triple Talaq Bill, Enemy Property Bill and Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill were delayed, thanks to the Opposition.The Opposition has brought disrepute to the institution of Parliament by the conduct of their Rajya Sabha MPs on September 20 during the debate on the farm reforms bills. After creating a ruckus in Parliament, these parties are trying to lay the blame at the doorstep of the government and the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha. The Opposition has no respect for the people’s mandate. It is trying to create false narratives.  Democracy does not envisage a consensus on all issues. Every MP is free to express their views without any influence or coercion on subjects which arise in Parliament. But no one has the right to violate the rights and privileges of other members in regard to freedom of speech.During the debate on the farm bills, 109 members of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) were present while only 70 members of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) were in the House as per the attendance register. Some Opposition members had sought a leave of absence. The conduct of parliamentary proceedings in the Rajya Sabha on September 20, under the supervision of the deputy chairman, was strictly as per the constitutional mandate and Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business. The farm bills were discussed for more than the time allocated by the Business Advisory Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The Opposition is trying to create the impression that sense of the House means consensus in the House, which is a clear misrepresentation of constitutional and parliamentary rules. All decisions are taken in Parliament based on the majority. Allegations regarding the deputy chairman not allowing division on statutory resolutions and amendments sought by Opposition members, while these bills were being passed, are false. There are two basic conditions for seeking division in the House: The member seeking division should be in his seat, and the House should be in order so that the division may be conducted. Some members who demanded division were not in their seats, and this is a matter of record. The Opposition created all sorts of problems in the House such as tearing the rule book and formula papers of the Chair, sloganeering, manhandling officials of the secretariat and marshals, and standing on the tables of Rajya Sabha officials. Their conduct was not only in violation of the privileges of Parliament for which Parliament can penalise them (eight members were suspended from the service of the House for the remaining session), but also in violation of the Indian Penal Code for which action can be taken as there is no immunity for criminal conduct even in Parliament. Kapil Sibal also claimed that Question Hour, an essential element of parliamentary democracy, has been dispensed with and that way, executive accountability to Parliament has been eroded. As per practice on a particular day, in ordinary circumstances, 20 starred and 230 unstarred questions are listed in the Lok Sabha while 15 starred and 160 unstarred questions are listed in the Rajya Sabha. During this session, only starred questions were dispensed with, keeping in view the special circumstances. On a daily basis, the government has replied to 230/160 questions in the respective Houses. A false impression is being created of abrogation of executive accountability to Parliament. He has also criticised the passage of bills relating to ordinances without reference to the Standing Committees. This is baseless because such bills are usually not referred to committees since they are required to be replaced by Acts of Parliament within six weeks from reassembly of Parliament under Article 123 of the Constitution. It is not practically possible for Committees to examine and give reports on the bills in such a short time. Sibal made scathing personal attacks attributing different negative aspects to the PM while not saying a single word about his own party’s leader who was missing for the whole monsoon session. All this acrimony on the part of the Opposition in Parliament is symptomatic of a mindset that brooks no tolerance for the people’s mandate and majority in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-opposition-must-respect-parliament/story-86G5D41ano2bBu2Y5n4M8M.html
01-10-2020||News||Those who invested in clean energy early must now be given the benefits||Clean and renewable energy sources have moved up on the agenda of most nations today. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the world energy mix is changing, and the contribution of renewable energy has grown to 26% of the energy basket. With governments adopting more sustainable sources of energy supply, the share of renewable energy source is expected to reach 30% by 2024.India has drawn up a progressive road map to lessen its dependence on coal and liquid hydrocarbon and build more renewable capacity instead. From 17.5 gigawatt (GW) in June 2010, India has added another 65 GW in 10 years. This has been possible largely due to the promotional regulatory and market structure which steered the renewable energy (RE) sector for a decade.It’s high time now that the consumer who had paid substantially for the promotion of RE generation is allowed to reap the benefits. Today solar and wind generation costs are much lower than even the conventional coal-based generation.The conventional and RE power segments are linked through the renewable power purchase obligation (RPO) which binds obligators (like Discoms, captive power plants) to either buy electricity-generated by specified ‘green’ sources, or buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the market. Government and the regulator-introduced RECs is a market-based instrument to promote renewable energy and facilitate compliance of renewable purchase obligations (RPO) by obligators who do not have solar RE generating resources like land, roofs or 270 days sunshine.Today, with the price of renewable energy falling below the purchase cost, the developer of renewable energy has to charge the consumer a reasonable price. Solar REC prices are as high as Rs 2.25 per unit, while solar power (i.e. power plus REC certificate) has been getting auctioned at an average rate of around Rs 2.50 /kwh since FY17-18.The plight of discoms (and their consumers) s further aggravated by delays in revising and publishing the revised ‘floor’ and ‘forbearance’ price for RECs by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) due to avoidable litigations by interested parties (RE generators) who want to benefit from current system which is skewed in their favour. This has resulted in unnecessary financial burden on consumers / obligators / conventional power distributors.Therefore, protection must be provided to the consumer from unreasonable REC prices. However, keeping the floor price at zero instead of making it obligatory to sell RECs at discounted price and keeping the forbearance price higher than zero is violative of the Electricity Act, 2003. The developers of RE generators have gained unreasonable recovery in addition to the admissible RE tariff. Until, the new pricing is notified by CERC, the inflated REC price will continue to burden the obligated entities. These entities will be required to pay high solar REC price that is not in line with the current market price for wind and solar energy. This is when the tariffs of solar and wind projects have declined considerably. However, the inflated price of solar REC continues to put a huge burden on consumers / obligators.In a progressive move, the Central commission (CERC) had taken note of this and reduced the forbearance and floor prices of RECs in June 2020. In the present scenario of low RE prices , it would not be misplaced to consider a negative price for the RECs and pass on the benefits to the consumer who has been funding the RE promotion by paying a higher tariff for a decade.Manish Garg is a regulatory expert and consultantThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/those-who-invested-in-clean-energy-early-must-now-be-given-the-benefits/story-ZJlZCvxrni8P9ZlTlUsjYK.html

One such habit is smoking or using smokeless forms of tobacco.A recent review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO in April 2020 found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease with Covid-19, compared to non-smokers. There is evidence that impaired lung function due to smoking and susceptibility to non-communicable diseases (NCD) like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes due to continued use of tobacco products, are putting people at higher risk of developing severe Covid-related health complications.In this pandemic, factors like social isolation for long periods, poor work-life balance, strained interpersonal relationships, lack of personal time, poor coping skills, pre-existing psychological conditions, financial distress, and job insecurities are major triggers for individuals to take up or increase the use of cigarettes, beedis and other tobacco products. It is crucial that the government focuses on tobacco control measures.In India, an estimated 1.3 million deaths are accounted for as due to the use of tobacco. As per WHO data, the most common way tobacco kills is from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which amounted to 4,49, 844 deaths in India as of 2018. The high prevalence of non-communicable diseases due to tobacco use poses a huge challenge to Covid-19 management and amplifies the health burden.In April 2020, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) urged the public to stop consuming tobacco products and spitting in public places during the pandemic. Subsequently, the government banned the sale of all forms of tobacco products under the National Directive for Covid-19 Management. The ministry of health and family welfare issued a warning against the use of any tobacco products in the current times. While these initiatives are important, there is also a need to view tobacco control from a long-term lens.The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a robust public health system driven by effective policies and increased investment in the sector to improve health care outcomes as well as support economic growth through improved health indicators. WHO estimates that tobacco use burdens the global economy with an estimated $ 1.4 trillion in health care costs and lost productivity each year. According to studies in India, in 2011, the estimate of direct cost for treating four major tobacco-related noncommunicable diseases was Rs 104,500 crores, of which 16% was related to direct costs, and 84% to indirect costs. In this context, tobacco control has to become the centrepiece of public health debates across the world. This pandemic may have unwittingly led to a great opportunity to curb the use of tobacco and to positively shape the future of public health in India. By prioritising and strengthening tobacco control measures and implementing NCD prevention policies, India will improve health conditions and the economy. As India plans its road to recovery in a post-pandemic world, stringent tobacco control measures through simple but effective policy changes as part of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) Bill, increased focus on improving on-ground implementation especially checks on violations and stronger measures to reduce access and affordability to tobacco products through taxation and price, will pave way to a successful roadmap for better health indicators. WHO in its recent advisories and communications has also emphasised the need for stringent tobacco control for better management of the pandemic. It has highlighted increased tobacco taxation as an effective measure to help reduce consumption, reduce future health burden and to also increase revenues for governments for future management of health care costs. These efforts coupled with a collaborative approach with the private sector, civil society organisations, academia, and others will bolster our public health systems.As we cope with the varied socio-economic implications of this pandemic, there is an urgent need to develop a resilient health care system that complements our Atmanirbhar Bharat mission, which not only focuses on revival of the economy but also on overall improvement of the health of our citizens.

Commuters claim that no action is being taken on these vehicles.The road also has a no parking sign board. However, the entire road has two-wheelers parked.Rupali Kadam, 35, who travels to Mumbai by local train from Kalyan, said, “The authorities should tow these illegally-parked vehicles, especially during the peak hours. It is very difficult to walk along the station road because of this illegal parking. Once the trains resume for everyone, the situation will be chaotic.”Kadam added that no traffic police is seen stopping this illegal parking.Auto drivers claimed that the lane that they use to form a queue has been taken over by the private vehicles parked illegally.“Those autos that ply for emergency have no way to reach the station now as the road is blocked with illegal parking. All our three stands were closed during the lockdown. When lockdown was relaxed, people started parking everywhere including the space where rickshaws used to stand. We have requested the traffic police to take note of this and clear the area,” said Santosh Navale, representative, Autorickshaw Driver Owner Union, Kalyan.Sukhdev Patil, senior traffic police inspector, Kalyan (W) unit, said, “The reason behind increase in illegal parking on road is because of the closure of the civic body’s parking lot near the station. We have asked the civic body to start it soon so that vehicles can be parked there on a daily basis.”An official from Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) who did not wish to be named said, “The civic body will hold meeting in the coming days and then decide whether to open the parking lot or not.”QUOTE BOX:“The reason behind increase in illegal parking is because of the closure of the civic body’s parking lot near the station.

Disposing of a petition filed by the Punjab Dyers Association (PDA) on September 28, the single-judge bench of Justice Augustine George Masih on Wednesday directed MC to issue fresh bills within a week after deducting the amount pertaining to the lockdown period in a week. The remaining dues have to be cleared by the petitioners (dyeing industry) within three days of issuance of bills, the high court said.PDA general secretary, Bobby Jindal said, “The dyeing industry remained shut during the Covid-19 lockdown in Punjab from March 23 to May 17. How can the industrialists pay water-sewer charges for the months when no industrial operations took place? MC had issued unjustified bills, but the court has provided us major relief.”In their petition, the association, which has over 350 members, also stated that common effluent treatment plants (CETP) were being established for the dyeing industry and were expected to be completed by October 31. Following this, the discharge will not be released in MC sewer lines. Hence, the industry should not be made to pay the user charges for using MC sewer lines till March 2021. The association had also filed another petition in the court against the annual water-sewer bills issued by MC, contending that the charges were not levied on actual usage, but against the maximum discharge permissible as granted by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). This matter will come up for hearing in December.“Even if the owners use less water in comparison to the permission they have taken from PPCB, MC levies bills as per the permissible limit,” Jindal said.MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said, “The corporation will revise the bills after removing the lockdown period from the total billable months. This may take some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dyeing-industry-s-petition-waive-water-sewer-charges-for-lockdown-period-hc-tells-ludhiana-mc/story-FzBKGJrYJwzyo4RlxKQToJ.html

The circular that has been sent to all department and other administrative heads reads: “It has been observed that the incidence of the theft and pilferage of the machine, machine parts and equipment in the institute are increasing and most of the time it has been found that such type of incidents happened due to leaving the room, lab unattended and unlocked where such machines have been installed.”Officials said this has prompted them to fix responsibility of the staff members, who have shown carelessness and thus cause extra monetary stress on the institute’s finances.The administration has also told the in-charge of the out-patient departments (OPDs) to issue appropriate directions to prevent such incidents in future. “Appropriate directions to the staff concerned working under them on not to leave the room/lab unattended/unlocked where costly equipment/machines are installed have also been issued to the in-charges of such labs and rooms,” officials said.The order also states that in case of occurrence of theft or pilferage of any equipment or machine, the staff working in the said area will be responsible for the incident and the recovery of the loss will be made from the official concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/theft-of-costly-equipment-pgi-to-take-careless-staffers-to-task/story-PGf8RqW3uMy5JF250NgtYO.html

01-10-2020||City||Covid-19 lockdown: Accidents on Navi Mumbai highways down by 58%||The accidents along the major highways, connecting Navi Mumbai to other cities have shown over 58 per cent decrease during the lockdown.Though the number of accidents is less, the fatalities are almost the same as those of the previous year despite lockdown as most accidents reported were major.Highways like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Thane-Belapur Road, Sion-Panvel Highway and Palm Beach Road pass through Navi Mumbai.In 2019, a total of 403 accidents were recorded on all the four highways. The corresponding number this year is 169, a drop by more than half. An officer said, “Though the number of accidents have reduced, most of the accidents this year were fatal accidents. Last year, 79 fatal accidents were reported, killing 89 people while this year 76 fatal accidents were reported, killing 83.”The major affected highways are the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the Sion-Panvel Highway.Arun Patil, Assistant Commissioner of Police, traffic, said, “The highways face issue of bad roads and poor lighting. These are the main reasons behind fatal accidents. While Palm Beach Road is properly lit, Thane-Belapur Road and Sion-Panvel Road face lighting issues. We have written several times to the concerned department about the same. Besides, not following proper traffic rules is another reason for fatal accidents.”The data of the accidents of Mumbai-Pune Expressway from Highway Safety Patrol is of the whole 94.5 km stretch, of which only 11 km stretch from Kalamboli to Bhatanbhogda falls under the jurisdiction of Navi Mumbai police commissionerate. The traffic department claimed that efforts are on to intercept the speeding vehicles.“Currently, we have two interceptor vehicles on the move, especially on major highways to detect the speed of the vehicles approaching. These vehicles play a major role in identifying speeding vehicles. We have also sent a proposal to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation regarding installation of Number Plate Recognition (NPR) cameras on major highways. While the interceptor vans would be on the move, the static cameras will help in identifying speeding vehicles at many locations,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (traffic), Sunil Lokhande, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-lockdown-accidents-on-navi-mumbai-highways-down-by-58/story-DMtmGZxiX3t6JajTigqAoM.html
01-10-2020||City||Waiver of unipole advertisers’ licence fee costs Mohali MC ₹7 crore||Already reeling under fiscal crisis, the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) is now staring at a loss of about ₹7 crore which it has incurred after the Punjab local bodies department waived the licence fee of unipole advertisers for six months (March to September). The department has also given relaxation to the advertisers, allowing them to deposit only 50% of the licence fee till March 2021.Every month, the Mohali civic body used to earn around ₹88 lakh from 102 unipoles within its limits. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have suffered a huge loss as we were earning ₹88 lakh per month from unipole ads. We will ask the state government for more funds.” In May this year, unipole advertisers had refused to pay their fee for five months amounting to ₹5 crore. They instead wrote to the civic body, seeking a waiver citing no revenue generation. MC had referred the case to the local bodies department for approval, following which the fee was waived. In February this year, in a major setback to the Mohali civic body, the Punjab local bodies department had imposed a cut of ₹141 crore in its budget for 2020-21. Against the proposal of ₹268 crore, which MC had forwarded in February, the local bodies department sanctioned only ₹127 crore. Every month, Mohali MC spends ₹5 crore on paying salaries, power bills, fuel charges and maintaining city’s sanitation. With the pandemic affecting its income, the civic body is now left with only ₹15 crore to meet its expenses for the remaining financial year. While it expected to earn ₹10 crore in lieu of octroi, a duty levied on various goods entering Mohali, the civic body got just ₹5 crore from the state government. Besides, neither the ₹25-lakh rent nor the tehbazaari fee (licence to squat and sell goods at a particular location) that generally amount to ₹5 lakh per month was collected by MC for the past five months. On the account of property tax, residents have so far paid just ₹15 crore against estimated ₹25 crore, and water bill payments come to around ₹8 lakh instead of ₹25 lakh. 200 tenders await allotmentMeanwhile, more than 200 tenders of development works worth ₹30 crore have not been allotted in last one year. These projects pertain to development of parks, laying of paver blocks and construction of footpaths, repairing of roads and setting up outdoor gyms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waiver-of-unipole-advertisers-licence-fee-costs-mohali-mc-7-crore/story-1XKWddIVoHshYEiwmDYEZK.html

He was later bailed out from jail, and taught the con job to his son,” said Surinder Mohan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Detective 2).“His son, Mohit, a drug addict, is already facing trial in a snatching case. After being released on bail, he started swapping ATM cards like his father,” the ACP said.The CIA staff-2 had nabbed Mohit, along with his accomplice, Sandeep Kumar, alias Kala, of Gurpal Nagar, Daba, from Jamalpur Chowk on Tuesday and recovered Rs 9,000 in cash and nine debit cards from them.MODUS OPERANDIThe police official said Mohit and Sandeep used to recce the city to find ATM kiosks without security guards. They would then lurk around for customers and target the elderly or labourers. On the pretext of helping them withdraw cash from the ATM, the duo would swap their debit cards with a fake one, and later steal cash from their bank accounts using the valid card.To avoid being caught, they would keep changing their area of operation after swindling a few customers. Sandeep had dropped out from school after Class 8, while Mohit had cleared Class 12, and both were now unemployed, the ACP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/atm-card-swapping-two-held-accused-learnt-fraud-tactics-from-father/story-bkCDPZee4nZ6h60OOrqySO.html
01-10-2020||City||Covid-19 lockdown: Death by accident in Navi Mumbai, Panvel down by 37%||With the city under lockdown for more than six months, deaths by accidents on major highways in Navi Mumbai and Panvel are down by around 37% this year compared to last year.The death rate was especially low in the lockdown period by 62% from March to August. The Panvel Division, however, still continues to report a high number of accidents largely due to potholes and also the fact that the division includes the Mumbai-Pune Expressway.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Sunil Lokhande, said, “The major reason behind the drop in the number of accidents is the lockdown that happened. No vehicles, except the ones providing essential services, were on the road when the lockdown was in place. Even as places began to open up, most of them still continue to work from home and that is making all the difference in the accident rates.”The total number of accidents that occurred from January to August 2020 was reported to be 308 while the corresponding figure for the same period in 2019 was 490.In this year, 111 people have died and 200 suffered serious injuries in road accidents, a drop from 179 and 390, respectively, in 2019.The months of January and February this year reported higher number of accidents and fatalities as compared to last year, but from March, when the coronavirus pandemic started spreading and the lockdown began, the numbers could be seen decreasing.Of the four divisions of traffic in Navi Mumbai – Panvel, Port, Turbhe and Vashi – the maximum number of accidents were reported in Panvel division, which includes Kalamboli, Panvel Taluka and New Panvel traffic units. The number of accidents is high in Panvel division due to Mumbai-Pune Expressway.Police Inspector Madhukar Bhatte from New Panvel traffic unit said, “The stretch from Bhatanbhogda to Kalamboli falls under Navi Mumbai traffic unit. While some of the parts fall under New Panvel unit, some comes under Kalamboli unit. In the past, there have been many initiatives to curb the accidents on the expressway but now since the pandemic started, all of them have been stalled.”Meanwhile, Deepak Singh, a Kharghar-based activist said, “Panvel is always an accident-prone zone and the reason is bad condition of roads, non-availability of lights and proper safety sign boards. Lack of discipline in following traffic rule is also a reason for accidents. As per my Right to Information application to police zone II, more than 300 people lost their lives in three years only in Panvel zone. The reply said that there were a total of 341 deaths and 598 accidents in three years from 2016 to 2018.”Executive engineer Kishore Patil from PWD said, “The patch from Kalamboli to BARC junction is completely concretised and hence there is no way that there could be any potholes. We are conducting regular surveys and if we find any patch that needs repair, we get the work done immediately.”Pandemic has affected safety initiatives (SUBHEAD)‘Campus with Helmet’ and ‘Traffic Family Cop’ programmes were initiated in 2019 and 2020, respectively, in schools, colleges and industrial areas. “Around 100 campuses including private and government offices, and colleges were introduced to ‘Campus with Helmet. We had sought public participation and were receiving good response. But with the lockdown and colleges being shut, the programmes have been stalled for the moment. The programmes ensure that nobody enters the campus without a helmet and none leaves without one,” Assistant Commissioner of Police (traffic), Arun Patil, said.Meanwhile, the Family Traffic Cop initiative involves students. Each student poses as a family traffic cop to make sure his/her family followed the traffic rules. During the Road Safety Week in January this year, children were approached to help traffic police in educating their families in following traffic rules.“We planned to carry on with the initiative and involve the young ‘cops’ but it has now taken a back seat,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-lockdown-death-by-accident-in-navi-mumbai-panvel-down-by-37/story-bOWX33BCHMg6nH9IQBYMGJ.html

Other members of the team are Dr Pranay Pawar, Dr Atul Phillips, Dr Parvez Haque, Dr John Abraham and Dr Divya Varghese. The senior faculty of CMCH has also contributed many articles for the app.Dr William Bhatti, director, CMCH, said, “With a pandemic comes an ‘infodemic’, a short term for information epidemic. All kinds of wrong information is spread, creating panic in society and even among the healthcare staff. To control this, the app will provide medically correct information,” he said.Dr Jeyarak Pandian, principal and professor of neurology, CMC, and vice-president of the World Stroke Organisation, said there was much panic in the initial months when the pandemic started. “Even lab attendants and clerical staff at hospitals were confused.

Construction on government land is against the law and a punishable offence,” said Santosh Upadhyay, officer on special duty, Noida authority.Officials said land grabbers had illegally built boundary walls, some rooms, swimming pool and other facilities on the plot. The land mafia wanted to build more of such structures and then sell them, they added.As per the Noida authority, developing any housing societies or building without requisite permissions and map approvals is against the law. “We have been issuing public notices in the newspapers and also on our website wherein we warn developers of building such illegal localities in or face legal action. Apart from this, we keep asking the homebuyers not to invest in such illegal projects and stay away from buying flats and plots in such unauthorised areas,” said Upadhayaya.The authority said since July when lockdown norms were considerably relaxed, it has continued to take action against illegal construction. “We have been carrying out demolition drives against illegal construction wherever land grabbers are trying to encroach upon land in villages. In some villages, the authority has acquired the land for planned development but hasn’t started work so far as the project will be developed later. Eyeing such opportunities, the land mafia try to grab such plots and develop illegal buildings to sell flats. We have been appealing to homebuyers not to invest in it as they will be cheated,” said an official requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-frees-up-government-land-worth-40-crore-in-phase-2/story-buZGWYjDiMVxPAuqtNvGOI.html

The SOP is being drafted and is expected to be finalised by Monday. The SOP will be divided into two parts – for customers and restaurant owners – and will include sanitising, wearing masks, social distancing and getting restaurant staff to wear gloves and masks throughout. The notification issued by the state government on Wednesday allowed hotels, bars, restaurants, food courts, shut for more than six months, to operate at 50% of their capacity. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “We have planned to ensure an arrangement of pre-booking of seats at restaurants to avoid unnecessary crowding. The restaurant owners will have to take precautions to ensure this transition, of opening up their spaces for customers, takes place smoothly. Their seating arrangement should be made in a way that social distancing is maintained.” Restaurant owners will have to ensure regular sanitising of the eating space and maintain hygiene in the kitchen. Also, periodic testing of its staff will be mandatory, as per the upcoming SOP of the BMC. Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, spokesperson of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India, said, “I think people are more cautious to wait outside the restaurants in this pandemic and so pre-booking will work. I don’t agree that there will be overcrowding the moment we open restaurants as consumers’ confidence is low. We are on a wait-and-watch mode and will see how it unfolds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pre-booking-may-be-must-in-bmc-s-sop-for-eateries-in-mumbai/story-51NKqAmQyQLsPkKgue69KJ.html

Till September 27, 54 civilians in the city have been infected with leptospirosis. The deceased, who was a resident of F-North ward that covers Matunga, developed fever with chills on August 31. He was admitted to a hospital on September 2 after he complained of breathlessness and was coughing up blood. He was then tested for Covid-19 along with malaria, dengue and leptospirosis. Though he came negative of the first three diseases, he tested positive for leptospirosis. “Despite providing treatment, his condition didn’t improve and he succumbed to the infection. When we checked with the family, we were informed that he recently waded in rainwater. Thus, he got exposed to the infection,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.Leptospirosis is an infection in rodents and other wild and domesticated species. Rodents are implicated most often in human cases. It can pass from animals to humans when an unhealed break in the skin comes in contact with water or soil, where the animal urine is present.Last year in the month of September, 56 leptospirosis cases were reported. Last month, till September 27, 54 civilians in the city were infected with leptospirosis.The BMC has advised people with a history of wading through floodwater should consult a doctor for prophylactic treatment of leptospirosis within 72 hours. “All private practitioners are hereby requested to start doxycycline to all fever patients during monsoon season as early treatment with doxycycline prevents organ involvement and other complications thereby preventing deaths due to leptospirosis,” reads the advisory. However, there is a silver lining. As per the data provided by the BMC, the cases of malaria have fallen drastically in the city. In the month of August, 1,163 cases of malaria were reported which has plunged to 661 cases as reported till September 27.Dr Vikrant Shah, infectious disease specialist, Zen Multispeciality Hospital, said “I have seen around 10 cases of malaria and two dengue in the last two-three months. However, I haven’t seen any patients with leptospirosis. People must follow all the precautions, as symptoms of malaria mimic the symptoms of Covid-19. See to it that there is no waterlogging around your house. Wear full-sleeved clothes if you are venturing out of the house to prevent mosquito bites. Use mosquito repellents and mosquito nets in the house to keep mosquitoes at bay.”People can contact the helpline number of the BMC at 022-2411-4000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/16-year-boy-dies-of-leptospirosis-first-fatality-in-mumbai-this-year/story-7C8DIhO5ldYSnAHoqQavZN.html

At present, line losses were estimated to be over 30%. UPPCL superintending engineer (Noida), Sarvesh Khare, said that by keeping a close tab on these feeders, not only the line loss could be reduced, but it will ensure uninterrupted power supply to consumers. “In the first phase, we have identified 60 feeders in the district, 30 each from circle 1 and 2 of power corporation. These feeders are located in sector 8, 10 and 47, Sarfabad, Bahlolpur, Sorkha, Dadri, Jewar and Dankaur areas. Power supply is being given mostly to jhuggis, rural areas and sites under construction from these feeders,” he said. He further said that the possibility of power theft in the areas connected with feeders can’t be ruled out. “We are also looking into it. We are also trying to get information that whether power department employees are involved in this power theft or not,” Khare said. The Uttar Pradesh energy minister Shrikant Sharma, had recently asked the power distribution companies in Noida and Ghaziabad to bringdown line loss to below 15%, to ensure uninterrupted power supply. The minister also asked the distribution companies to upgrade the existing 10 and 16 kVA transformers to higher capacity as soon as possible. “The line loss and tripping from these power stations can’t be tolerated in any case as the bona fide consumers also suffer due to frequent power cuts in these areas. Stern actions will be taken against all the officials concerned, if the problems of line loss and frequent power cuts are not corrected within two months. Without ensuring uninterrupted power supply, making power corporations self-reliant will remain a mirage,” the minister had said, warning the power officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/power-corp-starts-tab-on-60-feeders-to-reduce-line-loss-to-less-than-15-in-october/story-T4vwDFGOBKcix72Ov5udhJ.html

When I objected, he started misbehaving with me and also hurled verbal abuses. He started to get violent and then I confronted him. We were the only three women passengers aboard. Thereafter, other male passengers intervened and some of them also captured the entire incident through video,” the complainant alleged. In her complaint given to the police, the woman stated that the driver also told her that he is a government driver and offered her to stay with him. “The driver also assaulted me when I objected to his actions. Later, I went to the police station and gave a police complaint. The police were initially not ready to lodge the FIR but later they did as there were many passengers in the bus and videos of the incident had also been taken,” she added. The purported videos of the incident went viral over social media. They purportedly showed the suspect misbehaving and assaulting the victim. Based on the complaint, the police registered an FIR against the driver identified as Sheodan Lal, who is stated to be a UPSRTC driver based at Hapur depot.

The month accounted for 39% of all cases till date.Deaths, at eight in September, was five higher than in August but lower than the 20 of July.Much of the high number of cases could be attributed to the increased testing.In March this year, the district reported 38 Covid-19 cases, which indicated a rate of a little over one patient per day at 626 total tests that month. In April, there were 100 cases (three cases per day, 3290 tests), May had 315 cases and seven deaths (10 cases per day, 40,100 total tests), June had 1,851 cases and 15 deaths (62 cases per day, 44,016 total tests); July had 2781 cases and 20 deaths (90 cases per day, 65,418 total tests); August had 2,864 new cases and three deaths (92 cases per day, 58,029 total tests). September had 82,304 total tests.District magistrate Suhas LY said that with nearly all commercial activities opened up, the main aim of the administration now is to reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) to the minimum possible level and ensure maximum testing. “Our methodology of ‘track, test and treat’ for checking the spread of Covid-19, has so far yielded expected results. Due to this method, the GB Nagar’s CFR has gone down to 0.40%, which is much better than national figure of 1.62% and state’s 1.39%,” he said. The DM also said that GB Nagar’s testing rate is best among all districts of north India. “Our testing rate per million per day is over 1,750, which is much better than other best districts in north India. We have also issued instructions for industrial establishments, to strictly follow the Covid-19 protocols. Our teams are regularly monitoring the factories and other business establishments, to ensure the safety protocols being followed there,” he said. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that to check the spread of Covid-19 in the district, daily testing has been increased and regular rapid antigen kit testing camps are being organized at different places in the district. “Besides ramping up testing and started effective monitoring of patients under home isolation, the health department’s surveillance staff have also started implementing stringent containment.

01-10-2020||City||Private schools plan to continue with online classes as parents prefer keeping children at home||Gurugram: After staying closed for over six months now in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, schools can be expected to reopen after October 15 subject to state guidelines and consent of parents. Most schools have already readied protocols and measures that would be place as and when they reopen. At the same time, schools said they are likely to continue with online classes for now since parents were not in favour of sending their kids and had not been enthusiastic about the academic guidance sessions either. The central government has part of its fresh unlock guidelines has allowed state governments to take a call on reopening of schools after October 15. Students will be allowed in schools with consent from parents.Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14, said the school had sought feedback from parents of students in classes 11 and 12 this week and around 65-75% were not okay with physical classes. “The guidelines mention that even if the state government allows schools to open, it has to be done with the consent of parents. Two days ago, we had floated a google form for students of classes 11 and 12, seeking feedback from parents regarding school visits. Most parents are not in favour of school visits,” said Erry. She said parents were not keen on sending children to school for short duration, limited classes either. “We gave various choices to parents. Overwhelming majority of parents are not in favour of short duration visits to school either. Looking at the response of parents of students in senior classes, we are not expecting any favourable response from parents whose children are in junior classes,” Erry said. The school already has a sanitisation protocol in place as part of which the whole school campus is sanitised on a daily basis. From the entry gate till the classrooms, sanitisers are in place at various points and to regulate movement, the teaching staff is called to the school on a rotational basis. “We have done the groundwork and these measures can be scaled up whenever schools reopen,” Erry said. Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said chances of initiation of physical visits looked bleak since parents were not yet willing to send children for guidance sessions. Misra said the number of students visiting the school for guidance visits was dwindling, which could indicate the mood of parents. “While initially, some children had applied for guidance visits, only a few children came to school,” said Misra. She said the school had sought feedback from parents regarding school visits twice in the past six months. “Parents have clearly stated that they are happy with online classes. They don’t want to send children to school due to the fear of jeopardising their health,” said Misra. The school had served as a centre for the CBSE board compartment exams and has a Covid-19 safety protocol in place. It has placed sanitisers at various points in common areas. Within classrooms, desks have been marked with signs so that distancing rules are complied with. Throughout the school, arrows have been marked for one-way traffic apart from regular sanitisation measures. “Getting some 100 students for a compartment exam is quite different from calling 6,000 children to school. Due to the increase in strength, the sanitisation will be much more stringent and in-depth when schools start fully. We will have to increase manpower,” Misra said. Most parents said they would prefer online classes over physical classes till there was a significant improvement in the situation. “As long as online classes are taking place and a regular continuum of learning is being maintained, I don’t think I would be willing to send my son to school. The pandemic continues to be sensitive and it does not make much sense for schools to reopen due to the health concerns,” said Sonal Kaushik, whose son studies in Class 9 in a private school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-schools-plan-to-continue-with-online-classes-as-parents-prefer-keeping-children-at-home/story-HSsY6x90V6KsGjact2M4UJ.html

Singh said that the purpose of these bills was to ensure that income of farmers is augmented and they are able to get better prices for their produce. Singh, who is union minister of state for statistics, was speaking at a press conference in Gurugram on Thursday. He said that opposition parties were falsely creating the an impression that these decisions will eliminate the MSP (minimum support price) system and agriculture mandis (markets) across the country. He also said that only six per cent of the farming households have been able to get benefit from the MSP system. “These farm bills enable the farmers to sell their produce across the country and it allows them to sell their produce wherever they want. It will help them to get better prices. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, are trying to take advantage of the situation. But this should not happen at the cost of the society and nation. We must rise above petty interests,” said Singh. Singh said that the BJP government has increased the allocation for agriculture in the Union budget from 8.5 percent to 38.8 per cent. This is a clear indication that interests of the farmers won’t be hurt. Farmers in several states have been protesting against the three bills that got the President’s assent last Sunday.Taking a dig at the opposition parties, Singh said that eliminating the Agriculture Price Market Committee was part of the Congress party’s manifesto of 2019 and the opposition parties were taking an opportunistic view of the current situation. “The politics on this issue should not hurt the interests of the common man and the farmers. I left the Congress party because of its failures on these issues,” he said. Singh said that the ownership of the farmers’ land cannot be compromised in case of contract farming. “As far as Swaminathan recommendations are concerned, the BJP government has raised the MSP prices of various crops by more that 50 percent of the cost. It is to be noted that Congress government in 2007 had refused to implement these recommendations,” he said.Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla and district BJP president Gargi Kakkar were also present on the occasion. Senior Congress leader and former state minister Captain (Retd) Ajay Singh Yadav said that the three farm bills brought by Union government will destroy the future of Indian agriculture. The government is aiming to bring agriculture under the control of private and corporate sector. “The Gurugram MP and the BJP will have to bear the consequences of such disastrous policies. The people of the state will give a befitting reply when the time comes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mp-lauds-new-farm-bills-criticises-the-opposition/story-hjIVOPYgoQARkuOkonnjrI.html

Sarita was rushed to a private hospital in Manesar, where doctors had declared her dead-on-arrival. The police said a few months before the murder, Sombir was booked in two criminal cases for allegedly molesting, harassing and threatening Sarita and her family. In one of these cases, he was arrested but later released on bail. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “After the murder, his whereabouts were not known for several months. He kept changing his locations and went to Alwar before taking a room on rent in Ganeshpura village in Dausa, Rajasthan. To evade the police, he had changed his look and had started selling rat poison. Probe found that he had snatched a phone from Kapriwas and was booked in a case in Dharuhera.” The police said, on September 26, Sombir and his aide, Jitendra Nayak, from Dausa, made an extortion call to a businessman in Bilaspur and asked him to pay ₹50 lakh or face dire consequences. Bilaspur Police had registered an FIR against unknown persons the following day. “A probe found that the snatched phone was used to make the extortion call, following which the crime branch of Sector 40 traced his location to Dausa and both were arrested. At least five cases have been registered against Sombir. Jitendra was sent to judicial custody,” said ACP, adding that the gun used by the accused and other pieces of evidences are yet to be recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/former-wrestling-coach-held-for-murdering-taekwondo-player/story-h1hRo3mYkCpLxvfb4TsyuK.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||NHM workers call off protest after their demands for changes in contract are met||About 750 contractual workers of the National Health Mission (NHM) in Gurugram — comprising doctors, auxiliary midwife nurses, emergency medical technicians and ambulance drivers, among others — have called off their decision to protest after their demands were met by the district health department on Thursday. The workers had earlier objected to two specific clauses in their employment contracts, which, they alleged, would hamper their job security for the health workers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. During a meeting with the district chief medical officer(CMO) on Thursday, however, it was decided that the two clauses will be rescinded from their contracts. The specific clauses (numbered 9 and 10) in the ‘Letter of Contract’ affidavit, which NHM workers are expected to sign and submit by the end of the month in order to renew their employment, remove the provision of a month-long notice period in case of termination of employment. The affidavit (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times) also stated that this may be done “without making payment of remuneration in advance”.Dr Virender Yadav, CMO, Gurugram, said of the matter, “We will be renewing their contracts as per the old terms.” He declined to comment further, adding that this was a state issue which did not concern his office. “We are simply following orders as received,” he said.Hari Raj, district president of the NHM Karmachari Sangh (Haryana), said, “The move comes as a relief. We will sign identical copies of our old contracts in the next day or two and submit it to the CMO’s office to formally renew our contracts. All 750 workers in the district have also been granted extensions on their employment, which is a relief, especially since we are in the middle of a job scarcity.” Prabjot Singh, mission director, NHM Haryana, could not be reached for comment on Thursday despite multiple attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nhm-workers-call-off-protest-after-their-demands-for-changes-in-contract-are-met/story-5jYmX87HnHs5HysRzyjQJO.html

Dharna Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime against women, said, “The girl’s mother and her relatives took her to civil hospital. The victim had suffered a cut and required stitches. At the time, a paediatric surgeon was not available at the civil hospital in Faridabad, so she was referred to Safdarjung hospital. She is stable and has been provided counselling. The doctors at the civil hospital informed us of the incident.” Police said the suspect, a native of Buxar in Bihar, was a labourer. He was arrested within half an hour of the incident being reported, said police. “The victim is likely to be discharged on Friday. As per preliminary probe, the suspect does not have a criminal history. He was produced in a district court and sent to judicial custody,” said ACP Yadav.

01-10-2020||Chandigarh||Road in Ludhiana develops cracks a day after construction||Despite tall claims made by mayor Balkar Sandhu over checks being kept on quality of development works in the city, complaints against poor quality works continue to pour in. Residents of Street Number 3 of Laxman Nagar in Giaspura area complained that a road in their area has developed a crack in a day as the soil was not removed properly before laying the hotmix on Wednesday night.Intriguingly, the civic body has not even issued the work order to construct the street and the contractor laid the hotmix without apprising authorities. One of the residents, RK Yadav said, “The road has been constructed after eight years but the contractor has used inferior quality material. Hotmix has not been laid for the entire portion of the road and the required amount of material has also not been used. The road was constructed in a hurry on Wednesday night and has already developed cracks. I have forwarded a complaint to municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and he had sent a team for inspection in the evening.”Area councillor Sonia Sharma said, “The contractor did not even tell the authorities before starting the road construction work and poor quality work has been done in a hurry. I have also asked the MC chief to take action against the contractor and the road should be constructed properly.”MC sub-divisional officer Ravneet Singh said, “We have inspected the site after receiving a complaint from the residents. There are certain flaws in the work and a report will be forwarded to senior authorities so that action can be taken in this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/road-in-giaspura-develops-cracks-a-day-after-construction/story-9JyY6gSDHTfnX18AvTOzrI.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||District administration to consult all stakeholders on reopening of schools||A day after the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued Unlock 5 guidelines that permitted the reopening of schools in a graded manner after October 15, officials from the district administration said that a decision on the same will be taken after consultation with all stakeholders. Reacting to the MHA guidelines, a senior official from the district administration said any order regarding the opening of institutes will be taken after due consultation with various stakeholders and departments. “The guidelines say that schools can be reopened after October 15 depending on certain conditions. Any order in this context will be issued only after consultation with various stakeholders and departments and taking cognisance of the ground realities. The education department will share the feedback it receives from parents on this matter with the administration on the basis of which the order will be passed. We will implement the order as and when it’s passed,” said the official, who did not wish to be quoted. According to the latest guidelines issued by the MHA, the decision for opening schools in a graded manner can be taken by the states/union territories after October 15 “in consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation”. Schools across the country were shut in March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Students in government schools in Haryana have been visiting the campuses for academic guidance sessions on a regular basis since September 21. District elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that schools would continue to remain open for students for classes 9 to 12 who need academic guidance. “Senior students from classes 9 to 12 are already visiting the school for academic guidance visits with the consent of parents. These visits will continue to take place. As far as the opening of schools for students in junior classes is concerned, the decision will be taken in due course of time. A discussion on the subject of reopening schools for remaining classes has not taken place,” said Yadav. Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the school was open for all practical purposes since senior students were already visiting the school for academic guidance sessions regularly. “Students in classes 9 to 12 are already visiting the school on alternate days. For us, the school is already open since regular guidance sessions are taking place with the consent of parents. Now, the issue of reopening schools for students of classes 6 to 8 needs to be dealt with,” said Raghav. He said that it seemed unlikely that parents would be willing to send children in junior classes to school even after October 15.“Based on the feedback received from parents, it seems unlikely that they would give consent for routine classes after October 15. Even if the state government were to give a go-ahead for junior classes, parents might remain reluctant about sending children to school,” said Raghav. Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari also confirmed that the number of students visiting the school for academic guidance visits was steadily increasing. “We are seeing an improvement in the number of students visiting the school for guidance sessions on a daily basis. Every day, there is an increase of 1%. This week we saw, around 6% of students attending these sessions,” said Kumari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-to-consult-all-stakeholders-on-reopening-of-schools/story-jMcVynexNSA59H5Pw1pemM.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||Few takers for ‘non-medical tests’ at Gurugram Civil Hospital||There are few takers for the Covid-19 facility dedicated to test people for “non-medical” reasons -- work or travel that required a negative certificate -- in Gurugram.On September 19, the Haryana government had directed districts to set up such centres to reduce the burden on labs after it had removed the requirement for a doctor’s prescription for a test. These centres would charge people depending on the type of test -- ₹1,600 for RT-PCR, ₹650 for antigen and ₹250 for antibody tests. Those who sought the test for medical reasons, however, would continue to be tested free of charge.Since the order, there have been only 220 tests at the centre in Gurugram -- the sector 10 Civil Hospital set up from September 21.“After walk-in tests (without prescription) were introduced, we were getting about 40 people a day who needed a Covid-negative certificate in order to travel or return to work. After we started charging for these kinds of tests, the number of those coming in for ‘non-medical’ reasons has come down to about 15 to 20,” said Anantha K, a senior lab technician with the health department.“The removal of the mandatory prescription rider had resulted in many individuals, in both blue- and white-collar jobs, seeking tests. We also have to keep tests available for people who show symptoms. Not everyone can get tested for free,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. The district tested 3355 tests on Thursday, which, officials said, was on target.Health department officials said that people relied on private laboratories for ”non-medical” tests. “This is mainly because private labs offer home visits, and reports are sent to the patients within a day. At Civil Hospital, the reports take longer, about 36 to 48 hours. Most people wanting non-medical tests generally need the results sooner,” said a senior medical officer with the health department, seeking anonymity.There are a total of 12 labs and medical facilities in the district offering tests privately.Rishabh Rajput, director of Covid-19 and microbiology divisions at Modern Diagnostics, a certified testing lab in Jawahar Nagar, said, “Approximately speaking, 80 percent of our clients need RT PCR tests for medical purposes. They have some symptoms or may just generally be feeling unwell. The rest are what the health department is calling ‘non-medical’ tests.”Experts have viewed the health department’s move critically. Dr Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former head of the department of community medicine at PGIMER, Chandigarh, said, “Every single Covid-19 test administered by the government should ideally be free. Allowing people to go back to work is as much a part of the public health response as preventing deaths. If there is a paucity of equipment, you must manufacture or procure more kits. A price barrier will exclude many people who cannot afford the test, even with Haryana’s relatively low pricing. When enough tests are available the price should be removed or lowered.”Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer in Gurugram, added, “We have put up notices at all PHCs where tests are being conducted stating that non-medical tests will be chargeable. People do approach us for tests without any signs or symptoms of Covid-19. They are diverted to the facility in Civil Hospital. Maybe they are choosing not to go ahead because of the pricing, or maybe they are heading to private labs.” While he was unable to provide specific numbers, Sharma added that of the 220 paid tests conducted since September 21, a large portion were RT PCR tests.On September 5, the ICMR had issued a revised testing advisory to all states, paving the way for walk-in tests. Prior to this, the ICMR’s testing advisory required people to either have flu-like symptoms or come in close contact with an infected person, following which a doctor could issue a prescription for a test. The revised criteria was implemented in Gurugram on September 7, after which the demand for non-medical tests rose, at both private labs and PHCs in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/few-takers-for-non-medical-tests-at-gurugram-civil-hospital/story-n249qGcSVUyBD2igW1GWbI.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||Three years after he went missing, minor reunited with family in Kapashera||Three years after he went missing, a 13-year-old boy was reunited with his family members in Delhi on Thursday. The boy, who was ten years old at the time, had gone missing from Kapashera in 2017. The police officials said the boy had strayed from his house in Kapashera and was later found roaming on the streets in Gurugram. He was handed over to the child welfare committee(CWC) and was shifted to a shelter home in Rajiv Nagar, where he had been staying since then. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The boy was unable to articulate any information about his background apart from his name and state. He could not recollect any information, perhaps due to shock and trauma.” Recently, the city police had opened a missing cell and tasked officials to counsel people in the homeless shelters and upload information of their cases on zonal integrated police network (Zipnet) in an effort to trace their families. During counselling, police collected information from Zipnet and found the photograph of the boy who had been living in a shelter home in Rajiv Nagar in Gurugram. “Further probe found that the boy had gone missing from Kapashera and a missing persons’ complaint had been filed at Kapashera police station in Delhi in 2017. We got information of his parents from Kapashera police station, but at the time, his parents were in their native town in Vaishali district in Bihar due to the lockdown,” said Boken. The police said they contacted the boy’s maternal aunt, who was in Delhi, who then arrived and identified him and informed his parents in Bihar. His parents arrived in the city earlier this week. On Thursday, after background checks, a medical examination and on the directions of CWC officials, the boy was reunited with his family. K K Rao, police commissioner, Gurugram, has announced a cash reward and a certificate of appreciation for the investigating officers of the missing cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-years-after-he-went-missing-minor-reunited-with-family-in-kapashera/story-TcGAa4KA28tkDkqGQxMVGN.html

The policeman was not wearing his uniform at the time of incident. A video of the assault was widely shared on social media after which the police registered a case of assault against the volunteers on Thursday to probe the incident.Police said the fracas took place around 7.30pm at the Naraina Vihar traffic signal when head constable Naresh, posted at the Connaught Place police station, was returning home on his motorcycle. In his complaint, Naresh said a team of civil defence volunteers who were penalising people for not wearing mask stopped him.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said initial inquiry suggests that Naresh was also not wearing a face mask. “After he was stopped, he had an argument with the volunteers that later turned violent,” he said.The officer also said they are checking who these volunteers were and on whose orders they were deployed in the area.Police are also looking into allegations against the head constable of having misbehaved with a woman volunteer when she stopped him for not wearing a mask. However, no complaint was received against the head constable till Thursday evening, police said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Sameer Sharma said a case of assault has been registered. “During preliminary probe, it was found that the argument started over the head constable not wearing a mask. We are verifying allegations made by both sides,” Sharma said.SDM Delhi Cantonment Piyush Rohankar said the administration is waiting for the outcome of the police inquiry as it was a matter of law and order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/head-constable-thrashed-in-argument-over-face-mask-in-delhi/story-7kXm3rDSyRnREu1g9OnO3M.html
01-10-2020||City||With eye on 2022 MCD polls, Delhi BJP announces new team||New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced its new state team with an eye on securing a fourth term in the municipal polls scheduled in 2022. The 46-member team has seven sitting and former councillors, excluding state unit president Adesh Gupta (councillor from west Patel Nagar). Former youth wing head of Delhi BJP Sunil Yadav, who contested the assembly elections against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this year, has been made the vice-president. While the party has accommodated Congress and AAP rebels in the new team, BJP leader Kapil Mishra, a former minister in the Arvind Kejriwal government in 2015, didn’t find a place. Mishra has been in the news recently related to his speech in north-east Delhi, a day before communal riots broke out in the area. Congress rebel Barkha Singh, former Delhi Commission for Women chairperson, and Richa Pandey Misha, former head of AAP’s women’s wing, have been appointed vice-president and spokesperson respectively. Richa Pandey Mishra and Kapil Mishra had joined the BJP together in August last year. With over a year left for the municipal polls and the AAP stepping up its attack on the BJP, which is ruling all the three civic bodies, Gupta said the new team will be instrumental in “party’s victory once again”. “This team will work to win the party its fourth consecutive term in the municipal polls. It is a mixed bag with a lot of people with organisational experience and newcomers, youth and members of the SC and OBC communities,” Gupta said. The party has given key appointments to seven former and sitting councillors, including three former mayors. Former East Delhi mayor Harsh Malhotra has been made the general secretary along with Kuljeet Chahal and Dinesh Pratap Singh. Former East Delhi Mayor Neema Bhagat and former South Delhi Mayor Sunita Kangra has been appointed as secretaries. Of the seven, four are sitting councillors. The party has also appointed eight leaders who had contested the assembly elections in 2020, including Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. While Bagga has been retained as the spokesperson along with Harish Khurana and Praveen Shankar Kapoor, Laxmi Nagar MLA Abhay Verma has been made the chief spokesperson of the Delhi BJP. Party members say that very few people from the old team have been retained. While Rajiv Babbar has been retained as the vice-president, current media in-charge Ashok Goyal has been elevated to the post of vice-president. Virendra Sachdeva, member of the national BJP’s good governance team, has been appointed as the vice-president. By replacing Purvanchali leader and North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari with Gupta as Delhi BJP chief, the BJP had made a move to woo its core support base in the Punjabi-Baniya community. But the party has appointed close to five people from the Purvanchali community in the new team. There are nine women and two Muslims in the new team. Sanjay Kumar, director, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said the in the reorganisation of the Delhi unit, the BJP has tried to strike a balance between two key communities -- Purvanchalis and Baniyas. “By making Gupta the state chief the BJP tried to keep the trading community (its core support base) happy. But at the same time, they have given representation to the Purvanchal community. Though the party’s attempt to woo the Purvanchalis did little good for them, it did play a role in increasing the party’s vote share in the assembly elections, especially in east Delhi. The recent appointments show that they have devised a strategy to keep both the trading community and the Purvanchalis happy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-eye-on-2022-mcd-polls-delhi-bjp-announces-new-team/story-zAPy7FidY5J3Gd6ROoe9fO.html

01-10-2020||City||As ridership increases, Metro to run trains on peak frequency in some corridors||New Delhi: With the rush at Metro stations increasing, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided to run trains at quick intervals or at “peak hour frequency” between 8am and 8pm. Metro officials say the decision has been taken to “break the peak”, with occupancy touching 100% on several lines during peak hours. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “DMRC also introduced peak hour frequency of trains from 8am to 8pm to provide better occupancy. We are doing away with the concept of off-peak hours from 11am to 4pm where services were available with less trains/trips earlier.” Currently, the frequency of trains during peak hours is between 2 and 5 minutes whereas during off-peak hours is 8-15 minutes. Metro officials said, on five sections-- Dilshad Garden to Shastri Park, Mundka to Kirti Nagar, Kirti Nagar to Mandi House, New Bus Adda to Dilshad Garden and Escorts Mujesar to Badarpur—the train occupancy is almost 100% of the allowed capacity. The Metro started its full-scale operations from September 12. Since then it has seen a gradual rise in ridership. According to DMRC officials, the line utilisation is around 9-10 lakh daily. Dayal said, “It has been observed that certain sections of the Metro network as given below are showing a trend where occupancy is touching 100% mark during morning and evening peak hours whereas during off-peak hours the occupancy in the same sections is in the range of 30-50% only. This leaves ample scope for people to stagger their travel from peak hours to the extent possible and have hassle-free travel with social distancing in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-ridership-increases-metro-to-run-trains-on-peak-frequency-in-some-corridors/story-5vpIxFgntXpOGzhO5rOllI.html
01-10-2020||City||Youth Congress workers try to ‘vandalise’ BJP office in Ludhiana||BJP leaders have lodged a complaint against Youth Congress workers for allegedly trying to vandalise the BJP office located near Clock Tower on Thursday.In a hurriedly called press conference, State BJP vice-president Parveen Bansal, general secretary Jeevan Gupta and spokesperson Anil Sareen condemned the act and demanded stringent action against the Congres workers for attempting to vandalise the BJP office.The incident, they said, took place on Thursday afternoon when the Youth Congress workers gathered near the Clock Tower to burn the effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protest against the rape and brutal killing of a girl in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh (UP).BJP leader Jeevan Gupta said that the Youth Congress workers took the effigy at the BJP party office located on the first floor and tried to set it on fire. They alleged that some of the Congress workers even tried to vandalise the party office.However, the BJP workers swung into action and prevented the incident. Later, the BJP workers lodged a police complaint in this regard, said Gupta.It is being alleged that the act of burning effigy was carried out by the same group of Congressmen who were involved in assaulting Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leader Sunny Kainth.Sharing details, Anil Sareen accused the police of remaining a mute spectator. “The Congress workers reached the first floor and tried to vandalise the BJP office. All this happened right in front of the police but the cops did nothing. It was when the BJP workers stopped them from vandalising the office that the police intervened and took the workers downstairs,” said Sareen.SHO of Division Number 1 police station Inspector Harjit Singh said that the complaint has been received and the matter was being investigated. He admitted that the Youth Congress workers had reached till the first floor but soon they have rushed downstairs. “No attempt to burn effigy was made,” said the SHO.Speaking on the issue, district president of Youth Congress Yogesh Handa said that it was a peaceful protest being carried out in the presence of mediapersons. “The protest was to wake up the BJP government and its blind followers from their slumber. Our national security is being compromised, our GDP is at an all-time low, businesses have ruined completely. The government has failed to keep a tab on the Covid-19 pandemic. To top it all, the government has introduced a pro-corporate farmer bill to crush the poor farmers and then the news of the gruesome gang-rape case at UP has sent shockwaves across the country. Our peaceful protest was pertaining to all these issues. We have not burnt the effigy of PM Modi. We had visited the market, where the BJP office is also located, to protest. BJP workers are making false complaints,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/youth-congress-workers-try-to-vandalise-bjp-office-in-ludhiana/story-ZjHuBpfyDZ2P5m4jKsPUGL.html

01-10-2020||Noida||District administration stops sale, purchase of land, buildings on floodplains||To put a check on illegal construction on floodplains, the Gautam Budh Nagar district disaster management committee passed an order regulating sale and purchase of illegal/unauthorised buildings in notified areas of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway as well as land/buildings on the floodplains of the Yamuna and Hindon rivers. District magistrate Suhas LY, who is the also the chairman of the committee, said this order will not only stop the illegal construction of high-rises in notified areas, but also protect the floodplains of Hindon and Yamuna rivers. The registration of properties in these areas will no more be possible for buyers or sellers, the DM said. “As per the powers vested under section 34 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, the committee has asked the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna authorities, along with police, irrigation, revenue and registration departments, to control plotting, colonization and construction in notified areas under the three authorities. The authorities and police have been asked to take immediate action against persons involved in such illegal/unauthorised constructions,” he said. The DM further said it will be mandatory for both buyers and sellers, to mention the height and floors of any commercial, industrial, institutional or residential building before the registry of the said property is executed. “Any building having a height of more than 15 metres or having more than four floors will not be registered, partially or completely, by the deputy registrar concerned as that may cause major loss of lives in the event of a collapse,” Suhas said. About the constructions on the flood plains of Hindon and Yamuna rivers, Suhas said without producing bona fide documents ( in context of sections 2(d), 6(g), 9(i) and 10 of UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 and Rule 20.2, 20.3 and 24.1 of Noida/ Greater Noida Industrial Development Area Building Regulation, 2010) no construction will be permitted. “Even the agricultural land on the floodplains of these rivers will not be registered, if there is illegal or unauthorised construction on it,” he said.The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai), has welcomed the move. Subodh Goel, secretary, Credai (western UP), said it will put a big check on land mafias in these areas, who are selling the land hoodwinking people, on the basis of fake powers of attorney. “This order will also alert prospective buyers. But, the district administration must soften its stand against buyers, who have already purchased land or houses in these areas. The administration should also consider their displacement. It will be a double blow for them,” he said. Vikrant Tongad, an environment conservationist, said by restricting illegal construction on floodplains and notified belts, the areas will more safe and greener. “The administration must not allow construction on even a single inch of floodplain. If we restrict the course of nature, it may destroy us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/district-administration-stops-sale-purchase-of-land-buildings-on-floodplains/story-zCbF6suDbGVcpFKymgP2HI.html

The woman said two weeks ago, Kapil had called the Shradha’s younger brother to a local park and threatened to abduct Shradha if the family did not accept his marriage proposal. “Once my daughter went missing, we tried Kapil’s mobile phone number but that was also switched off. We suspect his role in her disappearance. We are concerned about Shradha’s safety,” she said. Azad Singh Tomar, SHO, Sector 39 police station, said primary investigation revealed that Shradha and Kapil knew each other. “We have registered a case against the three named suspects under Section 506 (criminal intimidation), Section 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) and Section 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code.

This left the farmers to suffer as many had already turned up at the mandis with their produce. In some grain markets, farmers had accused the government agencies of not procuring their produce despite the moisture content being below 16%. On Thursday, the government agencies started the procurement operations after a meeting of district administration officials, procurement agencies, arhtiyas and rice millers.As per the officials of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board, the agencies will also procure paddy with moisture content up to 19%. However, the arhtiyas have also complained that their paddy was procured but has not been lifted yet due to non-availability of gunny bags.Also, a group of rice millers has allowed the procurement agencies to use their godowns for storage of procured paddy. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “The procurement has started and over 60,000 quintals of paddy or 25% of total paddy in the mandis has been procured so far.”The district administrations has also held meetings with the ricemillers, arhtiyas, officials of agriculture marketing board and procurement agencies as well as concerned officials to keep a watch on the procurement process and ensure smooth procurement and lifting from the grain market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-as-paddy-procurement-begins-again/story-xzPFBwbBWXT5sGr7KnQu4K.html

He said the INLD has also submitted memorandums seeking a fourth farm law which guarantees minimum support price (MSP) for farmers and registration of a criminal case against those who purchase the farm produce below MSP. “The government stands exposed. Our farmers are being looted in the mandis. The MSP of paddy, millet and maize is ₹ 1,888, ₹ 2,100 and ₹ 1,800 respectively but due to the government’s anti-farmer policies it is being sold for less amount. Farmers are also forced to sell paddy at a much lower price than the MSP,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmer-friendly-bjp-jjp-leaders-should-resign-abhay-chautala/story-dB33HSnr5AMpSUci3HnBZO.html

The Congress government is doing what their high-command is telling them to do. But as far as farmers are concerned, they have understood the matter completely and their issues have been resolved after Prime Minister’s assurance,” Vij added.On October 5, the protest will begin from Dudhan Sadhan (Patiala) with a public meeting, and the tractors will then travel 10km to Pehowa border, from where Rahul Gandhi will enter Haryana, for a series of programmes there, a Congress spokesperson said. According to sources in Haryana Congress, Rahul Gandhi is likely to address rallies at Kaithal and Pipli in Kurukshetra district along the national highway on October 5 after which he will return to Delhi.Meanwhile, state BJP president OP Dhankar also said that the government will not welcome Congress leader Rahul Gandhi if he intends to damage the atmosphere of Haryana.“We will not welcome him if he is coming to damage the atmosphere of Haryana for political advantages,” Dhankar said. He also took a jibe at Congress president Sonia Gandhi saying that she was struggling to see her son as the Prime Minister of the country. “People should understand that Modiji is giving money for the procurement, not Sonia Gandhi,” he said.Dhankar, who was in Kurukshetra for a meeting of BJP district-level office bearers, said, “Congress leaders are spreading lies and false information about the new legislations as the Centre has already issued Rs 12,500 crore for paddy procurement in the state,” he said.Dhankar also slammed the Congress for not implementing the recommendations of Swaminathan commission.On the delay in paddy procurement, he said rice millers are affecting the procurement operations by not supporting the agencies but the government has already taken some decisions in this regard and every single grain of the farmers will be procured.

Gurpal Singh, a farm leader, said the Fatehabad MLA should join their protest or tender his resignation as an MLA against these three farm bills. “We want to ask why Babli and his party leaders did not register their protest before Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and home minister Anil Vij over the lathicharge on farmers and middlemen. Khattar had said the police resorted to lathicharge on farmers in self defence while Vij said no such incident was reported. This shows that the JJP leaders, including Babli, failed to stand by farmers during the tough time,” he said.Singh said it was shameful that the BJP ministers had lodged FIRs against the protesters and called them Congress workers. “People have voted for Babli to raise their grievances and not to enjoy power. If he considers himself as a farmer’s son, he should resign and support the farming community,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-bills-row-farmers-gherao-fatehabad-mla-s-office-demand-his-resignation/story-DgDGrt3Bm7ZqoeevyrrT4J.html

01-10-2020||Noida||Unlock 5: UP issues guidelines for graded opening of schools after Oct 15, allows public gatherings||The Uttar Pradesh government Thursday announced the guidelines under Unlock 5 and said all schools and coaching institutes, outside containment zones, will be allowed to open in a graded manner after October 15. However, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari said the decision to open schools will be taken by the district administration on the basis of local Covid-19 situation and in consultation with schools. The state also gave permission for religious gatherings, which means that public celebrations on the occasions of Durga Puja and Ram Lila and Diwali will be allowed. The Centre Wednesday had issued new guidelines for the reopening of movie theatres, schools and colleges, among others, and for allowing religious gatherings after a period of six months since the lockdown was imposed in March. “The online and distance education will continue and will be encouraged. Where the schools are conducting online classes, students who wish to continue with that instead of being physically present in school, they can do so. Students will be allowed to come to schools only with the written consent of parents. No school will be allowed to make parent consent mandatory,” Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), said. Most of the schools since the lockdown have been imparting online education. On September 21, the Ghaziabad district administration has deferred the decision to allow students of classes 9 to 12 to come to school on a voluntary basis for seeking academic guidance. The fresh directions have also paved way for Durga Puja and Ram Lila celebrations. The government in its order said permission for gatherings of 100 persons has already been given for social, educational, cultural and religious activities outside the containment zones. Regarding the Unlock 5 directions, members of parents’ associations said most parents were not in favour of sending children to school even after October 15. “There is still no vaccine for Covid-19 and most parents are unwilling to send children to schools even after October 15. Above all, since a major part of the academic year has been lost to the pandemic, the government must declare the session void for students up to class 8 and promote them to the higher classes,” Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of Ghaziabad parents’ association, said. “Even after the roll-out of the vaccine, there will be issues regarding the school fee. We have always maintained that the fee should be charged for online education. So, before opening, all such decisions have to be sorted out by the government or the administration,” he said. The schools are waiting for the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and will also have a meeting with the officials of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) before a final decision is taken. “There is a meeting scheduled for October 10 of various principals with the officials of the CBSE. Further, the CBSE will also issue SOPs regarding the reopening and send it to the state government. It is after these SOPs are notified by the government that the procedure for reopening schools will be decided,” Subhash Jain, president of the Independent Schools’ Federation of India, said. With regard to gatherings, Tiwari said, “Gatherings of more than 100 persons, outside containment zones, will be allowed from October 15 but with certain restrictions. Inside an enclosed space such as a hall, the permission would be for 50% of its capacity, or a maximum of 200 persons wearing face masks, maintaining social distancing and following other protocols. Gatherings will be allowed in open spaces with mandatory conditions of social distancing and face masks.” The state will soon issue SOPs for regulating the number of people. Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate, said that he has assigned several officials to take up assessment of opening of sports facilities, schools and theatres, among others. “The officials will deliberate on what all activities will be allowed after October 15 and make an assessment as per norms. I have deputed the district inspector of schools, district sports officer and the entertainment department officer to make this assessment,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/unlock-5-up-issues-guidelines-for-graded-opening-of-schools-after-oct-15-allows-public-gatherings/story-TIsYARFoLAcruRmbeJTplI.html

01-10-2020||Patna||Parties still shy of big ‘ticket’ change for women in Bihar||As Bihar’s chief minister for 15 years, Nitish Kumar has indeed taken a slew of initiatives for women, but their political empowerment, particularly in the context of assembly elections, remains a concern even today.Initiatives like cycle scheme for girls, 50% reservation to women in panchayats, primary agriculture credit societies, cooperative societies and school teachers’ recruitment, or even total prohibition in Bihar have found favour with women, which manifested itself in their turnout during 2019 Lok Sabha election, which was 60% compared to 55% male voters. But their representation in the state assembly remains low. The present assembly has just 28 women, which comes to mere 11% of the House strength of 243. The high point was the 2010 assembly polls, when 34 women (14%) made it to the Assembly, the highest representation in the last six decades. The year 2010 also witnessed the highest number of women in the election fray at 307, which dropped to 272 five years later. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections also, only three women could win from Bihar. The 17th Lok Sabha got 78 woman MPs, an increase of 16 from the 16th but it was still just 14.31%. With another Assembly elections round the corner, the issue of woman representation has again started drawing attention, as it depends on how many tickets mainstream political parties actually give to women. Most political parties shy away from giving tickets to women citing the winnability factor in the male-dominated electoral politics.Shakti, along with 120 grassroots organisations, has very timely appealed to all political parties in Bihar, national and smaller parties, urging them to field 50% female candidates.Tara Krishnswamy, co-founder of Shakti, said, “The last 68 years of elections in Bihar show that men have 90% reservations in the Assembly, which implies that voters have no choice. Shockingly, if we add up all the women who have ever been MLAs in Bihar, it adds up to only 277! Just a little more than the size of the Assembly.”“How can Bihar become a glorious state by leaving 50% of the talent untapped for state governance? We are putting public pressure on the parties to be fair, and field 50% women candidates. It is the only democratic thing to do,” she says.Dr Maya Shankar Prasad, historian and retired professor, department of history, Patna University, says, “21st century should be a gender equality century, especially when it comes to representation in the Parliament and state assemblies. It would be a good gesture on the part of our leaders to offer them at least 33% to start with.”Earlier this month, an endeavour to groom woman leaders by a social organization ‘Netri Foundation’ and involving experts from World Bank, UN Women, Indian School of democracy and other organisations also got underway with the support from all the mainstream political parties to prepare woman leaders for 2020 polls. “We have trained over 250 women in UP and MP for panchayat politicians, but this is the first time we doing it for assembly elections. The objective is to let women themselves champion the cause of gender in politics, which remains largely neglected. The response has been very good,” said Netri founder Kanchi Agarwal, adding the programme ends on October 3. Congress MLA Amita Bhushan too pitched for at least 33% reservation for women in the legislature. “Rest they can do themselves, as they have amply proved with whatever opportunities have come their way. It is high time all the political parties came forward to give women the representation they deserve and stop rhetoric. Women today are ready to take the mantle, but they are being denied their rights,” she says.

01-10-2020||City||After Rohtang, more high-altitude tunnels to come up on Manali-Leh highway||Once the strategic Atal Tunnel under the Rohtang Pass is inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, the defence ministry will expedite work on building more high-altitude tunnels, including three on the Manali-Leh highway, to facilitate troop movement to the China border. “Atal Tunnel at Rohtang will not only open new vistas of development in landlocked Lahaul-Spiti district but will also ensure better connectivity to the border areas. The Government of India is contemplating building three more tunnels on the Manali-Leh highway to have all-weather connectivity to the border areas of Ladakh,” Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said on Thursday. Fifteen years ago, the defence ministry proposed tunnels under the Shinku La (Pass), Zoji La, Baralacha La, Tanglang La and Lachung La. The tunnels on the Manali-Leh highway are the 13.2-km stretch under the 16,040-foot Baralacha Pass; the 14.78-km tunnel under Lachung Pass; and the 7.32-km tunnel under the Tanglang Pass located at 17,480-ft above sea level. DETAILED PROJECT REPORT OF SHINKU LA BEING MADE The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) has begun preparing a detailed project report for the tunnel under Shinku La. A high-level team recently inspected the north end of the proposed 13.5-km tunnel. Though Shinku La does not have glaciers, it’s prone to avalanches during the snow season that hampers vehicular movement. Three years ago, the Border Road Organisation completed the 39.6-km stretch from Lahaul valley to Zanskar. The stretch connecting Darcha with Shinku La also cuts the distance between Manali and Leh. Besides the road’s strategic importance, it has brought relief for the 15-odd villages in Zanskar valley where residents had to walk for five days to either reach Leh or Manali. The road is significant for the proposed tunnel beneath Shinku La. TALL CHALLENGES The defence ministry has proposed to excavate a 13.2-km tunnel beneath the Baralacha Pass in the Zanskar range. At present, crossing it on the 470-km highway connecting Manali and Leh is a nightmare for travellers. It remains closed for traffic in winter, while melting glaciers create streams, making it one of the country’s most treacherous roads. A 7.32-km tunnel has been mooted under the 17,480-ft Tanglang Pass, the second highest motorable pass in the world. The last tunnel on the highway has been planned under the 16,666-ft Lachung Pass on the boundary of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Located just 25 km from Sarchu, the tunnel will measure 14.7km. Defence sources said the need for all-weather connectivity to the forward areas on the 475-km Manali-Leh road is priority in view of the tense border ties with China. TUNNELS IN THE MAKING The defence ministry will expedite work on building more high-altitude tunnels, including three on the Manali-Leh highway, to facilitate troop movement to the China border. Tanglang Pass: 17,480 ft, tunnel of 7.32km Shinku Pass: 16,703 ft, tunnel of 13.5km Lachung Pass: 16,666 ft, tunnel of 14.7km Baralacha Pass: 16,040 ft, tunnel of 13.2km Zoji La: 11,570 ft||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-rohtang-more-high-altitude-tunnels-to-come-up-on-manali-leh-highway/story-INv0t7ftiERrL0oXRBU2DL.html

01-10-2020||City||Covid-19 testing falls in Jalandhar, kiosks set up outside govt offices||Jalandhar With a sharp dip in daily sampling and contact-tracing of covid-19 cases due to farmers’ protests, the district health department is setting up testing centres outside government offices and densely populated localities.The Jalandhar health department was taking, on average, 5,000 samples per day for two weeks before the protests broke out. Last week, the deputy commissioner asked the department to increase the sampling. However, with people in rural areas refusing to undergo the test, the department is finding it difficult to collect 3,000 samples per day. For daily sampling, 78 health department teams comprising four-five employees in each are enrolled in daily sampling.Responding to the situation, officials have deployed health teams outside the district administration complex, transport department, SDM’s office and Sewa Kendras of the district for mandatory covid testing.In addition, teams have been deployed at the PSPCL office, the municipal corporation office, containment zones, Surya Enclave locality, Krishan Pura, Amar Nagar, Basti Gujja, PAP etc for conducting the covid-19 test. “The farmers’ protest has impacted daily sampling. We have now deployed teams outside government offices. Health officials are taking the sample of all government employees to contain the virus and meet targets,” said Dr Harish Bhardwaj, nodal officer for covid testing in Jalandhar.Jalandhar is the second-worst district of the state with 12,920 positive cases and 390 deaths from the virus till September 30. The number of samples taken was 3,698 on Thursday. Officials said they conduct antigen tests that detect certain proteins in the virus by using a nasal or throat swab to get a fluid sample. The report is updated on the website the next day, concealing the identity, while information is provided to the individual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-testing-falls-in-jalandhar-kiosks-set-up-outside-govt-offices/story-FrqbFRgbNhappkTwWSQEOP.html

The government has also allowed the reopening of schools, coaching institutions, public libraries from mid-October in a phased manner.Swimming pools for the training of sportspersons and entertainment parks too will be allowed to open from October 15 under the guidelines of the Centre.The “Reopen” exercise comes after four unlock phases since June 1. The new guidelines allow political, religious, social, cultural, and sports gatherings in open spaces with no limit, provided people wear masks, observe social distancing and there are adequate provisions to observe such rules from mid-October.With the by-polls to seven assembly seats to be held in early November, allowing political gatherings in open spaces could pave the way for parties to hold rallies and campaigns.The decision will also allow larger marriage functions and other social and cultural activities during the upcoming festive season.In closed spaces, gatherings with a maximum of 50% of hall capacity and with a ceiling of 200 people have been allowed. Till now, the number of people allowed at such gatherings was 100.The government imposed strict curbs on activities and travel across the country on March 25. After the 68-days hard lockdown, the government began implementing a graded plan to reopen businesses and bring economic activities, hit hard by the pandemic and the restrictions that followed, back on track in June. It was then that the Unlock 1 phase guidelines came into place. Shops, malls, hotels and restaurants, offices and religious places have been allowed to open in a phased manner over the past few months. Restrictions on the interstate and intrastate travel too were lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/re-open-norms-pave-way-for-restart-of-schools-durga-puja-by-poll-rallies-in-uttar-pradesh/story-Jfs5oPGVTs7QNGUnq83bjI.html

01-10-2020||Mumbai||Form commission for grievances against private hospitals: Bombay high court||The Bombay high court has said the state has the power to cancel the registrations of private hospitals and nursing homes found guilty of overcharging Covid-19 patients, but shutting them would not be a viable option. It has said compensation to such patients could be a remedy. The court also suggested the state could form a redressal mechanism in the form of a commission on the lines of a similar set up in West Bengal that has been effective in addressing grievances of such overcharging. It observed that mere entrustment of duty to administrative officers may not be enough and the Maharashtra government can consider similar solutions. The court said this while disposing of a petition seeking directions for capping rates of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits in private hospitals and nursing homes.Also Read: Respond to PIL on lack of POCSO implementation: Bombay HC to MaharashtraThe court was told the state government has issued notifications warning hospitals against overcharging. But in the absence of a redressal mechanism, the assurances and notifications have been ineffective.Abhijit Mangade, the petitioner, submitted bills of a private hospital which charged Rs 1.37 lakhs for PPE kits from a patient under treatment for 20 days. Mangade told a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that the patient was given a regulated bed. He added though there was a cap on the rate of PPE kits, the hospital charged the man for 11 PPE kits per day, thus making the entire purpose of the rate chart useless.A notification issued by the government said private hospitals could charge only Rs 600 for a PPE kit.Also Read: Fatal injury not a must to invoke attempt to murder charge: Bombay high courtManagade told the court that a hospital run by a charitable trust had also charged a Covid-19 patient Rs 46,000 for one-day hospitalisation.

I will not say conspiracy, but there has to be some preparation behind the act. Without preparation, bringing down the structure in five hours, was not possible,” Godbole said. A special CBI court in Lucknow ruled out conspiracy and acquitted all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, including former deputy prime minister LK Advani, former union minister Murli Manohar Joshi, ex-Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti, due to lack of conclusive evidence. The court held that the demolition on December 6, 1992 was a spontaneous act and not pre-plannedRecalling the chain of events in 1992, Godbole said that the then Kalyan Singh government in Uttar Pradesh was not inclined to protect mosque. “This has been brought out even in Liberhan commission report,” he said. The commission was constituted by the centre as an inquiry into the sequence of events that led to demolition of mosque. Godbole said when the result related to the Ram Janma Bhoomi came, he thought there could be a dispute over the claims as who owns the land. “But in this case, where a criminal offence was registered, I thought the court would do the proper verification and some result will come,” he said.The former home secretary said he believes the latest verdict by the Lucknow court has come because the Supreme Court was insistent on a verdict, because of which, the case had reached this stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/was-expecting-a-different-verdict-says-fmr-home-secy-godbole-on-babri-demolition-case/story-TF34fOWWycno1AH2oyZl6I.html

Both, Phursungi and Uruli Devachi garbage yards are currently shut as per NGT orders, so why has the PMC released a tender seeking bulldozers on rent?” he questioned. Shinde furnished copies of the tender as part of a petition filed before the PMC commissioner seeking immediate action. “The tender has come up before the standing committee for approval. Moreover, a 30-year-old bulldozer was deployed in violation of Supreme Court norms,” the petition lodged by Shinde stated. The head of PMC’s solid waste management division, Dnyaneshwar Molak, who is incharge of the project said, “I am on leave. Please contact PMC property tax head Vilas Kanade.” Kanade said, “I don’t know much about the issue and I am only officiating for a few days.” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar could not be reached for his comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cong-corporator-claims-huge-waste-of-public-money-by-pmc/story-9ynKVhxuelx38Qor3A3P1J.html

Citizens used it continuously. It might be more dangerous. It was the rainy season, so gardens were closed, but we will meet and review our decision.”Ashok Ghorpade, chief of PMC’s garden department, said, “No other municipal corporation has opened gardens yet. Even the state government’s guidelines are to keep gardens shut. The PMC opened up 13 gardens two months ago, but citizens did not follow guidelines. They were coming without masks and arguing with security guards. Mainly senior citizens and children come to gardens and both are in the high-risk age group for Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-may-review-decision-to-open-public-gardens/story-mPsOyfVF0ZKwwo6ldsGPuN.html
01-10-2020||Pune||Experts will train Pune city doctors on SOPs||A team of specialists from Mumbai will arrive in the city on Thursday to impart training on post-Covid complications and treatment thereof, at the jumbo Covid facility at COEP. The doctors from Nair Hospital in Mumbai would also help formulate a standard operating procedure (SOP) for patients who have recovered from the Covid-19 infection, but still face health issues. Earlier in August four extremely critical Covid-19 patients who were on a ventilator for about four to six weeks were successfully discharged from Pune’s Army Institute of Cardiothoracic Sciences (AICTS) after they were treated with anti-fibrotic drugs which was also the first such feat in the country. By the end of June, four kids who were admitted to Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital who lived in Covid-19 containment zones also showed signs of Kawasaki disease like swelling of hands and feet, peeling of skin of fingers and Coronary artery (heart blood vessel) dilatation and persistent fever and other inflammation signs.City doctors and hospitals have been reporting multiple complications, post Covid-19, including Kawasaki disease-like symptoms in children and lung fibrosis. The draft SOP prepared by the Pune administration covers a wide array of issues including drug-related complications and neuromuscular problems. The SOP, which is in the possession of HT, mentions what symptoms should be looked in patients that have recovered and what should be a probable line of diagnosis. As of Tuesday, of the total number of reported Covid-19 positives of 2,89,803, 2,27,250 have recovered. Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner, said, “Cuttack university has given a detailed presentation and draft SOP based on which we will prepare our own SOP. We will have a decentralised system for post-Covid-19 treatment because we do not want rural patients who might have sought treatment in the city to travel back to the city for post-infection treatment.” The draft SOP speaks of multiple tests including blood investigations, to ascertain the stoppage of cytokine storm for moderate cases. A chest X-ray and HRCT is to detect residual lung damage. A six-minute walk test is offered to all to detect a fall in saturation after exercise. Pulmonary complications include exertional hypoxia or the need for low-dose oxygen therapy, which points to lung fibrosis. Post-Covid Kawasaki disease symptoms with rashes in the adolescent age group, and a variety of skin manifestations should be looked for six weeks. Post Covid-19 stroke is also a factor, with viral fatigue syndrome, weakness and extreme fatigue, mentioned in the draft SOP. As per the SOP, for those with comorbidities, anti-diabetic therapy should be titrated with blood glucose control as sugars will settle down with reduction in steroid dose. This is applicable to hypertension also. Patients needing dialysis therapy during acute stage should be monitored for residual renal damage, the SOP states. The SOP also speaks of drug related complications during the course of treatment. Physiotherapy is needed for all patients who have recovered from Covid-19. As per the SOP, respiratory physiotherapy with respiratory exercise for a period of six weeks to three months is recommended. Other possible complications include weight loss, depression, episodes of mania and social deprivation, also of which needs to be tackled by a clinical psychologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/experts-will-train-pune-city-docs-on-sops/story-oW5tPpdyPJJ8fk46ua6nPP.html
01-10-2020||Pune||Sero survey: Prevalence of antibodies at former hotspots in Pune||Although the scientific community is still studying and understanding herd immunity with respect to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covd-19, fewer cases being reported from former virus hotspot areas like Bhavani peth, are indicative of antibodies developed in a majority of the population there. The city’s first sero survey was conducted by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER). The report, accessed by HT on Wednesday, claims a 45.7% prevalence of antibodies in Bhavani peth, which includes Rasta peth and Raviwar peth. Ward number 19, Lohiyanagar-Kasewadi, showed a 65.4% prevalence, indicative of a majority of the population in these areas developing antibodies. A senior official requesting anonymity said, “Both the sero survey and the current scenario is indicative of herd immunity in these wards. Although this requires an in-depth study, but the positivity rate and the numbers of cases being reported from these areas is now lower than ever before.” Dr Sarang Kalekar, the health officer in Bhavani peth, said, “The positivity rate for the ward is now close to nine-10 per cent. On Tuesday we tested 70 samples, of which six tested positive, while on Monday, when we tested 60 samples, five tested positive. A total of 4,900 have tested positive in Bhavani peth since March, till September 30. The positivity rate has gone down drastically in the past one week. We will keep a watch on this and if the trend continues for another 10 days, it will be great. We are fulfilling out daily target of 120-130 tests daily, and fewer new positives are being recorded.” In Dhole Patil road, another former Covid hotspot in the city, of the 2,773 tests conducted by the PMC in September, 388 are positive. Dr Rekha Galande, Pune municipal corporation (PMC) health officer with Dhole Patil road, said, “We have not brought down the number of tests, but there is no requirement, because fewer new Covid-19 positives are coming up. With every new test, four contacts are tested, but most test negative and so the spread is not as much as it used to be.” Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC said, “Every ward has a target of 150-300 tests, daily, depending on fresh cases, contacts that have to be tested and the population of each ward. It is true that the current positivity rate of both these wards, Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road, is low. We have not deliberately brought down the number of tests being carried out, but it is done as per requirement.” As of latest report, the percentage growth of Covid-19 cases from both these wards is the lowest in the city. From September 17 to September 23, Bhavani peth reported 5.2% growth in positive cases, and Dhole Patil road, reported 5.4%. Sinhgad road, in comparison reported a growth 12.8% in the same period, the highest in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sero-survey-prevalence-of-antibodies-at-former-hotspots-in-pune/story-g8Aurl9Tp9nTVWPEDDi7tM.html

The traffic stayed jammed for over an hour despite the lockdown.“The stretch of road that usually takes me hardly 10 minutes, took around an hour to cross.

Once people became aware of the hike in toll, the traffic returned to normal,” said a traffic policeman, requesting anonymity.Jayant Mhaiskar, chairman and managing director of MEP Infra, which manages the toll gates, said, “We have deployed additional staff for toll collection; as people get used to the new rates, the situation will stabilise within a day or two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/day-1-of-increased-toll-long-queue-of-vehicles-at-two-toll-gates-in-thane/story-lXkjmjzkc9MGy8U7owrO9H.html
01-10-2020||Delhi||Gandhi Jayanti: Drama returns to Delhi’s stage with Bapu’s footsteps||Like a drop of water on parched earth, theatre has returned in its original format to where its heart lies. The recent commotion within the premises of National School of Drama (NSD) isn’t for no reason. The stage is being set for its first live performance since the pandemic brought the life in Mandi House to a standstill, just like in most other parts of the country. On Gandhi Jayanti, October 2, the return of theatre to its most prominent genesis will be marked with the staging of the play, Pehla Satyagrahi. Though this play was introduced to audience last year, the stage on which it will be presented now is newly built, in the lawns of NSD. “When MHA guidelines for Unlock 4 allowed us to restart operations, we called our actors back, asked them to submit their Covid-19 report, and then made a roster to ensure that only about 9-10 people are present at a time for rehearsals. This stage on which we will perform now is bigger, but is in open space so we will be well within the guidelines of social distancing. Also, no visitor without a mask will be allowed entry plus the stage and audience gallery will be sanitised before and after the show, which will be for only 100 people,” informs Suresh Sharma, director of this play and director-in-charge at NSD. “A new play takes about 45 days to be conceived and well executed on the stage. Since we had limited time after our repertory actors joined back on September 7, there wasn’t much time to start work on a new play. And for that we would have had to work with 40 people in one go, which would be a risky affair in these times! But, we knew that our audience has been waiting. Aur jab tak ek artiste perform na kare, toh depress ho jata hai... ab toh cheh mahine se zyada ho gaye perform kiye...,” adds Sharma. The play an apt choice for Covid-19 times, this play certainly talks about Bapu’s journey of becoming a Mahatma from Gandhi, and unravels many lesser-known aspects of his life. But, the director feels that it’s Gandhi who taught us the relevance of “swachchta and self-discipline”, and in the Covid era “Hume apne aap ko anushasit karna hoga, sarkar kitna karegi (We will have to discipline ourselves, how much will the government do)?” says Sharma opining that the comeback to stage was much needed and he isn’t in favour of theatre going online. “Theatre’s definition, around the world, is a performance that is live. It has to be an interaction between the actors and with the audience. Theatre can’t be online... And if there arises a situation that the actors have to wear masks and perform, then in that case there shouldn’t be any performance because a mask hides 70% of the face; in theatre we convey a lot through our body language. Aise hi karna hai toh phir toh hum puppet ke through kar lenge.”              If this format turns out to be a success then the performances will resume fortnightly, over weekends, according to the plan so far. And actors, who were out of work are in a way welcoming this decision. “During the rehearsals we wore masks,” says Raju Roy, who plays the protagonist Gandhi, in the play. A guest artiste with NSD Repertory, Roy says it wasn’t easy for him to leave his ailing mother back home in Guwahati, Assam, to return to Delhi for work. His words, “Natak ki bhookh hai,” echo as he shares how he had to quarantine himself for 10 days to meet his mother in his hometown before he returned to the Capital. “Almost all of my friends who are artistes called me up during the lockdown saying they are going back home because they were unable to pay their house rent in absence of a livelihood. Some said they were feeling depressed; and now I’ve been calling them up saying that work has resumed.... Lekin, is baar jab Delhi aaya to ek ajeeb sa mahaul dikha... ab dimag ke ek hisse me corona hai aur dusre me natak. Savdhan hoke manch pe chalna padega.”                               Catch It LiveWhat: Pehla Satyagrahi  Where: Open Air Auditorium, National School of Drama When: October 2 to 4 Timing: 6.30pm Nearest Metro Station: Mandi House on Blue and Violet Line          Author tweets @HennaRakheja Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gandhi-jayanti-drama-returns-to-delhi-s-stage-with-bapu-s-footsteps/story-CpsIiZr4bMFPtdmVLJygeJ.html

01-10-2020||City||Assam BJP leader arrested in connection with police recruitment scam||A leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assam has been arrested for his alleged involvement in a paper leak scam related to a written examination to recruit 587 police sub-inspectors (S-Is). The examination to recruit the S-Is was cancelled following the paper leak on social media on September 20. Diban Deka (43), who had unsuccessfully contested as a BJP candidate from the Barkhetri assembly seat in Assam’s Nalbari district in 2011, was arrested from Patacharkuchi in newly created Bajali district late at night on Wednesday, 10 days after the scam was unearthed.According to the police, a team from the crime branch of Guwahati police was dispatched to lower Assam on Wednesday morning based on credible information about movement of Deka. “At about 2345 hours (11.45pm), during checking near Pathsala town, Diban Deka was found travelling with his wife. He was detained and brought to Guwahati under a strong police escort,” said an Assam Police release. He was produced in a city court which remanded him to five days of police custody. “Deka was not an office bearer of any unit of the party. He was a primary member of BJP and following his arrest and involvement in the job scam, we have removed him from the party’s primary membership,” Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass told journalists on Thursday. Following the cancellation of the written exam, Deka, in a Facebook post, had admitted that he was associated with the company that was to conduct the recruitment of SIs. But he denied any involvement in the paper leak. PK Dutta, another prime accused in the case and a retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who is suspected to have lured the aspirants with the promise of S-I’s jobs in exchange for cash, is still absconding.Nearly 66,000 aspirants were scheduled to appear for the cancelled examination. Assam Police’s crime branch and the CID are probing the case and have arrested over a dozen suspects in the case. Deka and Dutta are accused of getting hold of the question paper and giving it to select candidates, who had allegedly paid them in cash.Investigation has revealed that several job aspirants had stayed at a hotel in Guwahati, which is owned by Dutta, and had appeared for a mock test in another hotel a day ahead of the written examination that was slated to be held on September 20.“Deka had arranged for the question paper for the mock test conducted at a Guwahati hotel. We need to establish the link between Deka and Dutta,” Gyanendra Pratap Singh, additional director-general of police (ADGP) (law and order), Assam Police, had told media persons on Monday.Earlier this week, Assam Police had issued a lookout notice for both Dutta and Deka and announced a cash reward of Rs 100,000 each for any information leading to the arrest of these absconders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-bjp-leader-arrested-in-connection-with-police-recruitment-scam/story-joYoOK8NLkvRaILNKQzx1K.html

He also held discussions with elected representatives of various political parties through video conferences. The public movement against the disease will also include free distribution of face masks to encourage people to follow the prescribed protocol for protection against the virus. Gehlot has called upon everybody to take a pledge to make the movement an effective weapon against the virus.“If the number of corona positive cases increases then it will be a big challenge for us,” said Gehlot before adding that the movement starting from October 2 is not a political campaign, but a non-political campaign against coronavirus, requiring cooperation from everyone. “Saving life is our top priority. There will be no shortage of funds to prevent the coronavirus infection,” said the CM.Former chief minister and senior BJP leader Vasundhara Raje thanked Gehlot for reaching out to public representatives from all parties. She said that the corona infection was in its most dangerous phase now and everyone was required to work together, rising above party politics, to defeat it.

01-10-2020||Mumbai||Fatal injury not a must to invoke attempt to murder charge: Bombay high court||For justifying to invoke the charge of attempt to murder, it is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted, the Bombay high court observed last week.“Section 307 (of the Indian Penal Code) draws a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any,” said justice Bharati Dangre.“Such an act may not be attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but still there can be cases in which a person could be held liable under the section,” the judge added.The high court made the observation while rejecting bail applications of Sachin Gurav (27) and his brother Samir (21), both of whom have been arrested by Vijaydurg police on September 5, 2019 for “attempting to murder” one Bhikaji Gurav.Also Read: ‘Don’t want anyone homeless during pandemic’: Bombay HC refuses to allow demolitions, evictionsPolice claimed that Bhikaji was prosecuted for killing Sachin and Samir’s father, and the brothers were perturbed by Bhikaji’s acquittal, and therefore they assaulted him on September 4, when he returned to their village.It was argued on behalf of the Gurav brothers that it was unfortunate that Bhikaji lost his left hand in the attack, but the applicants did not intend to kill him, as they did not attack any vital organ, and therefore the attack could not be termed as an attempt to murder.Justice Dangre, however, refused to accept the argument. The judge said for ascertaining whether an act would fall within the ambit of Section 307, it necessary to look into the nature of the act, circumstances under which the act is committed and the intention or knowledge of the accused.The judge said in the case at hand “the applicants nurtured motive”.“The applicants can be attributed of clear knowledge and intention,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fatal-injury-not-a-must-to-invoke-attempt-to-murder-charge-bombay-high-court/story-P8H846c4bakcymqSqs5w7N.html
01-10-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 impact: Menstrual hygiene worsens for girls in capital’s slums||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has aggravated menstrual woes for young girls in the national capital slum clusters. They are facing an acute fund crunch to buy sanitary napkins coupled with unhygienic and crowded washrooms and toilets in their tenements. There is also a perennial scarcity of water and a lack of awareness about menstrual hygiene products. The contagion-induced economic crisis has led many young girls to abandon sanitary napkins for menstrual pads made of cloth, which has raised the spectre of a looming health hazard. Also read: Life a struggle, can’t SC rethink decision, ask residents of Delhi slums along railway linesTeenager Babita Kumari (16), a resident of the Shaheed Bhagat Singh camp in Delhi, is the sole breadwinner for her family. She lives with her widowed mother and siblings. “Earlier, we could ask our neighbours for sanitary pads or at times use the ones given to my sister from her school. We have stopped asking the neighbours because everyone is hard up for cash these days and schools are closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. What I earn isn’t enough for us to even afford two square meals a day or buy my mother’s medicines. Sanitary pads are a luxury,” said Kumari, a domestic help.Her switch to cloth as a poor substitute for sanitary pads has led to constant itches and painful rashes. “I can’t even move around freely in my home, because I am, too, worried about the blood stains. Other girls in our slum cluster are facing a similar problem,” she added. Komal Kumari (15), another teenager and a resident of the Nehru camp in the national capital, said: “The biggest problem that we faced during the Covid-19 pandemic was during our menstrual cycles. We have to wash our dirty cloth pads, dry, and reuse them. Since all our family members were at home during the pandemic-induced lockdown restrictions, we had to hide the cloth pads and take it to the community toilet, where scarcity of water is a perennial problem.” Lack of adequate toilets and washrooms are a commonplace problem across various slum clusters in Delhi for thousands of families living cheek by jowl in these tenements. Teenage girls, who have attained puberty, are the worst victims of the infrastructure woes and are finding it increasingly difficult to overcome the stigma of menstruation.Gunja (15), who lives at a camp in west Delhi, said it was uncomfortable to even walk to the toilets in her slum cluster. “At times, blood stains remain, despite being careful. Once, local rowdies made lewd remarks against me while I was on my way back home,” she said.Experts said that though the problem was prevalent earlier, the Covid-19 outbreak has aggravated the crisis. “Young girls living on the streets are not even able to manage menstrual hygiene even during pre-Covid times. The viral outbreak has deepened their woes. The difficulty in obtaining old clothes from various sources, lack of water, growing job losses, privacy issues and myths are collectively responsible for the travails at hand,” said Sanjay Gupta, director at CHETNA, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The NGO has been distributing sanitary napkins among young girls living on the streets, night-shelters and slums across Delhi after their internal survey pointed out to this glaring need, he said.Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court (SC)-appointed monitoring committee for homeless shelters, said, “This is a major issue among underprivileged female children because there is no money or work. If food can be provided at these shelters, then why not sanitary napkins? The government can create programmes for distributing sanitary pads, preferably biodegradable, among such sections of the society to address this pressing need.”Though the Central government has ensured that Suvidha sanitary napkins are available at Jan-Aushadhi Kendras under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Aushadhi Yojana (PMJAY) across the country at Re.1 per pad, experts said lack of awareness remains a major deterrent. “The public doesn’t know about Jan Aushudi Kendras or there is no established link between the beneficiaries and the options available,” said Prakash.Ranjana Prasad, a member of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, said, “We distributed around 1.48 lakh sanitary pads on a priority basis to young girls in child care institutions, night-shelters and slum clusters during the Covid-19-induced lockdown in the city. The sanitary napkins were also added to ration kits because we were aware that this is an important issue among underprivileged families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-impact-menstrual-hygiene-worsens-for-girls-in-capital-s-slums/story-z8G0IlSx9CMbknK9fb4sKO.html
01-10-2020||City||Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka to meet Hathras rape victim’s family today||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his sister and party general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will visit the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday a fortnight after she was gang-raped at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. The woman was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. A Congress leader said some members of the party’s Scheduled Castes department – Akshay Maurya, Shivram Singh, Ritu Choudhary, Pramod Kumar and Pradeep Narwal -- will also accompany them. Hundreds of Congress workers have started gathering at the Delhi-Noida border to accompany the two leaders, he added. Before leaving for Hathras, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over “jungle raj” in Uttar Pradesh. “The atrocities on daughters continue in UP’s jungle raj. They were not given respect when alive and now the dignity has been taken away even in death. The BJP’s slogan of ‘Beti Bachao’ is not to save girls but to hide facts and save power,” he tweeted. Also read: Samajwadi Party to take vow of silence in protest against UP govt on Gandhi JayantiPriyanka Gandhi too attacked chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the rise in incidents of rape in UP. “Hathras-like gruesome incident has happened in Balrampur. The girl’s feet and back were broken. There have been atrocities on girls in Azamgarh, Baghpat and Bulandshahr. There is no limit to UP’s jungle raj. Law and order cannot be implemented through marketing and speeches. This is the time for the chief minister’s accountability. People want answers,” she tweeted in Hindi. On Wednesday, the Congress demanded Adityanath’s resignation over the incident. Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the people of the country are sad and angry over the gruesome incident and said the ‘Nirbhaya of Hathras’ did not die but was killed by a “cruel and insensitive” government and its administration. In a video message, she said the country will speak up against this injustice and not allow the BJP to divide the country and violate the Constitution. “This incident is a blot on our society. I want to ask is it a sin to be a girl? Is it a crime to be the daughter of a poor? What was the UP government doing? For weeks, the family’s cry for justice was not heard. There was an attempt to cover up the issue. The girl was not given proper treatment. Today, our daughter has left us. I want to say that the Nirbhaya of Hathras did not die, she was killed by an insensitive government and its administration,” Gandhi said. Also read: After Hathras, another Dalit woman gangraped in Balrampur; UP govt faces backlash“Even after her death, the girl was denied dignity and not handed over to her family. A weeping mother could not see her daughter for the last time. This is a grave sin. Her body was cremated by force. There is dignity in death. Our Hindu religion is clear about it. But she was cremated like an orphan by the police,” she added. “What kind of justice is this? What kind of a government is this? You think you can do anything and the nation will sit and watch. The nation will speak against your injustice. On behalf of the Congress party, I demand justice for the family. India belongs to everyone. Everyone has the right to live with dignity. The Constitution has given us this right. We will not allow the BJP to break the country and violate the Constitution,” the Congress president said. Rahul Gandhi attacked the BJP government over the alleged rise in atrocities on Dalits in the state. “A daughter of India is raped-murdered, facts are suppressed and in the end, the right to perform the last rites is also taken away from the victim’s family. It is insulting and unjust,” he tweeted in Hindi using the hashtag ‘Hathras Horror Shocks India’. Gandhi tagged a video purportedly of the cremation site showing a police officer not answering questions on whether the body of the victim was being cremated there. “This is a shameful move of the UP government to suppress Dalits and show them their ‘place’ in the society. The Congress’ fight is against this disgusting thinking,” he said. Priyanka Gandhi said, “I was on the phone with the Hathras victim’s father when he was informed that his daughter had passed away. I heard him cry out in despair.” “He had just been telling me that all he wanted was justice for his child. Last night, the victim’s father was robbed of the chance to take his daughter home for the last time and perform her last rites,” she said in a series of tweets. Tagging Adityanath, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted, “RESIGN. Instead of protecting the victim and her family, your government became complicit in depriving her of every single human right, even in death. You have no moral right to continue as chief minister.” In another tweet in Hindi, she alleged that at 2.30 am Wednesday, the victim’s kin kept requesting but the UP administration forcibly cremated the deceased. “The government did not protect her when she was alive. The government did not provide her timely treatment when she was attacked. After her death, the government took away the right of the family to perform the last rites of their daughter and did not respect the deceased,” she said. “Gross inhumanity. You did not stop the crime but behaved like criminals. You did not stop the atrocities, but committed atrocity on an innocent child and her family twice,” she added. At a press briefing, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said there must be an inquiry into the whole incident, but the subject matter of the inquiry must go beyond the activities of the rapists. There should be an inquiry into the “gross and criminal negligence” by the UP chief minister, who is also the home minister of the state, in the matter, Dev said. “The way she was cremated is a gross violation of her human rights. The way she was left in a normal ward for more than six days is a gross violation of her human rights. For eight days, there is no FIR and when there is an FIR, look at the sections this hopeless and ruthless government gives, no sections of rape,” she alleged. “The way the cremation was carried out at 2.30 am in an unjust manner, to give justice, the only answer is that the Prime Minister should ask for UP CM’s resignation. If the PM does not do so, then there will be no justice to her,” Dev said. She also attacked union minister Smriti Irani for not speaking out on the issue. “She would go down in history as the worst women and child development minister. She should resign as an MP of the Lok Sabha given the state of crime and women security in UP,” Dev said. “Don’t you tell us we are politicising this. The same PM who told us ‘Nirbhaya ko yaad rakhna’ is silent. Ajay Bisht (Yogi Adityanath) will have to resign. We will take to the streets till he leaves his post and we will not let this government sleep,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rahul-priyanka-to-visit-hathras-to-meet-family-of-dalit-girl/story-Lytjte9uFyqheBIy5EKtoJ.html

In 2018, a city-wise environmental crime data was published by the NCRB for the first time, where Mumbai had recorded 10 cases, which was the highest among the 19 cities surveyed. However, the NCRB figure was a fraction, as compared to the data collated by the Maharashtra revenue department. According to the Mumbai suburban collector’s office, violations under the EPA, 1986 were 244 in 2019 against 286 in 2018. While similar violations in Mumbai city were 56 in 2019, as compared to 68 in 2018.“The reason for fewer cases documented by the NCRB vis-à-vis revenue department data is because environmental offence information is submitted by the Mumbai Police, who record fewer cases as compared to the revenue department, which is empowered to file offences under the EPA Act, 1986,” said an Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) official, the monitoring agency for such violations. Also Read: Maharashtra cabinet decides to withdraw cases against green activists for Aarey protests“NCRB and revenue department data are indicative of proper reporting and documentation of cases in both Mumbai and Maharashtra, as compared to other states,” he added.The NCRB data for EPA, 1986 offences for Maharashtra showed 42 cases in 2019, as compared to 45 in 2018. It was the second-highest offence last year after Uttar Pradesh (UP), which had recorded 382 cases. However, the tally of environment-related offences -- all acts clubbed under environmental crime such as the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972; the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000; the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; EPA, 1986; and Indian Forest Act, 1927 -- was 1,004 across Maharashtra last year. The corresponding cases in 2016 and 2017 were 176 and 439, respectively. The offences had gone up exponentially to 1,010 cases in 2018.“Better detection and a rigorous follow up by the state authorities coupled with awareness among the public for reporting cases led to the marginal decline last year,” said Sanjay Sandanshiv, undersecretary, environment department, Maharashtra.No cases were reported for offences under forest laws, air and noise pollution or the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010. While four cases were reported under violations of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.The environmentalists have welcomed the Mumbai city collector’s move to book offenders in the two cases. The first one involved repeated complaints by environment group, Conservation Action Trust (CAT), alleging dumping of illegal debris to reclaim land along the periphery of Sagarmatha club in Navy Nagar Colaba by the Indian Army. The alleged move has led to wanton mangrove destruction.The Army claims that the debris is intended to fortify the club against sea erosion.“We are happy that the Mumbai city collector has again reiterated his decision to book the club authorities. Reclamation and destruction of mangroves has been continuing for years, despite innumerable complaints. The collector has also agreed to order the removal of the debris and undertake mangrove plantation for trees destroyed in the area. This is the most important step that was long overdue,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, CAT.The second case is on the basis of complaints filed by Vanashakti, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), regarding dumping of debris and encroachments across an 80-acre wetland located 500 metres (m) from Bhakti Park Monorail station along the eastern freeway in Wadala. The area is identified as wetland under the Maharashtra National Wetland Atlas, 2011 and is home to a 10-acre water body. However, encroachers built a road for the movement of trucks to the site to dump construction waste. “The state machinery seems to have woken up after almost 19 months to remove the debris and also initiate prosecution. We hope it won’t be delayed further and the culprits will be booked soon,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES IN MAHARASHTRA IN 2019Maharashtra also recorded 89 and 53 cases under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules,2000, respectively, according to the NCRB data. These are the third and the fourth-highest cases in the country, respectively. Data revealed that only two cases were filed under various forest laws.But no case was registered under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act,1974 even though Maharashtra recorded the highest number of polluted cities. The state is also home to the maximum number of polluted river stretches (54) in the country.HIGHEST CASES IN INDIATamil Nadu (13,316), followed by Rajasthan (10,782), and Kerala (5,054) recorded the maximum number of environmental cases last year, according to the NCRB data. While the least number of environmental crimes were reported from the north-eastern states, Himachal Pradesh (HP), Goa, and Odisha, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/mumbai-records-most-environmental-offences-among-major-cities-for-second-consecutive-year/story-zebQ9RypEZZ5AFdoGiFmFJ.html

The two other men--Abrar Ahmad, 26 and Mohammad Ibrar, 18--were Imtiyaz Ahmad’s cousins.The Army initially said the three were “terrorists”. It later said an inquiry has prima facie brought out evidence indicating “during the operation [in which the three were killed], powers vested under the AFSPA [Armed Forces Special Powers Act] 1990 were exceeded and the dos and don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened”. The army added consequently, the “competent disciplinary authority has directed initiation of disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable”.The Jammu & Kashmir police last week said the DNA samples of the three have matched with their family members in Rajouri. “My son, who had passed class 12th this year, wanted to pursue his studies and had gone to Shopian to work as a labourer and collect enough money to get admission to the Rajouri Degree College,” said Ahmad’s mother, Shamim Akhter, 40, over the phone from her Dhar Sakiri village in Rajouri.She added she wants justice. “Those who killed my son and nephews [Abrar Ahmed and Mohammad Ibrar] should also meet the same fate. The barbarians did not allow them to have food and picked them up from their rented room...before killing them...” Akhter said the whole truth about their killing should be made public and the perpetrators should be hanged. She added they are yet to get any compensation.Lal Hussain, an uncle of the three men, said they stand vindicated after the Army’s inquiry. “They were poor labourers, who were branded terrorists and killed for rewards and awards.” He demanded that the “source” who branded the three young men as terrorists to the Army for “rewards and awards” be exposed. “I demand that those involved in the fake encounter and the contact who branded my nephews as terrorists and passed on the information security forces be punished under the law.”Two men believed to be informers of security forces were arrested in connection with the staged gunbattle on Wednesday.Rajouri deputy commissioner Mohammad Nazir Sheikh said he has received no instructions for the compensation yet. “Nothing has come to us as of now but whatever under rules is required shall be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shopian-fake-encounter-kin-demand-justice-say-innocent-men-killed-for-awards-rewards/story-R91DYqNEDGg8VMrsH9CtyN.html

01-10-2020||Lucknow||Mathura court dismisses plea for mosque removal, petitioners to move higher court||The lawyer of the petitioner whose suit filed on behalf of child deity Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman seeking removal of the Shahi Idgah Masjid near Mathura’s Sri Krishna temple complex was dismissed by a local court has said they will now move a higher court against the dismissal.Hari Shankar Jain, the lawyer, said he had left for Delhi after arguing the case and is still to study the reasons for the dismissal of the suit. “We would move an upper court if we failed to get justice from the lower court in Mathura.”The suit was heard by Additional District Judge Chhaya Sharma, who refused to admit the suit citing the bar under the Place of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991.Also Read: Babri Masjid demolition verdict: All 32 accused acquittedThe law was passed at the height of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and seeks to protect all religious structures as they existed at the time of Independence on August 15, 1947, with the exception of the disputed site at Ayodhya.Since Ayodhya land was exempted, the Supreme Court had invoked this law in 2019 while awarding the disputed site at Ayodhya to child deity Ram Lalla while reaffirming that similar such cases cannot be entertained with respect to other sites in view of the law.The suit claiming ownership of the entire land of 13.37 acres land which is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Sri Krishna, the 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu, was filed on September 25 through the next friend of the child deity, one Ranjana Agnihotri, an advocate and a resident of Lucknow. Six other devotees were also plaintiffs to the suit.They had sought cancellation of a settlement entered into between the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan which is the governing body of the temple complex and the Committee of Management of Trust of Shahi Idgah (Idgah Trust) in 1968.Also Read: Purohit Mahasabha condemns suit in Mathura court on Krishna Janambhoomi issueThe suit stated that Lord Shri Krishna was born in a prison of King Kans and the entire area under dispute is known as ‘Katra Keshav Dev’. Katra Keshav Dev is sacred for the devotees of Lord Shri Krishna and the Hindu community. Hindu rulers have always paid homage to the birthplace of Lord Shree Krishna and from time to time they constructed/ renovated temple at the spot, the petition said.It was submitted that the Idgah Trust with the help of some Muslims encroached upon the land belonging to Shri Krishna Janmasthan Trust and the deity and erected a superstructure at the place.The birthplace of Lord Krishna lies beneath the structure raised by the trust, the suit added.It claimed that Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan, which is the governing body of the temple complex, entered into an illegal compromise with the Idgah Trust in 1968 with a view to grab the property in question.“The Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan is working against the interest of the deity and devotees and fraudulently entered into a compromise with the Committee of Management of Trust Masjid Idgah (Trust) in 1968 conceding a considerable portion of property belonging to the deity and the trust,” the suit argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mathura-court-dismisses-plea-for-mosque-removal-petitioners-to-move-higher-court/story-h74NhtF5RK2KzFOkLKK8eP.html
01-10-2020||City||Sena reluctant to share power with MVA allies in running BMC||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, a coalition of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, is ruling the state, but the allies are not on the same page about sharing power in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which runs Mumbai.The Shiv Sena does not have a majority in the civic body after snapping its ties with former ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), last year, but it is not willing to share power with the Congress and the NCP, who are still in the Oopposition.The BJP, which is the second-largest party, has announced that it would be sitting in the Opposition. The election to the chairmanship of the crucial civic committees is slated for Monday, and it is likely to see a three-cornered contest among the ruling Sena, the BJP and the Congress-NCP. Significantly, MVA leaders have been discussing the possibility of contesting the civic polls, which are slated to be held in 2022, together.However, the Shiv Sena doesn’t want to dilute its hold over one of the country’s richest civic bodies and has decided to field its candidates for all the committees. The Shiv Sena has 97 elected representatives in the 227-member BMC. Though the majority mark in the civic body is 114, the Shiv Sena has managed to cling to power because of a divided opposition.The BJP is the second-largest party and has 83 elected representatives. However, it has decided to play the role of an opposition party, along with the Congress and the NCP, who have 29 and eight elected representatives, respectively. Other smaller parties include the Samajwadi Party (SP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), who have six and two each elected representatives, respectively. Elections will be held for the chairmanship of the standing committee, which has financial powers, the improvements committee that deals with land leases and other city properties. Voting will also be held for the education committee that handles primary and secondary education in Mumbai and the BEST Committee that governs Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST). Corporators elect the members of the committee, except for BEST, and, they, in turn, elect the chairman.The representation from each party to these committees is based on the strength of its elected corporators. The members have a fixed tenure of two years, while that of the chairman is a year.Non-elected persons can also be nominated by the parties in case of BEST. At present, all these committees are dominated by the Shiv Sena. The Congress and the NCP were hoping to control at least a committee each because they are a part of the MVA coalition government.On Wednesday, Shiv Sena Corporator Yashwant Jadhav, who is also the sitting chairman of BMC’s standing committee for the last two years, filed his nomination papers for the third term. Shiv Sena Corporator from Gorai Sandhya Doshi filed her nomination papers for the post of the chairwoman of the education committee. The BJP has fielded Colaba corporator Makrand Narvekar and Kandivali corporator Surekha Patil for the post of the standing and the education committee, respectively.The Congress has fielded Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria and Cmembur corporator Sangita Handore for the standing and the education committee, respectively.The Congress has also announced that it would contest for the chairman’s post in all the committees. The party has claimed the support of the NCP and SP.Ravi Raja, a Congress corporator and the leader of opposition in the BMC said, “There is no question of not fielding our own candidates. We are in the opposition and we will field our candidates for all the committees. We have the support of the NCP and the SP. We are not seeking support from any other party.” The Shiv Sena is likely to retain control over all the committees since it enjoys a majority in all these panels. But the party’s dominance will signify that the bid to contest the 2022 civic polls as a single MVA entity is far from reality.The BJP has maintained that it would field candidates for all the committees. The party is also open to all options. Bhalchandra Shirsat, a BJP corporator and a member of BMC’s standing committee said, “We are fielding candidates for all the panels because we are the second-largest party in the civic body. We are the only opposition party in the BMC.”Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst, said, “It is unlikely that there will be any cross-voting, where a Congress member will be supported by the BJP. Though the Congress does not enjoy the majority, it’s decision to field candidates signifies that the party wants to remain politically relevant. The BJP is fielding candidates because it also has to hold on to its position as the second-largest party in the BMC.” He added: “Whether MVA allies will fight the 2022 BMC elections together will also depend on the sustainability of their coalition at the state level. If they don’t fight together, then it may also mean that the Shiv Sena does not want to share power with any other party in the BMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sena-reluctant-to-share-power-with-mva-allies-in-running-bmc/story-LYkx1dOOUu7S9WCdjPl3vN.html

01-10-2020||Lucknow||Hathras cops cremate rape victim by stealth||Uttar Pradesh Police forced the cremation of a 19-year-old Dalit woman from Hathras who died after being brutally raped by four men, the victim’s family said on Wednesday, triggering anger from locals and political rivals who accused the Yogi Adityanath government of trying to suppress the collection of additional forensic evidence and prevent the ballooning of protests.District officials contended that they had consent from the woman’s family, but the manner in which the developments took place raised questions over the conduct of the administration and law enforcement. The woman succumbed to injuries in Delhi on Tuesday and the body was moved later that night to her home town 200km away. The cremation was carried out at 2.30am amid heavy deployment of police, who stopped locals and the media from approaching the site.WATCH | Hathras victim’s kin say cops ‘forcibly’ cremated her body; protests break out“The police have forcibly taken the body and my father along with them for cremation. When my father reached Hathras, he was immediately taken (to the crematorium) by the police,” the woman’s brother was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Also Read: Hathras gang-rape: BJP stares at the return of Dalit unrest“Police paid no heed to our request to have cremation during the daytime on Wednesday. Police were bent upon cremation at night and forcibly got it conducted,” alleged a villager. Hathras district magistrate (DM) Praveen Kumar denied the charges. “The funeral was conducted with the due permission of the father. No one in the family, except a handful, have levelled such charges. Initially, family was not prepared to shift the victim to Delhi for better treatment but later agreed to it,” the DM added.Members of Dalit groups and activists alleged that the early morning cremation was done to prevent any mobilisation or protests in the village. “The whole world is watching how the government and the police together cremated our sister in the absence of her family. I have been taken into custody and put under house arrest in Saharanpur; but we will continue to fight,” said Chandrasekhar Azad, chief of the Bhim Army that had led protests outside Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday.Also Read: More outrage, protests after Hathras victim’s cremationOn Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of people gathered in the main market area of Hathras in protest before police used tear gas and force to break up the agitation. Demonstrations also took place in Delhi and Kolkata, and a social activist filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a federal investigation into the case.The victim was attacked and raped on September 14 in a field near her home in Hathras district. Details of the barbaric assault emerged last week, and the woman was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she battled for life till Tuesday.Adityanath spoke to the woman’s father and set up a three-member special investigation team (SIT), and said a fast-track court will handle the case. The chief minister also announced ₹25 lakh in compensation to the victim’s family and a job to a family member. Also Read: Nirbhaya of Hathras killed by insensitive government: Sonia GandhiIn a tweet, the chief minister’s office said the Prime Minister spoke to Adityanath over the case. “Respected Prime Minister @narendramodi Ji has spoken on the Hathras incident and said that strict action should be taken against the culprits,” the post said.The men arrested for the crime will now face charges under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code, according to Hathras superintendent of police Vikrant Vir.The family left Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi on Tuesday night amid heavy police deployment and reached the village in Hathras after arrival of the body of the woman, a family member told PTI. Though they were present in the village, family members alleged that they were not allowed to see the body before the last rites. A video shot by locals shows the woman’s mother as saying: “I wanted my daughter to come home first. At least we could have applied ‘haldi’ on her body. This was her last goodbye. She won’t come back now.”Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the hurried cremation was meant to “destroy evidence”. Taking to Twitter, the former state chief minister said cremating the rape victim under the administration’s “pressure” without the “consent” of her family was against the culture of the state. “This act of destroying evidence is condemnable,” he wrote. Also Read: AAP demands CBI probe in Hathras case, FIRs against Delhi cops over ‘assault’ on MLACongress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Adityanath must resignation since he has “no moral right” to continue. “After 15 days, he (Adityanath) has made a statement and what does he say that ‘PM called and I have constituted an SIT’. Were you waiting for the PM’s phone call, you could not do anything for 15 days, you did not provide her treatment, did not take her to a good hospital, she was brought to Delhi only day before yesterday,” the Congress general secretary said.Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev said the government acted quick and set up an SIT to probe the case in a time-bound manner. “Let me assure you that all those responsible for gruesome crime would be dealt with in a befitting manner,” he said.Former Uttar Pradesh director general of police Prakash Singh said the teenager’s rape was a tragedy but how police reacted after her death on Tuesday was “a double tragedy”.“The handling of her cremation should have been in a better way. The police are competent enough to deal with any possible law-and-order crisis in these situations. They should have taken the young woman’s family into confidence. Her family was already traumatised and should have been allowed to see the body or perform the final rites,” he said. “The police action has only compounded the problem and mistrust. It is a failure of leadership and was badly handled. Who issued the orders for the midnight cremation? Was it issued by the director-general, inspector general, or a political figure, maybe someone at the ministerial level,” said Singh, who headed Uttar Pradesh Police between 1991 and 1993.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hathras-cops-cremate-rape-victim-by-stealth/story-ogo6h0ZJgUYQojsFWv1njJ.html

01-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Visiting the poets’ park||The carefree man in blue track suit is sprawled on the grass, his eyes closed in deep sleep, and his bare feet entangled amid dry leaves and white frangipanis that have fallen from the adjacent tree.The DDA (Delhi Development Authority) run district park in Vasant Vihar, south Delhi, was renamed Bagh-e-Bahaar, the garden of spring, after its redevelopment last year. This afternoon, its beauty feels so tangible that you could almost hold it in your hand. Understood to be the only surviving of the many gardens laid in 14th century Delhi by Emperor Firoz Shah Tughlaq, it is among the city’s prettiest grassy escapes besides Lodhi Garden and Sunder Nursery.The most poetic spot is the plaza named Bagh-e-Shazar, or the Tree Garden, in front of the gate no. 2 entrance on Poorvi Marg. It has red sandstone columns inscribed with verses by Jalaluddin Rumi, Joyce Kilmer, Rabindranath Tagore, and Khalil Gibran. Each verse, written in Hindi, English and Urdu, celebrates trees.Here is Rumi’s: “May be you are searching among branches for what only appears in the roots.”These verses on stone surround a luscious tree whose trunk is so entangled in vines that it looks like a sage’s knotted hair.With the pleasant winter season setting in, the sunlight is easy on the senses and makes one nicely sleepy. That explains the languid postures of a few masked men, perched on the sloping lawn named Bagh-e-Sukhan, or the Poetry Garden.While two couples are lingering about nearby, others in the garden seem to be loners. One man is lying on a bench, reading a newspaper.Further ahead are the soaring walls of Bara Lao ka Gumbad, a Tughlaq-era monument.The most heart-touching sight lies along an unpaved lane shooting off the Tree Garden. Here stand a series of trees, and under each tree is sitting a lone man. A symmetry of solitude is mirroring into infinity.Do not forget to gaze upon the slab outside the gate. It is inscribed with the name of the park along with the depiction of a leaf, identified as of the Pilkhan tree. This careful attention to a mere leaf, too, is poetic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-visiting-the-poets-park/story-YE0fSW7MzbD1MmJ0q7J4OI.html

Talking to Hindustan Times, Kundu said, “I will start the ‘Kisan Majdoor Nyay Yudh’ from the famous Meham Chaubisi Chabutara against these anti-farmer laws that are aimed at destroying the mandi system and scrapping the minimum support price. They were thrust upon the farmers without any discussion in the Parliament.” Kundu said farmers and labourers from Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh will join him in the indefinite hunger strike.“We will continue our strike till the Union government amends these laws. People associated with art, culture, academics, sports, farm unions and others will take part in our hunger strike. I urge politicians from across parties to sit on hunger strikes against these laws,” he added. The Meham legislator further urged the government to amend these laws with the consent of farmers and state governments as it is a state subject. Hitting out at the Jannayak Janta Party, Kundu said, “I am shocked that they took out a tractor rally in Rohtak in support of these laws. I thought Dushyant Chautala will follow in the footsteps of his great grandfather Devi Lal but he has disappointed the agrarian community.” Kundu further said that the leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar have the same view on these laws as Hooda did not register any protest against these bills in the one-day assembly session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/meham-mla-kundu-to-start-hunger-strike-against-farm-laws-on-october-2/story-goU9LxB61uRvLVPjEBfiSO.html
01-10-2020||City||Haryana farmers protest as stalemate over paddy procurement continues||The stalemate over paddy procurement continued for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, prompting farmers to stage protests and block roads in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Yamunanagar districts.Though the Haryana government had announced to start procurement from September 27, procurement agencies and rice-millers had refused to cooperate in the process. This left the farmers to suffer as many had already turned up at the mandis with their produce.Waiting in vain with their unsold crop, hundreds of angry farmers, protesting under the banner of BKU (Charuni), blocked the roads by parking their tractor-trailers. Traffic on national highway 44 in Karnal and Karnal-Yamunanagar state highway remained affected for several hours on Wednesday. Dharnas were also staged outside the market committee offices of Assandh, Taraori and Nilokheri grain market, where the government’s effigy was burnt. In Ambala, protesting farmers blocked the Ambala-Hisar Highway while in Yamunanagar, protests were held outside various mandis in Chhachhrauli, Jagadhari, Radaur etc. Jagdeep Singh, a farmer, said he had come to the grain market five days ago, but his crop had not been procured so far. Charuni gives ultimatumBharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni said they have given 24 hours’ ultimatum to the government and that they will block all the roads if their produce is not procured by 1pm on Thursday.Officials of the market committees, meanwhile, claimed that they had started the procurement process. Karnal market committee secretary Sunder Kamboj claimed that 225 quintals of paddy was procured at Karnal grain market by the Hafed on Wednesday. Even in Kurukshetra, deputy commissioner Sharandeep Kaur Barar claimed that 10,190 MT paddy was procured by government agencies, of which 316 MT had already been lifted.In some grain markets, farmers accused the government agencies of not procuring their produce despite the moisture content being below 16%. Yamunanagar deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar in a statement said that Haryana CM Manohar Lal has increased the purchase limit of paddy from 25 quintals to 30 quintals and if a farmer brings 10% extra grain. that will be purchased too.

01-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government completes CZMP public consultation amid protests in Palghar, Sindhudurg||Despite a large number of protests at Palghar and Sindhudurg between Monday and Wednesday, against the draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP) maps, the state government on Wednesday evening said the public consultation process had been completed. Environmentalists said the public hearing held at Palghar on Wednesday was chaotic and mismanaged. “There was strong opposition by the locals for the online hearing. Hundreds of participants were waiting outside the venue to be allowed to share their concerns. Police teams had been brought in to control the locals. It was pointed out to authorities that the CRZ notification 2019 was published in the local language only on September 25, three days before the public hearing on the draft CZMP’s of Sindhudurg and Palghar,” said Prasad Khale, senior conservation officer, Conservation Action Trust.Mumbai-based environmental researcher Dhwani Shah said, “Palghar district is predominantly a tribal district with a majority of the population living in rural areas. During this pandemic, the state forced a majority of the senior citizens from fishing villages to step out for this hearing, which could have easily been deferred. What’s worse, state officials said they would not answer any questions and the process was just for recording submissions, making it undemocratic.”“The National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, Chennai which has been authorised by the Centre to prepare the maps was not present at the public hearing, thus putting a question mark on the legality of the public hearing. We were told that the Chennai-based agency’s key personnel have contracted Covid-19 and were unable to attend. We questioned the haste with which the government was carrying out the public hearing, which could have been easily postponed to a later date when the pandemic scare is over,” said Bhushan Bhoir, social activist.A complaint was filed by environment group Vanashakti before the Palghar collector stating the entire procedure was conducted haphazardly. “People in Palghar mostly fishermen and coastal farmers affected by this CZMP are not tech-savvy, and they should be given a physical public hearing at large public halls rather than such farcical proceedings,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.Meanwhile, a simultaneous online hearing was underway remaining suggestions for Sindhudurg on Wednesday as well. “A large number of participants were not admitted through the online proceedings during Sindhurug’s hearings and our long list of objections remains unheard as the state has completed their namesake hearing process,” said Nandan Vengurlekar, district coordinator, CZMP awareness committee, Sindhudurg.Collector prevented entryDr Manek Gursale, Palghar district collector was unable to enter the venue as the protestors sat on the road to block his official car. The collector tried to convince the protestors to let him pass as he was there to present a report to the Centre in regard to the public hearing. Finally Dr Gursale had to take an alternative route to reach the venue.WHY WAS THE HEARING UNDERTAKENDraft CZMP maps were prepared by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) under the Union environment ministry in 2019 for all coastal districts in Maharashtra based on the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. The maps were published on January 22 this year. Using distinct colour codes, these maps demarcate CRZ areas (I to IV), high tide and hazard line, fishing zones, intertidal areas, mangrove forests and buffer areas, turtle nesting sites, cyclone shelters, koliwadas and gaothans. These also identify coastal areas that can be opened up for infrastructure development. Holding public consultation, especially with local communities, calling for suggestions and objections is compulsory before finalising the maps. The public consultation process for all districts was completed by March 6 except Palghar and Sindhudurg. It was later slotted for March 21 for the two districts but owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was deferred. “Based on the Union environment ministry’s memorandum, an online public consultation was promulgated along with receiving submissions through offline means. Both would be considered. We are just following the simple process as directed by the Centre,” a senior state government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-completes-czmp-public-consultation-amid-protests-in-palghar-sindhudurg/story-8yAJbLHq7MLicUUICT69BO.html
01-10-2020||Chandigarh||Post Art 370, J&K witnesses surge in domestic tourists||Following the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A on August 5, 2019, there has been a quantum jump in the number of domestic tourists heading to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. However, there has been a corresponding steep decline in the number of foreign tourists visiting to the Union Territory of Ladakh. In response to query made by Kochi-based activist K Govindan Nampoothiry under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, ministry of tourism deputy secretary Kiriti Gaikwad revealed that around 1,61,63,330 domestic tourists and 57, 920 foreign tourists had visited J&K in 2019. Similarly, 24,98,141 domestic tourists and 5,056 foreign tourists visited the UT from January 1 to July 15. However, only 2,41,285 domestic tourists and 38,652 foreign tourists visited Ladakh in 2019. This year, till July 15, 5,019 domestic and 1,060 foreign tourists visited the region. Nampoothiry said, “The surge of domestic tourists in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 is a positive sign. It proves the Union government’s strategic move is leading the UT in the right direction and it has started reaping the benefits. The administration of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), now, should take steps to unlock breathtaking tourist destinations to the public, promote them in domestic as well as in foreign arenas and brand J&K tourism. This will definitely pave the way for economic development in J&K by attracting investments, companies and creating employment opportunities for locals.” He, however, agreed that the steep decline in the number of tourists visiting Ladakh was cause for concern. ‘Tension along LAC responsible for dip in visitors to Ladakh’“The tense situation at the LAC might be the primary reason for fall in visitors to the region, apart from Covid but the Union government should take effective steps to resolve the matter as most locals earn their bread and butter through tourism. The matter requires immediate intervention and solution,” he added. After the BJP government revoked Article 370 and 35-A on August 5 last year, the erstwhile state was bifurcated into two UTs-- Ladakh without legislature and J&K with legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-art-370-j-k-witnesses-surge-in-domestic-tourists/story-oOF5bOzXP9r4xr1Uh0JZiM.html
01-10-2020||Chandigarh||J&K panchayat body seeks complete implementation of 73rd amendment||The All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference (AJKPC)—a frontline organisation of elected panchayat members—has reiterated its demand for complete empowerment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the Union Territory by implementing the 73rd Amendment of the Indian Constitution in entirety. AJKPC president Anil Sharma, during his visits to Reasi and Udhampur districts, welcomed the government’s initiative of taking the bureaucratic set up to the doorsteps of the people through the ‘back to village’ (B2V) programmes and said Panchayat members in J&K yearned for the complete empowerment of PRIs through the 73rd Amendment of Indian Constitution in letter and spirit. “Different line departments of the government were asked to consult the elected members of the PRIs while implementing welfare schemes. It is unfortunate that these departments are not adhering to government guidelines. All such issues can be addressed suitably if PRIs are fully empowered,” Sharma said, while addressing a large gatherings of PRI members, comprising panches, sarpanches and block development council (BDC) chairpersons. He also demanded financial empowerment of the panchayats saying, “PRIs have not been able to bring a desired change on the ground due to non-availability of financial resources. We request the UT government to create Panchayat Development Fund on the pattern of MLAs’ Constituency Development Fund (CDF) to improve the living standards of people at the panchayat level.” He demanded that the government should fix ₹25 lakh per panchayat as panchayat development fund, which will help elected panchayat members to bring a positive change on ground. He also demanded immediate enhancement of monthly honorarium being paid to sarpanches and panches. “It is very difficult for sarpanches and panches to work under the existing meagre honorariums of ₹3,000 and ₹1,000 respectively. The government should immediately hike the sarpanches’ honorarium to ₹10,000 per month while panches should receive ₹5,000 per month. The monthly honorarium of BDC chairpersons should be hiked to ₹25,000 per month,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-panchayat-body-seeks-complete-implementation-of-73rd-amendment/story-E2C1bBYQW0wFwXMAMLpuJP.html
01-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government submits action plan before NGT to tackle waste at Mumbai mangroves||Two state bodies have chalked out an action plan to reduce waste that is affecting mangrove forests and coastal wetlands in Mumbai.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and state mangrove cell under the forest department have recommended that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) make special arrangements to install metal nets along all creek areas, especially along Mithi river, to ensure waste is trapped before entering the creeks.The submissions come in response to directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in July while hearing an application by environment group Vanashakti on coastal water pollution and the impact of solid waste entering the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS).NGT directed both, the MPCB and mangrove cell to submit recommendations to keep mangrove areas free from waste. The next date of hearing is October 7.Both bodies submitted a joint affidavit dated September 18 (made public by applicants on Monday) highlighting measures such as appointing a flying squad to prevent and monitor illegal waste disposal; a mechanism to impose fines on defaulters; ensuring 100% sewage network, and development of an overall comprehensive action plan from an expert institute for mangrove conservation.“The present perception of mangroves as the garbage can of the city has to change. A major threat to mangroves is the deposition of enormous quantities of solid waste in the area. Much of this waste is non-biodegradable and settles on mangrove breathing roots, choking them to death,” read the submission by divisional forest officer DR Patil (mangrove cell).MPCB’s recommendations directed state departments (revenue, forest, and BMC) to ensure encroachment removal, restrict the dumping of construction debris and carry out mangrove plantation on degraded areas to avoid any waste dumping there.MPCB estimates that untreated domestic waste accounts for 93% pollution across water bodies and mangrove forests, with 25% of the city’s total sewage entering the sea without any treatment. “We have called for two major recommendations. The first is for BMC to commence the process of mapping most vulnerable areas where trash enters creeks and install metal nets to trap this waste. The second is to constitute a mangrove conservation district committee, including a member from the planning authority, for effective implementation of all our plans,” said a senior MPCB official, requesting anonymity as the matter is sub judice.Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “We will be submitting our affidavit before the NGT soon. We are open to implementing suggestions expressed by state bodies, including installation of nets, provided we receive clearance for such activities from either the tribunal or the Union environment ministry in the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) 1 area.”Meanwhile, the mangrove cell, under the forest department, had informed the NGT during an earlier hearing, that 8,000 tonnes of garbage were removed from different mangrove forests in successive clean-up operations. The cell estimates Mumbai’s mangrove forests (6,600 hectares) have around 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste due to improper waste treatment.“We have suggested various measures as indicated under an effluent treatment plan study undertaken to address pollution at the Mahul Trombay creek by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) for the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link project,” said Patil.Of this, the cell has suggested the use of deflector screens (flat surfaces that help collect floating debris from rivers and creeks even at high flow rate) and booms (partially submerged temporary floating barrier with mesh skirts to collect debris and litter by spreading across an entire waterway). “We have also laid emphasis on sediment removal technologies through trapping silt either downstream or at certain sections of the creeks and rivers. We are in the process of implementing this for the TCFS under our management plan,” said Patil.Meanwhile, applicants in the matter said BMC had not taken any steps so far to address the issues. “In fact, they have not bothered to even reply to our petition yet. Nor have they responded to requests from other statutory bodies. It is left to the judiciary now to pass orders to stop the flow of non-degradable waste into mangrove areas,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, adding that BMC was duty-bound to implement cheap effective solutions to keep the marine ecosystems clean. According to Vanashakti, Mumbai daily dumps 80-110 metric tons (MT) of plastic waste into drains and water channels.An official from the stormwater drains department said trash booms were installed across eight locations in Mumbai (western suburbs) in 2019. “It was successful during the pre-monsoon period, with plastic waste collected regularly from the drains. However, when the load increased during monsoon, the booms could not contain the capacity. The plan was dropped,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-submits-action-plan-before-ngt-to-tackle-waste-at-mumbai-mangroves/story-wUYFyY9fp9xTO0NGyC2KCK.html

01-10-2020||Mumbai||Why people in Mumbai don’t wear masks despite Covid-19 threat? ‘Lost it; it flew away; led to allergy’||Since the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made it mandatory for Mumbaiites to wear masks in public places, the civic body has fined 14,000 people for flouting this rule. As of September 26, BMC had earned ₹52.76 lakh from non-compliance of the mask rule, and field inspectors say civilians remain negligent about wearing masks. In end-June, BMC had issued an order that made not wearing a mask in public areas a punishable offence. Each ward has 25 field inspectors drawn from the solid waste management (SWM) department and these officers encounter strange excuses from civilians who are not wearing masks. “People often say that they have lost or forgotten their masks, and therefore are heading to a medical shop to buy one. Some even say it flew off while they were riding a bike. Once, a defaulter told me that a pigeon had pooped on his mask,” said field inspector Dharmesh Salvi. Morning walkers are regularly seen with their masks around their chins instead of covering their nose and mouth. “When we catch them, they complain of breathlessness while walking with the mask. Some even claim to be asthma patients who feel suffocated while walking if they put their mask on,” said Jyoti Jadhav, from A ward’s SWM department. Dr Prashant Borade of Global Hospital, said, “We don’t have any scientific studies to prove that masks lead to asthma or other serious breathing problems. It is essential to wear masks to save oneself from Covid-19 infection.” Other excuses proffered include sensitive skin, being allergic to sweat, suffering from heat rash, and the claim that they were eating or drinking something just before being caught by the field inspector. Psychiatrists said the mask can add to some people’s anxiety levels. “Lots of people feel the mask is an imposition on their life. This is most common among Covid-19 recovered patients who had to stay in a hospital for days in isolation among medical staffers,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, a city-based psychiatrist. Masks are effective against Covid-19 because they trap droplets that could transmit the infection. “Covid-19 is a respiratory illness that spreads through respiratory droplets, which are ejected when infected people sneeze, cough or talk. Thus, wearing masks is of utmost importance to stop the spread of the virus,” said Rajneesh Bhardwaj, a professor at the department of mechanical engineering, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), who has been studying how long the virus stays active on surfaces. Between September 13 and September 26, BMC collected ₹19 lakh as fines from 9,218 people who violated the mask guideline. Since September, the fine is ₹200. Between end-June and September 26, the highest amount in fines (₹615,800 ) has been collected from K West ward (Andheri West), followed by R South ward (Dahisar; ₹6.07 lakh); and C ward (Kalbadevi; ₹560,100). Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G North ward (Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim) said economically weaker sections have shown greater compliance with the mask rule. “Slum dwellers are very careful about Covid-19. They know that as they live in clustered and enclosed setups, they have to be more careful and take extra precautions. Many NGOs [non-government organisations] also supply masks in slums like Dharavi every day,” said Dighavkar. On Tuesday, BMC announced people not wearing masks will not be allowed to avail public transport. Malls, offices and other private compounds have also been instructed to restrict entry to only those wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-people-in-mumbai-don-t-wear-masks-despite-covid-19-threat-lost-it-it-flew-away-led-to-allergy/story-McdNWd8NSDKLIbiTWXwhQN.html

Secretary, social welfare department, will be the secretary of the society, which will have 19 members, including four nominated members to be appointed by the UT administrator. The executive committee will have the UT adviser as its chairperson, while UT finance secretary will be its vice-chairperson. It will have eight members, including four from the governing council who will be nominated to the committee by the UT administrator.The administration had in February taken over the Indira Holiday Home in Sector 24 with plans to set up a high-end old age facility on payment basis.The administration’s move comes at a time when the demand for converting Indira Holiday Home into a group home for mentally ill people had been gaining ground in the city. “Indira Holiday Home is the best place possible for care home/community living of persons with mental disabilities,” said Dina Singh, a Sector-8 resident, who is associated with the welfare of mentally ill people. The decision to the setup a group home at Cheshire Home has come under criticism over inadequate space to meet city’s needs. Meanwhile, residents contend that Indira Holiday Home has adequate space for the purpose. “There is enough space for residential staff, counsellors, and social workers at Indira Holiday Home. It has a safe and secure campus. There cannot be a better combination for community living of persons with mental challenges,” Dina added.India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had inaugurated the Holiday Home Society in 1954. The holiday home in Sector 24 was set up in early 60s. Spread over 6.5 acres, the holiday home is mostly used for organising camps for children on nominal charges. The premises has hostel facility with air-conditioned rooms and dormitories to accommodate about 100 people and an AC auditorium with a capacity of 200 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/badnore-to-be-president-of-holiday-home-society-s-governing-council/story-yl8KajSrorVcTZFEKrlZ0K.html
01-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC releases stricter containment zone rules; more Covid-19 tests for Mumbai||Given the rising number of cases in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to further tighten containment rules in sealed buildings across the city and to scale testing per day to 16,000-18,000 tests. This is up from the current target of 15,000 tests daily. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal issued the new directives in a review meeting with all assistant commissioners, zonal deputy municipal commissioners, deans of municipal hospitals and officers of BMC’s public health department, on Wednesday. The move comes as Mumbai on Wednesday recorded its highest-ever number of Covid-19 cases in a single day, at 2,654 cases, taking the city’s total count to 205,268. Mumbai on Wednesday also recorded 46 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the toll to 8,929. At present, there are 26,663 active cases in the city. Chahal told Hindustan Times, “BMC will further scale testing, and has a target of conducting 16,000 to 18,000 tests a day.”All residential buildings will now have to screen domestic help and other employees who have access to the building such as drivers, sweepers, security personnel. While retaining the current rule of sealing an entire building only if there are cases on two or more floors, or if there are more than 10 cases, BMC will ensure no one exits or enters the building. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the public health department, said, “Entry and exit will be regulated in a sealed building. There are three permutations and combinations for this sealing. If a patient is quarantined in his house, no one can enter or exit his house during the duration of the quarantine, except a health worker. Same applies to the floor and building if it is sealed. For medical emergencies, BMC will provide an ambulance to take the quarantined person to a hospital. In case of groceries, they need to be delivered either to the gate of the building, or the door of the sealed home.” A senior civic official said that this directive will move the onus from the chairman of the cooperative housing society to the civic body itself. “Depending on the severity of the spread of infection in the building, BMC may decide to man the entrance too,” the official said. Assistant commissioners of all wards will now revert to old measures regarding testing, tracing, door-to-door surveys and conducting fever camps to ensure more tests are conducted per day in each ward. “All high-risk contacts and close contacts of positive patients in sealed buildings will be tested by BMC. More fever camps will be organised, and frontline health workers will be screened periodically,” said Kakani.A ward officer told HT, “We have decided to hold more fever camps, and also test all residents of a sealed building.” Another ward officer said, “At my ward, I have decided to frequently screen employees of commercial places such as municipal markets as one vendor can easily spread the infection to many shoppers. There will be no way of tracing such contacts.” Chahal also directed all hospitals to update the numbers of vacant beds every night on BMC’s portal and has stressed that action will be taken if this is not done seriously. “We will not straight away take extreme action such as shutting down a hospital. But we will issue warnings first, a show-cause notice if required at a later stage, if the hospital persists in not updating vacant beds figures every night,” Kakani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-releases-stricter-containment-zone-rules-more-tests-for-city/story-AardjfPsHtOQB779ew6l4N.html
01-10-2020||City||September accounted for 65% Covid casualties in Chandigarh tricity||September has proven to be the worst month so far for the tricity with regard to Covid-19, accounting for 77%, 64% and 59% of the total deaths in Panchkula, Chandigarh and Mohali, respectively, and 65% overall. In comparison to 41 deaths in August, Chandigarh witnessed 106 deaths in September, though new cases started declining after a major surge in mid-September. The record was set on September 13 with 449 cases while highest number of active cases (3,171) was reported on September 16. In fact, 61% (7,266) of the total cases were reported in September, while only 3,267 surfaced in August. The number of tests also went up from 16,048 to 45,452. UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said: “Now, the cases are coming down and also the number of contacts, and the situation seems to be stabilising. For patients in home isolation, we are developing a protocol so that can reach hospital in time.” Panchkula district, too, witnessed the highest number of deaths (66) in September, up from 18 in August. In fact, only two people had died till July 31. The month also witnessed 3,762 new cases, more than double the cases in August (1,669) and 63% of the total (5,992). While the cases saw a surge, the authorities also doubled the number of tests (66,603 from 33,602). The district also has the highest number of active cases per lakh population, when compared with other parts of Haryana.Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said: “In September, we were in the middle of the peak of Covid-19. In the last week, there was some respite, but still the situation is unpredictable.”On the high number of deaths, she said: “This is in proportion to the number of cases reported. Also, most of them were critical with co-morbidities, many continued self-medication, and reported to the hospitals quite late.” In Mohali, 114 people died in September, up from 63 in August. The number of fresh cases stood at 7,556 as compared to 2,831 in August, and accounted for 73% of the total tally.Around 60% (116) of the total (194) deaths reported so far were of senior citizens. As many as 85% had either hypertension or diabetes.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said: “Extensive sampling and strict home quarantine has saved Mohali from community spreading. We are facing a rise in cases because of outsiders arriving in the district. Their home quarantine is preventing further spread.”No scope for complacencyProfessor Rajesh Kumar, former head of the community medicine department, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said it appears the region, including Chandigarh, has achieved the peak of cases, but warned that complacency could take the graph of infections up again.“There is a lag of one week to two weeks between the peak of cases and deaths. So what we can gather from local data is that most cases came around mid-September, so fatalities due to that surge will continue to come for a few more days,” he said.Dr Yogesh Chawla, former PGIMER director, said infected persons in home isolation should monitor for signs and symptoms so that they can reach hospitals well in time and fatalities can be decreased.“Deaths should not take place due to delay in treatment and hospitalisation, and we need to keep a check on this when cases see a surge. For such a scenario, pulse oximeters are important for home isolated persons to monitor the oxygen saturation level and the robust system should be available for dealing with urgencies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/september-accounted-for-65-covid-casualties-in-chandigarh-tricity/story-M6Gpoxd3c4m3SETCFlMGXK.html

Till now, PhD scholars had to appear physically and submit their thesis at the varsity in the absence of any such provision. However, these recommendations are subject to approval from the PU vice-chancellor. Senator Parveen Goyal, who is a member of the PhD guidelines committee, said, “The panel has decided that a research scholar can be allowed to authorise anyone to submit PhD thesis on his/her behalf after taking permission from DUI.”“It has been observed that the permission for authorisation should be sought from DUI through a proper channel. The decision has been taken for the benefit of research scholars and their guides. It will also help in the timely submission of thesis,” Goyal added. In a major relief earlier this year, the varsity had allowed its research scholars to take PhD viva via videotelephony or videoconference after PU syndicate’s nod.The committee in its meeting on Wednesday also decided that for the pre-PhD course examination, the departments will take decisions on their own level, but exams would not be held physically. In specific categories of research positions such as INSPIRE faculty and Ramalingaswami fellow, the committee has decided that if the supervisor of the research scholar is not a full-time regular teacher of the university’s departments, centres, or affiliated colleges, then a regular teacher of the university should also be associated with the research scholar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-scholars-may-get-exempted-from-in-person-submission-of-phd-thesis/story-EwflDFM9ddbQvyfxsvcTqO.html

However, the state cabinet has decided to extend other social and economic benefits through ongoing schemes meant for the community.After a three-judge bench of the Apex court stayed the reservation to Marathas in jobs and education for 2020-21 on September 9, the state government last week decided to extend the EWS reservation to the community. The organisations representing Marathas turned down the proposal to accommodate them in the 10% reservation meant for the economically weaker section from the open category. Marathas were granted reservations of 12% and 13% in employment and admissions, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.“The community is divided over the decision [to include it under EWS quota], as a section feels that it will weaken the legal battle. In response to the concerns raised, we have kept our decision pending till further court order. Other schemes meant for the community will continue to be in operation. We have also directed the authorities to expedite the process of issuing certificates to community members under SEBC Act,” said Ashok Chavan, public works department minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee dealing with the reservation. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP and Maratha leader Sambhaji Raje met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday regarding the issue and said saying that Marathas had decided not to go for EWS quota as it may go against the legal battle in the apex court.The state government has now decided to issue a notification allowing Marathas to continue to take benefits of scholarships, funding for the entrepreneur projects, training for the civil services, funding for the hostel facilities for the students from the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-stays-plan-to-include-maratha-community-under-ews-reservation/story-qtuyjZtfR0ecwc7sBSvZ8N.html
01-10-2020||Chandigarh||PU asks final semester students to vacate hostels within 3 days after exams||The final semester students of Panjab University have been asked to vacate their hostel accommodations within three days after their exams end. A notice in this regard has been issued to all wardens, who were asked to inform the hostel residents. This comes after the varsity had last week asked the wardens to encourage parents of the hostellers to call their wards back home till the situation becomes ‘normal’. Referring to Rule 14 of the handbook of university’s hostel rules, the notice issued to the hostel wardens reads, “The hostels (including messes, canteens and common rooms) shall remain closed during the summer vacation for a period as specified by the DSW. The residents will vacate the hostel rooms within three days of their last paper.”It also states that in case the room is not vacated, it will be locked by the hostel authorities till the possession of the room is handed over and a minimum fine of ₹1,000 will be imposed in addition to the payment of daily charges for stay without permission from the warden.However, students have expressed their resentment against the move. A student residing at PU boys’ hostel number 3, who sought to remain anonymous, said, “My last paper was on Wednesday and now, I am unable to book a train ticket so that I can return to my home. I had requested the hostel warden to allow me to stay here for a few days but he refused.”Residents of boys’ hostels have, meanwhile, started vacating their rooms. “My final semester exams have ended, but I have to take a competitive test in the coming days in Chandigarh. I cannot leave the city before that, so I will get accommodation outside the campus,” said one such student of boys’ hostel number 5.PU’s Dean Students Welfare (DSW) SK Tomar said, “The decision has been taken according to the rules of the university.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-asks-final-semester-students-to-vacate-hostels-within-3-days-after-exams/story-4Y4wQvcRJxsAC17zN9KRHM.html
01-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet decides to withdraw cases against green activists for Aarey protests||The cases registered against green activists who protested felling of trees in Mumbai’s Aarey Colony will be withdrawn, state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray said on Wednesday. Several cases were registered after clashes broke out between the police and the activists who opposed the hacking of trees by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRC) in Aarey Colony in October last year for the construction of a car shed for Metro-3. The decision to withdraw the cases was taken in a cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.“I raised the issue of cases on those who protested against the tree hacking in Aarey last year, in cabinet meeting today. I was backed by Ministers Jitendra Awhad and Aslam Shaikh. The cabinet has decided to withdraw these cases. These were citizens/ protestors standing for the future of our planet. To hold them from stopping desired work was one thing but to press police charges was another. We can’t have cases against those who stand up for environment and forests,” Aaditya Thackeray wrote in a series of tweets on Wednesday.On October 4 last year, several hundred trees were being felled by MMRC as part of Metro project. A group of students and activists had gathered at the site to oppose the tree felling, which led to a clash. The police then booked 38 people and charged 29 of them. The activists were arrested for obstructing public servants from discharging duty and for unlawful assembly.Following the arrests, the protesters have faced several issues such as finding a job, continuing their home rental agreements or applying for a passport. Rohit Joshi, a part of Aarey Conservation Group (ACG), said, “Around 10 days ago, a delegation of ACG, including me, along with the protesters who were charged met state cabinet minister Jitendra Awhad to propose the withdrawal of cases. We discussed how they were facing issues in their everyday life. We thank the state and especially Awhad ji for today’s decision by the cabinet.”Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had assured the protestors in December last year that the cases would be withdrawn. However, the process had not started until now. Officials from the state government have now said that the process of the withdrawal of cases will be expedited.Sitaram Kunte, additional chief secretary, home, said, “The process of the withdrawal of the cases against the protesters will be expedited. We are gathering the information about the cases registered against the protesters last year. The legal process will be followed before the withdrawal of the cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-decides-to-withdraw-cases-against-green-activists-for-aarey-protests/story-ezGhwACmdq2U9dtvTNXrpI.html

This year monsoon onset was officially declared on June 14, three days beyond its normal onset date. However, southwest monsoon from June to September came to an end with almost 1,500mm more rain than the average rainfall during the four months.Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 3,687mm rain against the seasonal average of 2,260 mm between June 1 and September 30, which means an excess of 1,481mm or 67% rain. Similarly Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 3,202.5mm during the same period, against the average of 2,066mm. South Mumbai received 1,181.5mm or 58% excess rain for the season, which is the highest since 1984. “Total seasonal rainfall for Colaba and Santacruz from June to September has been exceedingly well with departures of more than 1,000mm. Day-wise rainfall progress from June to September indicated that the rain pattern in the city and suburbs almost remained identical till August and it slowed down from September, apart from a major rain spell during the third week,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.Over the four months, the season saw four extremely heavy rain events — one in July, two in August, and one in September, 11 very heavy rain events between July to September, and nine heavy rain days, calculated over 24 hours for Colaba and Santacruz.

Independent meteorologists said that from this weekend, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) could once again witness post-noon thunderstorms. “This is likely to continue until the middle of next week. Monsoon’s withdrawal from the region appears unlikely before October 10. The most probable window as per the current forecast seems to be between October 15 and 20,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, the United Kingdom.Overall, Maharashtra witnessed 16% excess rain with 1,165mm recorded over four months against the average of 1,004.2mm. Central Maharashtra and Marathwada recorded 29% and 30% excess rain. Only three districts in Vidarbha — Akola, Amravati, and Yavatmal — recorded 27%, 20%, and 24% deficient rain in Maharashtra this season. Sindhudurg recorded maximum rainfall over four months at 4,485.4mm which is 53% more than the average. “Maharashtra witnessed satisfactory seasonal rainfall in 2020 with Marathwada witnessing excess rains. The overall distribution of rains remained good throughout, leading to a good monsoon season for farmers in the state,” said Hosalikar.MONSOON 2020 ACROSS INDIAIndia witnessed ‘above normal’ rainfall at 109% of the long period average (LPA) this year. India defines average or near-normal rainfall as rainfall between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 89cm for four months. Pan-India, 957.6mm rain was recorded against the normal of 880.6mm; this makes this the second best monsoon since 1994, the best being 2019 which ended with 110% of LPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-ends-70mm-short-of-all-time-high-in-mumbai-67-excess-rain-over-four-months/story-avVRq7W2JjLacT0Hts76NP.html
01-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra begins Aadhaar enrolment, updation exercise for 64 lakh students||Schools across Maharashtra have been asked to ensure that all students registered under them get their Aadhaar cards in the coming days. Around 64 lakh students across the state are yet to have their Aadhaar cards or have not updated their details. In a circular issued on Wednesday, the department asked schools to ensure that all students who are yet to get their Aadhaar cards or are yet to undergo biometric verification for the same should do it. “In accordance with the unlock-4 guidelines issued by the state government, facilitation centres are being set up for making Aadhaar cards for such students at the local level. Schools should ensure that all remaining students are covered under the exercise,” stated the circular. Schools have been asked to ensure that there is no overcrowding at the facilitation centres and that all the Covid-19-related protocols are followed. Teachers, however, said that initiating this exercise at a point when Covid-19 cases are still high across the state is risky. “Records of nearly 64 lakh students have to be updated as per the process. This would pose a big risk for schools as they would have a lot of difficulty in working on such a big scale during the ongoing pandemic. We are requesting the government to push the deadline further and withdraw the current circular,” said Anil Bornare, coordinator of the BJP teachers’ cell which has written to the department in this regard. Aadhaar card data of students is required to avail government subsidies, scholarships and other schemes from time to time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-begins-aadhaar-enrolment-updation-exercise-for-64-lakh-students/story-gu3reTlhlimTqZIiEUvsdN.html
01-10-2020||City||Ulhasnagar man held for assaulting wine shop owner, managers with hammer, scissors||Titwala police on Wednesday arrested a 32-year-old mechanic for stabbing a wine shop owner and two shop employees with a hammer and scissors. The fight took place over payment of ₹500. Police identified the accused Govind Prem Prakash Verma, a resident of Ulhasnagar, with the help of CCTV footage. “He was arrested on Wednesday and will be produced in court on Thursday. The accused alleged he committed the crime under the influence of alcohol,” said Vijay Surve, sub-inspector, Titwala police station. The incident took place at 8.13pm on Monday at Roz Wines shop at Maharal in Titwala. The complainant Laxmi Ahuja, 42, the manager at the wine shop claimed the accused came to the shop and said that he had paid ₹500 to purchase alcohol. “Ahuja denied this, saying that they had never seen the accused before. He asked Verma to wait till they checked the CCTV footage to clear the confusion. Instead of waiting, Verma left the shop and returned 15 minutes later with a hammer and scissors. He entered the shop and started assaulting Ahuja, another manager and the shop owner Dharmapal Vanjani,” a police officer said. Vanjani, Ahuja and the other shop manager were injured in the incident and are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Titwala. Titwala police registered a case of assault and attempt to murder against Verma after verifying the entire incident on the CCTV footage of the shop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ulhasnagar-man-held-for-assaulting-wine-shop-owner-managers-with-hammer-scissors/story-kSks9dXXj1PdcQG1hdYVSO.html
01-10-2020||City||Dhakoli’s sub-post office building cries for attention||The sub-post office in Dhakoli is housed in a dilapidated building, which demands urgent attention and maintenance as it tends to pose threat to the safety of at least 10 employees working there and hundreds of daily visitors. Their safety assumed more prominence after the last week’s building collapse in Meera Milli Mohalla of Dera Bassi, where four lives were lost. In the wake of the mishap, the authorities have decided to conduct a survey of all ‘unsafe’ buildings in the Dera Bassi subdivision, wherein the structures older than 50 years would be inspected and demolished if found unsafe, following due procedure. “The building in which the sub-post office is situated was declared unsafe by the postal department in 2018, but no alternative was found,” said an employee of the post office, who requested anonymity. The sub-post office is being operated from a single-room rented accommodation in the building that also had an anganwadi. However, considering the risk it posed, around 45 children were accommodated in the room in Dhakoli primary school. But the building is still being used for cooking and storage purposes for the anganwadi children. Post office’s employees claimed that many a time, they have to stand and work as most of the space is occupied by parcels and other paraphernalia. “The walls of the building have developed deep cracks and the lack of maintenance makes it worse. It can come crashing down any day. Requests have been forwarded to shift the post office out of this building, but no decision has been made so far in this regard,” added another employee. The residents, too, at several instances have demanded shifting of the post office to a better place and even suggested the local community centre as an option. The sub-post office on an average sees a footfall of more than 100 as it caters to Dhakoli, Peermuchalla, Ghazipur, Nagla and Sanuali areas. SDM’s take“I will get the post office as well as the anganwadi inspected and if the building is unfit for use, we will definitely shift them out. Safety of people is our priority. I will take up the matter with officials concerned soon,” said Kuldeep Bawa, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Dera Bassi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dhakoli-s-sub-post-office-building-cries-for-attention/story-WhX1MAQDu1xeIdLSH7i9BI.html
01-10-2020||Mumbai||Online teaching platform designed by IIT-Bombay now available to all school, college teachers||An online teaching platform developed by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay is now available to teachers of all schools and colleges in the country. BodhiTree is a multimedia platform designed by the computer science engineering department of IIT-Bombay that can mimic classroom teaching. While most tools such as massive open online courses (MOOC) are designed to help students, BodhiTree is built with the aim of aiding teachers in their instructions. Under the current circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, most educational institutes including IITs have switched to online mode of instruction. To help teachers adapt to the challenge and integrate technology in their teachings, IIT-Bombay has made it available to all. “BodhiTree is open sourced and free to use. It is also very easy to install. Individual colleges or schools can install and host an independent instance of BodhiTree either on their premises or on the cloud, with full control over the students’/ teachers’ data and content,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-Bombay. The platform hosts interactive multimedia books including lab manuals. These books — called BodhiBooks — are curated by the faculty of IIT-Bombay and can be in the form of interactive videos, auto-graded practice sheets and auto or manual graded lab exercises. By adopting this platform, teachers can manage multiple tasks such as creating their own content, enrol students, impose schedules, monitor students’ progress, take tests and share marks with students, and check for plagiarism. “Teachers can use the BodhiBooks in conjunction with the rich set of learning management system (LMS) features. The platform has a particularly good support system for engineering colleges with virtual labs and software labs,” Chaudhuri added. Currently the platform is being used by science and technology colleges including Walchand Institute of Technology, Solapur, and National Institute of Technology, Goa. “We hope this IIT-Bombay innovation helps the nation in getting through the current hardship,” he said. Instructors can sign up for a free demo for adopting the platform in their school, college or individually. While individual accounts for instructors are free of cost, the institute charges a nominal price for schools and institutes depending on the courses they choose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/online-teaching-platform-designed-by-iit-bombay-now-available-to-all-school-college-teachers/story-sq0ijyYQG5uVQPk0CWtBGL.html

01-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC plans special study of Covid-19 trends in Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will soon begin a study on trends in Covid infection among Mumbaiites, which will be made available for global research and as a benchmark for public health care in case of such a crisis. From the plush housing societies of south Mumbai to congested pockets in India’s largest slum Dharavi and densely populated Govandi-Mankhurd, Mumbai’s Covid medical staff handles and treats patients across the socio-economic spectrum. A total of 78 hospitals, including jumbo Covid centres, dedicated Covid health centres, Covid care centres and beds reserved in peripheral civic hospitals, are handling the patients. BMC’s plan involves documenting every aspect of Covid-19 in the city such as effect of medicines on patients depending on their age and extent of infection; chances of recovery based on their socio-economic background; and nutrition during the treatment. A team of researchers and professors from all civic hospitals and medical colleges will be formed to create a research bank. Dr Satish Dharap, acting dean of BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, said, “We will study what kind of treatment is impacting which type of Covid patient and how it is helping in their recovery. Various departments such as medicine, pulmonology, microbiology, intensive care specialty and psychiatry will be involved in this study.” The observations will be concluded by researchers, based on which a report will be prepared. This study is likely to start from this week and will only be carried out in BMC-run hospitals and Covid centres. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “This plan is at an initial stage. While every aspect of Covid-19 will be documented, the team of researchers has been asked to come up with various questions for the research and study them accordingly. We are one of the few cities that handle a minimum of 1,000 Covid patients a day and this is a handful of an experience for our staff. We want this experience to be put to good use and share our research with the world.” BMC is yet to decide on the number of patients to be monitored for the research. Last week, professors and doctors of major civic hospitals held a meeting, chaired by Kakani, to discuss the outline of the study. Kakani said, “In case of Remdesivir, the study should focus on the stage at which the medicine was administered, the vital parameters at that time and the changes –recovery or deterioration of health. This will be an ongoing process.” The researchers will also compare the recovery time of patients from buildings to that of slums. Efficacy of medicines like anti-viral drugs and plasma therapy will be part of this study. According to senior civic officials, of the total 192,427 Covid-19 cases, more than 70% have been treated in BMC-run hospitals and centres. So far, 155,638 Covid patients have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-special-study-of-covid-19-trends-in-mumbai/story-ciq2Tbq9gZ7M9dBGDSYGzN.html

The data reveals that Mumbai leads the list of crime under section criminal breach of trust and cheating with 902 cases followed by Lucknow with 762 cases and Delhi with 315 cases. Officers with the economic offences wing (EOW) in Mumbai Police said that since the city is the financial capital of India, there are a maximum number of cases related to economic offences.

01-10-2020||Mumbai||Restaurants and bars can open in Maharashtra from October 5||Nearly 400,000 restaurants, bars, eateries across Maharashtra have been allowed to reopen from October 5, along with resumption of train services that operate within state limits and more suburban trains for essential services workers, both from today. These were some of the major points of the state’s government’s latest notification that extended the ongoing coronavirus-enforced lockdown by another month till October 31, while opening up a number of activities under its Mission Begin Again — a staggered plan to unlock activities.According to the notification, all industries and manufacturing units operating in non-essential services in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), too, have been allowed to begin operations. In accordance with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s assurance to the representatives of hotel industries on Monday, the notification issued on Wednesday has allowed hotels, bars, restaurants, food courts, shut for more than six months, to operate at 50% of their capacity. The standard operation procedures (SOP) for these outlets are expected to be issued by the tourism department in the next two days. Similarly, the state government has allowed operations of trains originating and ending within state limits with immediate effect. Inter-city services between Mumbai and Pune and trains plying between Mumbai, Nagpur, Kolhapur and Sawantwadi will resume services once Railways completes its preparations. With local trains in MMR already running for essential services workers, the state government has now directed Railways to increase the number of services to avoid crowding. Currently, commuters from emergency and essential services, including security forces, banking, central and state government, have been allowed to travel on local trains via QR codes. Now, dabbawalas in Mumbai, too, have been allowed to board these trains. Local services in Pune district, too, have been allowed to start operations, along the lines of the services operating in MMR. The notification, issued by acting chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, has stated that activities, which have been prohibited in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, will be opened up in a phased manner. “Schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutions, cinema halls, swimming pools, theatres, auditoriums, entertainment parks, Metro rail, international airlines, other than those allowed by the Central government, will continue to be prohibited till October 31. Similarly, political, social, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious functions and large congregations remain prohibited,” the order has stated.Kunte said, “The activities to be opened up immediately while extending the lockdown have been mentioned in today’s notification. The remaining activities to be allowed under Mission Begin Again will be considered in due course and may take a few more weeks.”Shivanand Shetty, President, Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR), said that this will pave the way for the opening of at least 40-50 % outlets in the next few days. “We are opening after six months and it will take some time for hoteliers to prepare themselves to start their businesses with the various restrictions,” said Shetty. Mirah Hospitality, which runs 10 hotels under the brand name Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute in Mumbai, said they will open their outlets in phases. “We will take time to check the various services, which have been closed from the last six months, and this will take time. We plan to open majority of our outlets by October 15,” said Aji Nair, CEO - F&B Division, Mirah Hospitality. He said that they have staff of 800 in these 10 outlets, of which 600 were migrant labours who have left for their villages. “Our challenge is to bring them back to Mumbai. In some places we will arrange buses, while in some we will also offer air tickets to bring them back,” said Nair. Maharashtra has more than 400,00 outlets in the sector with about 2.2 million people employed in various roles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/restaurants-and-bars-can-open-in-maharashtra-from-october-5/story-HT3RG0letuP4UMHcCotEeN.html

Meanwhile, University of Mumbai (MU) decided to opt for decentralised exams by giving each college the choice to conduct exams as per their schedule, as long as they follow the exams are held online and in MCQ format. “Since colleges are conducting the exams in clusters, no exam will be deferred for MU affiliated colleges. Students need not worry,” said a spokesperson for MU. Most MU colleges will start online exams from October 5, this year.Due to Covid-19 cases and the eventual nation-wide lockdown implemented since March this year, final year university exams had to be postponed time and again. After receiving several petitions from different states seeking permission to cancel final year exams and instead promote students based on their performance in previous semesters, the Supreme Court in August 2020 clarified that exams will compulsorily have to be taken and only then can students be promoted.After much discussion, the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant in September announced that all final year exams for state university students will be conducted online, and in multiple-choice question (MCQ) format. While online exams for backlogs/allowed to keep term (ATKT) students were to take place in the last week of September, online exams for final year students were supposed to take place between October 1 and 31 and results for the same have to be announced by the first week of November, the state has clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-maharashtra-universities-defer-final-year-exams-after-employees-strike-for-better-wages/story-uhHqJAc1dVdwUBsYFl3LvN.html

As the flames erupted on the ground floor, the workers were stranded on the first floor of the building till the firefighters rescued them with the help of a ladder. While no one was hurt, stock of the factory, Bilal Enterprises, kept on the ground and first floors was gutted in the incident. It took the firefighters nearly 90 minutes to douse the flames. Short-circuit in the electricity supply line is suspected to have caused the fire. Sub fire-officer Atish Rai said, “The workers were on the first floor of the building when the fire broke out on the ground floor, blocking their only way out. Firefighters rescued them and the flames were doused by 6.15pm using three fire tenders, after receiving information around 4.45pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/workers-rescued-from-fire-at-sundar-nagar-factory/story-inbIaO4JJVmz5z4u7sQnxL.html

As the area was not developed by 2017, she demanded the possession or refund, but was denied both. Amanpreet Singh of Sector 38, Chandigarh, had a similar plight after paying ₹8.8 lakh for the same size of plot in July 2011.In both cases, Navjeet Singh, president, Sky Rock City Welfare Society, failed to appear before the commission, as he is presently lodged in the Patiala Central Jail in a multicrore housing scam.While passing the orders, commission president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma said since the society president has chosen not to come forward to contest the claims, “we have no alternative except to believe the contents of the complaints”.In both cases, the commission directed the society president to refund the paid amount along with 12% interest from the dates of various deposits till realisation. Also, a fine of ₹50,000 was imposed in each case.In 2013, Sky Rock City Welfare Society was found to have violated key provisions of the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995, putting at risk nearly ₹200 crore of its 400 members. It had collected ₹10 lakh-₹85 lakh from each of its members despite having no developer’s licence, a mandatory requirement for carrying out such a step. As a punishment, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority had cancelled the licence of the society’s promoter, which meant cancellation of its registration with the authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-developer-told-to-refund-15l-pay-1l-fine-for-failing-to-give-possession-of-plots/story-ajbbyknnpbJA5NcQZirk2N.html

01-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government stays its order on farm laws||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, stayed the implementation of recently-enacted farm laws in Maharashtra, on Wednesday. A Cabinet sub-committee has been appointed to deliberate on the legislations which many have described as anti-farmer and against which Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) stand staunchly opposed. On Wednesday, the Cabinet discussed the issue of the farm laws, which were passed in Parliament on September 17, and decided to take farmer organisations and other stakeholders into confidence. A sub-committee will look into concerns and questions raised by various groups. Minority affairs minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik said the committee will also look at the labour laws passed by the Centre. “The sub-committee will look into all the contentious issues, including the minimum support price (MSP), the fate of agricultural produce market committes (APMCs), possible hoarding of farm produce; and study the options with the state government. I think the state government under article 254 (2) of the Constitution has the right to have its own regulations while implementing the laws. The CM has assured us of a decision in the interest of farmers after studying all aspects related to the issue,” said public works department minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan. An NCP minister said, “Law and judiciary department also apprised the Cabinet about the powers with the state to enact separate laws to negate the [farm] laws and ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce and APMCs do not lose their existence due to these laws. The state government has decided to utilise every possible option to ensure farmers’ rights are safeguarded.” Earlier in the day, a high voltage drama unfolded within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance after Congress pressed for a withdrawal of the notification issued by the cooperation and marketing department led by Nationalist Congress Party. The notification, issued on August 10 by director of marketing Satish Soni, directed local authorities governing APMCs to implement the contentious farm ordinances, that were recently enacted as the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020. “As per the provisions in the ordinances, the farmers are free to market their produce at field, factory, warehouse or cold storage without any hindrance and without any market fee applicable under APMC Act. Any other fee or charges applicable under APMC Act cannot be charged now as per the provisions made in the ordinances. The law and judiciary department has vetted the ordinances and validated its applicability. Though the existence of the APMCs has not been affected by promulgation of the ordinance, the farmers will have a parallel mechanism to get fair prices for their produce. The market committees are expected to implement the provisions in the ordinances effectively,” the circular stated. Congress and NCP have staunchly opposed the farm laws and their implementation in Maharashtra. However, the circular stirred up a controversy as Shiv Sena had not taken a stand on the issue. Demanding a withdrawal of the circular, Congress threatened to boycott the Cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The state cooperation and marketing minister Balasaheb Patil conducted a hearing on September 30 (today) and passed an order of interim stay on the implementation of the notification. Patil had directed the marketing department to withdraw the circular with immediate effect, but no action was taken. Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had also written a letter on September 27, to the cooperation and marketing department, for the withdrawal of the circular. Thorat has said all ruling parties in the state are against the newly-enacted farm laws and the decision to not implement them would be taken collectively after due deliberation. Last week, deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar had also said the farm laws would not be implemented in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-government-stays-its-order-on-farm-laws-in-maharashtra/story-xiYn6BifjdFSqVG9qobrrN.html

01-10-2020||Chandigarh||Remove all encroachments in Mohali in six months: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Mohali municipal corporation and Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to remove all encroachments from public spaces along roads and in commercial and residential areas within six months. The authorities have also been directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings within three months against the officers in whose tenure the encroachment and unauthorised constructions have taken place.“The public paths, footpaths, open spaces, parks, corridors, streets, roads cannot be permitted to be encroached upon. It is the duty cast upon the statutory authorities to ensure that no unauthorised construction takes place in public places... (It) causes immense hardship to the public at large,” the bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice Harinder Singh Sidhu observed. The court was hearing a plea from Area Social Welfare Association, Phase 11, a registered body of residents. It was alleged in the petition that a large number of street vendors and daily fruit and vegetable vendors have encroached upon open spaces in front of houses of high income group in Phase 11. “They have also set up temporary kiosks on the footpath without getting the licence from the competent authority,” it was submitted, seeking direction to local authorities to remove the vendors.In fact, in August 2018, the MC had conducted a survey and identified 4,200 encroachers in residential areas of Mohali, but have not issued any notice to date. The situation has gone bad to worse, especially in 3B1, 3B2, 7, 9, 10, and 11, where vendors are fearlessly operating in parking lots and on the main road.‘State is custodian of public property’The HC bench, taking serious note of the plea, enlarged the scope and issued directions for whole of the Mohali city, observing that the state is the custodian of public property and in the present case, the statutory authorities are remiss in discharge of their statutory duties.While disposing of the plea, the HC has now directed the MC and GMADA to remove all illegal and unauthorised encroachments from public paths, footpaths, open spaces, parks, corridors, street, road and pavement within the municipal limits within a period of six months. However, it has been made clear that the principle of natural justice be followed, which means that encroachers be served notices before eviction. The MC commissioner and GMADA chief administrator have been told that they would be personally responsible to implement and execute the HC order while the senior superintendent of police has been directed to render all assistance to the statutory authorities in the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/remove-all-encroachments-in-mohali-in-six-months-hc/story-eJl9z79UchOgeG1gnCXqkL.html
01-10-2020||City||Ludhiana’s historical Jagraon Bridge gets new lease of life||The historic Jagraon Bridge – a major traffic lifeline of the city – got a new lease of life on Wednesday, as one of the oldest bridge in the region was, at last, thrown open to city residents after a prolonged wait of four years. The bowstring-girder bridge, which has become the cynosure of all eyes, connects the old city with the new areas, and has been built by the Railways by replacing an over 132-year-old structure constructed by the British in 1888.One side of the bridge, the original structure, was found to be severely corroded in 2016, following which it was closed for repairs, resulting in traffic congestion with a cascading effect on vehicle movement on the Railway Station road, Lakkar Bridge, Vishwakarma Chowk and nearby areas.For four years, it remained a struggle for commuters, who had to either take detours or face a harrowing time while entering or exiting the city from this side.Peeved with the repair moving at a snail’s pace all these years, residents and NGOs had observed ‘four death anniversaries’ of the bridge as symbolic protests. This had prompted member of Parliament (MP) Ravneet Singh Bittu, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, mayor Balkar Sandhu and Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma to meet Union railway minister Piyush Goyal over the delay in March 2020.Social activist Gurpal Grewal said, “It took four years to complete the project, that too, after frequent protests by NGOs and residents to wake up the authorities from their deep slumber.”PUNJAB’S LONGEST BOWSTRING BRIDGE: A MARVEL OF MODERN ENGINEERINGAt 63.5 metres, the bowstring-girder bridge is now the longest in Punjab, snatching the tag from a similar bridge in Shahkot that is around 50 metres long.At 9 metres high, the bridge weighs around 530 tonnes and has been erected by tightening around 34,000 nut-bolts.“Its width has also been increased from 7.5 metres to 10.5 metres, which will allow traffic to move in three lanes,” said Gurdeep Singh, senior section engineer, constructions, Railways.The Rs 24-crore project was carried out by a Delhi-based company, while the bowstring girder was prepared at a Ghaziabad workshop.MC officials said they were working to beautify the structure by installing colourful lights at the bridge under the Smart City Mission, as the bridge had become a landmark for the city.STRING OF MISSED DEADLINESConceived in 2016, the project to repair this damaged portion of the bridge stayed in limbo for two years as the railways refused to pool in money for it.It was only after the municipal corporation (MC) handed over Rs 24.3 crore to the railways that construction finally began in 2018, with a deadline of June 30, 2019.However, the railways could not proceed with the work, attributing the delay to MC’s failure in removing encroachments along the bridge by June 2018. There were around 100 encroachments in the form of houses, which were razed by MC amid resistance by the occupants, who have since been shifted to flats constructed under a government scheme in Mundiyan Kalan.In December 2019, MC took over the project and announced it will be completed by March 2020.However, roadblocks caused by the Covid-19 lockdown pushed the completion to June. The fourth deadline was revised to August 15 and then again extended to September 15, citing change in foundation design as the reason behind the delay.Finally, mayor Balkar Sandhu recently announced that the bridge will be opened by September 30 or October 2. “The bridge was opened to vehicles on Wednesday and will have a minimum life of 100 years, if maintained properly,” said Dayaram, executive engineer, Railways Construction Organisation.PROJECT MARRED BY ‘EMBEZZLEMENT’The project was also embroiled in controversy with the mayor catching an alleged embezzlement of around Rs 44 lakh in the estimates that were prepared for constructing the retaining wall of the bridge. Show-cause notices were issued to four officials, including two superintending engineers, one sub-divisional officer and a junior engineer. According to the mayor, the report was sent to the local bodies department for conducting further inquiry. The department had since delegated the task to a third party to conduct the technical and financial audit of the project.CONGRESS TAKES CREDIT BY INSTALLING HOARDINGSWhile no inaugural ceremony was organised at the site, the Congress leadership took credit of the project by installing multiple hoardings along the bridge and Ferozepur Road.Through these hoardings, the Congress leaders, including mayor Balkar Sandhu, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, among others, thanked the residents for being patient and congratulated them on completion of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-historical-jagraon-bridge-gets-new-lease-of-life/story-Ox3fvlAIFd7N1KTgPLmMaN.html
01-10-2020||City||Dedicated RT PCR testing camps to be set up near containment zones in the evening||Gurugram: To expand testing in areas near containment zones, the health department will set up evening RT PCR camps in seven urban primary health care blocks in the district over the next 10 days. The selected areas include Laxman Vihar, Rajiv Nagar, Patel Nagar, Khandsa, Sukhrali and Nathupur. The camps will be held at 10 locations over the next 10 days, which have been strategically selected as they see large footfalls, officials explained. The 10 locations are the Gurudwara Sabzi Mandi in Sadar Bazaar (Patel Nagar), the Gurugram bus stand (Rajiv Nagar), Galleria Market (Chanderlok), Sahara Mall (Chanderlok), Gurugram railway station (Laxman Vihar), Kahndsa Sabji Mandi, the health department’s malaria office in Jacobpura, Sheetla Mata Mandir in Rajiv Nagar, Sector 14 market in Sukhrali and Ambience Mall in Nathupur. This is the first time in the course of the outbreak that dedicated camps are being set up solely for RT PCR tests, which until now were being administered only in PHCs and at antigen testing camps (for symptomatic patients). “With most people getting back to work during the day, we have decided to set up these camps in the evening between five to eight. These areas are important public places, where people either meet or find themselves in transit. So that is their strategic importance,” said Dr MP Singh, nodal officer for containment zone and testing camp management in Gurugram. Singh said while these locations are not present inside ‘sealed areas’, they are near containment zones. “So if there is any spread happening outside the containment area, people who feel they have symptoms should have access to testing,” Singh added. Health department officials said only those requiring tests for medical reasons will be tested. “Our field staff will use their discretion and divert anyone seeking tests for non-medical reasons to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10, where they can pay for either an RT PCR or an antigen test,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram. Depending on public response, a revised schedule of RT PCR camps to be held between October 10 and October 20 would be drawn up, Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dedicated-rt-pcr-testing-camps-to-be-set-up-near-containment-zones-in-the-evening/story-H3dN570RQVSXGwNANIip2H.html
01-10-2020||City||Gurugram: Covid-19 spread slows down in densely populated localities||Gurugram: The district health department has observed a slowdown in the spread of Covid-19 among densely populated localities that were, until a month ago, hotspots for the disease. These areas come under four different primary healthcare blocks, namely Patel Nagar, Badshahpur, Wazirabad and Chanderlok. Of them, Patel Nagar has been denotified as a containment zone after no new positive cases were reported from the area in two weeks. Health officials attributed this improvement to “active” surveillance in containment zones, as opposed to “passive” surveillance deployed in other parts of the district. According to Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav, passive surveillance includes testing people based on symptoms and contact history at designated surveillance sites, such as primary health centres (PHCs) and private labs, while active surveillance in containment zones involves aggressively testing as many people as possible, irrespective of the presence of symptoms.Revised containment zone orders issued on September 29 show a significant drop in the number of ‘sealed areas’ in these localities, where public mobility continues to be restricted and only essential activities are permitted even as the lockdown restrictions continue to be lifted elsewhere. For example, Patel Nagar, which had 11 containment zones on September 18, now has none. Similarly, Badshahpur, which had 10 sealed areas, has just one. Wazirabad, which had nine sealed areas on September 18, now has four such zones, while Chanderlok (having 11 containment zones earlier this month) now has just four. “While containment zones across the district have reduced in number, these areas have shown the most improvement,” said Dr MP Singh, the health department’s nodal officer for containment zone management in Gurugram. Despite multiple requests, the health department officials did not provide data to show how much of Gurugram’s total caseload has been reported from these areas. However, Singh said, “At present, we have 66 active cases in Badhshapur, 110 in Patel Nagar, 291 in Chanderlok and 138 in Wazriabad. I do not have the data on earlier cases, but I can say that we had far more active cases in these neighbourhoods about four weeks ago. They are some of the most populated areas in Gurugram. Homes are small, and many parts have informal housing, accelerating the spread.” This trend does not, however, apply across all containment zones. “We have two exceptions to this trend, namely the Tigra PHC block and the Khandsa PHC block. But we are implementing the same strategy in these areas as we did in Patel Nagar, so we are hoping to see a decline in cases here in coming weeks,” said Singh. Khandsa, which had just three sealed areas on September 18, now has 12. Similarly, Tigra, which had 18 sealed areas on September 8, now has 23 -- with 393 active cases (the highest density of active cases in Gurugram).The officials said that the Centre’s directive on September 7 restricts the use of rapid antigen tests to containment zones. “With all antigen tests concentrated in these areas, we have been able to isolate more positive people in the past three weeks than we were able to do earlier. Rapid response teams have been following up on patients in sealed areas in person, whereas in other parts the follow-up may happen only over a phone call, depending on staff capacity,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram. Experts, on the other hand, said that there is also a chance that containment zone areas may have naturally attained a certain level of population immunity — or herd immunity — due to rapid spread of the virus earlier in the outbreak, thereby naturally slowing the transmission of Covid-19 within the community. “It’s a possibility, but it needs to be supported with evidence from sero studies. I think it is more of a fifty-fifty scenario. Gurugram has been more liberal with testing than other districts and the response must be credited,” said Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice-president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-covid-19-spread-slows-down-in-densely-populated-localities/story-jFFrqt8SNhZ0liIW1gsY9I.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana education dept to provide sanitary pads to students||In an initiative aimed at raising awareness about menstrual health and hygiene, the state education department has decided to provide sanitary pads to female students of classes 6 to 12 on a monthly basis. In a letter addressed to district education officers (DEOs) on Monday, the directorate of school education asked schools to make arrangements for the supply of sanitary pads and appoint nodal officers for the project. Schools will be receiving an initial supply for two months to be distributed within a week. Each student will be given two packets on a monthly basis. The nodal officers, preferentially women, will be responsible for distribution of the pads among students as well as educating students about their usage. “If the students are visiting the school for academic guidance sessions, they can be provided the pads in school. else these pads can be delivered on the lines of mid-day meals,” stated the directive issued by the department. During the pandemic, mid-day meals are being delivered to students at their homes. Elementary education department director Pardeep Kumar said that this was the first time that a statewide initiative for creating awareness about menstrual hygiene was being undertaken. “Through this initiative, we seek to provide sanitary pads to girl students on a monthly basis. Till the time students are studying from home, we will try and deliver the pads. Senior students, who have started visiting schools for guidance sessions, can be called in batches and given the pads, while complying with physical distancing norms. We are considering various possibilities before we can finalise the method of dissemination,” said Kumar. District education officers have been given time till October 6 to prepare and share the list of nodal officers for the project with the department. Rinki Sharma, a 17-year-old Class 12 student, said the current move will immensely help students who are unable to purchase sanitary pads due to underlying financial concerns and social stigma. “It is a good step and will possibly play a role in normalising the discourse around menstrual health. Many students continue to be hesitant about menstrual health. There is a certain sense of conservativeness in society. That could change,” said Sharma. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that while some schools had sanitary pad vending machines that had been sponsored through CSR funds, it was for the first time that the government had directly launched an initiative that sought to provide sanitary pads to adolescent girls. “We have received directions regarding the implementation of the initiative and have appointed nodal officers who’d be supervising the dissemination. The senior students in classes 9 to 12 can be handed over the pads when they visit the school for academic guidance sessions,” said Sharma. She said that all girl students would benefit from the step which will be coupled with menstrual hygiene awareness sessions. “We have a committee of women teachers who have been conducting awareness sessions in the past. Once classes resume as per the routine, we will be able to extend the scope of these sessions,” said Sharma. Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli — an NGO that works on menstrual health with the Delhi government in its schools —said that the initiative was a good first step for driving the conversation on the subject of periods and menstrual health. “Children in the adolescent age group are ready to embrace change. Providing pads can act as the first step towards developing an understanding of menstrual hygiene,” said Singh. She added that while it was a good initiative, menstrual hygiene should not remain restricted to the availability of pads alone. “Change cannot be achieved simply by providing sanitary napkins. We need to dispel the stigma surround menstruation, both in school and at home. The larger goal should be educating children so that the stigma surrounding periods is reduced,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-education-dept-to-provide-sanitary-pads-to-students/story-rTcU6RKFA6dVbPYfmp24jP.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||Panel submits interim report on Sohna road collapse: Material quality in focus||The quality of materials used and the formation of a cavity could have contributed to the collapse of an elevated section of the under construction Sohna road on August 22, according to an interim report on the incident submitted to the national highways authority of India (NHAI).The report, prepared by a four-member high-level technical committee formed by the NHAI after the incident was submitted on Tuesday evening.NHAI officials who reviewed the contents of the report said it attributed the failure of the structure to quality of concrete used in the section, inadequacy of epoxy bonding used to bind the concrete, the possible displacement of stressing cables used to support the elevated structure and the possible formation of a cavity in the span that was not visible from the outside.Another NHAI official, privy to the report but not authorised to speak to the media, said it recommended that the concrete spans on the elevated structure and those cast at the construction yard should undergo non-destructive strength test to check for quality. “The concessionaire has also been asked to develop a standard operating procedure for bringing the concrete spans from yard to site and their erection. This process should be evaluated and proofed by the highway authority,” the official said.Shashi Bhushan, the NHAI project director for Gurugram, said that the initial findings looked into the sequence of construction activities and other aspects. “The test reports from Shriram lab (on the concrete used) and those conducted by Central Road Research Institute, which were submitted by the concessionaire, will also be sent to the technical committee. A consolidated report based on these findings would be able to give exact reasons, which caused this incident,” he said.The committee comprised VL Patankar, ex DG, (RD) MORTH, and ex-member, NHAI, AK Srivastav, advisor, NHAI, PG Venkataram, emeinent bridge expert, Vinay Gupta, eminent bridge expert. The members, when contacted for comment, said it was an internal matter and refused further comment.A senior official of the contractor, Oriental Structures Pvt Ltd, said that they have also submitted reports to the authority and awaiting the final report in this matter.The technical committee last month had made it clear that the contractor of the Sohna elevated road will not get any additional time for completing the project, scheduled for July 2021, on account of the delay due to the collapse.The work on 6-km Sohna road elevated road project was suspended after the collapse of the span between pier 10 and pier 11 on August 22. It was only last week that partial resumption of work on the surface level was allowed after the NHAI officials conducted an inspection of the project. The total length of the project is around 21 km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/panel-submits-interim-report-on-sohna-road-collapse-material-quality-in-focus/story-nDXpaSpvYCynQH1Of6QCEO.html
01-10-2020||Chandigarh||Use glue to seal letters instead of staplers, pins: Ludhiana post office staffers||India Post has urged the public to use glue while sealing letters instead of staplers or pins that can damage machines and tear bags of postmen.The staff deputed at the counters of the Ludhiana head post office keep suggesting to the public to use glue as stapled letters can be tampered with easily. The employees said that if they receive stapled letters from residents by hand, they immediately ask the person to use glue and remove the pin. Glue has also been kept at the entrance of the post office so that residents can conveniently use it to seal their envelope, they added. The Ludhiana head post office receives 3,000 letters daily, out of which 2,500 are stapled. Several private firms send their mails to public by post and majority of them are sealed with pins. Head postman, Ashwani Kumar, said, “I have been handling the mail sorting process for the last five years and most letters are sealed not with glue.

I find this very convenient as glue can hurt my hands. But today, when the employee at the counter advised me to use gum, I decided listen to them.

01-10-2020||Gurugram||Two held for beating man to death after argument near Sector 31||Two weeks after a 28-year-old man was allegedly beaten to death on Jharsa road near sector 31, the police on Tuesday arrested two suspects and claimed to have cracked the case. Police said their probe has found that both the arrested suspects had an argument with the victim, following which they roughed him up and also hit him in the chest with a brick, before fleeing from the spot. According to the police, the suspects — identified as Ataullah Khan alias Totla and Priyanshu alias Mota alias Sachin — were arrested from a house near Signature Tower on Tuesday. The deceased, identified by his first name as Pankaj, a native of Bhadaf village in Kanina of Mahendragarh district, had arrived in the city on September 5 to look for a job and had been staying at the house of his friend, identified as construction supervisor Ajay Kumar, in Rajiv Nagar in Sector 13. According to the police complaint lodged by Kumar, on September 15 at 1am, a woman had come to visit Pankaj. After she left, Pankaj told Kumar to accompany him to meet someone. At 2.10 am, they rode a motorcycle towards Atul Kataria Chowk and near a restaurant on Jharsa service road, their motorcycle broke down. While dragging the vehicle towards the nearest fuel station, they asked help from two men, who were passing by on a white scooter. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “An argument ensued between the victims and the suspects. The suspects slapped them and started kicking Pankaj, who fell on the road. Kumar managed to run away from the spot and hide in a lane nearby. The suspects kicked Pankaj in his private parts and also hit him with a brick on his chest, before escaping. They also took the keys of the motorcycle.” Later, after the men had left the spot, Kumar took the help of a passerby and rushed Pankaj to a private hospital in Jharsa and they returned to their house. At 5am, Pankaj again complained of severe pain in his private parts where the suspect had kicked him repeatedly. He was again rushed to a private hospital in sector 13, from where he was referred to another private hospital in sector 38. The doctors then referred him to civil hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The accused were produced in a district court on Wednesday and sent to judicial custody. They were booked under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) at sector 40 police station, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-beating-man-to-death-after-argument-near-sector-31/story-9OtqXhRFdLvWnViNbqStaO.html

01-10-2020||Delhi||Three rapes, 126 vehicle thefts per day in Delhi in 2019: NCRB||Delhi reported at least three rapes and 126 vehicle thefts every day in 2019 -- the year when overall crime in the national capital went up by 20% compared to the previous year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) Report. To be sure, the national crime rate has grown by 3% during the same period. As per the NCRB data, thefts accounted for most of the crimes in Delhi. Over 82% of the 299,475 crimes in Delhi were thefts -- such as burglaries, stealing of vehicles or snatching that do not involve use of force. Also Read: India records 1.6% rise in crimes in 2018-19: NCRB dataThe crimes in this category saw an increase of 25.7% as compared to 2018. In sharp contrast, thefts accounted for just a little over 20% of the 3.2 million crimes across India where the overall thefts increased by 8%.WATCH | Vikram Chandra on Yogi facing heat over Hathras gang-rape death, other storiesRobberies, however, witnessed a substantial dip of 20% even though the rate (number of cases per 100,000 population) remained the highest across India. The rate of robbery cases in Delhi last year was 9.8 as against the all India rate of 2.3; and 6.3 by the next ranked state Maharashtra.Also Read: Maharashtra only state to see 6 crimes worth over ₹100 crore: NCRBRobberies are different from thefts. Robberies include use of force while committing a theft and are registered under a separate IPC section.The NCRB does not maintain separate data for street crimes, particularly snatching, which is a rising menace in the city. That is because a crime like snatching on the streets is either registered in the first information report (FIR) under IPC section of theft or a robbery, depending on whether force was used or not.But the Delhi Police’s data shows that until August 15 this year, there have been nearly 20 incidents of snatching every day in the national capital.Despite fewer people going out due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a 6% increase (4,257) in the snatching incidents this year compared to 4,010 in the corresponding period last year, according to police data.Vehicle thefts dipVehicle thefts witnessed a negligible dip of 0.46%. While 46,433 vehicle thefts were reported across Delhi in 2018, last year there were 46,215 such cases.However compare to the national average, the scene in Delhi remains bleak. The vehicle theft rate in Delhi in 2019 was 231.8 compared to 17.8 nationally and 12.6 in Uttar Pradesh -- the second ranked state in this category. 24 rapes every weekRape cases in 2019 in Delhi rose by 3% compared to the previous year, the NCRB data shows. In 969 cases, children were victims compared to 989 such instances in 2018. Cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act dipped marginally from 1,736 to 1,719.Also Read: Mumbai ranks third in crimes, after Delhi, Chennai: NCRB dataThe NCRB data shows that in 98.7% of the 1,253 total rape cases in 2019, the victims and the suspects were known to each other. Of them, 129 were family members, 588 were friends, neighbours or employers and 520 were cases in which the accused were online friends, estranged partners or rapes on the pretext of marriage.Reported cases of molestation fell by 13% to 2,355 last year. Incidents of sexual harassment went down to 456, a 17% decrease compared to 2018.Overall, crimes against women decreased by 6% from 12,521 to 11,755.Drop in crimes against and by minorsThe data shows a 5.7% dip in crimes against children -- from 6,271 to 5,915. Moreover, overall crimes allegedly executed by minors also saw a drop of about 3.5% from 2,727 in 2018 to 2,633 last year. But the number of murders committed by minors rose to 72 in 2019 compared to 58 in 2018. Prakash Singh, former director-general of police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh and Assam, said though he has not seen the NCRB data, he found Delhi to be a better place for registration of cases compared to other states.“If Delhi saw a 20% increase in registered IPC crimes in 2019 when compared to the national spike of 3%, I must say that Delhi is a better place for registration of crimes than other Indian states. I want to compliment the Delhi Police for truthfully and faithfully registering the cases,” said Singh.But, more than the statistics, the focus should be on crime detection rate, timely filing of charge sheets, and behaviour of police personnel towards complainants, Singh added. “This would help in building confidence among the public,” he said.A Delhi Police spokesperson said, “The Delhi Police believes in truthful registration of cases and fair investigation. Our crime prevention strategies include analysing all crime related calls received in the police control room and accordingly register first information reports (FIRs). These practices may lead to rise in registration of cases but we should not be bothered about numbers.” “Our focus should be on making efforts to nab the offenders and bring them to justice. In the long run, this will eventually lead to a decline in the number of FIRs. Our prime focus is on curbing serious crimes such as snatching, robbery, house theft, murder and crimes against women and children. As far of cases of thefts are concerned, the Delhi Police have provided people with a platform where they themselves register FIRs online related to property thefts, including vehicles,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-rapes-126-vehicle-thefts-per-day-in-delhi-in-2019-ncrb/story-qRAe1Buwwrkombvl3ngDkJ.html
01-10-2020||Delhi||Stop pasting posters outside Covid patients’ homes: Petition in Delhi HC||The Delhi high court Wednesday sought Delhi government’s response on a plea seeking the formulation of guidelines to do away with the practice of pasting posters outside the homes of Covid-19 positive persons or those put under home isolation. The plea had also sought steps to ensure that names of Covid-19 patients are not revealed, especially to residents’ welfare associations or on WhatsApp groups.A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad issued a notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand, only on this limited issue, after a plea was filed by advocate Kush Kalra on September 28, contending that pasting posters outside the homes of positive persons was a serious infringement of the fundamental right to privacy, as laid down by the Supreme Court and the Constitution.The plea had sought other reliefs as well, including enhancing testing capacity in the city, using indigenously developed kits, reformulating the Indian Council of Medical Research advisory on testing and validation of rapid antigen test kits. However, the court said it was already examining all these aspects in another plea and hence “there was no sense in duplication” and limited the scope of the present plea. The bench also said the relief sought in terms of availing of the testing capacity of a neighbouring state cannot be allowed as, earlier, such practices were leading to a delay in getting the results. In his plea, Kalra, also contended that freely circulating to RWAs and on WhatsApp groups the names of persons who tested Covid-19 positive was “leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention”. He said the positive persons “ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace, away from prying eyes”.His plea also claimed that this has resulted in “people shying away and deliberately choosing not to test themselves” to avoid the “public embarrassment and stigmatization” which is also caused by pasting posters outside the homes of Covid-19 patients. “It is because of these sound reasons that Punjab has rescinded its earlier decision of paste posters outside the home of Covid-19 patients under home isolation or quarantine,” the plea read.The matter would be now heard on October 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plea-wants-end-to-pasting-posters-outside-homes-of-covid-19-patients-hc-seeks-delhi-govt-reply/story-A0ejXXY7qLpkntyE2JaUXP.html
01-10-2020||Noida||With increased testing, results coming late in GB Nagar||On September 26, a 22-year-old woman, who did not wish to be named, was cursing her fate in front of the office of Gautam Budh Nagar district chief medical officer (CMO). During these times, she was one of the lucky ones with a job offer in hand from a company in Bengaluru. She was all prepared to join the company on September 28, but for the Covid-19 certificate that her employer required from her. Four days after giving her samples for an RT-PCR test, she had not got the certificate.“I had to meet the CMO otherwise my future would be in jeopardy,” she said. “Last seven to eight days have been so depressing for me as the anxiety while waiting for my test results was not less than killing me”. The CMO made a few quick calls and assured her that she would get it by Monday morning, which she did.Several people HT spoke to attested to receiving the certificate at least four days after giving their sample. According to the Gautam Budh Nagar notices, results are supposed to be given to people within three days. CMO Dr. Deepak Ohri said that there are four ICMR-approved laboratories in the district that tests for Covid-19. “While the labs in Child PGI and Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) are under the state government, the labs in National Institute of Biology (NIB) and National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) are under the domain of central government. While the state government labs also test the samples of other district, the central government labs are assigned for testing samples from other states also,” he said. Normally the RT-PCR reports are available within 72 hours.The delay, he said, is because of the increased testing and further process of uploading the data onto the database before submitting it to the person. “The same labs, which used to test around 1,300 samples daily in May, are now testing over 2,500 samples a day in September,” Ohri said. “At present, we are taking samples of over 3,500 persons daily. We are planning to double it in coming month.”District magistrate Suhas LY said he would ask the agencies to ensure they stick to the timelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-increased-testing-reults-coming-late-in-gb-nagar/story-evaXZNgk363ODETaHrL7UM.html
01-10-2020||Delhi||‘Disgusted’: Delhi HC tells chief to act against erring cops||The Delhi high court has directed the Delhi Police commissioner to take action against his officers for their failure to investigate the case of a minor girl going missing in July. She was rescued from Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, only after her mother moved a habeas corpus petition before the court on September 21 seeking to know the whereabouts of the girl and a direction to the police to produce her.Police submitted before the court that the girl was living in Hathras with a man who “married” her in February, but since she was only 16 years of age, that marriage was not valid and his action amounted to criminality. He was hence arrested and sent to judicial custody. The girl is now three months pregnant, the court was told.Hathras cops cremate rape victim by stealthA bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said it was “not only anguished, but also disgusted at the manner in which the police conduct investigations in such cases, particularly when it involves the poor of society”.While noting that the mother was a house help, the court said it was because of her profession that her complaint/FIR was neglected and not acted upon with the urgency that it deserved.More outrage, protests after Hathras victim’s cremation“We direct the commissioner of police to take serious and effective action against the police personnel concerned, who were recalcitrant and failed to perform their duties in the case. The action taken against those found guilty of negligence and dereliction of duty should be such that it sends a message to the entire police force. Let the copy of this order be placed before the commissioner of police, Delhi, for his knowledge and compliance,” the court said in its order dated September 29, while also seeking a status report from the police.Plea in SC seeks CBI probe into Hathras gang rape caseThe court was hearing a habeas corpus plea filed on September 21 by the mother of the girl who went missing on July 27. In her plea, the mother contended that despite her registering an FIR  on July 28 at the Trilokpuri police station, her daughter was not found or rescued.In a status report, the police had told the court on September 23 that a man had claimed that he got married to the girl in February in Ghaziabad.Resolve the Hathras rape case swiftlyAppearing for the Delhi Police, standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain submitted that the date of birth of the girl has been verified from school records – which shows that she is only 16 years of age (as on Wednesday); and that she gotten married to the man on the basis of the date of birth given in the Aadhaar card – which is not correct.On September 29, the police filed a status report that the girl was rescued from Hathras and that she is three months pregnant. The police said she was housed at a Nari Niketan (women’s shelter home) and the “husband” was sent to judicial custody.The girl told the judges on September 29 that she did not want to go with her mother and would rather stay at the Nari Niketan even though her mother insisted to take her daughter along.Following this, the court said she should continue to be housed at the Nari Niketan and that she should be provided counselling, considering the fact that she is pregnant so that she is able to take responsible decisions with regard to her pregnancy.The court, while passing the order, said it was only when this petition was preferred and it directed transfer of the investigation to Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) (Crime), that the girl was rescued and the man apprehended from Hathras.“This delay on the part of the police in carrying out effective investigation has ruined not only the life of the girl but also the man and put in dark the future of the child that the girl is carrying,” the court said while ordering an inquiry in into the alleged police inaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-recommends-action-against-cops-for-laxity-in-probing-missing-girl-case/story-3jHLeU7X1iTKMd1pIhGIWJ.html

The bi-weekly prison visits were suspended on March 23 due to the burgeoning coronavirus disease crisis.Several prisoners have written to jail officers over the last two months, asking not only to meet their families but requesting that visitors be allowed to bring a fresh set of clothes, saying the ones they were wearing over the past six months were either torn or worn out.Mumbai ranks third in crimes, after Delhi, Chennai: NCRB dataA senior prison officer, who asked not to be named, said that starting October 1, one member of every prisoner’s family will be allowed inside the jail each month. Until March 23, before visits were suspended, a prisoner was allowed to meet their family twice a week.In an order issued by the prison headquarters that HT has seen, every visitor will be allowed to get one set of clothes. India records 1.6% rise in crimes in 2018-19: NCRB dataWith in-person visits disallowed, prison inmates were allowed to interact with family members over video conferencing, a practice jail officers said would continue, saying it would help curb the spread of Covid-19.Earlier this month, at least 15 inmates across jails had written to senior prison officers requesting new clothes. “The number of visitors at every visiting room inside the jail will be almost half of what it was before the lockdown. Rooms will be sanitised before every meeting by a team of prisoners. This is for every one’s safety. Every visitor will be thermally scanned and have to give an undertaking that they have not come in touch with any Covid-positive person,” the senior prison officer told HT.A second officer, who also asked not to be named, said new rules regulating the visits will also be in place for prisoners. “The clothes will have to be soaked in soap water for at least half an hour before it is worn the first time,” the officer said.Till Wednesday, at least 83 prisoners of Tihar, Mandoli, and Rohini jails, and 207 staffers had been infected with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-person-visits-to-delhi-s-three-prisons-to-resume-from-october-1/story-wYmio6dccGy0YhKaRtiTKL.html
01-10-2020||Delhi||Mayors say govt owes them ‘crores’ in property tax; AAP says ‘figures false’||Mayors of the three municipal corporations Wednesday said they will soon call in the outstanding property tax dues on various Delhi government buildings -- an amount, which they claimed, would run into crores of rupees. This comes a day after the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) issued notices to seven agencies, including the three municipal corporations, over pending water and sewerage dues.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, South corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh and East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain, in a joint press conference on Wednesday, said they will be acting on the outstanding property dues of various Delhi government buildings, including schools, hospitals and offices, among others. “The properties of the public works department (PWD), the Delhi Secretariat, the Delhi Transco Limited and the Delhi Jal Board have never paid property tax to the corporation, to recover which we will now take action,” said Prakash.A government spokesperson termed the press briefing “unfortunate” and said the three mayors “have united to put before the media false figures”. The DJB, on Tuesday, had said the North corporation owes it Rs 2,466 crore in dues, while the South and East corporations have dues of Rs 81 crore and Rs 49 crore, respectively.“The Delhi government has imposed super commercial rates on water bills at 700 schools, six hospitals, 17 polyclinics and offices of the corporation. The corporation provides free education and health facilities to the poor. This shows how the Delhi government wants to spread chaos in the city,” claimed Prakash.He added that the DJB has not paid property tax worth Rs 216 crore, while Rs 293 crore is pending towards road cutting work in the North civic body area. “Besides these, the Delhi government has not paid the dues of Rs 955.84 crore for the first and second quarter of the current fiscal to the North corporation. As per the recommendations of Delhi Finance Commission, Rs 968.91 crore is pending, which means that a total Rs 1,924.81 crore has not been released to the corporation as yet,” said Prakash. East Corporation mayor Jain said in a letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, he had requested Kejriwal to pay the pending amount of Rs 175.52 crore to the civic body, which is due on behalf of the DJB.South corporation mayor Mithilesh said in each of the four zones of the civic body, property tax worth of Rs 2,500 crore is pending on properties of the Delhi government. “This means a total of Rs 10,000 crore is due to us from the Delhi government,” said Mithilesh.Reacting to the press briefing, a Delhi government spokesperson said,” It is unfortunate that all the three mayors of MCDs have united to give completely false figures to the media. They have made a joke of their offices. The SDMC said Delhi govt owes it Rs 10,000 crores on properties, but their total property tax collection last year was Rs 940 crore from around 12 lakh properties.” “People of Delhi will not be fooled. If the BJP cannot run the MCD, it should resign immediately. The AAP will run it within the same budget. But the BJP should stop crying like a child daily. Ever since the BJP has been running the MCDs, the people have only gotten corruption and daily excuses,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-say-govt-owes-them-crores-in-property-tax-aap-says-figures-false/story-nDZAzXOGtM2jawVFKwbr5J.html

01-10-2020||Education||Delhi govt to hold meeting on Thursday to discuss unlock guidelines on schools, colleges||The Delhi government’s education department officials will hold a meeting on Thursday discuss the Unlock 5 rules issued by the Union home ministry on Wednesday. According to the latest guidelines, the decision for opening schools and coaching institutions in a graded manner can be taken by the states/union territories after October 15 “in consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation”. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will take the call in notifying the relaxation order by the central government guidelines. The DDMA is chaired by L-G Anil Baijal and CM Arvind Kejriwal is it’s vice-chairperson. However, the education department will be entrusted with working out the modalities on how the relaxation is to be implemented, once permitted. Reacting to the MHA guidelines, a senior official from the deputy chief minister’s office on Wednesday said, “We had announced for closure of schools till October 5 in the capital. This gives us time to go through the guidelines, consult stakeholders, and take the decision on the reopening of schools in the national Capital. We will hold a meeting on Thursday.” Even though the last guidelines issued on August 29 allowed voluntary school visits by students of classes 9 to 12 for guidance from September 21, the Delhi government had announced on September 18 that all schools in the Capital would remain closed for till October 5. Schools across the country were shut in March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Classes are being conducted online, and links to online study material are being sent to the students via WhatsApp, emails and SMS. Aparajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents’ Association, said parents are still not keen on sending children to the schools. “The standard operating procedures (SOPs) did not instil any confidence among parents. They know it won’t be followed or implemented properly. We prefer online classes because we don’t want to take any chances.” School administrators are, however, concerned about the students who would be appearing for board exams next year. “It is difficult to conduct laboratory practicals for board students online. We think schools should be made operational in a staggered manner with extensive safety protocols and by taking parents into confidence. As a part of our internal survey, we found out that around 35% of parents in our school were in favour of reopening schools. The Covid-19 situation might also be relatively improve by October 15,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector-8, said, “Even though, government school children might face more difficulties than private school students due to irregular access to devices or internet, reopening schools might be difficult after October 15. The number of Covid cases are still high and teachers, too, are still afraid to join duties. Maybe we can begin with calling class 10 and 12 students once a week. But we are awaiting a decision by the directorate of education.” The latest guidelines state that if students prefer to attend online classes rather than physically attend school, they may be permitted to do so. Students may attend schools/ institutions only with the written consent of parents and attendance must not be enforced, and must depend entirely on parental consent.According to the guidelines, higher education institutions with PhD scholars and post-graduate students in science and technology stream, requiring laboratory or experimental work, will be allowed to reopen from October 15. For central universities, the head of the institution will determine “the genuine requirement” of research scholars. For state and private universities, the decision will be taken by the state government. JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar said, “The guidelines have only given an option to reopen universities for research scholars and postgraduate students and it is not compulsory. We will hold a meeting with all our deans in a couple of days to decide on the matter.” DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “In order to ensure that the work of PhD students is not affected, we have already allowed some of them to access laboratories. After October 15, we will also allow MPhil students and postgraduate students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-hold-meeting-on-thursday-to-discuss-unlock-guidelines-on-schools-colleges/story-KjH7SjUxCncu3r7hMnzZdO.html
01-10-2020||Delhi||Ensure farmers get easy access to stubble-removal machines: EPCA to Punjab, Haryana||The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Wednesday asked the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana to ensure that small and marginal farmers in their states get easy access to stubble-removal machines at affordable rates so that cases of crop residue burning can be controlled in the upcoming winter season.EPCA chairperson Bhure Lal on Wednesday said in his letters to the top officials of Punjab and Haryana that with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across the country, controlling early instances of farm fires will become more important this year because if unchecked, these could worsen problems for people with co-morbidities.The Punjab government had on August 14 directed that crop residue management machines be provided at a subsidy of 80% to farmers across the state, and that these should be made available to small and marginal farmers on “priority”. The government said the farmers will be charged only operational cost and no rental for the machines. The operational cost includes power charges and operator wages but not the cost of capital.“The rate of rental, which is being waived of, is not apparent; the cost of operation is not laid down. We would urge you to ensure this is done so that small and marginal farmers have access (to the machines) at affordable/free cost,” Lal said in his letter to Vini Mahajan, chief secretary of Punjab.A senior Haryana government official said that the office of the chief secretary will respond to the letter in a few days after scanning its contents. The office of Punjab chief secretary did not comment.On similar lines, the Haryana government had on August 24 directed that small and marginal farmers would be given preference in the use of crop residue management machines in panchayat-run custom hiring centres, by providing 70% reservation for them. Lal in his letter to Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora, wrote, “We would urge you there should be a clear directive on the rate/free use of machines to small and marginal farmers. The machines have been provided at 80-100% subsidy to panchayat-run CHCs to ensure that farmers, who cannot afford to purchase them, have access.”He asked both governments to ensure these schemes are widely publicised among farmers.Meanwhile, the EPCA also submitted a report before the Supreme Court on implementation of schemes announced by state and central governments in Punjab and Haryana to control stubble burning this year.Citing data from the union ministry’s air quality monitoring agency, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting snd Research, the EPC report said that while stubble burning is not the only cause of pollution in Delhi, “there is no doubt that the transportation of pollutants from burning fields is the tipping point that makes winter’s already unhealthy air quality a public health emergency”.This year, farmers have already begun burning crop residue in parts of Punjab and Haryana, suggesting an early start to a practice that aggravates winter pollution. Every year these farm fires usually begin in full swing by mid-October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ensure-farmers-get-easy-access-to-stubble-removal-machines-epca-to-punjab-haryana/story-NU4wLr05CS6S9nft4oSuEI.html

While Delhi has to suffer from the smoke, the farmers who are forced to burn the stubble and their villages are the ones who have to suffer the most.”WATCH| Delhi CM Kejriwal on solution to stubble burning amid coronavirus pandemicThe CM said this year, the Pusa research institute has formulated capsules, four of which can be mixed with a liquid solution prepared from jaggery and gram flour, and can be sprayed to cover one hectare of land. This mixture when sprayed softens the hard straw and turns it into manure.Kejriwal said the mixture will be prepared by the Delhi government under the guidance of the Pusa institute. The process of formulating the mixture will begin from October 5 and completed by October 12 or 13.The Delhi government will set up the entire spraying system on the fields with tractors, free of cost for the farmers, he said.In 15-20 days, the sprayed stubble will soften and will be converted into manure for the fields.There are around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown, following which the stubble is collected and set on fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-start-process-of-preparing-bio-decomposer-for-stubble/story-vDT4OyQewpiEd8JYeIE2LK.html

01-10-2020||City||PAU V-C urges farmers to desist from stubble burning||While the farmer unions are covertly supporting the stubble fire to press the government to withdraw the controversial farm bills and for compensation for stubble management, Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU) vice-chancellor Baldev Dhillon on Wednesday urged farmers to desist from burning stubble in fields to curb pollution.The Bharati Kisan Union, Lakhowal, has said that they will be forced to burn stubble if the government failed to compensate them. “It is not wise to burn stubble as it will pollute other cities as well. Yes, the struggle for the rights is justified, but burning stubble in no solution to the problem,” said Dhillon.He said that the rise in stubble burning cases is failing the efforts made in the past 11 years to reduce the number of farm fires. “This year we are comfortably placed. We have enough number of super seeders, happy seeders, cutters and rotavator. Even this year has witnessed a record sale of high-power tractors which supports these machines. We started receiving positive results of in-situ crop management. I was expecting a lesser number of farm fire but unfortunately, there has been a spurt in the incidents,” the vice-chancellor said.He stressed that farm fires will lead to several problems. “Firstly, it is injurious to health and the smoke from the fields causes blindness on roads which leads to accidents and it is not healthily for our soil health,” the agricultural varsity’s V-C said. On the other hand, Bharati Kisan Union (BKU) (Lakhowal) general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said that farmers would be forced to burn stubble if the government failed to either give a bonus of ₹100 per quintal on paddy crop or compensation of ₹2,500 per acre.Lakhowal said the apex court had issued directions to the government last year that since farmers were not in a position to bear the additional cost of straw management, the government ought to lend financial assistance to them if it wanted that stubble burning should stop.“We have urged the government to incorporate the management cost in the Minimum Support Price (MSP),” said Harvinder Singh. He added that there is a lot of anger among farmers against the central government for imposing three farmer laws. “The only way to stop stubble burning is to provide assured financial assistance in the form of bonus on crop or lump sum grants on the basis of land holding,” he said.“The farmers in the state said that if the Centre does not think about their welfare then why should they care about the politicians sitting in Delhi,” said Lakhowal.Lakhowal maintained that the rail roko agitation will start from October 1. He said their protest would continue till the state government adopts a resolution against the farm acts and the Centre scraps these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-v-c-urges-farmers-to-desist-from-stubble-burning/story-AChl5RjCNTS9Utax5lrhgL.html
01-10-2020||Gurugram||41% of all Covid-19 cases reported in September||Of the 20,417 cases of Covid-19 reported in the district so far, 41 percent (or 8500 cases) surfaced in the month of September alone, data released by state bulletins state. During the same period, Covid-related mortality saw a 28 percent increase from last month, with 37 new deaths reported since September 1 (up from just 16 deaths recorded in August), the data further shows. Health department officials attributed this spike to a continued increase in public mobility, spurred by lockdown fatigue and resumption of social and economic activities. The uptick of cases in September marks the highest monthly aggregate of new infections since June, when the district recorded 4,716 cases of Covid-19. The subsequent months of July and August saw a sustained dip in the number of new cases, along with an increase in testing capabilities and a decline in the test-positivity rate (i.e. the ratio of positive cases to samples tested). Improvement in treatment protocols for serious and moderately ill patients, along with better enforcement of home isolation guides helped keep deaths lower, health department officials claimed. “We have seen a second peak in September Increase in connectivity with Delhi, workplaces opening up, people resuming their social engagements... these are the most obvious reasons. Though there are also some theories that drop in temperature and post-monsoon changes in weather may have also sped up the transmission of the virus. We can’t say for sure,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram. Dr Prakash added that there has been a slowdown in cases over the past week, coinciding with a nationwide deceleration in growth of new cases. “After July, the dip in cases was localised. The spread instead had begun to pick up in rural districts and towns, but over the past week, there has been a widespread dip across not only Haryana, but the entire country. This is a good thing,” he said. However, with winter soon approaching, officials are on guard that new infections may spike, and also worry that patients might require pharmalcological interventions. “Cases of respiratory illness tend to worsen during winter months, when we see far more people seeking medical attention for accurate respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI). Whether this will worsen infections in symptomatic patients is yet to be seen. We are making preparations to increase testing during the winter season,” said Dr Ram Prakash Sharma, district epidemiologist, Gurugram. He, however, added that it was still too early to know if Gurugram is experiencing a ‘second wave’ of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/41-of-all-covid-19-cases-reported-in-september-mortality-rate-spikes-by-28/story-XhuVJJy2UWD33iLbgYceXN.html
01-10-2020||World||‘Can only allow lawyers with license to practice in Pakistan’: Kulbhushan Jadhav denied Queen’s counsel||Pakistan on Thursday once again rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel should be appointed for death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in the review of his death sentence in this country. “We have repeatedly told them that only those lawyers can represent Commander Jadhav in the Court who have the license to practice law in Pakistan. This is in accordance with legal practice in other jurisdictions as well,” Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said while replying to a question during his weekly press briefing here.He further said that the Indian Supreme Court, in one of its judgments, has also ruled that foreign lawyers cannot practice law within the country.India’s Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last month said the government of Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit.“It has not yet addressed the core issues, which include provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial,” he said.Queen’s Counsel is a barrister or advocate, appointed Counsel to the UK Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor.Last month, the Islamabad High Court directed the Pakistan government to give India another chance to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav and adjourned hearing for a month.Pakistan’s Parliament last month extended for four months an ordinance that allowed Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in a high court as required by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).Responding to a question on Pakistan’s offer of arranging a meeting of Jadhav with his father and wife, Chaudhri said the offer “remains valid.” “However, we have not received any response from the Indian side as yet,” he added.In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a “farcical” approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order.Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.During the briefing, Chaudhri also said that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has once again written to the President of the UN Security Council, raising the Kashmir issue.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcating it into two Union territories. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-only-allow-lawyers-with-license-to-practice-in-pakistan-kulbhushan-jadhav-denied-queen-s-counsel/story-GOGH3gl8lIXsPuGYhieS5I.html

The app will alert users if they have recently been near someone who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Many of the 20 hot spots include Orthodox Jewish communities. Cuomo said he talked to community leaders about enforcing social distancing measures.“A cluster today can become community spread tomorrow,” Cuomo said on a briefing call with reporters. “These ZIP codes are not hermetically sealed.”He implored local authorities to increase enforcement measures. “If they’re not wearing masks, they should be fined,” Cuomo said.Wisconsin health officials are urging residents to stay home and avoid large gatherings ahead of Trump’s weekend rallies in La Crosse and Green Bay in the run up to the Nov. 3 election.“This spike we’re seeing in Brown County, Wisconsin should be a wakeup call to anyone who lives here that our community is facing a crisis,” Dr. Paul Casey, medical director of the emergency department at Bellin Hospital, told CNN.Cases, hospitalizations, positive test rates and deaths are all climbing in Wisconsin, according to a Reuters analysis.Last week 19% of tests came back positive for Covid-19 and have steadily risen for five weeks in a row from 8% in late August. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has doubled in the last two weeks hitting a record of 646 on Wednesday. On Wednesday, the state reported its biggest one-day increase in deaths since the pandemic started with 27 lives lost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-worries-over-20-covid-19-hot-spots-wisconsin-sees-troubling-trends/story-43EkomJl4aA5On88NJQNxL.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump biggest driver of Covid-19 misinformation: Report||US President Donald Trump has been the world’s biggest driver of Covid-19 misinformation during the pandemic, a study from Cornell University said Thursday.A team from the Cornell Alliance for Science evaluated 38 million articles published by English-language, traditional media worldwide between January 1 and May 26 of this year.The database they used aggregates coverage from countries such as the United States, Britain, India, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and other African and Asian nations.They identified 522,472 news articles that reproduced or amplified misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic, or what the World Health Organization has called the “infodemic.”These were categorized into 11 main sub-topics, ranging from conspiracy theories to attacks on top scientist Anthony Fauci to the idea that the virus is a bioweapon unleashed by China.But the most popular topic by far was what the study authors termed “miracle cures,” which appeared in 295,351 articles -- more than the other 10 topics combined.The authors found that comments by President Trump drove major spikes in the “miracle cures” topic, led by his April 24 press briefing where he mused on the possibility of using disinfectants inside the body to cure the coronavirus.Similar spikes were seen when he promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.“We conclude therefore that the president of the United States was likely the largest driver of the COVID-19 misinformation ‘infodemic,’“ the team wrote.Sara Evanega, who led the study and is director of the Cornell Alliance for Science, said: “If people are misled by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about the disease, they may be less likely to observe official guidance and thus risk spreading the virus.”Co-author Jordan Adams, a data analyst at Cision Insights that provided the database, added: “One of the more interesting aspects of the data collection process was discovering the staggering amount of misinformation coverage directly linked to the public comments of a small number of individuals.”After miracle cures, the second-most prevalent misinformation topic was that the pandemic was created to advance a “new world order.”Next came the claim that the pandemic was a hoax for political gain by the US Democratic Party, followed by conspiracies alleging the virus was a bioweapon released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.Conspiracy theories linking the pandemic to philanthropist Bill Gates came next, then the hoax that Covid-19 symptoms are caused by 5G phone networks, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the notion that the virus is a form of population control.Attacks on US government scientist Fauci, references to the debunked “Plandemic” video, and blaming the virus on Chinese people consuming bat soup rounded off the list.The study authors also tracked how the stories were shared on social media, finding that the posts elicited 36 million engagements, three-quarters of them on Facebook. The research was partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-biggest-driver-of-covid-19-misinformation-report/story-IrmQTGibOMQSFHh96GwjKK.html

01-10-2020||World||US judge blocks fee hike for H-1B, L-1 visas, Green Cards||A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from raising filing fees for a range of immigrant and non-immigrant services, including Green Cards and H-1B and L-1 visas used by US companies to hire foreign workers, as well as work authorisation for international students.The fee hikes were to go into effect on Friday.The fee for H-1B petitions filed by US employers was set to rise from $460 to $555 and for L visas from $460 to $805. Other charges related to H-1Bs were also slated to go up.Filing fee for international students for Optional Practical Training, which allows them to work as part for their courses, would have gone up from $410 to $550.The cost of filing for US citizenship was to rise from $640 to $1,160. Asylum application fee was set to be $50 for each applicant, which would have made the United States the only country in the world to charge asylum seekers.US district judge Jeffrey S White of the Northern District of California issued the nationwide injunction on Tuesday in response to a lawsuit brought by eight organisations challenging the fee hikes on the ground that top officials heading the Department of Homeland Security at the time did not meet their service requirements — Secretary Kevin McAleenan and his successor Chad Wolf were not confirmed by US Senate.“Plaintiffs have met their burden to show they are likely to succeed on their claim that Mr McAleenan and Mr Wolf were not lawfully serving under the HSA (Homeland Security Act),” White wrote. “Defendants conceded at the hearing that if this court rejects their arguments on this issue, which it does, the final rule would have been promulgated without lawful authority.”The Trump administration is expected to appeal the injunction.“Not only is it unfair and fiscally foolish for the Trump administration to make H-1B visas, green cards, and citizenship too costly for many immigrants, but now a federal judge has ruled it lawless,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House, and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.The H-1B petition fees are paid by American employers, who have mostly turned to India to hire highly skilled workers in IT and other specialised professions. Indians hired from India and those enrolled in US colleges and universities have accounted for more than 70% of H-1B visas granted every year.The short-term non-immigrant visa programme has faced relentless pressure from the Trump administration, which believes it is being used to displace American workers. And the administration has issued a slew of orders tightening and changing rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-blocks-fee-hike-for-h-1b-l-1-visas-green-cards/story-LMz4nydR7sDooXCVgYzBRL.html

01-10-2020||World||2 British PMs benefited from slavery, admits Westminster||Two British prime ministers – Robert Peel and William Gladstone – are among top politicians who directly benefited from slave trade and indentured labour in India, America, West Indies and elsewhere, according to a major review of parliamentary art in Westminster released on Thursday.Initial findings in the ongoing review supported by House of Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle reveal that at least 232 items of over 9,500 works in the Parliamentary Art Collection have links to the transatlantic slave trade over the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Spurred by the Black Lives Movement, the parliamentary art review is part of similar efforts by several museums, art galleries and other large collections in the UK in recent months to reconsider the approach to managing the collection and how to broaden its diversity and inclusion.The Speaker’s Advisory Committee on Works of Art said: “British involvement in the transatlantic slave trade began in 1562, and by the 1730s Britain was the biggest slave-trading nation in the world”. “The abolition movement in Britain, and the acts of resistance and rebellion by enslaved Africans in the Colonies, led to the abolition of first the trade, and then the use of enslaved labour in British colonies by Acts of Parliament in 1807 and 1833”. “However, many British people continued to have direct financial gain from the trading and use of enslaved labour and indentured labour in the West Indies, America, India and elsewhere”, it added.Of the 232 items identified so far, 189 depict 24 people who had ties to the slave trade and 40 pieces depict 14 people who worked to abolish slavery. Peel was twice prime minister (1834-35 and 1841-46), while Gladstone held the office over four terms between 1868 and 1894.Besides Peel and Gladstone, the list of MPs who had financial or family interests in transatlantic slave trade and slavery includes Henry Dundas (1742-1811), who was president of the Board of Control of the East India Company.Items linked to those who campaigned to abolish slavery include William Wilberforce (1759-1833), who also pushed for Christian evangelism in colonial India in parliamentary debates during the renewal of the East India Company’s charter in 1793 and 1813.The small number of artworks linked to non-white MPs include a painting and images of the first three Indian MPs in the House of Commons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Dadabhai Naoroji (Finsbury Central), Mancherjee Bhownagree (Bethnal Green North East) and Shapurji Saklatvala (Battersea North).The committee said: “There is no definitive list of MPs with close connections to the transatlantic trade, or those who had financial interests in the use of enslaved labour and indentured labour in the West Indies, America, India and elsewhere”. “However, they will be numerous, and some will be included in artworks on display in Parliament. There are also instances of MPs whose views changed over their time in Parliament, for example those with economic interests in the use of enslaved peoples and the slave trade who later fought for abolition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-british-pms-benefited-from-slavery-admits-westminster/story-rq8dHlj8TvvTOHzkBmGZjI.html

The move came just days after an opposition alliance was formed against the government.Addressing the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s first major meeting via video link late last month, Sharif had severely criticised the military as “a state above the state”.But while talking to media in London later, Sharif said he had supported the country’s armed forces a lot. He went on to claim that his government reverse-engineered a missile launched against Afghanistan by the US in strikes ordered against al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan in 1998. “One of these missiles landed undamaged in Balochistan and we used back-engineering (sic) to develop our own missile programme,” Sharif said.“It was during my tenure as PM that Pakistan became a nuclear power, developed the JF-17 aircraft along with China and I can also claim that half of the missiles that Pakistan has developed were done with my support.”The former PM said he had all love and respect for both military officers and soldiers. “There are very few people in the armed forces who I have a problem with,” he said. Talking about the opposition alliance, Sharif said it is a matter of time that the present government will go. “If the country stands up, change will come in a few months,” he said.He also took the opportunity to attack Khan whom he called “selected...incompetent...mad.” He said Khan did not know how to govern and his government was failing. Nawaz Sharif said that he will hold to account those people who brought Imran Khan to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-pak-pm-recalls-reverse-engineering-of-us-missile-to-demonstrate-his-ties-to-military/story-VTVAViCLcELnWoi3dX9xhP.html

The Vatican declined his request to see Pope Francis, citing Holy See policy to not grant papal audiences during election campaigns, Parolin said.Pompeo was in Rome to participate in a conference on religious freedom organized by the US Embassy to the Holy See, and to meet with Italian and Vatican officials.During the Wednesday conference, Pompeo urged the Vatican to join the US in denouncing violations of religious freedom in China, part of the US campaign to criticize Beijing’s crackdown on religious and ethnic minorities that has increased amid the coronavirus pandemic and before the Nov. 3 election.The conference was organized at the same time the Vatican is entering into delicate negotiations with Beijing on extending their controversial 2018 agreement on nominating bishops for China.The Vatican is seeking to extend the accord, which envisages a process of dialogue in selecting bishops. It signed it in 2018 in hopes it would help unite China’s Catholics, who for seven decades have been split between those belonging to an official, state-sanctioned church and an underground church loyal to Rome.Pompeo has strongly criticized the accord, penning an essay earlier this month suggesting that the Vatican had compromised its moral authority by signing it. His article greatly irritated the Vatican, which saw it as interference in the church’s internal affairs for the sake of scoring domestic political points.The Vatican secretary of state, Parolin, said the Holy See was “surprised” by Pompeo’s article. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference, Parolin said the private meetings Pompeo had scheduled at the Vatican would have been the more appropriate setting to express his concerns, Italian news agency ANSA reported.Pompeo started his day Thursday visiting the Rome-based Sant’Egidio Community, a Catholic charity active in caring for refugees in Italy and providing HIV-AIDS care in Africa. Arriving at Sant’Egidio’s headquarters, Pompeo praised the group’s efforts as “the Lord’s work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-meets-with-vatican-after-us-china-tensions-spill-over/story-JlNUeL0SkG4ImlggisOB7N.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says he ‘enjoyed’ debate with Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump says he “enjoyed” debating former Vice President Joe Biden, but he is falsely claiming that Biden is trying to get of the next two debates.Trump spoke at a campaign rally in Duluth, Minnesota, Wednesday.He gloated about the television ratings the debate generated and ignored how contentious and unruly the debate quickly became, in large part thanks to his refusal to adhere to the moderator’s requests and the debate’s rules.He made no mention of the Commission on Presidential Debates’ promise earlier Wednesday to implement “additional structure ... to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues” going forward.Trump suggested Biden was trying to get out of the next two debates, but the vice president’s campaign said earlier Wednesday that the Democratic nominee remained committed to taking part in them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-enjoyed-debate-with-joe-biden/story-nEI6wc2hfQulvi0j6glSyO.html
01-10-2020||World||Hong Kong police enforce ‘Stability’ on a tense National Day||Riot police flooded Hong Kong streets on a tense National Day, a show of force intended to back up leader Carrie Lam’s morning declaration that stability had returned to the Asian financial center.“The plain truth is and it is obvious to see that stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded, and our people can continue to enjoy their basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law,” Lam said Thursday morning after the annual outdoor flag-raising ceremony.With some 6,000 riot police on standby, the display offered a marked contrast from a year ago, when calls for protests forced officials from the special administrative region to take shelter inside.The Oct. 1 holiday marking the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 is the latest test of Hong Kong’s efforts to quash the unrest that helped spark a historic recession last year, even before the coronavirus pandemic. Mass arrests and, in June, the passage of a powerful and controversial security law have helped Hong Kong’s leaders suppress dissenters. Covid control measures that limit the size of public gatherings have also chilled protest action.Earlier this week, an appeals panel upheld a police ban on a protest sought by the Civil Human Rights Front, which last year organized largely peaceful marches that drew more than a million people. Police announced the arrests of five activists this week on allegations that they incited people to attend unlawful gatherings.Some protesters turned out anyway. In the Mong Kok shopping district, a small group chanted the popular slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,” which has been banned by the government for months. Across the harbor in Causeway Bay, police warned protesters taking part in unauthorized assemblies to leave the area. Earlier in the day, veteran activist Leung “Long Hair” Kwok-hung led a small protest near the flag-raising event at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.“We have been fighting for over a year,” a Hong Kong University of Science & Technology student named Tse said. “If people do turn up, they will be there to express their concerns or express their non-compliance to the national security law. Many young people don’t like how the government is treating its people.”Massive protests a year ago undercut President Xi Jinping’s efforts to convey national strength on the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule, as demonstrators clashed with police and one protester was shot by a riot officer. Xi took unprecedented action to impose the security law without local debate, giving authorities the power to jail for life those convicted of crimes including subversion and collusion with foreign powers.The Group of Seven nations denounced the security law as a breach of China’s promise to preserve the financial hub’s autonomy, and the US levelled sanctions against Lam and other top officials. Lam, who has previously complained about how the measures have caused problems with her credit cards, criticized unnamed foreign governments Thursday for “unjustified accusations.”“I and my relevant colleagues will continue to discharge our duty to safeguard national security in accordance with the law without fear or anxiety,” Lam said. She was joined at the ceremony by China’s most senior officials in Hong Kong, including Liaison Office Director Luo Huining and former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who’s now vice chairman of the country’s top political advisory body.Support for several of the protest movement’s goals increased over two months, according to a Reuters/Hong Kong Opinion Research Institute poll released in August. The share in favor of Lam’s resignation rose to 58% and direct elections for her replacement were backed by 63%. Some 51% said they “very much oppose” the national security law.Nick Or, an assistant professor of public policy at the City University of Hong Kong, said the government would be better off trying to resolve the underlying disputes. “The potential social unrest that may happen on Oct. 1 is a manifestation of the fact that the political system in Hong Kong fails to set up an institution to address the demands and grievances in society,” Or said.The plight of a dozen Hong Kong activists ages 16 to 33, who have been held on the mainland since attempting to flee to Taiwan by boat in August was among the concerns protesters wanted to highlight. China approved the arrests of 12 people matching their description on allegations of organizing or participating in an illegal border crossing, according to district prosecutors from the mainland city of Shenzhen in a statement late Wednesday.Those who attend an unauthorized protest are liable for crimes ranging from inciting an unlawful assembly to rioting, a colonial-era charge that carries a sentence of as long as 10 years in prison. Still, thousands of Hong Kong residents defied warnings to return to the streets on Sept. 6, in a show of anger over the government’s decision to postpone the election by a year over the pandemic. Hundreds were arrested.Earlier this week, the Liaison Office warned that “the sword” of the security law was hanging over those who attempt to protest on the holiday. And Luo, the agency’s director, told a National Day event Wednesday that the legislation had saved Hong Kong from falling into “the abyss of color revolution.”“Patriotism isn’t a choice, but an obligation,” Luo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-enforce-stability-on-a-tense-national-day/story-mIh42yiDorWBDuwuVJzY4J.html

01-10-2020||World||American to furlough 19,000 as clock runs out on airlines||American Airlines will begin furloughing 19,000 employees on Thursday after lawmakers and the White House failed to agree on a broad pandemic-relief package that includes more federal aid for airlines.CEO Doug Parker said Wednesday night that if Washington comes up with a deal for USD 25 billion in airline aid “over the next few days,” American will reverse the furloughs and recall the employees.The move by American represents the first — and likely the largest — involuntary jobs cut across the industry in coming days. United Airlines has indicated it could furlough nearly 12,000 workers.Airline employees and executives made 11th-hour appeals this week to Congress and the Trump administration to avert furloughs when a federal prohibition on layoffs — a condition of an earlier round of federal aid — expires Thursday.The passenger airlines and their labor unions are lobbying for taxpayer money to pay workers for six more months, through next March. Their request is tied up in stalled negotiations over a larger pandemic-relief measure.Industry officials acknowledged that prospects were bleak for action before Thursday’s deadline. They said, however, they were cheered that the House this week included airline payroll help in a USD 2.2 trillion relief plan that moved closer to Republicans’ preference for a lower price tag.“It provides a glimmer of hope that something will get done,” said Nicholas Calio, president of the trade group Airlines for America.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday night that the administration wants to help hotels, airlines and schools. He said he was talking with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi but hinted that the White House doesn’t want to go above about USD 1.5 trillion — USD 700 million below the House Democrats’ figure.“I don’t think we’re going to make significant progress” until Thursday, he said on Fox Business.Calio suggested that Thursday might not be a hard deadline — airlines could reverse some furloughs if a deal between the White House and congressional Democrats appeared imminent.“Ideally, if it’s going to go beyond Thursday they will be close to a deal and say, ‘Hang on for a couple days,’ and we can wait,” he said.“Beyond that, the notices have gone and furloughs will go into effect.” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said she still expects action by Congress because majorities in the House and Senate have signaled support for more airline relief.She said a bailout that keeps airline workers employed would be cheaper for the government than putting them on the unemployment line during a pandemic.“These are people who are not going to be able to pay their rent, they are not going to be able to take care of themselves,” Nelson said on CNBC.Beyond American and United, smaller airlines have sent layoff warnings to several thousand employees. Delta and Southwest have shed thousands of jobs through voluntary departures but don’t plan to lay off workers immediately.Airlines have persuaded tens of thousands of employees to take early retirement or severance deals. But even after those offers, the airlines have more pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and other workers than they need.Critics say airlines shouldn’t get special treatment, and that subsidizing their workforces will only delay the companies’ need to adjust to the downturn in travel — which even airline trade groups think will last three or four years.“The airlines are always the first ones begging for support. They get bailed out over and over again,” Veronique de Rugy, a research fellow at George Mason University and columnist for a libertarian magazine, said in a recent interview.“Airlines have a history of not preparing properly for the next emergency because they know they are going to be bailed out.” In March, Congress approved USD 25 billion mostly in grants to cover passenger airline payrolls through September and up to another USD 25 billion in loans that the airlines could use for other purposes.Late Tuesday, the Treasury Department said it completed loans to seven major airlines: American, United, Alaska, JetBlue, Frontier, Hawaiian and SkyWest.American now expects to borrow USD 5.5 billion from the Treasury, and United can get USD 5.17 billion. Airlines have also borrowed billions from private lenders.They could use that money to keep employees — as critics like de Rugy suggest they should — but they are trying to cut spending in case ticket revenue remains severely depressed for a long time.US air travel remains down nearly 70 per cent from a year ago. Signs of a modest recovery faded this summer when Covid-19 cases spiked in many states. Traditionally lucrative business and international travel are even weaker than domestic leisure flying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-to-furlough-19-000-as-clock-runs-out-on-airlines/story-qkiyii5SxRwAAZSGBxt9hP.html

The candidate is currently being tested in a large decisive trial. The race to come up with a vaccine has become a divisive issue for the U.S. presidential election and was of significant importance in the presidential debate on Tuesday between U.S. President Donald Trump and contender Joe Biden.Bancel earlier this month had said he expects the company to file for an Emergency Use Authorization in 2020, which could occur in November or even as early as October depending on interim analysis.Results from an early safety study of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine candidate in older adults on Tuesday showed that it produced virus-neutralizing antibodies at levels similar to those seen in younger adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-covid-19-vaccine-unlikely-to-be-ready-before-us-election-report/story-BX15F0mCu5qrmZw6ioDChL.html
01-10-2020||World||Canada’s long wait ends as Trudeau government okays Covid-19 rapid test kits||After days of criticism over delays, the Canadian government has finally approved rapid test kits for the coronavirus disease.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the first batch of the kits made by an American manufacturer will arrive in the country “in the coming weeks”, as Health Canada gave its approval for the devices a day after public services and procurement minister Anita Anand announced that 7.9 million units had been bought.These decisions come even as some Canadian provinces, including two of the largest, Ontario and Quebec, witnessed record highs in new Covid-19 cases as the second wave sets in. Confirmed cases in the country have surpassed 158,400 as authorities have warned of community transmission of the deadly virus. The daily increase in infections has been 1,672, a rise of nearly 90% over that recorded a fortnight earlier. However, there have been far fewer fatalities when compared to the conditions prevailing in March and April, with only six confirmed to have died on Wednesday.The situation in the two provinces worst-hit by the pandemic, Ontario and Quebec, is grim. Francois Legault, Quebec premier, described it as “critical” as he announced a “red alert level” for three regions, including the province’s two largest municipalities, Montreal and Quebec City. Coming into effect on Thursday, many establishments that were allowed to reopen, including bars, restaurants and cinemas, will be forced to close down for a month.Ontario, meanwhile, recorded its highest single-day increase in new coronavirus cases on Monday, at 700, as part of a trend of numbers rising steeply over the last week.The surge in numbers has impacted public health infrastructure, particularly in relation to testing, as people queued up for hours for Covid-19 tests with results taking days to become available. Under pressure, the Trudeau government announced the procurement of molecular devices from Abbott Laboratories on Tuesday. Results are expected to be delivered within minutes after a swab specimen is taken from the throat or nose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-long-wait-ends-as-trudeau-government-okays-covid-19-rapid-test-kits/story-ZzhLpm6wIcQo98L0K7IJpO.html
01-10-2020||World||Canada’s population sees record low growth due to sharp decline in migration||Canada has seen record low growth in its population in the second quarter of the year, mainly due to a fall in migration to the country due to travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. A key highlight of the trend is that the number of Indians arriving in Canada as permanent residents (PRs) this year is set to number less than half the total for 2019.According to the country’s data agency Statistics Canada or StatCan, there was just a 0.1% increase in population between April and June, which is a record low. StatCan said in a release, “International migration is the main driver of population growth in Canada, accounting for 81.9% of growth in 2019-2020. Therefore, the restrictions placed on international borders and the subsequent drop in international migration levels had the largest impact on population growth in 2019-2020.”Coronavirus-related curbs have markedly affected Indians moving to Canada; they have comprised the largest source group for the country’s PRs in recent years. According to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Indian-origin PRs in 2019 were at a peak of 85,590, up from 69,980 the previous year. The category saw the numbers rise during the first quarter of the year, growing from 15,595 to 16,660. However, as Covid-19 restrictions came into place, there was a sharp drop in PRs in the country, falling from 23,825 for the second quarter of 2019 to only 9,945 for the same period this year. In total, just 29,800 Indians became Canadian PRs till the end of July this year, a pace that indicates the total will be below half of that for 2019.This is in sharp contrast to the situation last year. StatCan noted that the July-October quarter of 2019 had seen the numbers reach 208,659, growing by 0.6%. It said it was the “highest level of growth for a quarter since comparable record keeping began in July 1971”. However, “the global pandemic began to affect the demographic patterns in Canada at the end of the first quarter of 2020”, StatCan said, after Canada recorded its first Covid-19 death on March 9 and curbs, including those on international travel, came into effect about a week later. Canada had targeted accepting more than 300,000 new PRs each year. The pandemic could possibly make the government wind down those numbers in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-population-sees-record-low-growth-due-to-sharp-decline-in-migration/story-PESISYLMPGxBSZtovX82rJ.html
01-10-2020||World||US isn’t yet keen on formalising Quad, says state department official||Ahead of an upcoming ministerial meeting of the Quad - as a consultative group comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia calls itself - a senior US state department official dismissed talk of formalising the association, saying America wanted to strengthen existing regional architectures, not create new ones. The meeting is scheduled for October 6.The official also said, addressing a wide range of India-US issues, that human rights organisation Amnesty International’s decision to shut down its India operations had “received attention at the highest levels” of the Trump administration and it was being followed “very, very closely” by members of US congress.The official reiterated the US call for India and China to settle their border dispute using “their existing bilateral channels… and not resort to military force”.The official addressed the “situation” around Amnesty International shutting down its India operations on Tuesday, in response to a question. “We’ve been very, very closely following this issue, not just in the administration, but I know that our members of congress have (been following) as well” the official said, adding, “It has received attention at the highest levels of our government.”Speculation about formalising the four-country consultative group known as the Quad received a boost in September when a senior state department official, Steven Biegun, was seen to be signaling a US willingness to explore the possibility of growing the Quad into a Nato-like formally organised group.The US state department official said Biegun’s speech was a misinterpretation of what “he actually said (and) what it was the analysts believed he was getting at”.“The United States is building new and stronger bonds with the nations that share our values across the Indo-Pacific region,” the official said. “India, Australia and Japan are the main three (countries) that we have gotten together on the Quad. And these relationships flow from the spirit of respect to inclusivity and partnership, not domination. We all have our own Indo-Pacific strategies and approaches, and we share a complimentary vision of a free and open region that’s committed to a rules-based order and respect for international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes.”Sameer Lalwani, a South Asia expert with the think tank Stimson Center, said, “I don’t see these propositions as mutually exclusive - you can build new infrastructure on top of existing regional architecture to reinforce rather than displace it. “Deputy secretary Biegun even seemed to allude to that in his remarks a month ago. Gradually elevating the Quad from a grouping of consultations to expressed commitments to coordinated capabilities and actions can be additive, bolstering that regional architecture and deterring challenges to that order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-isn-t-yet-keen-on-formalising-quad-says-state-department-official/story-FvSaDVkhS9ggjwtixzbm3O.html
01-10-2020||World||US court approves $800 million settlement in Las Vegas mass shooting||A US court on Wednesday approved an $800 million settlement for victims of America’s worst mass shooting -- a rampage that left 58 dead and more than 800 wounded in Las Vegas.In the October 2017 massacre, a man named Stephen Paddock opened fire with high-powered rifles from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, unleashing more than 1,000 rounds as he mowed down people among a crowd attending an outdoor country music festival.MGM Resorts International, the casino’s owner, will pay $49 million “of its own funds” while the remainder is to come from its insurers, the court order stated.The order said there had been “near-unanimous participation in the settlement” among thousands of potential claimants including victims and their families.“We are grateful that the decision brings families, victims and the community closer to closure,” MGM said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday.“It is especially meaningful that the decision comes one day before the third anniversary of the incident, a time of great sadness and reflection.”An earlier statement said the settlement does not amount to an admission of liability by MGM Resorts.MGM was sued by victims on grounds of negligence for allowing Paddock to stockpile a huge amount guns and ammunition in his hotel room without being noticed. Twenty-four guns were found in Paddock’s hotel room including 10 AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, most of which were equipped with 100-round magazines.In 2018 MGM Resorts launched a counter-suit aimed at forcing the plaintiffs to drop their suits on grounds that it is not liable.An outline of the settlement was first announced last October, with MGM saying in a statement that “prolonged litigation around these matters is in no one’s best interest.”- ‘Unique and tragic’ -In her order Wednesday, Clark County District Court Judge Linda Bell noted “the extraordinary work and effort by counsel in this case to achieve the maximum amount available to claimants... despite having an immensely difficult, unique, and tragic set of circumstances.”At just after 10:00 pm on a balmy Sunday, Paddock opened fire on the 22,000-strong crowd below his hotel room listening to country singer Jason Aldean.The shooting went on for 10 minutes, sending the crowd into panic. Paddock was later found dead in his hotel room with a self-inflicted gunshot. Paddock left no message behind, and his family and girlfriend could not offer any explanation for what evidence later showed was long in the planning.In August 2018 authorities ended their probe of the shooting without learning Paddock’s motive. An FBI report said the gunman may have been seeking a “certain degree of infamy.”Eighteen more guns were recovered from Paddock’s residence in Mesquite, Nevada and another seven from his home in Reno.A heavy gambler, Paddock was known to wager tens of thousands of dollars at a time and had lost a great deal of money in the years leading up to the attack, according to a Las Vegas police report.amz/bfmMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-approves-800-million-settlement-in-las-vegas-mass-shooting/story-mQzbGHq2zhAPk5wg89gV0M.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to cut 2021 refugee admission to 15,000||President Donald Trump is planning to cut refugee admissions by 3,000 to 15,000 in 2021, submitting his proposal to Congress less than an hour before the deadline for the fiscal year’s figure was to expire, the administration announced late Wednesday.The 40-year-old resettlement program has been dwindling under his administration and the 2021 figure will continue to shrink it. The 2021 figure is a 16% reduction over 2020’s admissions.The 1980 Refugee Act requires presidents to issue their determination by Oct. 1 for the next fiscal year. The president also must consult with Congress before making his determination, though ultimately it is up to him.Trump froze refugee admissions in March amid the coronavirus pandemic, citing a need to protect American jobs as fallout from the coronavirus crashed the economy.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration is committed to the country’s history of leading the world in providing a safe place for refugees.“We continue to be the single greatest contributor to the relief of humanitarian crisis all around the world, and we will continue to do so,” Pompeo told reporters in Rome on the sidelines of a conference on religious freedom organized by the U.S. Embassy. “Certainly so long as President Trump is in office, I can promise you this administration is deeply committed to that.”But advocates say the government’s actions do not show that. Since taking office, Trump has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country by more than 80%, reflecting his broader efforts to drastically reduce both legal and illegal immigration.The U.S. allowed in just over 10,800 refugees — a little more than half of the 18,000 cap set by Trump for 2020 — before the State Department suspended the program because of the coronavirus.The 18,000 cap was already the lowest in the history of the program. In addition, the State Department announced last week that it would no longer provide some statistical information on refugee resettlement, sparking more concerns.Advocates say the Trump administration is dismantling a program that has long enjoyed bipartisan support and has been considered a model for protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.Scores of resettlement offices have closed because of the drop in federal funding, which is tied to the number of refugees placed in the U.S.And the damage is reverberating beyond American borders as other countries close their doors to refugees as well.“We’re talking about tens of millions of desperate families with no place to go and having no hope for protection in the near term,” said Krish Vignarajah, president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a federally funded agency charged with resettling refugees in the United States.Bisrat Sibhatu, an Eritrean refugee, does not want to think about the possibility of another year passing without reuniting with his wife.For the past 2 1/2 years, he has called the caseworker who helped him resettle in Milwaukee every two weeks to inquire about the status of his wife’s refugee case.The answer is always the same — nothing to report.“My wife is always asking me: ‘Is there news?’“ said Sibhatu, who talks to her daily over a messaging app. “It’s very tough. How would you feel if you were separated from your husband? It’s not easy. I don’t know what to say to her.”He said the couple fled Eritrea’s authoritarian government and went to neighboring Ethiopia, which hosts more than 170,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum-seekers. Between 2017 and 2019, his wife, Ruta, was interviewed, vetted and approved to be admitted to the United States as a refugee. Then everything came to a halt.Sibhatu, who works as a machine operator at a spa factory, sends her about $500 every month to cover her living expenses in Ethiopia.“I worry about her, about her life,” Sibhatu said, noting Ethiopia’s spiraling violence and the pandemic. “But there is nothing we can do.”He hopes his wife will be among the refugees who make it to the United States in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-cut-2021-refugee-admission-to-15-000/story-ba0X3OJ9QktbCLxkYQfCpJ.html
01-10-2020||World||US Senate approves bill to avoid govt shutdown, sends it to president Trump||By a sweeping bipartisan vote Wednesday, the Senate sent President Trump a bill to fund the government through Dec. 11, averting the possibility of a government shutdown when the new fiscal year starts Thursday.Trump is expected to sign the measure before Wednesday’s midnight deadline. The temporary extension will set the stage for a lame-duck session of Congress later this year, where the agenda will be largely determined by the outcome of the presidential election.The measure would keep the government running through Dec. 11 and passed by a 84-10 vote. The House passed the bill last week.The stopgap spending bill is required because the GOP-controlled Senate has not acted on any of the 12 annual spending bills that fund the 30% of the government’s budget that is passed by Congress each year. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November, it’s likely that another stopgap measure would fund the government into next year and that the next administration and Congress would deal with the leftover business.The measure is the bare minimum accomplishment for Capitol Hill’s powerful Appropriations committees, who pride themselves on their deal-making abilities despite gridlock in other corners of Congress.The legislation — called a continuing resolution, or CR, in Washington-speak — would keep every federal agency running at current funding levels through Dec. 11, which will keep the government afloat past an election that could reshuffle Washington’s balance of power.The measure also extends many programs whose funding or authorizations lapse on Sept. 30, including the federal flood insurance program, highway and transit programs, and a long set of extensions of various health programs, such as a provision to prevent Medicaid cuts to hospitals that serve many poor people.It also finances the possible transition to a new administration if Biden wins the White House and would stave off an unwelcome Covid-caused increase in Medicare Part B premiums for outpatient doctor visits.Farm interests won language that would permit Trump’s farm bailout to continue without fear of interruption. In exchange, House Democrats won $8 billion in food aid for the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-approves-bill-to-avoid-govt-shutdown-sends-it-to-president-trump/story-GCAbNMKbvDGHf4ZQgXEM8I.html
01-10-2020||World||How the FBI became a target of Russian disinformation | Opinion||Almost a year ago, a former Russia specialist on the National Security Council warned Congress about Russia’s nefarious intentions in American politics. The goal of the Russians in 2016, Fiona Hill told the House Intelligence Committee, was to put whoever became president “under a cloud.”Not only did the Russians succeed — it was overcast before President Donald Trump even took office — but they also managed to damage the credibility and reputation of the very agency that is supposed to protect against foreign interference in U.S. elections: the Federal Bureau of Investigation.In her testimony last year, Hill warned that the opposition research commissioned by the Democratic Party against Trump and later used by the FBI to obtain a surveillance warrant against a campaign official named Carter Page would be a “perfect opportunity” for the Kremlin to inject disinformation into American political discourse. On Friday, the Justice Department declassified documents that show the FBI investigated the primary source of the dossier for being a Russian agent.One of those documents is a summary of the bureau’s investigation into a researcher at the Brookings Institution in 2009 and 2010. It says that in late 2008 he approached other researchers there who were joining the incoming administration of Barack Obama and asked if they wanted to make “a little extra money” once they were in their new positions and had access to classified information. The FBI later learned that in 2006 the primary source had contacts with “known Russian intelligence officers” at the Russian embassy in Washington.In 2010, the FBI closed its investigation because the primary source “had apparently left the United States.” But the bureau left open the prospect of reopening the probe if the primary source ever returned to the U.S.These facts alone are not dispositive. The former British spy who compiled the opposition research dossier on Trump’s campaign, Christopher Steele, has said that he is able to distinguish between real and fake information. It’s also possible that his source, the former Brookings Institution researcher, was acting as a kind of double agent.That said, “much of the material” in Steele’s reporting could not be corroborated, wrote Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz in his scathing 2019 report. “The limited information that was corroborated related to time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available,” he said. When the Justice Department declassified the three-day interview with Steele’s primary source, it showed that he had disavowed much of the information in Steele’s dossier.There were other signs that Steele was being played. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe informed the Senate Judiciary Committee this week that the U.S. government received a report that Russian intelligence surmised in July 2016 that “Hillary Clinton had approved a campaign plan to stir up a scandal against U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians’ hacking of the Democratic National Committee.” Ratcliffe says the intelligence community “does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.”Nonetheless, it was important enough for then-CIA director John Brennan to brief the president about it, according to Ratcliffe, and for U.S. intelligence officials to forward an investigation referral to the FBI in September 2016. Earlier this year, the intelligence community declassified a series of footnotes to the Horowitz report that showed other U.S. intelligence officers had warned that Steele’s dossier may contain Russian disinformation.One might expect the FBI’s leadership to be deeply embarrassed about all of this. People such as former FBI Director James Comey have been warning for years about the danger of Russia’s disinformation campaign against the public. The 2017 intelligence community assessment of Russia’s interference in the election of the previous year includes an entire section on Russia’s English-language propaganda station, RT.But in a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said he had no recollection that Steele’s primary source had been investigated for being a Russian spy or that U.S. intelligence officers referred the intelligence on Russia’s assessment of Clinton’s campaign strategy to the FBI.None of this is to say that the FBI was colluding with Russia. Rather, it suggests that in their panic over the possibility of a Trump victory in 2016, FBI leaders — much like many cable news networks — embraced shoddy and now discredited intelligence to make a case against his campaign. The signs were there that Steele’s research was bunk, but the bureau ignored them.None of this information gets Trump off the hook, either. He has aided and abetted Russian disinformation by repeatedly denying that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. This gives the Russians cover and encouragement to do it all over again this year, which is exactly what the intelligence community has been warning about.In this respect, Trump himself, like the FBI, is a victim of Russian disinformation.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Eli Lake is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering national security and foreign policy.

01-10-2020||World||Biodiversity is life insurance for humans: French President Emmanuel Macron||French President Emmanuel Macron was philosophical on Wednesday in his appeal for global efforts to reverse biodiversity loss, saying it is the life insurance of humans.The “protection of nature” raises the fundamental ethical issue of the “protection of human beings”. Above all, the “protection of biodiversity” is the ‘protection of ecosystems”, he spoke at the UN Biodiversity Summit.“I do not believe that the right of any other living creature is higher than a human right. But I do not believe in the effectiveness of preserving human rights without preserving the ecosystems. For me, this is the philosophical and ethical basis of this battle for biodiversity,” Macron said.Scientists have long been alerting about the risks of new infectious diseases due to deforestation and the poaching of wild species, by showing the links between human, animal and environmental health. The Covid-19 pandemic reminds that biodiversity is the life insurance of humans.“When it is weakened, our health security and our economic security are at stake,” said Macron.He stressed the need to step up the fight against environmental crime, and to put a definitive end to all illegal activities that endanger nature, destroy ecosystems, feed corruption, hinder the development of rule of law and, ultimately undermine the sustainable development of humanity.He called for public investment to enable the transformation. The French recovery plan will devote more than 1 billion euros (1.17 billion US dollars) to biodiversity and the fight against land degradation, he said.“If 2020 is the year of awareness, 2021 must be the year of action,” Macron said.France will mobilize for the adoption of an ambitious new global strategic framework for the protection of biodiversity at next year’s UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China, he said.“Like the Paris Agreement on climate change, we would like this agreement to include quantified and measurable commitments, as well as a clear implementation and accountability mechanism,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biodiversity-is-life-insurance-for-humans-french-president-emmanuel-macron/story-2IvPFohgOq4a214hz4nu5I.html
01-10-2020||World||‘The fire is outflanking us’: California wildfire evacuees return home to find devastation||Nikki and Kevin Conant returned to their home in Northern California wine country Wednesday to find only the charred remains of their home and burned pieces of the wine barrels they used to repurpose into custom-made art and furniture.“It was like a part of me is gone, burned up in the fire. Everything we built here, everything we made here is gone,” Nikki Conant said.The couple, both 52, were preparing to evacuate Sunday when they saw an orange glow in the hills near their Santa Rosa rental home. Within 45 minutes, they could hear the trees crackling and propane tanks exploding as the blaze reached their community. They jumped in their car, and for what seemed like an eternity they were stuck in bumper-to- bumper traffic.“I thought we were going to burn alive. I really did. It was horrible,” Nikki Conant said.Nikki sobbed Wednesday when she spotted her now-burned chicken coop. Her twelve beloved chickens all died in the fire. All the tools for their repurposing business were gone, too.The Conants are among more than 70,000 people still under evacuation orders in the wine region north of San Francisco where the Glass Fire has incinerated at least 80 homes along with winery installations and other buildings.Flames were continuing to tear through the region’s rolling pastures and tree-dotted hills, toppling renowned wineries and restaurants.“Every time we try to construct some control lines, the fire is outflanking us, so we have to pull back,” Cal Fire Chief Mark Brunton said.Firefighters were also warily watching for “violent” winds expected to return to the Napa-Sonoma area late Wednesday, with continuing extreme heat and low humidity. Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger were to continue into Friday evening.Officials said they were requesting more fire crews to join 2,000 firefighters battling the blaze that has charred 76 square miles (197 square kilometers) with almost no containment.Pacific Gas & Electric also cut power to another 3,100 customers in Napa County at the request of firefighters, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported.Hot weather and the potential for fire damage could stress power supplies as people switch on their air conditioners. To avoid shortages, the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s power grid, issued a statewide Flex Alert for 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday. It urged customers to avoid using large appliances during that time and to keep the thermostat at 78 degrees or above.A mid-August heat wave strained the grid to the point where Cal ISO ordered utilities to implement brief rolling blackouts for the first time since 2001.Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas, especially because climate change has made California much drier. A drier California means plants are more flammable.Some Northern Californians say they are getting fed up with the annual evacuations and fire fears and are thinking of leaving. Despite their latest harrowing experience, the Conants said they plan to stay.Their landlord already told them the home will be rebuilt and offered them a trailer to stay at on the land while the house is finished, Nikki Conant said.“This is home,” she said, referring to the Santa Rosa area. “I was born and raised here, my family is here. I don’t have the heart to just give up and leave the area.”The massive blazes are also becoming harder to fight. On Wednesday, officials said wind-whipped flames led two firefighters to deploy the emergency fire shelters they carry in case of imminent danger from flamesThe firefighters were assigned to the Glass Fire in Napa County on Sunday when gusty off-shore winds fanned the fire, forcing them to deploy the shelters after flames overwhelmed them. The firefighters covered themselves on the ground with the space blanket-looking devices. They were not injured, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.It’s the third time fire crews have had to deploy their fire shelters this month — a last-resort effort to save their lives that was once uncommon. On Sept. 8, 14 firefighters deployed emergency shelters as flames overtook them and destroyed the fire station they were defending in the Los Padres National Forest. Three firefighters were hospitalized and later released. A day later, a crew fighting a deadly blaze in Butte County was overrun by flames when winds shifted; its members escaped with only minor injuries after deploying emergency shelters.About 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north of wine country, the Zogg Fire, which also erupted during Sunday’s high winds and grew quickly, has killed four people, Shasta County Sheriff Eric Magrini said.A man evacuated with severe burns Sunday died at a hospital of his injuries Tuesday, Magrini said. Three others died Sunday.The deadly blaze that spread to neighboring Tehama County has burned 81 square miles (210 square kilometers) and destroyed 146 buildings, about half of them homes. It was 7% contained.The Glass and Zogg fires are among nearly 30 wildfires burning in California. Fire-related deaths in California this year total 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-fire-is-outflanking-us-california-wildfire-evacuees-return-home-to-find-devastation/story-JdlAfWZq71plbOSzZntyZO.html

The measure will now head to the Senate for consideration.Republican Representative Bill Huizenga said that their party was in “robust agreement” with Democrats about the need to combat forced labour.During the debate on the House floor, Huizenga accused Democrats of pushing through an “empty window dressing bill that hurts US investors and companies but unfortunately simply pays lip service to the Uygurs”.Meanwhile, Democrats said that only US-listed companies should be subjected to heightened scrutiny over forced labour in Xinjiang.Last month, the House of Representatives had passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act to ban imports of products into the US that were made with forced labour in Xinjiang and sanction individuals involved in labour trafficking.The Trump administration announced earlier in September that it will immediately block imports made in Xinjiang to end alleged forced labour practices.Human rights groups have accused the Chinese authorities of detaining more than a million people, mostly Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, in a network of detention centres as part of an assimilation campaign.China has denied the charges, saying the camps were built for vocational and Chinese language training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passes-bill-requiring-firms-to-disclose-connection-with-forced-labour-in-china-s-xinjiang/story-kRyknF92ewYfq9b5vJjI1N.html
01-10-2020||World||12 Democratic governors vow that all votes will be counted||Twelve Democratic governors issued a joint statement on Wednesday defending American democracy, vowing that every valid ballot will be counted in the election after President Donald Trump sowed distrust during the first presidential debate.Donald Trump claimed without evidence Tuesday night that mail voting — surging in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic — is ripe for fraud, and he refused to say whether he would accept the results. He also called on his backers to scrutinize voting procedures at the polls, which critics said could cross into voter intimidation.Without mentioning Trump by name, the governors noted his refusal last week to commit to a peaceful transition of power.“Any efforts to throw out ballots or refuse a peaceful transfer of power are nothing less than an assault on democracy,” they wrote. “There is absolutely no excuse for promoting the intimidation or harassment of voters. These are all blatant attempts to deny our constituents the right to have their voices heard, as guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, and to know the will of the people will be carried out.”Signing the statement were Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Ralph Northam of Virginia, Jay Inslee of Washington, Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Tim Walz of Minnesota, Kate Brown of Oregon, Steve Sisolak of Nevada, Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and John Carney of Delaware.The governors said all valid ballots cast in accordance with state and local laws must be counted and if Trump loses, “he must leave office — period.”They wrote that elections are not “an exercise in controlling power” and that disenfranchising voters “strikes at the very heart” of democracy.“We call on elected leaders at all levels, from both parties, to speak out loudly against such efforts in the weeks ahead,” they said.Trump campaign spokesperson Thea McDonald accused Democrats of “working to shred election integrity rules across the country to stack the deck for their lackluster candidate.” Republicans, she said, “are aiming for an election with results all Americans can trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-democratic-governors-vow-that-all-votes-will-be-counted/story-0DPCUNzZcvjEKND9kcckFJ.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says he won US presidential debate||US President Donald Trump has claimed that he won the first presidential debate against his Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Tuesday night.“By every measure, we won the debate easily last night,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday, a day after he and Biden clashed during the first of the three presidential debates in Cleveland, Ohio.Both the camps have declared victory.“I think he (Biden) was very weak. He was whining. We won the debate by almost every poll that I saw. If you look at the various polls. And I looked at about six of them, and we won every one of them,” he said.Responding to questions, Trump said he is looking forward to the other two debates in Florida and Tennessee. “I don’t mind debating him. I hear he wants to get out of the debates. I don’t know. That’s up to him,” he said.Responding to questions on his remark regarding the far-right group Proud Boys should “stand back and stand by,” Trump said he does not know who they are and would let the law enforcement agencies do their work.“I don’t know who the Proud Boys are. I mean, you’ll have to give me a definition, because I really don’t know who they are. I can only say they have to stand down, let law enforcement do their work,” he said.“Law enforcement will do the work more and more. As people see how bad this radical, liberal, Democrat movement is and the law enforcement is going to come back stronger and stronger. But again, I don’t know who Proud Boys are. But whoever they are, they have to stand down. Let law enforcement do their work,” he said.Trump said, “Antifa is a real problem, because the problem is on the left and Biden refuses to talk about it. He refuses to issue the words law and order. And you saw that last night when he choked up. He can’t say the words because he’ll lose the rest of the left. So he’s got to condemn Antifa. Antifa is a very bad group.” Biden, he said, has to say something about Antifa. “It’s not a philosophy. These are people that hit people over the head with baseball bats. He’s got to come out and he’s got to be strong, and he’s got to condemn Antifa. And it’s very important that he does that,” Trump added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-won-us-presidential-debate/story-i8oUN8uHmCEVlvXJot4B6N.html
01-10-2020||World||UK Covid rules may be working, 80,000-person mass survey shows||There are signs that restrictions on social contact such as limiting gatherings to groups of six may be helping slow the spread of Covid-19 across the UK, according to a major study.Researchers from Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI tested more than 80,000 volunteers in England between Sept. 18-26 as part of the country’s largest survey into Covid-19.The results show infections increased substantially across the country and the virus is still spreading, with an estimated one in every 200 people infected. But the “R rate” -- which measures how many people each infected person passes the virus on to -- fell to around 1.1, from 1.7 in late August and early September.“While our latest findings show some early evidence that the growth of new cases may have slowed, suggesting efforts to control the infection are working, the prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date,” said Paul Elliott, director of the program at Imperial College. “This reinforces the need for protective measures to limit the spread of the disease.”In London the prevalence of the disease rose fivefold, to 49 people per 10,000, up from 10. That puts the capital close to the national average.The study was commissioned by the government and full results are due next week, based on samples from 150,000 volunteers.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has introduced a range of measures to combat the disease, including 10 p.m. closing times for all bars and restaurants, and the “rule of six,” under which people must not meet in groups of more than six anywhere, indoors or outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-rules-may-be-working-80-000-person-mass-survey-shows/story-xVzixSfHvQlm3dIEIiCtqN.html
01-10-2020||World||Oxford-Astra Covid vaccine review to start in Europe||European regulators are set to start an accelerated review of a Covid-19 vaccine front-runner from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, in a sign the shot could be the first to seek approval in the region.The European Medicines Agency is expected to announce the “rolling review” as soon as this week, according to the person, who didn’t want to be identified because the decision is still private. Such assessments are used in emergencies to allow regulators to see trial data while the development is ongoing to speed up approvals of drugs and vaccines that are urgently needed.The move would be a key step forward for the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot after trials were halted earlier this month due to concerns about a participant in the U.K. study who became ill. The partners, along with companies such as Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., are sprinting ahead with experimental shots as governments look for a way out of the global crisis.The death toll from the disease exceeded 1 million this week, while the infection rate has rapidly picked up again in Europe.While the British regulator cleared the Oxford-Astra trial to restart less than a week after it was paused and studies in South Africa, Brazil and India have resumed, U.S. authorities have yet to give the go-ahead.Late Wednesday, Reuters reported that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had widened its investigation of the incident that led to the trial halt, citing people familiar with the matter.The EMA’s head of vaccines, Marco Cavaleri, said in July the agency would start rolling reviews of potential candidates after the summer. The approach means that a final approval could be granted a matter of days after the review period ends. Cavaleri said at the time the first approval of a vaccine could come by the end of the year.In a normal environment, drugmakers submit trial data to the regulator for a review that can take many months. Once that’s complete, an opinion is given on whether the product should be authorized for use, which must be signed off by the European Commission.In emergencies like a pandemic, a rolling review avoids delays so that an EMA recommendation and approval from the European Commission can be sought as quickly as possible. The agency started such an evaluation of remdesivir to treat Covid-19 in April, while trials were ongoing, and the drug was given conditional approval three months later.AstraZeneca declined to comment. A spokesperson for the EMA declined to comment on the review.“EMA has always stated that it will communicate the start of a rolling review for Covid-19 treatments or vaccines,” it said in a statement. “We have not made such an announcement for a vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-to-start-in-europe/story-6OxdwMCZz22n2UqbHZQjkO.html
01-10-2020||World||Northern California wildfire death toll rises to 4 as crews scramble to beat winds||The death toll from a wildfire raging in northern California’s Cascade foothills climbed to four on Wednesday as firefighters battling that blaze and another wreaking havoc in wine country near San Francisco braced to confront a new bout of high winds.Diminished winds across northern California assisted fire crews in making some initial headway on Tuesday against both blazes, which have scorched well over 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares) combined since they erupted about 200 miles (320 km) apart on Sunday.On Wednesday, crews fighting the so-called Zogg Fire in Shasta County and a separate blaze dubbed the Glass Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties scrambled to reinforce their control lines and tamp down hotspots while weather remained in their favor.A red-flag warning for heightened wildfire risks, including extreme winds, is due to be reinstated Wednesday evening for areas just north of San Francisco Bay, including the world-class wine-growing regions of Napa and Sonoma counties.Above-normal heat and extremely low humidity has persisted, even after fierce winds that fanned the explosive fires earlier in the week subsided on Tuesday.Authorities were also on guard for a return of high winds in Shasta County, closer to the Oregon border, California Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) officials said.“Now’s the time for our firefighters to buckle down,” Cal Fire Assistant Chief Bill See said during a late-morning update on the Glass Fire. “We’ll be diligently trying to secure the back door on this fire.”He added that the Napa Valley resort town of Calistoga, known for its hot springs, mud baths and wine tasting rooms but under full evacuation since late Monday, was a particular focal point for fire-protection efforts.The Glass Fire has already destroyed 80 homes and 32 other structures, including the mansion-like Chateau Boswell winery and a farmhouse containing storage, bottling and fermentation facilities at the Castello di Amorosa winery, built to resemble a 13th-century Tuscan castle. The castle itself was unscathed.Some 80,000 people have been placed under evacuation orders, including all 5,300 residents of Calistoga.The Zogg fire, burning near the town of Redding, has destroyed at least 146 structures, with some 15,000 structures listed as threatened and 2,200 residents under evacuation orders or advisories.The causes of the two fires are under investigation. Both were fueled by overgrown thickets of tinder-dry grass scrub covering the hilly, rugged terrain in each area.SMOKE-REDUCED VINTAGEThe Glass Fire struck midway through the traditional grape-harvesting season in Napa and Sonoma counties, both world-renowned among California’s wine-producing regions and still reeling from a cluster of large wildfires earlier this summer.The full effect on the region’s wine business remained to be seen. But industry officials said some vintners would likely scale back production of certain wines due to smoke exposure to grapes still on the vines when the fires struck. Several Napa Valley growers said recently they would forgo a 2020 vintage altogether due to smoke contamination of their crop.The blazes marked the latest flashpoints in a destructive spate of wildfires this summer across the U.S. West.California fires have scorched over 3.9 million acres (1.5 million hectares) since January - far exceeding any single year in state history. They have been stoked by increasingly frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme heat, high winds and dry-lightning sieges that scientists attribute to climate change.More than 7,200 homes and other structures have burned statewide this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northern-california-wildfire-death-toll-rises-to-4-as-crews-scramble-to-beat-winds/story-EXHXo67aWsoErgArJuDrmM.html

The Boris Johnson government, he alleged, had not considered the social impact of the pandemic.“Earlier, people used to be out of homes for work. Now, they remain at home 24 hours, which has its own implications. In our community, issues such as domestic and other violence are not spoken of due to ‘izzat’ (honour), but such incidents are on the rise. Drug abuse is also rising,” Sharma said. Sunak has often declared that despite the multi-billion-pounds packages to protect employment, he would not be able to save every job. According to Sharma, Sunak has described as “unviable” jobs in the wedding industry, events and exhibitions, major parts of the night-time economy like nightclubs and pubs, festivals, sports venues and theatres.He said: “We have to act now not just to save some parts of the economy but all the jobs at risk across the country. This country is only as strong as the life choices of thousands around the country who will be left unemployed, so we must act now to protect them.”The Indian community that has historically settled in Southall and nearby areas has recently faced major job losses, including at Heathrow and sectors associated with the airline industry. Former Labour leader and shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: “The chancellor is writing off thousands of businesses and a million workers, dismissing sectors that are shut down as ‘unviable’ and locking them out of government support.” “That means the wedding industry, events, clubs, festivals and arts and sports venues are being labelled unviable simply because they are following public health guidance to help tackle the virus. This is insulting and wrong, and writing these businesses off will damage lives across the country and accelerate the job crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-impact-in-southall-labour-mp-sharma-calls-for-urgent-action/story-AoYOyblT8whSHOkI7kjvIJ.html
01-10-2020||World||Boris Johnson says UK at ‘critical moment’ in Covid-19 fight||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said the UK is at a “critical moment” in its fight to control the spread of coronavirus, as a further 71 deaths took the country’s death toll from the deadly virus to 42,143.Addressing a briefing from 10 Downing Street in London, Johnson struck a sombre note as he called for “collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices” in order to avert another nationwide lockdown, even as he warned that he would not hesitate to impose further restrictions if needed.His warning of a high number of infections and “tragic increase” in deaths came as this week marked the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began, with a further 7,108 infections recorded on Wednesday and the number of patients with Covid-19 on ventilators hitting 312.“These figures show why our plan is so essential. We have to stick to it together and we should stick to it with confidence,” said Johnson.“I know some people think we should give up and let the virus take its course despite the huge loss of life that may entail. I profoundly disagree. I don’t think the British people want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus,” he said, adding that the UK will “get through this”.He was joined by his scientific and medical experts who reiterated that the coronavirus cases were “heading in the wrong direction”.Johnson’s briefing came as the House of Commons passed by 330 votes to 24 an extension to the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which needs parliamentary approval every six months.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to the members of the Parliament that they would be given votes “wherever possible” on any new coronavirus rules before they come into force in future. The assurance comes amid growing disquiet within Johnson’s own Conservative Party over some of the tough and hard to interpret localised lockdown measures being imposed in large parts of the country.In a rare intervention, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle delivered a harsh rebuke on the government for its failure to seek parliamentary approval for these measures.“The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory,” he said. Hoyle warned that he was “now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House and not treat it with the contempt it has shown”.As a result, any further tough lockdown moves are likely to be first tabled for a vote in Commons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-says-uk-at-critical-moment-in-covid-19-fight/story-3rvDliR5n6Llx4DQ8gx2HO.html

Post-mortem would make things more clear,” said a forest official of Angul.This is second such elephant death this week in the state. Earlier on Monday, a female elephant died near Banjhiama village in Dalijoda reserve Forest in Cuttack district. The elephant was allegedly shot on its right leg by poachers and was in critical condition when the locals spotted it. It succumbed to its injuries while undergoing treatment.On Sunday, forest officials had found a carcass of an elephant on the outskirts of Ratakhandi village under Sadar block in Bolangir district.Wildlife activists have been alleging that Odisha has turned out to be a happy hunting ground for elephant poachers. Last month, officials in Koenjhar district seized around 19 kg of elephant tusks from a car and arrested three persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-wildlife-week-carcass-of-tusker-with-bullet-wounds-found-in-odisha/story-LMNxTJ3bfhqpDJKwumACEJ.html
01-10-2020||India||SC nod to govt plan to refund air tickets||New Delhi The saga of airline ticket refunds finally came to an end on Thursday with the Supreme Court signing off on the Central government’s proposal of airlines refunding money within three weeks for air tickets booked during the lockdown, and either within 15 days or through passenger credit till March 31 next year for tickets booked before the lockdown. The move ends months of uncertainty for passengers who saw the flights on which they booked tickets being cancelled on account of the lockdown imposed to fight the coronavirus disease. Scheduled air services restarted in India only on May 25. This formulation, proposed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) after consultation with airlines and travel agents, was largely accepted by all stakeholders, in view of the unprecedented situation created by the pandemic.Accepting the suggestions of the DGCA in entirety, a three-judge bench comprising justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy, and MR Shah said, ‘’Strict enforcement of Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) at this moment (that required immediate refund of tickets) may not yield any meaningful result for any stakeholder. We also feel that such formulations (framed by DGCA and Ministry of Civil Aviation) are workable solutions in these peculiar circumstances which are prevailing in the country.”According to the order, if a passenger booked a ticket during the lockdown (from March 25 to May 24) for domestic or international travel during this period, he/she shall be entitled to full refund (without cancellation charges) to be made by the airline (Indian and foreign carrier) within three weeks from the date of cancellation. In cases where the ticket was booked through a travel agent, this money will be routed to the passenger through the agent. For international travel, the court dealt only with ex-India flights (originating from India) although during the hearing of the petitions, DGCA accepted that the benefit of refund will be available on flights originating outside the country provided the ticket was booked in India.For tickets booked prior to the lockdown period, the court asked airlines to “make all endeavours” to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days beginning Thursday. “If on account of financial distress, any airline(s) are not able to do so, they shall provide credit shell, equal to the amount of fare collected, in the name of passenger when the booking is done either directly or through travel agent, so as to consume the same on or before March 31, 2021,” the order said. The order came on a petition filed by passengers represented through Pravasi Legal Cell and Air Passengers Association. The Federation of Travel Agents filed a separate petition demanding that the “credit shell” should be issued in the name of the agent as in several cases passengers were yet to pay for the tickets. DGCA objected to this suggestion as it recognised only the relationship between an airline and the passenger. The bench resolved the situation by directing that the passenger be free to transfer the shell to any person, including the travel agent. Airlines such as IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir, Vistara and AirAsia were represented in the matter through their respective counsel. While most airlines were satisfied by the DGCA’s formulation, GoAir requested the court to extend the shell period till March 31, 2022 because airlines have been hit hard by the pandemic . The airline cited a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which showed 2020 as the worst year in the history of airlines with net losses of $84.3 billion posing a risk to 32 million jobs worldwide.The bench was not inclined to extend the period. Justice Reddy, writing the judgment for the bench, said, “We are not inclined to accept the same keeping in mind that the passengers who, with the hope of travel, have booked their tickets by spending their own money.”Vistara and AirAsia objected to the interest on the credit. According to DGCA, the airline will pay 0.5% interest from the date of cancellation till June 30 this year and thereafter 0.75% per month till March 31, 2021.Arvind Datar, lawyer for Go Air, responding to the DGCA’s scheme, said, “In two months we have disbursed Rs 40 crore refund and have to repay Rs 266 crore. Our flights are operating at 60% strength, prices have been capped, fuel charges have increased and we have to pay salaries to our workforce. From today, the deadline to make full refund expires in six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-nod-to-govt-plan-to-refund-air-tickets/story-vApaPn8g8SNWHCYDerDEkJ.html
01-10-2020||India||Bhushan files review plea in contempt case||Lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Friday sought a review of the Supreme Court order asking him to deposit a fine of Re 1 in a contempt case for his two tweets against the judiciary.This is Bhushan’s second review petition in the case.On August 31, the Supreme Court had directed Bhushan to pay a fine of Re 1 by September 15, failing which he would face three months of imprisonment and debarment from practicing before the Supreme Court for a period of three years. Bhushan paid the fine on September 14 and filed a review petition challenging the order convicting him of contempt passed by the Court on August 14. In his petition, Bhushan has raised 12 technical grounds urging the court to set aside the verdict. He has said that at no point of time, the three-judge bench indicated to him their intention to debar him from practice. He said that debarring a person from practice was a drastic step to be considered as a “last resort” by the Court.Bhushan further said that his reply was not considered by the bench before passing its order and he was denied an opportunity to lead evidence. Moreover, he said that the punishment in default could never be in excess of what was prescribed under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Section 12 provides for imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs 2000 or both.Bhushan sought permission of the top court to allow him to make oral arguments on his review petition as the practice normally is to decide the review petition in chambers without affording an open court hearing to the petitioner. Bhushan also raised constitutional issues saying that the bench went by his supplementary statement issued to the press which was not part of the contempt proceeding.“The judgment limits criticism to individual cases and puts all criticism of the institution or actions beyond the scope of the right. The above approach to Article 19(1)(a) completely disregards the principle that dissent and the free and fearless exchange of views concerning all matters pertaining to the state of Indian democracy are an especially central purpose of the right. The strength of this proposition is evidently compounded when these matters touch on the judiciary as an institution, in view of its unelected and counter-majoritarian position,” Bhushan’s petition said.In two tweets published by Bhushan in June this year, the lawyer blamed the CJI for keeping the Court closed during the Covid-19 lockdown and accused the judiciary for destroying democracy without a formal Emergency over the past few years. The Court while considering these tweets went on to hold Bhushan guilty of contempt. Further, the Court said that Bhushan “aggravated” the contempt against him by further making “reckless” allegations against past judges and refused to either withdraw the same or offer regret.The judgment had said, “It is not expected of a person who is a part of the system of administration of justice and who owes a duty to the said system, to make such tweets which are capable of shaking the confidence of general public and further making wild allegations in the affidavit thereby further attempting to malign the said institution. Such an act by responsible person who is part of this system cannot be ignored or overlooked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-files-review-plea-in-contempt-case/story-zqBy6vMNybipGwAYZSLj1H.html
01-10-2020||India||NIA court grants bail to Assam peasant leader Akhil Gogoi in anti-CAA protest case||A National Investigation Agency (NIA) special court here on Thursday granted bail to peasant leader Akhil Gogoi in connection with a case related to inciting violence during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) agitation in Assam last year. NIA special judge Pranjal Das granted bail to Gogoi in connection to a case lodged initially in Chabua police station in Dibrugarh district on a surety of Rs 30,000 and other conditions like non-tampering of evidence and avoiding influencing witnesses. But the leader of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), who was arrested in December last year on charges of violence during the anti-CAA stir, will remain in jail as he is yet to get bail in another NIA case lodged in Chandmari in Guwahati. Both cases had later been transferred to the NIA. Gogoi had earlier been granted bail by Gauhati High Court in July in connection with three separate cases slapped against him by Assam Police for allegedly inciting violence during the anti-CAA stir. “The court granted bail to Gogoi in connection with the NIA case filed in Chabua. He was denied bail in connection with the case in Chandmari in August this year. The bail application in that case will come for hearing on October 13,” Santanu Barthakur, counsel for Gogoi, said. Gogoi was arrested at Jorhat on December 12 last year for his role in the protests against CAA, which seeks to fast forward citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Buddhists and Jains from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Three of his associates were arrested a day later. He was later handed over to NIA and a court in Guwahati sent him to 10 days custody of the agency on December 17. He was taken to New Delhi the same day for questioning. Gogoi was brought back to Guwahati on December 25 and has been in judicial custody ever since. The NIA has lodged the cases under several sections of IPC and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPAA) pertaining to criminal conspiracy, sedition, promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc., assertions against national integrity, support to terrorist organization etc. The three associates of Gogoi, who were also arrested in December last year, are already out on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-court-grants-bail-to-assam-peasant-leader-akhil-gogoi-in-anti-caa-protest-case/story-pR8NQLC2WzAyxrRIIz4qbP.html

A medical examination was conducted on the victim on April 21 which concluded that sexual intercourse had taken place.The accused was charged with offence of rape under section 376 of Indian Penal Code and for offences under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.The Rajasthan high court, however, granted bail to the accused on September 3.“High Court mechanically and casually granted bail to the accused without considering the gravity of offence. High Court ought to have considered that if released, he in his capacity as the father of prosecutrix can to influence, intimidate and coerce her and can tamper evidence/witness,” the petition in the Supreme Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-response-from-rajasthan-govt-on-rape-of-minor-girl-by-father/story-pPV22Hk6rAPIXselSYItEI.html

We shall ensure that Telangana would get its rightful share of every drop of water in Godavari and Krishna rivers,” the chief minister said. At a high-level meeting of the irrigation department in Pragati Bhavan, KCR finalised the strategy to be adopted by the state government at the apex council meeting convened by Union Jal Sakthi minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat on October 6. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy would present his state’s arguments at the meeting called to discuss the disputes between the two Telugu states on river water sharing. Asking the officials to put forth powerful arguments supported by all the required data before the apex council meeting, KCR said he would expose the Centre’s inaction in resolving the inter-state water disputes. “Under the AP Reorganisation Act, Telangana should be allocated its water share in the rivers. We wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on June 14, 2014 within two weeks of the formation of Telangana, requesting him to take up water allocation to the state. We had asked for the constitution of a special tribunal under Section (3) of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act 1956 or through the existing tribunal,” he pointed out. The chief minister regretted that even after six years, there was no response for the letter written to the PM. “The Centre is trying to give an impression that it is settling the disputes by calling for apex council meetings. In reality, the Centre is not doing anything,” he said. Stating that he would take the Centre to task at the apex council meeting on October 6, KCR said “there should be absolute clarity on the allocation of water to Telangana.” The chief minister also vowed to give a befitting reply to Andhra Pradesh which, he said, was intentionally creating disputes on the river water sharing. “We shall put forth our arguments so strongly that the AP government will not raise the issues again in future. We shall reject the attempts made to undermine the rights of Telangana people,” KCR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-fight-even-with-god-kcr-on-river-water-dispute-with-andhra/story-htOI9hflDWDD45m9sUrzkL.html

The two countries have been locked in a border row for almost five months, and their armies have made arrangements for a long haul in the Ladakh sector with no resolution to the dispute in sight. Indian and Chinese diplomats held talks on the border standoff on Wednesday with little to show beyond a commitment to implement decisions made at the last round of military talks about maintaining stability along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). The September 21 military talks remained inconclusive, with Indian negotiators firmly demanding comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante as the only approach towards de-escalation, and China asking India to withdraw its soldiers from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to reduce friction. The two sides, however, made some headway. According to a joint statement, released in New Delhi and Beijing on September 22, the two sides agreed to stop sending more troops to the front line and to hold a seventh round of commander-level talks “as soon as possible, take practical measures to properly solve problems on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area.” China’s recent assertion that it abides by the LAC as proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959 has complicated the border row in eastern Ladakh, and called into question Beijing’s intent to restore status quo ante of early April and de-escalate the conflict, officials said. A change of guard is set to take place at the Leh-based 14 Corps, with its current commander Lieutenant General Harinder Singh moving out shortly after completing his one-year term. Singh is heading to Dehradun as the commandant of the Indian Military Academy. Singh will be replaced by Lieutenant General PGK Menon. He was present along with Singh at the September 21 talks. The change of guard will take place around mid-October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seventh-round-of-india-china-military-talks-on-border-row-likely-next-week/story-1DEyccDJrDufi9B6YTqKXM.html

In an 11-page order that relied on reportage of the 19-year-old’s cremation past midnight, the high court said it is taking suo moto cognisance of the case since the alleged incidents which took place after the death of the victim on 29 September leading up to her creation “have shocked our conscience”.Justices Jaspreet Singh and Rajan Roy also summoned the family members of the Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped on the night of September 14 and succumbed to the injuries later, on September 29 in Delhi. The judges ordered the state to ensure that “no coercion, influence or pressure is exerted upon the family members of the deceased in any manner, by anyone”.Also Read: Hathras gang-rape case: BJP lawmaker slams UP cops over 2.30am cremation, says it violates religious beliefsThe court has asked the state government to respond by October 12 when it will hear the officials and the woman’s family. The judges referred to several media reports that echoed the family’s allegations that the UP police had hurriedly completed the cremation of the young woman, allegedly without the consent of her family to underline that a dead person must be respected by the state.Also Read: ‘Media will go, we’ll still be here’: Top official on visit to Hathras family“The State must respect a dead person by allowing the body of the person to be treated with dignity and unless it is required for the purposes of establishing a crime to ascertain the cause of death and be subjected to postmortem or for any scientific investigation, medical education or to save the life of another person in accordance with law, the preservation of the dead body and disposal in accordance with human dignity,” it observed.“We are inclined to examine as to whether there has been gross violation of the fundamental rights of the deceased victim and the family members of the victim; whether the State Authorities have acted oppressively high handedly and illegally to violate such rights,” the court said.If the reports are true, then it will be a case of “gross violation of basic human and fundamental rights,” the court noted.“Death must be so beautiful...To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace,” the court said recalling Oscar wilde. “But in this case, the victim was treated with extreme brutality by the perpetrators of the crime and what is alleged to have happened thereafter, if true, amount to perpetuating the misery of the family and rubbing salt in their wounds,” it said.After the incident led to a nationwide outrage, Uttar Pradesh assistant director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar denied that the body was cremated without the family’s consent. “They were present during the funeral. The body was putrefying. The victim died yesterday in Delhi.

It is reprehensible for those who are supposed to uphold the law to trample upon the democratic values in such a manner,” he tweeted.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M K Stalin said that the incident showed the extent of “atrocities and injustices” faced by citizens under a “ruthless government”.“I strongly condemn #Hathras & #Balrampur rape cases which show the extent of atrocities & injustices faced by citizens under such a ruthless & cruel govt. If @RahulGandhi can be manhandled for seeking #JusticeForIndiasDaughters what protects the common man from @myogiadityanath?,” Stalin tweeted.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor shared photos of the scuffle between UP Police and Rahul Gandhi on his Twitter handle, and said that Opposition presence was being termed as “politicisation”. Earlier in the day, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had urged the opposition to not increase the tension through “political tourism”. “Godi media terms opposition presence as politicisation: how low will they bend to serve their masters’ agenda? The role of Opposition is to stand up for the victims of a Govt which lets lawlessness run rife, denies any form of justice to the family & tries to cremate the truth,” Tharoor tweeted.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan slammed the UP Police for preventing Rahul Gandhi from visiting the victim’s family, calling the move “anti-democratic”.“Rahul Gandhi has every democratic right to go to Hathras. There is also constitutional freedom. The move to eliminate it all is ultimately anti-democratic. This cannot be allowed in a democratic society. The police assault on Rahul Gandhi is a reprehensible act,” said Vijayan in an official statement.The 19-year-old gangrape victim had succumbed to her injuries in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-democratic-opposition-slams-reckless-up-police-for-detaining-rahul-gandhi/story-Bfzm1ul4sQFCDoJvYXEOZJ.html

While the assembly polls are scheduled for November 3, the election for the four seats in Vidhana Parishat will be held on October 28.Kumaraswamy in a series of tweets said “Who came to the door of Deve Gowda (national President of JDS) seeking alliance in 2018? We never went to the Congress’ doorstep. Congress is not a party worthy of allying.” The JDS leader went on to write, “Apart from toppling my coalition government, they even lured BSP MLAs who were supporting its government in Rajasthan and are daily destabilising the government in Maharashtra clearly showing they are unworthy of being allied with.”Saying that since Congress does not accept “coalition dharma” Kumaraswamy said there was no question of aligning with it in the future. He also said “let not some Congress leaders misuse Deve Gowda’s and JDS’ name in the guise of forming a coalition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-not-a-reliable-ally-no-tie-up-in-future-says-h-d-kumaraswamy/story-7eUurB8ojcoUM0cMW6uWTN.html
01-10-2020||India||India, Myanmar working to operationalise Sittwe port in early 2021||India and Myanmar are working to operationalise Sittwe port by the first quarter of 2021 while the tendering process for 69 bridges for the trilateral highway involving Thailand will begin soon, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday. Shringla made the remarks while co-chairing the India-Myanmar foreign office consultations with permanent secretary U Soe Han. India’s assistance to Myanmar currently stands at $1.4 billion, and New Delhi will provide debt service relief under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative to Myanmar from May to December to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Despite the challenges caused by the Covid pandemic, we are working towards operationalising the Sittwe port by the first quarter of next year. With respect to the 69 bridges on the trilateral highway, I am happy to inform you that we will soon be moving forward with the tendering process,” Shringla said. Sittwe port is part of the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project, which is crucial to India’s plans for the landlocked northeastern states to access the Bay of Bengal through Mizoram and to provide alternative connectivity to Kolkata without having to use the circuitous Siliguri corridor. Once the port is operationalised through a private operator, Indian goods can be taken via the Aizawl-Zorinpui-Palletwa axis to Kaladan river, and then transferred to Sittwe port. The India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway has been held up due to problems associated with the stretch in Myanmar and the construction of the bridges is expected to speed up work on the project. Shringla described security cooperation between the two countries as robust and said both sides were sensitive to each other’s security concerns. Myanmar’s handing over of 22 Indian insurgents was “deeply appreciated” by India as it sent a “strong message of deterrence to inimical elements on both sides”, he said. He requested Myanmar for the early conclusion of an extradition treaty, a mutual legal assistance treaty on civil and commercial matters, and an agreement on the transfer of sentenced persons. As part of defence cooperation, an Indian team for deployment of meteorological squadrons will travel to Myanmar this month, and India will receive Myanmar’s representative at its maritime Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean. Shringla also assured the Myanmar side that India is committed to sharing its capabilities for a Covid-19 vaccine with its strategic partners. The two sides also discussed ways to mitigate the pandemic’s impact, including supply of medicines, equipment and technology. The consultations, which were held virtually, reviewed overall bilateral ties, including border cooperation and upgrade of border infrastructure, the status of India’s development projects, trade and investment, and cultural cooperation, including the restoration of earthquake-damaged pagodas in Bagan. With the Joint Trade Committee’s next ministerial meeting to be held on October 20, Shringla said India is also looking forward to enhancing cooperation in the energy sector. Myanmar, with an energy portfolio of more than $1.2 billion, is the largest destination for Indian investments in oil and gas in Southeast Asia.

01-10-2020||India||Telangana records 50% excess rainfall this monsoon season||Telangana has recorded a 50 per cent increase in the average rainfall in this year’s south-west monsoon season which concluded on Wednesday.According to the official figures obtained from the state agriculture department, the state received an average rainfall of 1078.30 mm as on Wednesday, as against the normal rainfall of 720.4 mm since the monsoon entered the state in the second week of June. This accounts for an increase of around 50 per cent.However, Hyderabad meteorological department has projected that the state received 45 per cent excess rainfall this rainfall season. The average rainfall as on September 30 was 1,102 mm as against the normal rainfall of 759.6 mm – an excess of 45 per cent.“The IMD calculates rainfall season from June 1 to September 30, whereas the agriculture department takes into consideration the south-west monsoon, which enters the state a bit late,” Hyderabad meteorological department’s weather expert B Raja Rao said.He said this year’s rainfall was the highest in the last 10 years. “Last time the state received such a heavy rainfall was in 2010, when it was 33.5 per cent more than the normal rainfall. We only take into consideration the last 10 years’ data. So, compared to the previous decade, too, this year’s rainfall could be the highest,” Rao said.While Mulugu district received the highest rainfall of 1916 mm, Nalgonda received the lowest rainfall of 636 mm. Out of 33 districts, as many as 27 districts received an excess rainfall of 20 per cent or more.The IMD weather expert attributed this abnormal increase in the rainfall this season to frequent low-pressures in Bay of Bengal. “There was one low-pressure each in June and July and as many as five in August and two in September, that caused heavy rains in the state,” he said.Adding to this phenomenon, there were formation of vertical wind shears over some areas that resulted in excess rainfall in several places. “For the first time after many years, there was an excess rainfall of 50-80 per cent in south Telangana and Rayalaseema of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. In fact, there was an excess rainfall of 84 per cent in Anantapur, which is considered to be a perennially drought-hit area,” Rao said.He said the impact of south-west monsoon in the state will continue for some more days, before it starts retreating. So, rains will continue for some more days, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-records-50-excess-rainfall-this-monsoon-season/story-rq9XgI4NzPE4z3i3dEo0TL.html
01-10-2020||India||‘Media will go, we’ll still be here’: Top official on visit to Hathras family||The family of the Uttar Pradesh’s Dalit woman, who died days after being gang-raped and tortured in Hathras, has alleged being made to feel the “pressure” from a senior district official who visited them today. A 22-second video of the Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar speaking to the family in a courtyard has been widely shared online.The video shows Kumar telling the father of the woman that the media will go away in a day or two and that he should stick to his statement.“These media persons are not here to stay. Half would go today and the remaining will move away tomorrow and only few will remain. It is we who would stand with you and thus it is your wish if you want to change your statements or not. Do not harm your credibility, else we might also change…,” says the district magistrate in the video, before it ends abruptly.There is another video in which a woman from the victim’s family is seen blaming the district administration for putting pressure on the victim’s father.Repeated efforts were made to obtain the district magistrate’s version on this issue, but he did not take the call.When asked, Aligarh divisional commissioner GS Priyadarshi indicated he was not aware of the content of the video. “I can react once I come across the content of the said video,” Priyadarshi said. A senior Uttar Pradesh police officer said today the forensic report has revealed that the woman was not raped. Citing a forensic science laboratory (FSL) report, ADG (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar said the cause of her death is an injury on the neck and trauma resulting due to it.“The report of the FSL has come. It says clearly that samples did not have sperm. It makes clear that there was no rape or gang rape,” Kumar said.Last week, Hathras ASP Prakash Kumar had told mediapersons that initially the accused were booked for attempt to murder under Section 307 of the IPC. Later, on receiving more inputs, Section 376-D (gangrape) of the IPC was added to the FIR, he had said.On Wednesday, the family had alleged that the UP police forced the cremation of the woman who was brutally raped by four men. The Yogi Adityanath government has been accused of trying to suppress the collection of additional forensic evidence and prevent the ballooning of protests through the forced cremation.District officials contended that they had consent from the woman’s family, but the manner in which the developments took place raised questions over the conduct of the administration and law enforcement.The woman succumbed to injuries in Delhi on Tuesday and the body was moved later that night to her hometown 200km away. The cremation was carried out at 2.30am amid heavy deployment of police, who stopped locals and the media from approaching the site.“The police have forcibly taken the body and my father along with them for cremation. When my father reached Hathras, he was immediately taken (to the crematorium) by the police,” the woman’s brother was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Hathras DM Praveen Kumar had denied the charges. “The funeral was conducted with the due permission of the father. No one in the family, except a handful, have levelled such charges. Initially, family was not prepared to shift the victim to Delhi for better treatment but later agreed to it,” the DM had told the PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-will-go-we-ll-still-be-here-top-official-on-visit-to-hathras-family/story-FNchqNAjzq3hUaZRouaGIJ.html

01-10-2020||India||Onus on Pakistan for normal neighbourly ties, says India||India on Thursday said the onus is on Pakistan for creating an environment conducive to normal neighbourly relations in an atmosphere free of terrorism and violence. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava made the remarks during a weekly news briefing while answering a question on India’s overall relations with its neighbouring countries. He said India’s position on ties with Pakistan is well-known. “The government has conveyed that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an atmosphere free of terror, hostility and violence. The onus is on Pakistan for creating such an environment,” he said. In recent days, India has held a bilateral summit with Sri Lanka, a meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission with Bangladesh, and foreign office consultations with Myanmar and these engagements were part of the country’s “neighbourhood first” policy, he said. The Indian government is committed to friendly and mutually beneficial relations with neighbours, and its engagements are based on a “consultative, non-reciprocal and outcome-oriented approach”, Srivastava said. India also has a large development cooperation footprint in neighbouring countries, with several projects to promote greater connectivity, improved infrastructure and people-to-people contacts, he added. In response to another question, Srivastava dismissed Pakistan’s criticism of an Indian court’s verdict acquitting all 32 accused in the 1992 Babri mosque demolition case, including senior BJP leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. “India is a mature democracy, where the government and the people abide by the verdicts of the court and show respect for the rule of law. It may be difficult for a system with a coercive apparatus, where people and the courts can be silenced at the will of the establishment, to understand such a democratic ethos,” he said. Srivastava also said India expects Pakistan to ensure the safety and security of the Indian high commission in Islamabad and its personnel following a “staged protest” outside the mission over the recent death of 11 Pakistani Hindus in Rajasthan. He said the Pakistani Hindus, who were in India since September 2015, died after consuming a “toxic substance” and their deaths were reported to the external affairs ministry on August 8. In response to a communication from the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi seeking information on the incident, India had shared an interim response on August 14. This incident was “exploited by the Pakistani establishment to further its own anti-India propaganda”, and a “staged protest was held in Islamabad”, where people who claimed to belong to the Hindu community had gathered outside the Indian mission, he said. “I would say it is the responsibility of the Pakistani authorities to ensure the safety and security of the Indian high commission in Islamabad and its personnel,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-on-pakistan-for-normal-neighbourly-ties-says-india/story-pFFmX7TqBeKZlAu7ZdimTJ.html

Soon, she become an instructor at that same institute. Narrating her journey Tanya said, “Simultaneously, I was doing dance reality shows and started as background dancer in films. It was during one such song-dance stint for the film ‘Lollypop Since 1947’ when its female protagonist and parallel lead were replaced and its producer came to me and offered me the parallel lead in the film and that’s how acting happened.”Her debut film didn’t see light of the day but worked started coming her way. “Next, I got a Shashilal Nayar’s ‘Naagrik’ that awaits release. To keep my finances going, I took up TV and did numerous shows like ‘CID’, ‘Dil Dosti Dance’, a Telugu film that will release on OTT followed by another theatrical ‘Street Light’.

The police said they had the consent of the kin. Opposition parties have slammed the Yogi Adityanath government over the hurried cremation, arguing that it was meant to suppress protests.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi detained on way to Hathras, UP police take him back to DelhiGurjar claimed that a ‘political syndicate’ was at work along with officials to paint the BJP as anti-dalit and the administration’s decision to cremate the woman past midnight was part of this conspiracy.“The entire thing appears to be the handiwork of top officials from Lucknow to Hathras to malign the image of the government. It just cannot happen that such acts that are against the spirit of ‘sanatana dharma’ - of not cremating the dead at night and denying family the right to even lend a shoulder to their daughter’s bier – would be allowed without the consent of senior officials like UP DGP and others,” the lawmaker said in a letter to the governor.

01-10-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi detained on way to Hathras, UP police take him back to Delhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, his sister and party general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders were detained by the police on their way to Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit girl - who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, a fortnight after she was allegedly gang-raped in her village. The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) dubbed the proposed visit of Gandhi siblings to Hathras as “political tourism”. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the criminals will be punished for their barbarism. “The probe teams are carrying out the investigation, but I think there should not be political tourism on the same,” he said.The Gandhis and other Congress leaders were first stopped at Greater Noida on the Yamuna Expressway and later detained when they started walking towards Hathras, around 145 km from Greater Noida.Taken away in a police jeep, the Gandhis were kept in a guest house for sometime before being released and escorted back to Delhi by the UP police. The Congress had claimed that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were arrested by the police and attacked state chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the move.“Shri Rahul Gandhi, Smt Priyanka Gandhi and senior Congress leaders have been arrested by the UP police,” the party said on Twitter.Videos and pictures shared by the Congress showed Rahul Gandhi falling down in the scuffle that ensued when the police tried to stop Congress leaders and supporters from marching towards Hathras near the Jewar toll plaza. The girl was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Priyanka Gandhi also alleged that the police used ‘lathis’ on Congress workers and many of them were wounded in the baton-charge.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi was seen asking the UP police under which law he was being stopped and insisted that he would like to proceed alone towards Hathras to meet the rape victim’s family since Section 144 was imposed. Under this section, assembly of four or more people is prohibited.“Can you tell me under which law can you stop me from marching towards Hathras? I want to go alone to Hathras and on what basis can you arrest me?” he asked, to which police officials replied that he had violated Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) of disobeying orders promulgated by the government during the Covid-19 pandemic.Rahul Gandhi also alleged that in India today only RSS people and Prime Minister Narendra Modi can move around. “In today’s India, only Modi can walk or travel by air. No one else can,” he said.The Congress leader also tweeted, “In times of sorrow, loved ones are not left alone. It is Jungle Raj in UP that meeting a family in mourning also scares the government. Do not be so afraid chief minister.”Priyanka Gandhi said they were repeatedly stopped from going to Hathras. “When we all started our march on foot with Rahul ji, we were repeatedly stopped and lathis rained on us in a barbaric manner. Many workers were injured. But our intention is clear,” she alleged.“The sticks of an egotistical government cannot stop us. I wish these lathis were used by this police while standing in defence of Hathras’s Dalit daughter,” she also tweeted in Hindi.“An arrogant power is demonstrating its power over the dead bodies of innocent girls and it is indulging in injustice, instead of preventing it. Our struggle for women will continue for a safe society and state, where they can live freely and progress,” Priyanka Gandhi said in another tweet.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also posted a video with a tweet showing Rahul Gandhi allegedly being manhandled.“Lala Lajpat Rai had said that every blow of a stick on my body would prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the British Raj. The sticks on Rahul ji and Priyanka ji’s convoy will also prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the Yogi government,” he tweeted in Hindi.Former union finance minister P Chidambaram also alleged that none of the country’s laws seemed to apply to the UP police.“UP police is a law into itself. None of the laws of the country seem to apply to it. What is wrong if the leaders of a political party protest against a gruesome crime and wish to visit the victim’s family?” he asked on Twitter.The Congress has demanded Adityanath’s resignation over the gruesome incident that it said was a “blot” on the society. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said the ‘Nirbhaya of Hathras’ did not die but was killed by a “cruel and insensitive” government and its administration. In a video message, she said the country will speak up against this injustice and not allow the BJP to divide the country and violate the Constitution.Before leaving for Hathras, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over “jungle raj” in Uttar Pradesh. “The atrocities on daughters continue in UP’s jungle raj. They were not given respect when alive and now the dignity has been taken away even in death. The BJP’s slogan of ‘Beti Bachao’ is not to save girls but to hide facts and save power,” he tweeted.Priyanka Gandhi too attacked Adityanath over the increase in incidents of rape in UP. “Hathras-like gruesome incident has happened in Balrampur. The girl’s feet and back was broken. There have been atrocities on girls in Azamgarh, Baghpat and Bulandshahr. There is no limit to UP’s jungle raj. Law and order cannot be implemented through marketing and speeches. This is the time for the chief minister’s accountability. People want answers,” she tweeted in Hindi. But the BJP accused the Congress of politicising the issue and said the Uttar Pradesh government would provide justice in the incident.Without naming the Gandhis, Naqvi said, “Those who are trying to increase the tension through political tourism, should not do that. Everyone is saddened and wants punishment for the culprits. The Uttar Pradesh government is working towards it. You will see the results soon.”In UP, cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh lashed out at the Congress leaders and accused them of politicising the incident. He said the Congress leaders must answer why they haven’t visited Rajasthan where a similar incident of rape has been reported. Singh said the Hathras gang rape will be heard in a fast track court and the UP chief minister has already declared that a special investigation team (SIT) will probe the matter. “It will be made public in a week’s time,” he said, adding the state government has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2,50,000, a house and a job for the family of the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-detained-on-way-to-hathras-up-police-take-him-back-to-delhi/story-5P6cxXkmg6vkb4leInyLnL.html
01-10-2020||India||Kerala HC rejects former bishop’s plea to adjourn his trial in rape case||The Kerala High Court on Thursday rejected a petition of rape accused former bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal to adjourn the trial against him citing a big spurt in coronavirus cases in Kerala.In his plea, he said in view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation his lawyers are finding it difficult to appear before the trial court in Kottayam and hearing can be resumed after two months once the situation normalises. But his plea was opposed by the prosecution saying it was part of his plan to delay the trial. It said when witnesses are facing intense animosity and danger, it will be inappropriate to adjourn the case at this juncture. The prosecution also cited his multiple attempts earlier to delay the trial. The court agreed to the contention of the prosecution and rejected Mulakkal’s plea. Following the rejection of the plea, the trial will continue in the chief judicial magistrate court in Kottayam. The court has posted the next hearing on October 5. Since proceedings are in-camera press has not been allowed to cover the trial. Mulakkal, former head of the Jalandhar Diocese was accused of raping a 44-year-old nun of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation between 2014 and 2016. He was arrested in September 2018, but later released on bail. The rape survivor and fellow nuns who supported her are leading a secluded life in a convent in Kottayam. There were many attempts to evict them but the High Court had intervened and directed police to give protection to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-rejects-former-bishop-s-plea-to-adjourn-his-trial-in-rape-case/story-3kYQ2Qh385OgywvAlCrrJP.html

So, I focused on my music as it plays a big role in de-stressing as music gives internal peace to all.” The singer was in the state capital recently as a panelist at the official meet to discuss upcoming film city in Uttar Pradesh initiated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Talking about what all kept the ‘Kailasa’ singer busy, “During the phase I came out with a motivational song ‘Main hi mera rakshak hoon’ then memoir on suicide ‘Ek jyot hai jagi’ along with the song ‘Atmanirbhar hum, bolo Vande Matram’ and others. Under Sangeet Setu, with Citizen Rights Association (ISRA), I combined three generation (123 singers) of musicians to give a message of peace and strength to the world,” said Kailash. The ‘Teri deewani’ singer collaborated with many organisations for various projects. “Currently I’m also organising musical motivational talks. As I feel when said with music thoughts leave a deeper impact.” Kailash has done some commercial recordings too. “In this tough phase I tried my best to keep crediting salaries of my staff and thankfully I was able to generate it like always. As per live gigs, enquiries have started to pour in and God-willing we will be able to do shows from December onwards. We need live shows as virtual income is too low and most of them have been in collaborations for a cause. Truth is that everyone wants us to sing for free on digital platforms.” He is working on his new album. “We planned to bring it come out by this year but ‘Parmatma ne yeh saal to nigal hi liya’. Probably, by next year we will able to bring out the new album.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/people-want-us-to-sing-for-free-on-digital-platforms-says-kailash-kher/story-9J094MzCcHkwqZbAIjoYbP.html
01-10-2020||India||ED files chargesheet against LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in terror funding case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Muhammad Hafiz Saeed, his deputy Shahid Mehmood, a Dubai-based funds manager Mohammad Kamran and a Delhi-based hawala operator Mohammad Salim in connection with its money laundering probe against outfit’s financial arm Falah-i-Insaniyat (FiF) Foundation. The agency had initiated a money laundering probe against Mohammad Salman and Mohammad Salim, arrested in 2018, on the basis of a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). A statement by ED on Thursday said that Salman was involved in receiving funds from FIF operators through illegally operated hawala channels. FiF is a Pakistan based organisation established by Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the parent organisation of LeT, founded by Hafiz Saeed. FiF was designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations in March 2012. The UN and the Indian agencies have repeatedly claimed that FIF is nothing but a front end organization of JuD & LeT that was formed to evade security and sanctions. India declared FIF as a terrorist organisation under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in August 2016. The ED said that LeT uses FiF to raise funds and build a network for further terror activities. The agency’s probe revealed that funds were re-routed from Pakistan to Dubai and further to India through hawala channels. “Salman was the recipient of funds sent by Kamran and his associates Abdul Aziz Behlim and Arif Gulambashir Dharampuria, in Dubai. Salman used the funds received from abroad for construction of a Masjid at Uttawar, Palwal, Haryana and for the marriages of poor girls in and around the area of village Uttawar,” the ED said. The ED probe revealed Salman received Rs 4.69 crore through FiF and its members. The agency said it has attached three properties of Salman in New Delhi worth Rs 73.12 lakh. He was chargesheeted by the ED earlier this year. Both Salman and Salim are in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-chargesheet-against-let-chief-hafiz-saeed-in-terror-funding-case/story-xvTeOVjCTf6jV3iUh8tfiM.html
01-10-2020||India||Uttarakhand’s Corbett Tiger Reserve gets new tourism zone||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday announced the creation of a new tourism zone in Corbett Tiger Reserve, which will be known as Garjiya Tourism Zone and will be soon opened for visitors. Rawat made this announcement after inaugurating an interpretation centre, Kumaoni canteen and a souvenir shop at Dhangadi Corbett Tiger Reserve on Thursday. Thirty SUVs in the mornings and 30 in the evenings will be allowed to carry tourists in the new zone, which is likely to become functional in November. With the new zone, CTR will soon have eight tourism zones. Rawat said Corbett tiger reserve is the identity of Uttarakhand. “Because of Corbett, Uttarakhand is recognized in India and world over. CTR is famous for its tigers, wildlife, greenery and its biodiversity. Now, this interpretation centre will further increase awareness about different aspects of Corbett, be its history or biodiversity”, he said. Rawat also announced that villages including Chopda, Leti, and Rampur will be made revenue villages Rahul (who goes by his first name), director CTR said they had sent a proposal to chief wildlife warden for developing a new tourist zone in CTR. “The proposal has been approved by chief wildlife warden, paving way for the setting up of the new tourist zone”, he said. “This tourist zone has been developed by combining the forest areas of Bijrani range, Ringora Chaur, Aamdanda beat, Garjiya beat, Bijrani range and Sarpduli range,” he said. Rahul said big grassland, streams and scenic beauty are the main attractions of this zone. “60 Gypsy SUVs will ferry tourists in the mornings and in the evenings. At present the gate of this zone has not been constructed yet. Till a separate gate for Garjiya tourism zone is built, tourists will go for safari from the Bijrani zone gate,” said Rahul. He said the zone will help in reducing the pressure of tourists on the other zones of CTR. “It will also help in increasing the revenue,” he added. Currently CTR has Bijrani, Dhikala, Dhela Durga Devi, Jhirna, Pakhro and Sonanadhi zones for tourism activities. But with the arrival of thousands of tourists every year, there is a lot of pressure on these zones. With the opening of this new Garjiya Tourist Zone, tourists will get to see a new place in CTR and the pressure on other zones will be comparatively reduced, Rahul said. Earlier in the day, Rawat inaugurated around 62 development works worth Rs 119 crore in Haldwani. He also inaugurated BPPI (Bureau of pharma PSUs of India) Jan Aushadhi Kendra. Congress workers staged a protest against the CM and showed black flags to him. Protesters under the leadership of Hemant Sahu, Congress Nainital district unit secretary and Gurpreet Singh Prince, city president of youth Congress were stopped by police. Nearly 50 Congress workers were detained by police and later released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-s-corbett-tiger-reserve-gets-new-tourism-zone/story-PMc36116B8zUnRzGFo3HWI.html
01-10-2020||India||When Gandhi stood trial for sedition||On the occasion of the centennial birth anniversary of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Hindustan Times published a special supplement on October 2, 1969, which had essays by political thinkers, eminent journalists, Gandhians and writers. Fifty years on, we republish a piece from the supplement titled ‘Statement at the great trial of 1922’, which details the events of the year when the Father of the Nation was tried under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code — the sedition charge — for causing disaffection against the colonial government. The first part of this article offers a report of the trial. The second part is Gandhi’s oral submission. Gandhi also read out a written statement in court. The original piece has been edited for brevity:The historical trial of Mahatma Gandhi and Shri Shankarlal Ghelabhai Banker, editor, and printer and publisher respectively of Young India, on charges under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code was held on Saturday, 18th March, 1922, before Mr C. N. Broomfield. J.CS., District and Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad. Also read: MK Gandhi’s South Africa daysJ. T. Strangman, Advocate-General, with Rao Bahadur Girdhartal Uttamram, Public Prosecutor of Ahmedabad, appeared for the Crown. Mr A. C. Wild, Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, was also present. Mahatma Gandhi and Shri Shankarial Banker were undefended. Among the members of the public who were present on the occasion were: Kasturba Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu, Pandit M. M. Malaviya, Shri N. C. Kelkar, Smt J. B. Petit and Smt Anasuyabahen Sarabhai.The Judge, who took his seat at 12 noon, said that there was a slight mistake in the charges framed, which he corrected. The charges were then read out by the Registrar. These charges were of “bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt or exciting or attempting to excite disaffection towards His Majesty’s Government established by law in British India, and thereby committing offences punishable under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code,” the offences being in three articles published in Young India of September 29 and December 15 of 1921 and February 23 of 1922. The offending articles were then read out: The first of them was, “Tampering with Loyalty”; the second, “The Puzzle and its Solution” and the last, “Shaking the Manes.” The Judge said that the law required that the charges should not only be read out but explained. In this case it would not be necessary for him to say much by way of explanation. The charge of each case was that of bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt or exciting or attempting to excite disaffection towards His Majesty’s Government established by law in British India. Both the accused were charged with the three offences under Section 124A, contained in the articles read out, written by Mahatma Gandhi and printed by Shri Banker. The charges having been read out, the Judge called upon the accused to plead to the charges. He asked Gandhiji whether he pleaded guilty or claimed to be tried. Gandhiji said: “I plead guilty to all the charges. I observe that the King’s name has been omitted from the charge, and it has been properly omitted.” The Judge asked Shri Banker the same question and he too readily pleaded guilty. The Judge wished to give his verdict immediately after Gandhiji had pleaded guilty, but Sir Strangman insisted that the procedure should be carried out in full. The Advocate-General requested the Judge to take into account “the occurrences in Bombay, Malabar and Chauri Chaura, leading to rioting and murder.” He admitted, indeed, that ‘ in these articles you find that non-violence is insisted upon as an item of the campaign and of the creed,” but he added “of what value is it to insist on non-violence, if incessantly you preach disaffection towards the Government and hold it up as a treacherous Government and if you openly and deliberately seek to. instigate others to overthrow it?” These were the circumstances which he asked the Judge to take into account in passing sentence on the accused. (...)Court: Mr Gandhi, do you wish to make any statement on the question of sentence? Gandhiji: I would like to make a statement. Court: Could you give me a writing to put it on record? Gandhiji: I shall give it so soon as I finish it.Gandhi then made an oral statement (...) “Before I read this statement I would like to state that I entirely endorse the learned Advocate-General’s remarks in connection with my humble self. I think that he was entirely fair to me in all the statements that he has made, because it is very true and I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the existing system of Government has become almost a passion with me, and the Advocate-General is entirely in the right when he says that my preaching of disaffection did not commence with my connection with Young India but that it commenced much earlier, and in the statement that I am about to read. it will be my painful duty to admit before this court that it commenced much earlier than the period stated by the Advocate-General. It is a painful duty with me but I have to discharge that duty knowing the responsibility that rests upon my shoulders, and I wish to endorse all the blame that the learned Advocate-General has thrown on my shoulders in connection with the Bombay occurrences, Madras occurrences and the Chauri Chaura occurrences. Thinking over these things deeply and sleeping over them night after night, it is impossible for me to dissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chauri Chaura or the mad outrages of Bombay. Also read: Gandhi: The chroniclerHe is quite right when he says that as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair share of experience of this world, I should have known the consequences of every one of my acts. I know them. I knew that I was playing with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the same. I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty, if I did not say what I said here just now. I wanted to avoid violence. Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is also the last article of my creed. But I had to make my choice. I had either to submit to a system which I considered had done an irreparable harm to my country, or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people bursting forth when they understood the truth from my lips. I know that my people have sometimes gone mad. I am deeply sorry for it and I am, therefore, here to submit not to a light penalty but to the highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do not plead any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and cheerfully submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, the Judge, is, as I am going to say in my statement, either to resign your post, or inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and law you are assisting to administer are good for the people. I do not expect that kind of conversion. But by the time I have finished with my statement you will have a glimpse of what is raging within my breast to run this maddest risk which a sane man can run.”He then read out the written statement: “I owe it perhaps to the Indian public and to the public in England, to placate which this prosecution is mainly taken up, that I should explain why from a staunch loyalist and co-operator, I have become an uncompromising disaffectionist and non co-operator. To the court, too, 1 should say why I plead guilty to the charge of promoting disaffection towards the Government established by law in India. My public life began in 1893 in South Africa in troubled weather. My first contact with British authority in that country was not of a happy character. I discovered that as a man and an Indian, I had no rights as a man because I was an Indian. But I was not baffled. I thought that this treatment of Indians was as excrescence upon a system that was intrinsically and mainly good. I gave the Government my voluntary and hearty co-operation, criticising it freely where I felt it was faulty but never wishing its destruction. Consequently, when the existence of the Empire was threatened in 1899 by the Boer challenge, I offered my services to it, raised a volunteer ambulance corps and served at several actions that took place for the relief of Ladysmith (...) The first shock came in the shape of the Rowlatt Act, a law designed to rob the people of all real freedom. I felt called upon to lead an intensive agitation against it. Then followed the Punjab horrors beginning with the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and culminating in crawling orders, public floggings and other indescribable humiliations. I discovered too that the plighted word of the Prime Minister to the Musalmans of India regarding the integrity of Turkey and the holy places of Islam was not likely to be fulfilled. But in spite of the forebodings and the grave warnings of friends, at the Amritsar Congress in 1919, I fought for cooperation and working of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, hoping that the Prime Minister would redeem his promise to the Indian Musalmans, that the Punjab wound would be healed, and that the reforms, inadequate and unsatisfactory though they were, marked a new era of hope in the life of India. But all that hope was shattered.” (...)In fact I believe that I have rendered a service to India and England by showing in non-cooperation the way out of the unnatural state in which both are living. In my opinion non cooperation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation with good. But in the past non co-operation has been deliberately expressed in violence to the evil doer. I am endeavoring to show to my countrymen that violent non-cooperation only multiplies evil and that an evil can only be sustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abstention from violence. Non violence implies voluntary submission to the penalty for non-cooperation with evil. I am here therefore to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you the judge and the assessors is either to resign your posts and thus dissociate yourself from evil. If you feel that the law you are called upon to administer is an evil and that in reality I am innocent or to inflict on me the severest penalty, if you believe that the system and the law you are good for the people of this country and that my activity is therefore injurious to the common wealth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-gandhi-stood-trial-for-sedition/story-5NKJFXXvjL4mSdum64vFYP.html

The people want to remain with him,” he said.He said the JMM has been the championing the cause of adivasis and moolvasis, in particular in Santhal, Chotanagpur and Kolhan regions and people have wished that Basant be the party candidate.JMM working president and chief minister Hemant Soren, during his three-day Dumka visit last month, also got this message and the party decided to field Basant, he said.Bhattacharya said the JMM also wants congress to announce its candidate’s name for the Bermo by-election soon so that the party could energise its workers to ensure the victory of the alliance candidates with historic margins.The bypoll in Dumka was necessitated after Hemant vacated the seat in January this year while opting to retain his Barhet seat. He had won both the seats in the 2019 assembly polls.On Bihar election, Bhattacharya said the JMM was still talking to the RJD and others in the grand alliance and would make the announcement shortly.“We can contest more seats if we go to the polls alone or less number of seats if contesting as alliance partners,” he said.The JMM had identified 12 seats in Bihar assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jmm-youth-wing-chief-basant-soren-to-fight-dumka-bypoll/story-vo5CkRnt9ctxpZhFmh3JMK.html
01-10-2020||India||Customs detain LDF leader in Kerala gold smuggling case||Almost three months after seizure of 30 kg gold from a diplomatic consignment the Customs department on Thursday detained a Left Democratic Front (LDF) leader from Kozhikode in north Kerala in connection with the case. “Karat Faisal, an LDF municipal body councillor, is suspected to be the kingpin in the case and invested heavily in the racket and played a major role in distributing smuggled gold to jewellers,” said a Customs officer who did not wish to be named.Customs officials raided his house in Koduvally in the early hours of Thursday and later took him to Kochi. Officials said they came to know about his role after sustained interrogation of some of those arrested in the gold smuggling case. He will be produced in a court later. This is not Faisal’s first brush with the law. In 2013 the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had arrested him in connection with a smuggling incident in Kozhikode airport but he was let off after coughing up a hefty fine. He was reported to be very close to two LDF independent legislators, Karat Razak and PTA Raheem. The smuggling case came to light after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment that came in the name of an employee of the United Arab Emirates consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later that month, the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency. The NIA later said proceeds of smuggling could have been used to fund terror networks in the country.In a related development, one of the prime accused in the gold smuggling case Sandeep Nair has moved an application in the court to make a confession under the Section 164 A of the Indian Penal Code. The NIA did not oppose his plea in the court. There are reports the NIA will make him an approver to reach many big fish after his statements virtually led to Karat Faisal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-detain-ldf-leader-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case/story-zkXB3QtUxuRxJfUMB0dLcK.html
01-10-2020||India||Pak HC fixes hearing on appointment of defence council for Kulbhushan Jadhav on Oct 6||The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has fixed the hearing of the case related to the appointment of defence counsel for Kulbhushan Jadhav on October 6, ARY News reported.The hearing will be held by a larger bench of the high court comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Amir Farooq, and Justice Mian Gull Hassan Aurangzeb.This comes after Pakistan Foreign Office Spokesperson had earlier rejected India’s demand for an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel.In September, the Islamabad High Court in Pakistan had directed the federal government to give India another chance to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav and adjourned hearing for a month.Ministry of External Affairs’ spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said that Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of ICJ judgment in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case and has not yet addressed core issues including provision of all documents and unimpeded access.He said that Pakistan has also not addressed the appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial for Jadhav.“The Government of Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit. It has not yet addressed the core issues, which includes the provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial,” Srivastava had said at a press briefing.India said Pakistan should provide for an unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access and that the meeting of Indian officials with Jadhav should take place in an atmosphere free from fear of retribution.India also said that any conversation between Jadhav and High Commission officials must necessarily take place in privacy and without the presence of any Pakistani official or recording by Pakistan.Pakistan claims that Jadhav was arrested from Balochistan in 2016 on charges of espionage. India has rejected Pakistan’s allegations and said he was kidnapped from the Iranian port of Chabahar. In early 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced him to death.The International Court of Justice (ICJ) had upheld India’s claim that Pakistan has committed an egregious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations on several counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-hc-fixes-hearing-on-appointment-of-defence-council-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-on-oct-6/story-vK1sqOsyDBvL25hdZGnhxM.html
01-10-2020||India||Trump event cited for enquiry into Centre’s Covid handling, SC rejects plea||The government handling of the Covid-19 pandemic could be a matter for public debate but courts cannot examine the same, the Supreme Court said on Thursday, dismissing a plea seeking a commission of enquiry into the central government’s response to coronavirus disease.The plea by former Indian diplomat KP Fabian alleged that the ‘Namaste Trump’ event in February, when the coronavirus was spreading, was held in violation of the advisory issued by the central government against allowing a large congregation.The bench, headed by justice L Nageswara Rao, said that the government has to be given latitude when it comes to such issues and there is bound to be difference of opinion with regard to the government’s action in such matters.“It is a matter of public debate but the court cannot go into it. Government has to be given latitude. It is a matter of opinion. Six months ago, nobody knew what would happen,” the bench which also comprised justice Ajay Rastogi said.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing petitioner Fabian, told the court that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had given a warning in January 2020 regarding the seriousness of the coronavirus threat but the Indian government failed to heed the same.“The government did not start screening international passengers till March. The Namaste Trump event was held in which 1 lakh people gathered in a stadium despite the Ministry of Home Affairs itself having issued advisory against allowing large congregations,” Bhushan submitted.Bhushan also said that experts had advised against total lockdown and a meeting was also held with the chief secretaries of states in which it was decided that only hotspot districts would be kept under lockdown.“But immediately after that, the Prime Minister unilaterally declared a nationwide lockdown. The WHO had asked nations to procure PPE kits but the same was not done by the Centre on time and many doctors died. Two crore jobs were lost and the GDP fell by 23.9 which was the worst for any country,” Bhushan argued.He also highlighted the difficulties faced by migrant workers due to the lockdown.The bench, however, dismissed the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-event-cited-for-enquiry-into-centre-s-covid-handling-sc-rejects-plea/story-NRCQusoygYQKFmwxjpqyMM.html

The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday announced the ‘Re-open’ guidelines, paving the way for public celebration of Durga Puja, Ramleela, larger political activities including those for the UP Assembly bypolls on seven seats, or larger marriage gatherings. “We are happy about the state government decision in allowing Durga puja. The uncertainty has finally ended. We will go for smaller size idols and shall follow all the guidelines,” said Arun Banerjee, president of the Bengali Club. “We are the oldest organisation in the city celebrating Durga puja for more than 100 years now. It was difficult to discontinue a century-old tradition. This Durga puja let’s pray to God to kill the demon virus which has claimed several lives in the country,” he said. Rabindra Palli puja committee president Mihir Banerjee said, “This is a welcome decision. This is our 37th year. We are going for Kalash puja or will go for small size Durga idols. No distribution of ‘bhog’ (Prasad) will be conducted and will organise ‘pushpanjali’ in small batches.” Tirtho Sengupta of RDSO Durga puja committee said, “We are happy with the decision. A meeting has been called on Friday evening to discuss the arrangements. We will place an order for small-sized idols.” An elated Manoj Bhadra, president of Bondhu Mahal said, “During the pandemic along with celebrating Durga Puja, we will have to look into the health of devotees visiting the pandals.” “We have decided to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines in our Puja pandal,” he said. Bhadra said, “Though we are getting a very short time to prepare for the puja, our members will work to make it a grand event with curtailed programmes.” He said, “We have ordered for a small Durga protima and our ‘purohit’ and ‘dhaki’ have confirmed their participation.” Ramakrishna Math, which has been organising ‘Durga Puja’ for nearly 40 years now, is going ahead with the rituals. “We will follow all Covid guidelines, including social distancing and limited gathering,” said Swami Muktinathananda, president of the math.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-govt-permits-durga-puja-under-strict-covid-19-protocol/story-HCXgTHd9bQYKIKY7iUvpzL.html

The Shiv Sena has criticised Athawale saying that he was more concerned for justice for the actors instead of common people. “Athawale sought justice for an actor, but not for the poor girl from Hathras whose family was not even allowed to cremate her,” said Sena MP Sanjay Raut.In recent times, Athawalehas been supporting actor Kangana Ranaut who launched a tirade against the Shiv Sena and said the RPI will offer security to her. In addition, he also met Koshiyari protesting the demolition of Ranaut’s office and demanded compensation for her.This evoked criticism of Athawale from both rivals as well as social media users who questioned the priorities of the Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment and pointed out that he seemed more interested in celebrities than Dalits. Political observers rue that the Dalit leadership has bowed before the major political parties. “Athawale knows that celebs would attract more publicity for him than taking up the Dalits cause and hence favours them,” said political analyst Hemant Desai.The woman in Hathras was allegedly attacked and raped on September 14 in a field near her home. Details of the barbaric assault emerged last week, and the woman was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she battled for life till Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-fire-for-supporting-actors-ramdas-athawale-to-meet-hathras-victim-s-family/story-xnH85mrd733v2limNco5EN.html

The leaders were detained as they were walking to their destination after their vehicles were stopped at Yamuna Expressway, citing imposition of Section 144. The 19-year-old victim died at a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, a fortnight after she was allegedly gangraped and tortured by four upper caste men in UP’s Hathras.After the Congress leaders announced their decision to visit the victim’s family, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi urged the opposition to not increase the tension through “political tourism”. However, he did not name any party. The state government was working to punish the criminals for their “barbarism”, he added.Earlier in the day, Congress workers protested at the Delhi Noida Delhi (DND) flyway against the gangrape. They blocked five lanes of the Delhi-Noida side of the flyway by squatting on the road. “We demand President’s rule in Uttar Pradesh. We also demand safety and security of victim’s kin, as in the past in UP, there were instances where rape victim’s kin have been murdered. The government should also give decent compensation to the family,” UP Congress leader Badruddin Quraishi said. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi said he will march to Hathras alone in view of Section 144.“I am standing here peacefully. I want to march alone to Hathras. Section 144 talks about public assembly. I will go alone to Hathras. On what basis are you detaining me,” asked Rahul Gandhi in Hindi to the cops present on the scene.The two leaders were detained. However, the Congress alleges that they were arrested. The Uttar Pradesh Congress called for a statewide protest against the police action on Gandhis.In one of the pictures from the incident, the Congress leader is seen on the ground. Party workers and his security men quickly gathered around to help him up get up.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal condemned the leaders’ arrest.“The cowardly UP Govt has arrested Shri @RahulGandhi & Smt @PriyankaGandhi for seeking justice & trying to meet the bereaved Hathras victim’s family. I appeal to all PCCs and @INCIndia workers to protest today against the arrest of Rahul ji, Priyanka ji & other party leaders,” tweeted Congress general secretary KC Venugopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-priyanka-gandhi-detained-while-on-their-way-to-meet-hathras-gangrape-victim-s-family-photos/story-DmGA4nQcHXzDxB4GVWzWlM.html

Chukka Venkata Naga Varalakshmi submitted her resignation to the trust board as well as the executive officer of Kanaka Durga temple, owning moral responsibility for the seizure of as many as 280 liquor bottles from her car at Jaggayyapet on Wednesday. In her letter, Varalakshmi said she was no way connected with the transport of liquor bottles in her car. She said it was her driver Shiva who might have indulged in smuggling.“I will not continue in the post till the inquiry is completed,” she said. The Jaggayyapet police already arrested Shiva and also booked a case against him and Varalakshmi’s husband Venkata Krishna Prasad, also a YSRC leader under relevant sections of the Andhra Pradesh Excise (Amendment) Act 2020. The police seized the big consignment of liquor from Varalakshmi’s car which was parked in an apartment close to her residence. The value of the seized alcohol is around Rs 40,000. According to Jaggaiahpet circle inspector P Chandrasekhara Rao, preliminary investigation revealed that the liquor was procured from Telangana and smuggled into the state. “We are questioning the driver and investigating the role of the car owner,” he said. Varalakshmi told the police that she had only asked the driver to fill fuel in the vehicle and was not aware of the presence of liquor bottles in it. “We won’t encourage such practices,” she claimed. Telugu Desam Party Andhra Pradesh unit president Kala Venkat Rao demanded the abolition of entire trust board of Kanaka Durga temple in the wake of seizure of liquor bottles from the vehicle of one of the board members. “It clearly shows what kind of persons the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had appointed in the temple trust board. Not just the board member, even endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas also should resign from the post,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alcohol-smuggling-racket-scalps-woman-member-of-vijaywada-s-durga-temple-trust-board/story-zCg6xmh0Z5gwe7kF8L46pI.html

We have brought the body for post-mortem and combing of the area has started,” said IG Bastar, Sunderaj P.Police claimed that a group of Maoists reached the villages and killed Korsa and Kudiyam with sharp-edged weapons, suspecting them to be “police informers”.In Bijapur, 12 people, including three policemen and a forest ranger, have been killed in the last one month - an issue of concern for both police and human rights activists.Sunderaj P, in a statement to the media, said Maoists are frustrated because of an effective campaign against them, many of their camps have been demolished.“Realising that there is no future in Maoism, a large number of Maoists has also surrendered due to which the Maoists are frustrated and are trying to terrorise by killing and beating innocent villagers,” said the IG.He further said that roads, bridges, culverts and other basic facilities have been provided to the villagers in the Bastar region in the last few years even in situations of lockdown and floods, which has increased the confidence of the villagers in governance, administration and security forces.“They panicked after losing the confidence of the villagers and they are killing them,” said the IG.Other police officers believe that the Maoists want to create an environment of fear among villagers which can help them increase recruitment. “There has been a decrease in recruitment of sentries in 2017-18. The other very important factor behind the killings is that there is total indiscipline in ranks of Maoists, with local cadres now doing mass executions without even taking approval of senior cadres. And lastly, there is total ideological disarray with movement becoming an armed war with no ethics,” a police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-kill-2-villagers-in-chhattisgarh-for-being-informers-police/story-BD4PNPWJ4toNtevzzsq9OO.html
01-10-2020||India||Passenger from UAE held in Kerala for smuggling gold in mask||Despite high security at airports to deter gold smuggling, a passenger from the UAE tried to sneak in 40 grams of the yellow metal concealed behind the exhalation valve of a N-95 mask that he was wearing before Customs officials caught him at the Kozhikode international airport on Tuesday“This is the first time we are coming across such a concealment tactic. It shows smugglers are out to exploit every situation whether it is pandemic or not. Usually we avoid masks and they were using this opportunity to smuggle,” said a senior Customs official.He said the passenger Amar Mohammad, a native of Bhatkal in neighbouring Karnataka, who arrived by a Vande Bharat flight, had completed all checks and was about to exit the airport when an officer noticed that the mask he was wearing was sagging at one side and he was frequently adjusting it. When asked about it, he turned agitated and was in a hurry to slip out, the official said.After checking his mask, officials found gold concealed inside it. The official said after the incident now passengers have been asked to deposit their mask also along with their wallet, belt and mobile phones for checking. “The smuggled gold is worth Rs 2 lakh. We have detained him. It really shows the smugglers are making use of all opportunities,” said the official.Though there is no normal flight these days, smugglers make use of ‘Vande Bharat’ and chartered flights to carry out their activities thinking frisking norms would be lax during the Covid-19 pandemic, said the official. Smugglers have used date seeds, bra straps, belt buckles, shoes soles, sausages and gold paste to ring in the gold as its price soars in the country. For Customs officials it is a high-stakes hide-and- seek game every day. Last year in Kerala 550 kg gold seized from four international airports. Security at airports has been tightened after 30 kg of gold were seized from the Thiruvananthapuram international airport on July 5 from a consignment for the UAE consulate. The seizure led to a probe by the NIA which is continuing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passenger-from-uae-held-in-kerala-for-smuggling-gold-in-mask/story-ngyEmUWqy0B4y3VvLJbnmK.html

He is a local doctor, who was first called to treat the victim by the two accused at a room behind a grocery store run by one of the accused in a nearby market.The doctor told media persons that one of the accused visited his clinic to take him to his house to treat the victim, introducing her as a family member at around 5pm on Tuesday.The doctor said he became suspicious after finding the victim lying alone on a sofa.“I returned immediately, stating that I will treat her only in the presence of her family members and started asking for her father’s name and contact number.The youths then told me that they would bring the victim to the clinic with her father for the treatment, but they did not do so. Later, I came to know that she died,” he stated.The victim’s mother had earlier alleged that some youths had abducted her while she was returning home from the college and taken her to a room where she was raped and brutalised.The incident occurred on Tuesday when the woman had gone to take admission in a college near her village but did not return home till late in the evening, said superintendent of police (SP) of Balrampur, Dev Ranjan Verma, who visited the victim’s family with the district magistrate (DM), Krishna Karunesh, on Thursday.The woman later returned on a rickshaw with a glucose drip inserted in her hand while the family members were searching for her.Verma said the family members stated that the woman’s condition was not good, so they rushed her to a nearby hospital and later to the Balrampur district hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.While the family alleged that the woman’s hands and legs were fractured, police officials stated that no such injuries were confirmed in the post-mortem examination.The two accused were arrested after an FIR was registered following a complaint filed by the victim’s brother, officials said.Also Read: Centre should impose President’s rule in UP, says Mayawati over Hathras, Balrampur incidentsThe victim was cremated on Wednesday night itself after a post-mortem examination by a panel of four doctors.

Section 144 prohibits assembly of four or more people.The entry of journalists in the village was prohibited reportedly after some police personnel were found with Covid-19 symptoms.“We have asked these cops to get themselves tested and if they test positive, the village might be declared a containment zone. Thus, entry of outsiders, including media, has been stopped on apprehension of Covid-19,” the Hathras DM said.There were also reports that Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi set off on foot to meet the family of Hathras gang rape victim after the police stopped them on the Yamuna Expresswayciting prohibitory orders.However, Kumar denied any information about the arrival of the two Congress leaders.The 19-year-old Dalit woman, died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday a fortnight after she was gang-raped at Hathras while she was out to collect fodder with her mother.

He had picked up arms and joined militancy before being killed in an encounter that year. My mother Nagina Begum never divulged it to me but today when I insisted she eventually told me the truth. Probably she kept it a secret to protect me from going astray. Despite being uneducated, she has been the biggest inspiration and strength for me. She emotionally and morally supported me to come this far,” Abdullah said.Doda region was a hot bed of Pak sponsored terrorism in the 1990s. Abdullah stated that his mother had no option but to send him to an orphanage since she had no means to raise him at home. “My mother Nagina Begum is uneducated and works on a meagre honorarium of Rs 2,400 per month as an integrated child development services (ICDS) helper. After I passed class 4th from Rafiq memorial academy in Doda, I was sent to an orphanage in Srinagar where I spent seven years,” he said. Abdullah recalled the hard times he and his mother had to go through. “We had nothing to eat. Even today she gets paltry honorarium as an ICDS helper.

The former Congress president alleged that he was pushed to the ground and struck with a lathi by the police. Pictures from the scene showed Gandhi being held back by the policemen, while one of the frames captured him taking a tumble and falling to the ground as the pushback by police continued. The party workers quickly gathered around to pick him up. The police are citing the imposition of Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people, to deny Gandhis. “I am standing here peacefully. I want to march alone to Hathras. Section 144 talks about public assembly. I will go alone to Hathras. On what basis are you detaining me,” asked Rahul Gandhi in Hindi to the cops present on the scene.  The 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday a fortnight after she was gang-raped at Hathras while she was out to collect fodder with her mother, was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night.Earlier, members of Dalit groups and activists alleged that the early morning cremation was done to prevent any mobilisation or protests in the village. “The whole world is watching how the government and the police together cremated our sister in the absence of her family. I have been taken into custody and put under house arrest in Saharanpur; but we will continue to fight,” said Chandrasekhar Azad, chief of the Bhim Army, who had led protests outside Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-priyanka-gandhi-detained-by-up-police-while-on-their-way-to-meet-hathras-gangrape-victim-s-family/story-5pY3uUt3xRdNkHbR4oFuSP.html

01-10-2020||India||Air pollution: North-western states to adopt hot spot approach||Union minister for environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) Prakash Javadekar said 50 Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) teams would be deployed this winter in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR) in a bid to rein in the worsening air quality index (AQI) level, which has become an annual health hazard. The CPCB authorities would also coordinate with some of the north-western states on a daily basis to monitor polluting emissions, Javadekar said.Also read: Delhi HC wants Centre’s response on plea to stop stubble burningThe minister made the announcement following a review meeting with his counterparts from Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Delhi on Thursday.These north-western states have been recording some of the worst AQIs in the country during winter over the past few years because of the seasonal stubble burning. Farmers set their fields ablaze to clear excess crop residue in time for the wheat sowing season, which leads to poor AQI across the region.It was decided at the meeting that the north-western states will adopt a hot spot-based approach to control air pollution during the upcoming winter season.For example, Delhi will focus on controlling pollution sources in 13 of its hot spots such as Mayapuri, Bawana, Narela, Dwarka, Rohini, RK Puram, and Jahangirpuri. Similarly, Haryana will focus on Panipat, Sonepat, Jhajjar etc. UP will concentrate its actions on Bulandshahr, Meerut, Noida, Greater Noida etc and Rajasthan will lay emphasis on Bhiwadi.The trials of a microbial consortium -- also being called PUSA decomposer that has been developed by scientists at the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) -- have started in earnest across thousands of acres in all the stubble-burning states, Javadekar said. “We may see the results of the trials within a year. The Centre has disbursed Rs 1,700 crore in the past three years for subsidising straw management machinery to Punjab, Haryana and UP. The move has also resulted in the reduction of pollution in areas under stubble burning,” he said.Punjab government officials have informed the Centre that they are trying to create awareness in the worst stubble burning-affected districts and also explaining the common link between the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and air pollution. “Both these factors affect lungs. The Punjab government is communicating this common link to the farmers and the public,” Javadekar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-north-western-states-to-adopt-hot-spot-approach/story-5bsq7UdX7a1lTa7DSyV9kM.html

However, the Congress alleges that the Gandhis have been arrested. The police stopped the Gandhis, citing imposition of Section 144, which prohibits assembly of four or more people.Pictures from the scene showed Rahul Gandhi being held back by the cops, in one of the shots he is seen taking a tumble while a policeman is holding on to the leader’s kurta to stop him from falling. In the next snap, the Congress leader is on the ground. The party workers and his security men quickly gathered around to help shore him up.Gandhi said he would peacefully march alone to Hathras as that would not be in violation of Section 144 that prohibits public assembly. He demanded to know under which law he was being stopped. “I am standing here peacefully. I want to march alone to Hathras. Section 144 talks about public assembly. I will go alone to Hathras. On what basis are you detaining me,” asked Rahul Gandhi in Hindi to the cops present on the scene.The Uttar Pradesh Congress has called for a statewide protest against the police action on Gandhis.“The cowardly UP Govt has arrested Shri @RahulGandhi & Smt @PriyankaGandhi for seeking justice & trying to meet the bereaved Hathras victim’s family. I appeal to all PCCs and @INCIndia workers to protest today against the arrest of Rahul ji, Priyanka ji & other party leaders,” tweeted Congress general secretary KC Venugopal.Earlier in the day, Congress workers milled around the two leaders as Rahul Gandhi, his face mask on, led the march, with Priyanka, who was recently retained as general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, right behind him. Scores of reporters and people were seen clicking pictures of the two leaders as they went about their padyatra under the October sun. The 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday a fortnight after she was gang-raped at Hathras while she was out to collect fodder with her mother, was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. हाथरस के पीड़ित परिवार से मिलने दिल्ली से हाथरस निकले श्री @RahulGandhi जी एवं श्रीमती @priyankagandhi जी के काफिले को उप्र की तानाशाह पुलिस ने रोका,राहुल गांधी जी ने शुरू की पदयात्रा, पैदल ही निकले हाथरस की ओर.. pic.twitter.com/YefquJYzK3Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi urged the opposition to not increase the tension through “political tourism”, and said the state government is working to punish the criminals for their “barbarism”.

Manoj Chaudhry, Gautam Budh Nagar Congress president, said the party workers have gathered to demand justice for the rape and murder victim.Members of Dalit groups and activists alleged that the early morning cremation was done to prevent any mobilisation or protests in the village. “The whole world is watching how the government and the police together cremated our sister in the absence of her family. I have been taken into custody and put under house arrest in Saharanpur; but we will continue to fight,” said Chandrasekhar Azad, chief of the Bhim Army, who had led protests outside Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday.Amid nationwide outrage and calls for his resignation, state chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday spoke to the family via video-link. The chief minister has said a fast-track court will handle the case for speedy justice. The special investigation team has been constituted to probe the matter and asked to submit its report within seven days. “The CM has spoken to the father of the deceased woman of Hathras. Her father asked for harshest penalty against the accused. The CM assured him that the most stringent action shall be taken against the accused and all possible help shall be provided to the family of the deceased,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said yesterday.

It has been declared so by Bhimtal-based Butterfly Research Centre, and validated by Wildlife Institute of India.There were 1,641 species and subspecies of butterfly in India until 2006. In 2015, the number came down to 1,318 and with 10 more species added since, the number is now 1,328, said senior scientist, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, VP Uniyal. The 1328th species is new to India, he added.Spialia Zebra, the butterfly species that is normally found in Pakistan, was photographed at Sangwara in Rajasthan’s Dungarpur district on November 8, 2014. Mukesh Panwar, a government schoolteacher with interest in ecology, saw several of these between 1.20pm and 1.57pm. He sent one specimen to Bhimtal for identification and research.Also read: All you need to know about Delhi’s butterfly survey The Bhimtal institute took six years to declare it the 1,328th species. The butterfly species has also found place in a paper in BIONOTES, the journal edited by Dr RK Varshney, a former Zoological Survey of India scientist, and published by Entomological Society of India, New Delhi, and Butterfly Research Centre, in its July-September 2020 issue.“The butterfly is difficult to observe because it is quite small and flies rapidly low over the ground,” the paper said. “The species was first seen in [what is now] Pakistan in 1888. It has been seen for the first time in India,” said Bhimtal centre’s director, Peter Smetacek.He said it was for the first time that S. Zebra had been seen more than 1,000km south of its natural habitat in Pakistan. The centre catalogued 1,318 species of Indian butterflies in 2015. “The one seen in Rajasthan’s Sangwara is 1,328th species, according to our records,” Smetacek said.The butterfly species has been found in Margalla hills in northern Pakistan.Panwar said he has been working on butterflies for over 15 years. “I saw this species at a farmhouse and clicked its pictures, which were sent along with a specimen to Bhimtal for identification,” said Panwar, who has seen and identified 111 species of butterflies so far.The Rajasthan forest department, Rajputana Society of Natural History and Vagad Nature Club organised state’s first butterfly festival in Sangwara in February 2018.The country celebrated the big butterfly month in September for identification of butterflies and raising awareness about conservation of these bio-indicators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-1328th-species-of-butterfly-seen-in-rajasthan-wildlife-institute/story-VXyaxma7IKFIxYqg3A2NwJ.html

But we will fight,” Azad tweeted in Hindi.He also shared a picture of the notice issued to him by the Saharanpur police, which stated: “You are being informed that CrPC section 144 is imposed in the district. There are credible inputs that your tours and acts are gathering crowds, which may lead to law and order situation. Any untoward incident may happen. Hence, you are being informed that you will stay in your house only.” The order, issued by the local Fatehpur police station in-charge Manoj Chaudhary, also warned Azad of legal action for violating the instruction.When contacted, Chaudhary told PTI that it was not a “house arrest” but Azad has been asked to remain at his home in view of the law and order situation.“There is no time limit on the order as such,” he added.According to functionaries of the Azad Samaj Party, which was launched by the Bhim Army chief in March, Azad and Delhi unit head Himanshu Balmiki had gone missing after 10 pm on Tuesday while they were on their way to Hathras, accompanying the family of the gangrape victim, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday. The Azad Samaj Party and affiliates of the pro-Dalit Bhim Army, among others, had joined the protests outside Safdarjung hospital in the national capital on Tuesday to demand justice for the gangrape victim and her family. “There is no clue about the location of Azad and Balmiki after they reached the Jewar toll plaza to get on the lane to Tappal, Aligarh,” Azad Samaj Party’s core committee member Ravindra Bhati said earlier on Wednesday.He alleged that Azad and Balmiki were detained during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, but the police were not making it public.The body of the gangrape victim was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family members alleging that the local police forced them to perform the last rites in the dead of the night.Local police officers, however, told PTI that the victim was cremated “according to the wishes of the family”. Around 12.30 pm on Wednesday, dozens of Azad Samaj Party and Bhim Army activists reached the Tappal police station in Aligarh and staged a demonstration.“A delegation of our representatives will be meeting senior police and administration officials to inquire about Azad and Balmiki,” Bhati told the protesters inside the Tappal police station compound. When contacted, a senior Aligarh police official said, “I have no idea about this (detention) claim.” The district police chief and some other senior officers could not be contacted as according to another police official, they have been infected with the coronavirus and are under medication for the last three-four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stay-in-your-house-notice-to-bhim-army-chief-over-up-rape-protest-cops-deny/story-7Qd0Us3jXsEHRxUAaYfZJM.html

But a similar crime has been committed against a Dalit student in Balrampur. Under BJP’s UP government, criminals, mafias and rapists are having a free run,” Mayawati told ANI here.The BSP chief said that the incidents had shaken her to the core and therefore she had decided to talk to the media, “in an attempt to wake up the Centre if the UP government isn’t waking up.”She also raised questions on the actions taken against criminals in UP in the past few years.“People also say that the action taken against criminals, encounters, or breaking their houses is due to political benefits and not honesty. If there is any truth in that, then it is indeed very shameful. People across all sections of the society are unhappy with this government, the frequency of all types of crimes have increased but the daughters of UP are not safe,” she said.“Especially the girls coming from the Dalit community are not at all safe,” she added, further condemning the attitude of police and administration with the family members of the Hathras gang-rape victim.“On September 28, I sent a BSP delegation to meet the victim’s family member. When they reached the police team kept them in the police station, they then called the victim’s mother and brother to the police station and the cops stayed constantly by their side while the delegation held talks with them,” she added.The BSP chief said that the administration not handing over the victim’s body to the family members to pay respects and performing the last rites was a very shameful incident. “If this is not jungleraaj, then what is this?” Mayawati said.She further said that the two incidents in Hathras and Balrampur, reminded her of the Nirbhaya case of New Delhi.“In the past few hours there have been several cases of women being exploited in several districts in the state. Not even a day passes when such cases do not happen in the state. I want to remind Yogi Adityanath that you were given birth by a female, you should treat others’ daughters as your own. If you cannot protect them then you should resign on your own,” Mayawati said, further slamming the Yogi government.She also said that financial compensation, jobs being given to the victims’ family would not stop the crimes against the community and women.“I want to tell the Centre that the UP government is not waking up. Yogi Adityanath is not fit to control law and order, therefore, I want to tell the Centre that they might have made him the Chief Minister under pressure from RSS but he is not fit to run the government efficiently in UP,” Mayawati.She said that it would be better if Yogi Adityanath is sent back to the Gorakhpur Math or to Ayodhya, where the Ram Janmabhoomi temple is being constructed, by the BJP.“In his place, a more capable person should be made CM who can give better law and order to the UP residents. I want to tell Prime Minister that he has been chosen (as an MP) from UP only, he should take care of the state. If Yogi can’t handle UP then either make someone else CM, or impose President’s rule in the state,” Mayawati said.The BSP chief further asserted that the leadership needs to be changed immediately in the state.“I am 100 percent sure that the current UP CM is not able to run the government. Therefore, impose President’s rule and show some mercy to the people,” she added.The UP government has faced backlash after another Dalit woman lost her life due to gang rape in Balrampur district, a day after the cremation of the Hathras gangrape victim, who had succumbed to her injuries, was conducted by the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-impose-president-s-rule-in-up-says-mayawati-over-hathras-balrampur-incidents/story-7ITZK9LbD7q6HxwpdSWZVP.html

01-10-2020||India||SC quashes Gujarat notification exempting factories from payment of overtime wages||The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday struck down the Gujarat government’s decision to exempt industries in the state from certain provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 relating to the payment of overtime wages and also for fixed working hours between April 20 and July 19 on grounds of public emergency due to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic-induced lockdown restrictions. The apex court observed that right to life of workers is not conditional and their just claims to overtime wages and decent working conditions must not be denied because of the Covid-19 outbreak and massive disruption of economic activities following the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions. The lockdown was enforced from March 25 in a bid to contain the contagion. Also read: SC dismisses plea seeking postponement of UPSC civil services prelims 2020An SC bench, headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, held that workers faced unprecedented social and economic challenges during the lockdown and law cannot be used as an affront to their right to life and their just claims against forced labour. The Gujarat government had issued a notification on April 17 to provide relaxation to industries during the lockdown period by exempting them from certain conditions mandated under the Factories Act, 1948.The notification provided that workers in Gujarat can be made to work 12 hours a day with a 30-minute break after every six hours. It also did away with the requirement to pay double the wages for overtime work. The order had stated that normal wages can be paid even for overtime work. The notification was issued under section 5 of the Factories Act, 1948. Section 5 allows a government to exempt industries from the purview of Factories Act, 1948 on grounds of public emergency. Section 5 defines public emergency as a grave emergency, which threatens the internal security of the country whether by war or external aggression or even internal disturbances.The SC held that section 5 cannot be invoked to provide a blanket relief to all factories citing Covid-19 pandemic and the contagion cannot be considered a public emergency threatening national security. Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or the CPI (M), had moved the SC, challenging the Gujarat government’s April 17 notification. The petitioners had cited that Section 5 of the Factories Act, 1948, which provides for exemption only in cases of public emergency and that, too, for a factory or a class of factories. It does not provide for a blanket exemption for all factories, the plea had added.The court ordered that overtime wages should be paid to all eligible workers in Gujarat between April 20 and July 19, when the state government’s notification was in operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-quashes-gujarat-notification-exempting-factories-from-payment-of-overtime-wages/story-vMjApnDkxNgvE2FIEJsa5M.html
01-10-2020||India||China’s resurrection of 1959 LAC claim may be first step. India preps for fallout||With Beijing reiterating its claim on 1,597 kilometres of Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh on the basis of November 1959 maximalist cartographical claim, national security planners believe that Chinese Army may use this claim to put pressure on the six other areas of differences in the western sector that have not been impacted in the ongoing standoff between the two countries.The Indian Army has been sensitised to the assessment and is on alert to pre-empt any move by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), people familiar with the matter said.The 1959 line (defined as Green Line on military maps) was sent by Prime Minister Zhou En-Lai to his Indian counterpart Jawaharlal Nehru on November 7, 1959, appended to Zhou’s letter addressed to heads of African-Asian countries on November 15, 1962.During the inconclusive exercise of clarification and confirmation of the western sector by expert level group, it was found that India and China had 12 areas of differences with significant areas involved. The western sector maps were to be exchanged on June 17, 2002 but the Chinese withdrew at the last moment.HT Editorial: India must keep its guard up on LAC after China’s 1959 claimAccording to China watchers, with six out of 12 areas of differences already in the contest, the PLA may launch an aggression on the remaining six points including Samar Lungpa, Demchok and Chumar to press home its claim which was rejected by Nehru himself. Hence, Indian military commanders have asked troops to be ready to repel any PLA move before heavy snow takes over the theatre of contest in East Ladakh. The polar winds and snow will not only wreak havoc on men but also their equipment. Artillery guns and tank barrels freeze in such cold conditions. From November 15 to May, the top priority of the two armies will be to survive the cold at the heights.While both India and China are engaged at military and diplomatic level to disengage, the PLA commanders of Western Theatre Command only listen to their commander-in-chief Xi Jinping, not the foreign ministry in Beijing as many generals outrank the foreign minister in the all-powerful Central Military Commission (CMC).The situation on the ground in the Ladakh LAC continues to be tense with the PLA realising that the Indian Army means business and has the capacity and capability to repel any aggression, an official said. The PLA troopers have stopped playing Punjabi songs on north of Pangong Tso and psychological warfare messages in the south with the Indian troopers making it clear that any transgression now will invite severe retaliation.The Indian diplomats are unfazed by the 1959 line claim and question their predecessors who thought more about not crossing the Chinese red lines on the LAC rather than defending the Indian LAC claim.“The Ladakh stand-off is an outcome of a 30-year differential between India and China in the infrastructure race. China became Shanghai and India remained Mumbai. It is not good English but strong infrastructure and military that will force China to come to table,” said a serving diplomat.The Chinese 1959 claim is as absurd as India claiming part of Tibet on the basis of Dogra ruler of Jammu, Raja Gulab Singh’s general Zorawar Singh Kahluria’s 1841 Tibet campaign to occupy parts of Ngari prefecture of Tibet, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-ladakh-1959/story-kd4kPfwW5CFwKfh1KcHdmI.html

Having earned the moniker of “caged parrot” from the country’s highest court, CBI often gets slammed for shoddy probes or weak prosecution tactics. The agency has a conviction rate of around 69% in its cases, but it is the high-profile cases where its work is often put to the test.

01-10-2020||India||Scientists identify unique patterns in Covid-19 transmission in India||Researchers, including those from the Government of Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, have conducted one of the largest analysis of Covid-19 epidemiology to date, and have found that both cases and deaths due to the disease have been more heavily concentrated in the 40-69 year age group in India than is seen in high-income countries, among other trends.The study, published in the journal Science on Wednesday, assessed the disease transmission patterns in 5,75,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the two states based on data collected by tens of thousands of contact tracers. According to the scientists, including Ramanan Laxminarayan from the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy in New Delhi, the findings offer a peek into the pandemic’s trajectory in a low- and middle-income country, where most Covid-19 cases have occurred. Based on the data, the scientists said both cases and deaths in the two Indian states were concentrated in younger cohorts than expected from observations in higher-income countries. The study noted that contacts with the same age were associated with the greatest infection risk -- a pattern, which the researchers said, was strongest among children between 0-14 years of age, and among adults older than 65 years. They said the proportion of deaths to the number of infected people, known as the case-fatality ratio (CFR), spanned 0.05 per cent at ages 5-17 years to 16.6 per cent at ages exceeding 85. The researchers also noted that Covid-19 patients in the two states have a median stay of five days in the hospital before death compared to 13 days to death from the date of hospital admission in the US. Follow-up testing of exposed contacts revealed that 70 per cent of infected individuals did not infect any of their contacts, while 8 per cent of coronavirus positive patients accounted for 60 per cent of observed new infections. The researchers said this finding presents the largest empirical demonstration of superspreading. They said the findings “may indicate the identification of less-severe infections through active case-finding.” Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are among the Indian states with the largest healthcare workforce and public health expenditures per capita, and are known for their effective primary healthcare delivery models, the study noted. It said 63 per cent of those who died had at least one co-morbidity, and 36 per cent had two or more underlying health conditions that made them more susceptible to the disease. About 45 per cent of those who died were diabetic, the scientists said. Unlike observations in high-income countries, they said the deaths in India are concentrated at ages 50-64 years. In the two Indian states in particular, they said only 17.9 per cent of Covid-19 deaths occurring on or before 1 August, 2020 were among people older than 75, compared with 58.1 per cent of deaths due to the disease in the US. “This study was made possible by the significant contact tracing effort in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which involved tens of thousands of healthcare workers,”  Laxminarayan said. “The results on disease transmission and mortality have the potential to inform policy to fight Covid-19. The study also speaks to the capacity of research emerging from India to help inform the global response to Covid-19,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-identify-unique-patterns-in-covid-19-transmission-in-india/story-9HKtgkFHMma4rXnHNS2a3N.html

01-10-2020||India||Analysis of exhaled breath can help detect gastrointestinal diseases: Research||Analysis of the water vapour in the exhaled breath may soon be used to detect various gastrointestinal diseases, including the Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterial infection that causes sores and ulcers and may even lead to gastric cancer.Researchers from the S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata, under the department of science, have found in the exhaled breath,new biomarkers for bacterial infection, and have developed a patented device to detect H.pylori.Water has four naturally occurring isotopes (variants of an element with different number of neutrons) with different masses. The team was able to quantify the triple isotope signature of water in the exhaled breath, depending on the water consumed by the person. They found that deuterium-rich semi-heavy water is a bio-marker for the H. Pylori infection.The scientists also found that an improper absorption of water -- learnt through changes in the composition of the triple isotopes -- can be indicative of various gastric malfunctions.The study was conducted by Dr Manik Pradhan and his team with Dr Sujit Chaudhuri, gastroenterologist at AMRI Hospital, Kolkata, to demonstrate that the isotopic signatures of unusual water absorption in the gastrointestinal tract can trace the onset of various abnormalities. The study was published in journal Analytical Chemistry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/analysis-of-exhaled-breath-can-help-detect-gastrointestinal-diseases-research/story-zomBULNZmiPb3IHAlAu5EP.html

The country also reported 1,181 new fatalities due to the virus in last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 98,678.India has 9,40,705 active cases in the country, whereas a total of 52,73,201 people have been cured of the disease so far. While the country’s infection rate is at 15.11%, India’s recovery rate currently stands at 83.33%.A total of 7,56,19,781 samples have been tested for Covid-19 till September 30. Of these, 14,23,052 samples were tested on Wednesday, according to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Though the country continues to witness a rise in Covid-19 cases, the Centre on Wednesday issued fresh guidelines for reopening of activities for people. The Centre has given a green flag for partial reopening of movie theatres, schools, colleges and swimming pools among other things. As per the new guidelines, the schools and colleges can reopen from October 15 in a graded manner but only after the states and union territories have taken “consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation”. This relaxation comes with a set of its own conditions, one of those being: “Students may attend schools and institutions only with the written consent of parents.”On the other hand, Cinema halls have been permitted to reopen with up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity for which SOP (Standard operating procedure) will be issued by Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MHA).On Wednesday, Maharashtra extended its lockdown till October 31, while also issuing relaxations on a few services such as restaurants, Mumbai local services bars and hotel. The Centre in its guidelines has also made it clear that all states and UT governments will not impose any lockdown outside the containment zones until a consultation with the government is made.“State/ UT Governments shall not impose any local lockdown (State/ District/ sub-division/City/ village level), outside the containment zones, without prior consultation with the Central Government. No restriction on inter-state & intra-state movement,” the Ministry of Home Affairs had said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-6-3-million-mark-with-86-821-fresh-cases-1-181-fatalities/story-BZUId08zcZTtG4LKGcQVzJ.html

He had said that he would continue to raise his voice for the sake of the youth of this country and for the future of the film industry.“I’ll speak at the right time. I’ve raised my voice for youths & future of film industry. I didn’t think about my life. Desh ke bhavishya ke liye 2-5 goli bhi kha lenge, to koi chinta nahi hai (Will even take a bullet or two for the country. I don’t worry about it),” ANI reported him as saying.Earlier, speaking in the Parliament, Ravi had raised the drug addiction issue in the Lok Sabha. In response, actor and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan had launched a scathing attack on Ravi. She had said that she completely disagreed with those who called the entertainment industry a “gutter”, referring to a comment made by Kangana Ranaut.“People who have made a name in this industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree and I really disassociate,” she said. She had added how she was “really embarrassed and ashamed” in a reference to Kishan’s statement in the Lok Sabha on the alleged Bollywood drug cartel. “Jis thali mein khate hai usme chhed karte hai. Galat baat hai ,” she said referring to a popular Hindi proverb that means to bite the hands that feed you.In response, Ravi had hit back at Jaya and said that he was the son of a priest and had worked his way up. “There is a conspiracy to finish our film industry by hollowing it out. As a responsible member of film industry, it is not just my right but my duty to raise it in Parliament and Jaya-ji should respect that. I am just a son of a priest who crawled his way up and has worked in 600 films,” Ravi said while speaking to ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ravi-kishan-gets-y-security-after-threat-calls-post-speaking-on-bollywood-drugs/story-Tys0ZjYdLbYtIM3fXuZTVL.html
01-10-2020||India||Govt yet to appoint members, SC commission headless since May||The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) has been a headless body for the past four months, as the Union government is yet to appoint office-bearers for the constitutional body set up to safeguard the rights of the marginalised communities. The term of the team, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and a former Member of Parliament (MP) Ram Shankar Katheria as the chairperson and L Murugan as the vice-chairperson, came to an end in May. Murugan has since been appointed as the president of the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit.A government functionary aware of the details said no meetings were held to discuss the names for the panel to head the constitutional body.NCSC has the powers to investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the SCs under the Constitution. It also has the mandate to probe into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the SCs. “The intervention of the commission is necessary and reassuring, if there is any laxity in probe or registering complaints during actions taken by the Central and state governments in cases involving atrocities against Dalits. The panel also ensures that compensation is paid to the victims,” said a former NCSC functionary, requesting anonymity. The headless NCSC is a stark reminder amid two recent incidents of atrocities against Dalits. The gang-rape and murder of a teenager (19) Dalit in Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Hathras district was followed by reports of another Dalit woman was also brutalised in the state’s Balrampur district on Wednesday. However, this is not the first time that the NCSC has been headless. Katheria was appointed to the constitutional body in May 2017 after PL Punia’s tenure had ended in October 2016. Bhalchandra Mungekar, a former Rajya Sabha (RS) MP from the Congress, said not reconstituting the commission shows “insensitivity and hypocrisy of the Union government”.He said: “Keeping aside the qualitative and quantitative work that the panel did over a period of time, the formation of the commission is a statutory obligation of the government. The commission’s annual reports are tabled in Parliament along with the action taken reports (ATRs) by the government. This insensitivity towards the SCs is contrary to the government’s slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas. SCs are the most deprived sections not only economically, but also socially, culturally, educationally and politically.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-yet-to-appoint-members-sc-commission-headless-since-may/story-XKKdLVHxK0HSoEgbI2MJvJ.html
01-10-2020||India||Land under forest shrunk between 2011 and 2016, contrary to FSI’s findings||The built-up area in the country had increased by 2.39% between 2011-12 and 2015-16, but forest area had declined by 1.09%, according to a report on environmental accounts released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Wednesday.The largest decline in vegetation was observed in case of deciduous and evergreen forests, the report revealed. The area under inland wetlands had dropped by 6.9%. While 14.32% dip was recorded in barren or waste land, including in the Rann of Kutch, during the same period. The report dwells on the state of various environmental assets such as forests, land, water bodies, grasslands, carbon stocks, biodiversity etc and their impact on the country’s economy. Also read: Why farmers are opposing ‘pro-farmer’ reformsThe National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), under its Natural Resources Census (NRC) project, has produced the land use and land change data sets for 2005-06, 2011-12 and 2015-16.The data sets were utilised by the NSO to conduct an analysis on land use trends for its latest report.However, the NSO’s analysis is at odds with the Forest Survey of India’s (FSI) reports that have shown an increase in the country’s forest cover. The FSI’s report had shown last year that the country recorded a 0.56% improvement in its forest cover, as compared to 2017. But, the NSO’s land use change matrix showed that forest area declined by 1.09%, as compared to a 0.5% increase in forest area shown in the FSI reports between 2013 and 2015.An official from the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) said on condition of anonymity that this could be because of the difference in the way the FSI and the NRSC define forests. The NRSC considers land with a tree canopy cover of more than 10% and an area of over 0.5 hectare (ha). It excludes other predominant land uses such as agriculture and certain monocultures, which the FSI doesn’t. Union Minister for Environment, forest and climate change Prakash Javadekar had said last year that India was among few countries to record increasing forest cover while citing the FSI’s data.The NSO land use change matrix shows a reduction in forest area may be because of diversion to built-up area, agriculture and wasteland. Similar reasons can be attributed to the loss in areas under wetland. The NSO report has taken into account forest ecosystem services such as timber, non-timber forest resources and carbon retention and has suggested these economic activities are equivalent to 2.58% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The highest economic value per ha from forest ecosystem services during 2017-18 was recorded in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, followed by Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, according to the analysis by the NSO of the FSI’s data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/land-under-forest-shrunk-between-2011-and-2016-contrary-to-fsi-s-findings/story-LaFbckJ6sgORZBmqsOfKWP.html

It was set up in 1917 and was home to MK and Kasturba Gandhi for around a decade. The Ashram was meant as a school for satyagrahis, and boasted notable inhabitants like Vinoba Bhave, Madeleine Slade aka Mira, and Maganlal Gandhi. It was from Sabarmati Ashram that Gandhi launched his iconic Dandi March against the British salt law in 1930. Sadly, he never visited the Ashram again. While leaving, the Mahatma had vowed to return only after India attained independence, but he was assassinated months after the country’s liberation. After leaving Sabarmati, Gandhi had set up the Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra’s Wardha.

01-10-2020||India||New devices developed for effective Covid-19 testing||A glucometer-like device that can detect the level of antibodies against Covid-19, another that uses magnetic nanoparticles to collect virus fragments or antibodies from a sample within minutes, and a third the size of two stacked laptops that can perform molecular Covid-19 tests without trained manpower have all been developed in three to four months by startups supported under the department of science and technology’s CAWACH initiative.Also Read: Superspreaders led to 60% Covid-19 cases: StudyThe three are being sent for validation to the Indian Council of Medical Research to see how they perform against existing tests. The Centre for Augmenting War with Covid-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH) was created in April, with a corpus of Rs 56 crore, for scouting, evaluating, and supporting innovations that can help in the government’s fight against the pandemic.“In just three or four months, many of the startups supported by us have developed effective technologies to fight Covid-19 including ventilators, PPE kits and diagnostic kits that are now available in the market. This shows the power of collaboration. Through the CAWACH programme we were able to connect the dots in a timely manner and look at the big picture,” said Dr Anita Gupta, head of innovation and entrepreneurship at DST.Also Read: Covid-19: Data dilemma after third serological surveyOne startup, PathShodh has developed an antibody testing device that can not only tell whether a person has antibodies against Covid-19 but also measure the concentration of the antibodies, something currently possible only in large laboratories.“The test uses a small amount of blood that needs to be put on a paper strip just like in a glucometer. The strip then needs to be put in a small mobile phone-sized device that gives a digital reading of whether a person has antibodies against Covid-19 as well as the concentration of the antibodies within a few minutes,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, co-founder and director of PathShodh. The kit also detects the level of both IgM (the first antibody produced to fight off a new infection) and IgG (a specific antibody produced about 10 days later). Most antibody strips available in the market test only for the long-lasting IgG antibodies. The mobile phone like machine will also help in maintaining records of the patients that can be linked to their Aadhaar card or even Arogya Setu, the government’s contact tracing App.The machine will cost about Rs 50,000 and the per test cost will be just Rs 450-500, Dr Kumar said.Another portable device developed by Prantae Solutions OC uses magnetic nanoparticles to separate Covid-19 antibodies from a blood sample or the viral antigen (for current infection) from a swab sample. A reader then uses absorption spectrometry – a method that observes the absorption of radiation by the sample– to give results within a few minutes. “We are focusing more on the antibody testing that would be needed more and more as people start travelling and going to offices. It will tell them whether they have already had the infection, and currently re-infection is thought to be rare. The device will cost about Rs 20,000 and the per test cost will come to about Rs 300,” said Sumona Karjee Mishra, founder director of Prantae Solutions OC.The Omix AMP test developed by the OmiX research and diagnostic laboratory uses a small portable device the size of two stacked laptops to carry out molecular test just like the gold standard RT PCR ones in small laboratories that might not have the expensive RT PCR machines. The results can be given in 1.5 hours. The test has been designed keeping in mind small neighbourhood laboratories and those in some primary health centres.“The device we have developed eliminates the need for the expensive RT PCR machine, which very few labs across India have. All the reagents needed for the test also come in a dried form inside a test tube in which the extracted RNA and a solution has to be added. For the RT- PCR test, this mix of reagents has to be prepared by a trained person. The reagents needed for RT PCR also have to be transported at -20 degrees C as compared to our format which is stable at 35 degree C,” said Sudeshna Adak, founder and CEO of Omix research and diagnostic laboratory. The test is likely to have a sensitivity of over 95% and specificity of over 99%, meaning it can detect 95% of all positive cases and 99% of all negative samples correctly,Adak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-devices-developed-for-effective-covid-19-testing/story-AYKYPRwGLoimfx7ILRxs5J.html

01-10-2020||India||India moves terrain-hugging Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range to defend LAC||India will formally induct the Nirbhay subsonic cruise missile into the Indian Army and Navy after the seventh trial scheduled next month but has already moved a limited number of the missiles to the Line of Actual Control where Indian soldiers are locked in a tense standoff with China’s PLA.The 1,000 km range solid rocket booster missile has a single shot kill ratio of more than 90 per cent. It has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times hours after India test-fired an extended-range BrahMos surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile that can hit targets 400 km away.The Defence Acquisition Council headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh has cleared the formal induction of the Nirbhay subsonic missile. The military, however, did not wait for the formality to deploy the new missile and has already moved some of them to defend the LAC against China.The missile, which travels at a speed of 0.7 Mach, has both terrain-hugging and sea-skimming capability that helps it avoid detection and counter-measures.At the LAC, the PLA’s western theatre command has deployed stand-off weapons up to 2,000 km range and long-range surface-to-air missiles in Tibet and Xinjiang after the Ladakh stand-off started in May this year. The Chinese deployment is not limited to occupied Aksai Chin but is located in depth positions from Kashgar, Hotan, Lhasa and Nyingchi along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC).Officials said Wednesday’s testing of the 400-km range BrahMos missiles with an indigenous airframe and booster is significant since it clears the decks for India to have the next class of supersonic long-range tactical cruise missile.  The Brahmos has a liquid-fuelled booster capable of ranges over 500 km.These new-age weapons will be based on solid-fuelled ducted ramjet (SFDR) technology that can be used for air-to-air missiles as well as long-range supersonic cruise missiles. The technology has been tested by the DRDO twice - on 30 May 2018, and 8 February 2019.“The new class of cruise missile will have a solid rocket booster along with supersonic speed using SFDR technology. The range of missiles can be decided on the basis of mission objectives,” said an Indian missile expert.It is understood that the new class of cruise missiles (yet to be named) will have a better circular error of probability than the BrahMos with a heavy conventional warhead to target airbases and ships of the adversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-moves-terrain-hugging-nirbhay-missiles-with-1-000-km-range-to-defend-lac/story-yf5IrC1IhjVjbVv1aOJWSO.html

The victim was cremated on Wednesday night itself after post-mortem by a panel of four doctors.The incident occurred on Tuesday when the girl had gone to take admission in a college near her village but did not return home till late evening, superintendent of police of Balrampur, Dev Ranjan Verma, said. The girl later returned on a rickshaw with glucose drip inserted in her hand while family members were searching for her.Also read: Hathras cops cremate rape victim by stealthVerma said the family members stated that the girl’s condition was not good so they rushed her to a nearby hospital and later to the Balrampur district hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.While the family has alleged that the girl’s hands and legs were fractured, police officials state that no such injuries were confirmed in the post-mortem examination. The accused have been arrested after an FIR was registered following a complaint filed by the victim’s brother, officials said. Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 376-D for gang rape and 302 for murder have been slapped against the two accused and further probe is on, the police official quoted above added.

01-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The past two weeks have seen the world come full circle in terms of its views on how Sweden has handled the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In March, Sweden’s no-lockdown, minimal-restrictions, people-know-best approach was a novelty. In April, as the lockdown took its toll on other economies, it was touted as a success. In June and July, the sentiment turned. The country’s Scandinavian neighbours even closed their borders with Sweden, and the country was criticised for not doing enough to protect lives even as livelihoods suffered. Now, over the past two weeks, Sweden’s approach, which hasn’t changed at all, has come in for praise again.I’ve long been a critic of Sweden’s approach. On April 30, in Dispatch 42, I wrote: “The death rate (as a proportion of those infected) in Sweden is over 12%; per million of population it is 230. Yet, because it did not lock down (even school terms continued) — it did issue guidelines on social distancing, but left the enforcement to its people and businesses — the country likes to see its response to Covid-19 as a success (and indeed, this is evident in some of the coverage regarding Sweden’s strategy in dealing with the pandemic). At this point in time, at least to this writer, those numbers do not indicate a success at all; in the trade-off between lives and livelihoods, Sweden seems to have swung too much towards the latter.”WATCH | ‘In Covid parameters, India faring better than many countries’: Harsh Vardhan That column was written at a time when a lockdown seemed to be the best strategy to counter the spread of the virus. The death rate has come down (it is now 6.3%). And as countries around the world have opened up, are opening up even more, or not locking down despite a surge in cases, Sweden’s strategy is being examined again, and finding several endorsers. There’s been talk of Sweden’s immunity and the concept of herd immunity. Some countries seem to be telling themselves that if lockdowns are not an option, there could be things they can learn from Sweden. That must be music to the ears of Anders Tegnell, the epidemiologist in charge of managing the pandemic in Sweden who was initially celebrated, then vilified, for the country’s Covid-19 response. In a late June podcast on Swedish radio, he called for an honest assessment of the country’s strategy. Tegnell has always maintained that Covid-19 isn’t going to go away miraculously, and that the best way to deal with it is to keep things open, but educate people on social distancing guidelines (Sweden wasn’t big on masks until recently and has just started talking about their use in public places).India announced its own its fifth round of reopening guidelines on Wednesday, paving the way for the conditional reopening of schools (online classes are to continue, though, and are preferred, the home ministry said), and multiplexes.I remain unconvinced about Sweden’s approach at two levels. One, the numbers do not show the strategy as being the success it is claimed to be. Sweden, according to the latest data on worldometers.info, has 582 deaths per million, compared to Norway’s 50, Finland’s 62, and Denmark’s 112. India has 71. The UK has 619, and the US 636. Many of Sweden’s dead were older people in care homes which were ravaged by the disease. The Swedish economy is expected to shrink by 4.6% this year, which makes it better off than some European and American nations, although not Norway, whose economy is expected to shrink by 4.2% this year.Two, the Swedish approach assumes that people know best, and will always act with their best interests in mind. There’s enough evidence on how this has played out in other countries — some researchers say that the US’s third wave can be directly correlated with how people behaved during Labour Day weekend. And, during the coming festive season (there has already been some lobbying to allow celebrations, and new reopening guidelines do allow social and religious gatherings to be held in open air, with precautions such as the wearing of masks and social distancing), it’s easy to see how this will play out in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-bd3TZFtTWeMiVegKmkiFQJ.html
01-10-2020||India||Covid-19: Data dilemma after third serological survey||The prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 virus antibodies in Delhi dropped by over four percentage points in a month, officials told the Delhi high court citing the recent serological survey, throwing up an epidemiological finding that now distorts estimates of how many people may have been exposed to Covid-19 in the national capital.The presence of antibodies, which develop after a person has had an infection, is only expected to grow within a population with an outbreak. WATCH | Covid update: Mumbai orders 72,000 injections; new Unlock 5 rules; UK spikeBut it was 29.1% among the 15,000 people sampled in August, dropping to 24.8% among the 17,197 people sampled in September, according to the Delhi government’s submissions. The decrease may be due to a change in sampling method to represent of socio-economic conditions of the people, the researchers who designed the survey said. “The sampling method that we have used this time is more representative; samples were collected based on where people lived -- planned colonies, unauthorised colonies etc,” said Pragya Sharma, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), who was part of the team that designed the survey, led by MAMC dean Nandini Sharma.Also Read: Plea wants end to pasting posters outside homes of Covid-19 patients, HC seeks Delhi govt replyIf this is the right hypothesis, it means that the exposure level is one and four individuals, and the 29.1% projected in the previous survey was incorrect due to lopsided sampling.Experts said the change in sampling criteria meant comparing the last two surveys was similar to comparing “apples and oranges”. “Ideally, seroprevalence should not go down, especially when lockdown is happening and more and more cases are being reported. The pattern will become clear after a couple of more rounds of sero survey,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, centre for infectious diseases at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The latest survey sampled people based on whether they lived in five accommodation types – planned colonies, resettlement colonies, urban slums and JJ colonies, urban and rural villages, and unauthorised colonies. It found prevalence of antibodies was lower among those in planned colonies – 22.9% as compared to 25.9% in other areas. This could be because it may be easier for people living in planned colonies to maintain social distance and hygiene, the survey states. Some researchers added that the other reason for the dip could be a drop in antibodies among people who may have been infected a longer time ago.“The August seroprevalence was based on the infections that had happened a month ago; Delhi had seen a surge in cases in June end and July. This could be the reason for high antibody prevalence in August and then dissipating antibodies resulted in lower prevalence in September,” said Dr Sharma.Also Read: Delhi reports 3,390 fresh Covid-19 cases, 41 related deathsHowever, studies on immune responses, have not borne out this trend conclusively over the period of time the three sero surveys were carried out in. “There are some data – not very robust – that shows the antibodies go down after three or four months, but it wouldn’t explain a 4% dip,” Singh said. Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), too said “there should not be a dip in the seroprevalence”. “We need to look at the minutae of how the samples were collected and how the data was analysed,” she added. A Delhi government spokesperson said the second survey sampling was done at the district level while for the third samples were selected from 280 divisions - 272 MCD wards and four divisions each of NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board. “Hence, the third sero survey was much more representative of the antibodies prevalence at population level,” he said. Officials in Delhi’s health departments earlier said, while asking not to be named, that the September sampling showed that the prevalence of antibodies have increased to close to 33%. The Delhi high court pulled up the government for disclosing these findings. “Why is the Delhi government so eager to give the survey report to the media and not to the court? Don’t show the press as unreliable. Don’t play games with the court like this…Have you issued a clarification,” a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said. The Delhi surveys have consistently shown that more women than men have had exposure to Covid-19, which is opposite of what the national-level survey has found. In the current round of surveys, 30.4% of the women participants had antibodies as compared to 27.3% men. The highest seroprevalence was among women from Northwest Delhi at 33.1%. The study authors recommended that the rounds of sero surveillance needs to be held at longer intervals – currently it is conducted during the first week of each month – as per resource constraints. “Any future rounds of the sero survey should have an enhanced focus on ensuring representativeness of the sample in terms of settlement type and socioeconomic status,” the study said. The court’s admonition came while hearing a plea filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra who had sought ramping up of tests in the city. On the last date, the court had asked the Delhi government to submit the results of the 3rd sero survey in the court and not give it out to the media. During the hearing, the Delhi government also submitted a status report stating that the Geospatial Delhi Limited (GSDL) was requested to map out fixed testing sites to ensure easy access to the residents of Delhi. The government told the court that the final map has been shared with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) with request to put it on display at prominent locations/sites at major metro stations (at entry/exit points and others as found appropriate) for the information of general public. On the issue of providing testing access through Mohalla Clinics and Community centres, the government told the court that the need for more testing sites is a constituent of the overall testing paradigm under consideration of the Expert Committee and a decision shall be taken in accordance with what the panel decides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-delhi-s-recent-serological-survey-shows-drop-in-antibodies-data-dilemma-after-third-serological-survey/story-uBHMYNufnRcPPFR9HIjcKP.html

If any officer is found guilty, strict action should be taken against them,” he wrote.Hans, who represents the north-west Delhi reserved constituency, also said in the letter the Hathras gangrape “shocked” him and the entire country, and he hoped the culprits will be “taught a lesson” so that a message is sent across the nation that any injustice to women will not be tolerated.The 19-year-old Dalit woman died at a Delhi hospital on Tuesday morning, days after being raped by four men in Hathras.The woman was shifted to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi from Aligarh on Monday after her condition showed no signs of improvement.She was gangraped on September14 and received severe injuries, following which she was admitted to the AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh.The four accused have already been arrested.The woman’s body was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging that the local police “forced” them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night.Local police officers, however, told PTI that the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.The Uttar Pradesh Police took the victim’s body and her family members back to the state from the hospital on Tuesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gangrape-bjp-mp-hans-raj-hans-wants-strict-actions-against-officials-responsible-for-hasty-cremation/story-3VE1Kaoi7J7MAVSlftVKUK.html
01-10-2020||India||India tests missile with target range of 400km||India on Wednesday test-fired an extended-range BrahMos surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile that can hit targets 400km away, amid military tensions with China in the Ladakh sector, officials familiar with the development said. The range has been increased from the existing 290km. The extended-range variant was tested from the Integrated Test Range at Balasore in Odisha. The test has cleared the decks for India to induct a second class of supersonic, long-range tactical cruise missiles, propelled by a liquid-fuelled booster capable of hitting targets over 500km away . “The missile featuring an indigenous booster and air-frame section along with many other ‘Made in India’ sub-systems was successfully flight tested for designated range at 1030 hours on Wednesday…It is one more major step in enhancing the indigenous content,” the defence ministry said. The missile was tested for the second time. The missile cruised at a top speed of Mach 2.8 (nearly three times the speed of sound). The configuration of the existing missile -- the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile -- has been tweaked to enhance its range, the officials said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday congratulated scientists for the successful launch, saying the country has achieved “yet another milestone”. Brahmos Supersonic Cruise Missile has achieved yet another milestone with successful test launch showcasing enhanced operational capabilities and additional indigenous technologies. Congratulations to all the scientists and engineers. @DRDO_India @BrahMosMissileDefence minister Rajnath Singh also congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and BrahMos Aerospace for the successful flight testing. “This achievement will give a big boost to India’s #AtmaNirbharBharat Pledge,” he tweeted. According to experts, the next class of Indian cruise missiles will be based on solid-fuelled ducted ramjet (SFDR) technology, which can be used for air-to-air missiles as well as long-range supersonic cruise missiles. The technology has been tested by the DRDO twice -- on May 30,2018, and February 8, 2019.The significance of the BrahMos test from a mobile launcher was that the cruise missile reached 75% indigenisation with India now having the capability to design the airframe as well as an indigenous liquid-fuelled booster. BrahMos missiles are already deployed in the Ladakh theatre along with a limited number of 1,000km range Nirbhay subsonic cruise missiles to counter the missiles and rockets deployed by the Chinese army in Tibet and Xinjiang. The two armies are locked in a tense standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “The new class of cruise missile will have a solid rocket booster along with supersonic speed using SFDR technology. The range of the missile can be decided on the basis of mission objectives,” said an Indian missile expert, requesting anonymity.The Nirbhay will be formally inducted into the army and the navy after the seventh trial next month. The solid rocket booster missile has a single shot kill ratio of more than 90%. According to experts, the Nirbhay subsonic missile has been cleared for induction by the Defence Acquisition Council. The missile travels at a speed of 0.7 Mach and has both terrain-hugging and sea-skimming capability to avoid detection and counter-measures. Wednesday’s successful launch has paved the way for the serial production of the indigenous booster and other indigenous components of the powerful weapon system, the defence ministry said in a statement. The missile, which has land, air and naval variants, is an Indo-Russian joint venture. India is also working on a hypersonic missile, BrahMos-II (K), capable of taking out hardened targets such as underground bunkers and weapon storage facilities at seven times the speed of sound (Mach 7) or 8,575 kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tests-missile-with-target-range-of-400km/story-uRjusnneNNQ5bdowdpOIOJ.html
01-10-2020||India||In latest easing of Covid-19 curbs, graded restart for schools, cinemas||More than six months after the Centre imposed a hard lockdown due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the Union home ministry moved closer to unlocking almost all activities by allowing a graded restart of schools, partial reopening of movie theatres, and large gatherings including political and religious events. The latest easing of curbs permitted more activities in areas outside the containment zones including opening up cinemas, theatres and multiplexes with up to 50% of their seating capacity from October 15. The government also allowed flexibility to states and Union Territories to decide on reopening schools and coaching institutions from mid-October in a phased manner.The guidelines said that the decision for opening schools and coaching institutions in a graded manner can be taken by the states/UT after October 15 “in consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation”.WATCH | Covid update: New Unlock 5 rules; Mumbai orders 72,000 injections; UK spikeHowever, if students preferred to attend online classes, they would be permitted to do so. The guidelines said attendance must not be enforced, and must depend entirely on parental consent.Officials of the Delhi government’s education department will hold a meeting on Thursday to discuss the rules issued by the Centre. “(We will) go through the guidelines, consult stakeholders, and take the decision on the reopening of schools in the national capital. We will hold a meeting on Thursday,” a senior official from Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office said on condition of anonymity.Also Read: ‘Are all swimming pools open? When will schools reopen compulsorily?’: FAQs answeredAnother key decision taken during the latest unlocking exercise — which is the fifth in a series of such decisions since June 1 but with a changed nomenclature (earlier, the reopening process was called “Unlock”) — allows political, religious, social, cultural, and sports gatherings in “open spaces” with no limit, provided people wear masks, observe social distancing and there are adequate provisions to observe such rules from mid-October. With the Bihar elections scheduled in October and the first week of November, allowing political gatherings in open spaces could pave the way for parties to hold rallies. The decision will also allow larger marriage functions, and other social and cultural activities during the upcoming festive season. In closed spaces, however, gatherings with a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity and with a ceiling of 200 people have been allowed. Till now, the number of people allowed at such gatherings was capped at 100. The guidelines, which come into effect from Thursday, said that state governments will issue their own detailed standard operating protocols (SOPs) for such gatherings in open spaces and halls. Also Read: Re-opening guidelines out: MHA lets states reopen schools from 15 October. Conditions applyThe government imposed strict curbs on activities and travel across the country on March 25. After 68 days of a hard lockdown, the government began implementing a graded plan to reopen businesses and bring economic activities, hit hard by the pandemic and the restrictions that followed, back on track in June. It was then that the “Unlock 1” phase guidelines came into place. Shops, malls, hotels and restaurants, offices and religious places have been allowed to open in a phased manner over the past few months. Restrictions on interstate and intrastate travel too have been lifted. Some train services and flight operations, including limited flights to and from abroad, have resumed.The home ministry said in the order that “latest guidelines, based on feedback received from states and Union Territories, and extensive consultations held with related central ministries and departments, are aimed at reopening more activities outside containment zones, but strict lockdown will continue in containment zones till October 31.” For theatres, multiplexes and stand-alone cinema halls, allowed at 50% capacity, as well as entertainment parks, SOPs will be issued by the Union health ministry, while the sports ministry will issue SOPs for reopening of swimming pools for sportspersons from October 15, according to the guidelines. Cinema hall owners have been demanding for a long time that they be allowed to run movie shows with limited capacity as they are facing huge losses. The ministry of information and broadcasting is expected to issue detailed SOPs in this regard in a few days.Also Read: Cinemas to reopen from Oct 15: From Sooryavanshi to Tenet, 8 films that will get a big screen releaseBusiness to business (BZB) exhibitions, which were banned since March 22, have also been allowed. International flights and railways will continue to operate as per existing guidelines. Currently, international flights are operating in air bubbles and under the Vande Bharat scheme. The guidelines said that regular international flights will remain suspended till October 31. For domestic flights, 60% capacity has been currently allowed by the government.The railways will continue to operate about 300 special trains, with regular trains suspended indefinitely. For higher education, the ministry of education will decide on the timing of the opening of colleges based on the assessment of the situation.“However, higher education institutions only for research scholars (Ph.D) and post-graduate students in science and technology stream requiring laboratory/experimental works will be permitted to open from October 15,” the Centre said.It reiterated that states and UTs shall not impose any local lockdowns or restrict any inter-state or intra-state movement of goods and individuals.Like the previous guidelines on easing restrictions, the home ministry has advised vulnerable persons (people above 65 years of age, those with comorbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10 years) to stay at home, except for meeting essential requirements and for health purposes. It said that the use of the Aarogya Setu mobile application should be encouraged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/graded-restart-for-schools-cinemas/story-kuUKIYZ0V1EYS4koVcsABM.html
01-10-2020||India||‘Spontaneous act’: All 32 acquitted 28 years later||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Wednesday acquitted all 32 persons accused of conspiring to demolish the 16th century Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 -- an event that sparked a deadly cycle of riots and communal violence across India, leaving thousands dead.The verdict by judge Surendra Kumar Yadav ended a 28-year-long legal fight, and brought relief to senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, but raised serious questions about the investigation into a high-profile case by pointing out that several pieces of evidence were either inconclusive or unauthenticated.The 2,300-page judgment ruled out any criminal conspiracy behind the razing of the disputed structure and said it was a “spontaneous act”.WATCH | ‘Welcomed Babri verdict with Jai Shri Ram chant’: LK Advani on acquittal“The incident was not pre-planned,” Yadav said, reading out his verdict in open court in Lucknow. “The leaders present there actually tried to control and pacify the mob... anti-social elements brought the structure down.”Twenty-six of the accused were present in the court, while six -- Advani, Joshi, Bharti, Kalyan Singh, Ram temple trust chief Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, and former Shiv Sena leader Satish Pradhan-- followed the proceedings on video conference. Though 49 people were accused in the case, 17 died during the litigation process.Opposition parties criticised the verdict, describing it as a “black day” for justice. Experts said the decision showed the judge was not convinced of the evidence given by the CBI. And All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Zafaryab Jilani said the verdict will be challenged in high court.Yadav said in his judgment that CBI could not produce any conclusive evidence against any accused and refused to accept newspaper reports, documents and video cassettes as evidence. It was Yadav’s last working day in judicial service after being on extension for a year.Also Read: Babri judgment sharpens political divideReading out the operative part of the verdict at 12.15pm, the judge said he did not accept newspaper reports as evidence as their original copies were not produced and proved. He also did not rely on the photos of the incident as their negatives were not produced. “The video cassettes were not sealed and even the videos were not clear and as such the same cannot be relied (on),” he observed, adding that they were not certified by any forensic laboratory to ascertain authenticity. The CBI produced 351 witnesses and 600 pieces of document in court.“Even VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) leader late Ashok Singhal was trying to stop the kar sevaks from demolishing the disputed structure because the idol of Lord Ram was also inside the structure,” the judge wrote, concluding that the event suggested that the demolition was not planned in advance.As soon as the judge cleared the accused of all charges, chants of “Jai Shri Ram” filled the courtroom. Outside, celebrations began as Hindu groups distributed sweets and flowers.Supreme Court senior advocate Sanjay Hegde said there were various instances in which conspiracy charges had been applied when, at the spontaneous call of one person, others have joined in to injure a person or beat another to death.“We do not know on weighing of the evidence, how the judge has approached the task. But in other normal conspiracy and unlawful assembly cases, we have many times seen that when one person gives a call and three or fours other persons use sticks and somebody dies, then they all get roped in under criminal conspiracy read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code (which makes every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in pursuance of a common object by one person of that). But that standard does not seem to have been applied here,” said Hegde.The verdict comes roughly 11 months after the Supreme Court last November paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple at the 2.77 acre site in Ayodhya and ordered that land for a mosque be given to the Muslim parties at an alternative spot. The ground-breaking ceremony for the temple was performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5.CBI said it will decide on filing an appeal after consulting the legal department. “After a copy of today’s verdict is received, it would be sent to the CBI headquarters where it would be studied by the legal department and a decision on filing an appeal would be taken as per its suggestion,” CBI counsel Lalit Singh said.Senior lawyer and AIMPLB member Zafaryab Jilani said the verdict will be challenged in high court. “The special CBI court says that there is no evidence which prove that Babri Masjid demolition was a conspiracy but we say there is plenty of evidence,” he said.The verdict was welcomed by the accused persons, who said their faith in religion and Ram was vindicated.“The judgment vindicates my personal and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s belief and commitment towards the Ram Janmabhoomi movement,” said Advani, who joined the proceedings via video conference. Joshi said truth has triumphed.Another accused, BJP leader Vinay Katiyar who was present in court, said: “We never had any role in the demolition. We were actually on stage that was away from the site where the demolition took place.”Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and defence minister Rajnath Singh hailed the verdict. “I welcome the acquittal of all the 32 accused in the case. This shows, that though delayed, justice eventually triumphed,” said Singh.The Congress expressed its disappointment with the verdict. “The decision of the Special Court to acquit all the accused in Babri Masjid demolition case runs counter to Supreme Court judgment as also the Constitutional spirit,” the party said in a statement.All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi called the judgment “obnoxious” and said it contradicted the Supreme Court’s observations in its verdict on November 9 last year that the demolition of the Babri mosque was a violation of law. “This verdict will mark a black day in history,” he added.A key Muslim litigant in the title suit case, Iqbal Ansari, welcomed the verdict. “The entire world saw what happened in Ayodhya…I respect the court’s verdict.”On December 6, 1992, tens of thousands of kar sevaks, or Hindu religious volunteers gathered in Ayodhya – the result of a months-long political and religious mobilisation programme. As the day progressed, the crowd swelled, and shortly after noon, the kar sevaks broke through the police barricades and charged towards the three domes of the mosque.Armed with pickaxes, shovels and ropes, many young men scaled the domes. By evening, the structure was rubble and the state government had been dismissed. The criminal case originates from two police complaints lodged at 6.15pm and 6.25pm against unnamed kar sevaks and senior political leaders, respectively, at the Ram Janmabhoomi police station.Dispute over the structure, built on what Hindus believe as the birth place of Ram, dates back to the late 19th century. For roughly two decades, two separate criminal trials ran – one against unnamed kar sevaks in Lucknow, and another against political leaders in Rae Bareli – until the apex court clubbed the two in 2017.Allahabad high court lawyer Anurag Dixit said he thought that the prosecution failed to substantiate the evidence charges against the accused. “Moreover as we saw it, most of the evidence was in the form of newspaper reports which clearly was not a strong point,” Dixit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spontaneous-act-all-32-acquitted-28-years-later/story-mNFB5t9FKCnOwtKezT4zqI.html
01-10-2020||India||In 2,300-page judgment, court picks holes in CBI’s evidence||The 2,300-page verdict by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court, which acquitted all 32 persons accused of conspiring to demolish the Babri Masjid in 1992, largely focused on the lack of credible evidence provided by the probe agency.Judge Surendra Kumar Yadav determined that in the absence of this, it could not be proved that there was prior conspiracy to raze the disputed structure. Interestingly, the report of the 1992 Liberhan Commission set up to look into the demolition concluded that there was one.  WATCH | Babri Demolition Verdict: What next? Yug Mohit Chaudhry | On The Record In court, CBI argued that the provocative speeches given by senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad provoked kar sevaks (Hindu religious volunteers) who gathered in Ayodhya for several days before December 6, 1992. Also Read: ‘Babri demolition verdict an inspiration for temple in Mathura’: Karnataka ministerTo bolster its claim, it presented newspaper reports, photographs, video recordings of the demolition, 351 witnesses and the police complaints that were lodged hours after the mosque was razed. But it ran into problems from the start. During the trial, BJP veteran LK Advani and MM Joshi’s lawyer MP Ahluwalia pointed out that in two FIRs filed on December 6, 1992, the time of the demolition was recorded differently, and raised questions about the veracity of the proof.The first FIR (197/92) lodged by station house officer Priyamwadnath Shukla at Ram Janmabhoomi police station mentioned the time of the demolition as 12pm. This FIR blamed unnamed kar sevaks.The second FIR (198/92), also filed at Ram Janmabhoomi police station, by sub-inspector Ganga Prasad Tewari recorded the time of the demolition as 10am. This FIR blamed Advani, Joshi and other leaders. Ahluwalia argued that the two FIRs, filed in the same police station, were incongruent because the second FIR – naming the politicians -- was an afterthought filed to falsely frame persons. “During trial of the case, Priyamwadnath Shukla (then SHO) failed to justify why this was done,” said the judgment.Also Read: Muslim, Left leaders decry verdict on Babri Masjid demolitionThe second problem turned out to be voice samples. During the trial, the prosecution alleged that Advani and Joshi, along with others, were present on a stage and raising slogans that ultimately provoked the mob into demolishing the disputed structure. But the prosecution failed to submit recordings in court of any slogan raised by them or their voice samples – and the defence lawyers were able to argue that the recordings were muffled and it was not proven that the speeches were indeed delivered by the accused. The court observed that this could have been a valuable proof.The third problem for the prosecution was the evidence presented in the form of newspaper articles, videos and photographs.Yadav said in the judgment that newspaper articles were not submitted in their original form, videos were not certified from a forensic lab, and photographs were given without negatives.What also went against the prosecution was that none of the local residents of Ayodhya testified against any of the accused to prove that they incited the mob.“During investigation, no person came and testified that he was involved in the demolition of the disputed structure and this is also correct to state that nobody said during the probe that he got excited from the speeches of leaders and took part in the demolition,” the verdict noted.The court also observed there were intelligence reports at the time indicating some “anti-social elements” might indulge in some “unwarranted act”. The court said that witness Anju Gupta had given a statement in court that some ‘dacoits and criminals’ were part of the crowd. Gupta was additional superintendent of police, posted in Ayodhya during the demolition. She testified in court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-2-300-page-judgment-court-picks-holes-in-cbi-s-evidence/story-8quralH5fCz6kUi4Kl4P8K.html

01-10-2020||India||Covid-19: Govt strengthens community check protocols to check spread||A little over 4 million people, mostly in containment zones, and comprising asymptomatic high risk groups, such as the elderly (above 60 years of age), children under the age of 10 , and pregnant women are now routinely being monitored on a daily basis as part of the government’s strengthened community surveillance strategy. In zones where population density is high such as slums, these high risk groups are moved to a quarantine centre to be kept under observation, according to Union health ministry’s containment and surveillance plan that was revised earlier this month. “The phase of pandemic that we are in currently demands robust surveillance mechanism in place so that infected individuals are identified and isolated in time before they further spread the disease within the community. About 80% of contacts are successfully traced within 72 hours of the process having started,” said an official familiar with the matter and who works at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). A list of 100 households is assigned to each team that screens everyone in the household, and takes readings of their temperature and oxygen saturation; those found with fever or low oxygen saturation levels are isolated for testing and further necessary action. Any temperature of 100.4 F or greater is considered as fever, and oxygen saturation level below 95% will warrant monitoring under medical supervision. The surveillance teams are formed by state authorities based on the requirement. Community surveillance is one of the mainstays of the government’s strategy to fight coronavirus disease (Covid-19) transmission in the country. The Union health ministry is focusing on strengthening surveillance further by way of contact tracing and testing in collaboration with State governments. The 4.2 million people currently under community surveillance, have been identified as high risk contacts of confirmed cases, according to the government data. The plan is active at the district and block level to ensure no infected individual is missed. Contacts put under surveillance are individuals who have been exposed to an infected person (confirmed by a laboratory) from 2 days before to 14 days after the onset of illness. According to the plan, high risk contacts include those who live in the same household as the patient; were in close proximity (within 1 meter) of the confirmed case without precautions (mask) for more than 15 minutes; had direct physical contact with the body of the patient including physical examination without personal protection equipment; or shook hands or hgged or kissed an infected person. Contacts that need special focus are largely family members, visiting relatives and domestic help among household contacts; neighbours, friends, milk and vegetable vendors etc. among contacts within community; co-travelers and drivers in flights, trains, buses, taxis and auto rickshaws etc. in the travel category; and those who attended a marriage, party, funeral , religious meeting, conferencs etc. among social gatherings. “There is a large section of workers who have been adequately trained to execute community surveillance measures. The plan has been broken down to the block level and there are dedicated supervisors who are trained in monitoring and handholding the workers wherever required,”added the official.The integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) network in states is a dedicated unit that is responsible for executing surveillance measures, in collaboration with other state health bodies that have been pressed into action. As a result of strong monitoring mechanisms and improved awareness levels the infections reported per positive case have dropped significantly. From 81-130 in May this year, the number has come down to 26-32 in August, according to the data shared by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “It highlights the importance of effective testing, tracking and treating strategy in fighting the pandemic, and that we need to strengthen it further to keep the momentum going,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR. Experts in the field of community medicine say that for effective community surveillance workers need to be trained adequately in interpersonal and communication skills. “It is not only about what is communicated to members of the community but also about how it is communicated that makes the difference,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-strengthens-community-check-protocols/story-GBv7igRpvWGaduxmdGJkFI.html
01-10-2020||India||India successfully tests longer range BrahMos supersonic cruise missile||India on Wednesday test-fired an extended-range BrahMos surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile that can hit targets 400 km away, amid military tensions with China in the Ladakh sector, officials familiar with the development said. The range has been increased from the existing 290 km. The extended-range variant was tested from the Integrated Test Range at Balasore in Odisha.“The missile featuring an indigenous booster and air-frame section along with many other ‘Made in India’ sub-systems was successfully flight tested for designated range at 1030 hours on Wednesday…It is one more major step in enhancing the indigenous content,” a defence ministry spokesperson said. The missile was tested for the second time. The missile cruised at a top speed of Mach 2.8 (nearly three times the speed of sound). The configuration of the existing missile --- the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile --- has been tweaked to enhance its range, the officials said. Increasing the missile’s range became possible after India’s induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in June 2016.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation and BrahMos Aerospace for the successful flight testing of the missile. “This achievement will give a big boost to India’s AtmaNirbharBharat Pledge,” the minister tweeted. The existing BrahMos missile is deployed in the eastern Ladakh theatre where India and China are locked in a border row, the officials said. The successful launch has paved the way for the serial production of the indigenous booster and other indigenous components of the powerful weapon system, the defence ministry said in a statement. The missile, which has land, air and naval variants, is an Indo-Russian joint venture. India is also working on a hypersonic missile, BrahMos-II (K), capable of taking out hardened targets such as underground bunkers and weapon storage facilities at seven times the speed of sound (Mach 7) or 8,575 kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-tests-longer-range-brahmos-supersonic-cruise-missile/story-SpmSG7IEpzwR1fIOkYRLtJ.html
01-10-2020||India||First batch of houses for migrant workers likely to be ready by April||The first lot of houses under the central government’s affordable rental housing scheme, targeted at migrant workers in the cities who returned home in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown, may be ready by April 2021 and construction of new units will likely take two years, officials said.Nearly 75,000 vacant, government-funded housing complexes have been identified that would be converted into affordable rental housing complexes, or ARHCs, in the first phase of the scheme. These have been built under initiatives such as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) during the term in office of the United Progressive Alliance; and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. ARHCs mark a “huge, paradigm shift in the housing rental market,” said Amrit Abhijat, joint secretary, Housing For All. “It focuses on providing comfort and utilising government’s unutilised stock. These vacant government accommodations had an investment of nearly Rs 2,000 crore and were lying useless hence it is an important utilisation of the nation’s resources. We have also decided that these houses, given to the migrants, will not be affected by existing rental laws,” Abhijat added.According to data from the ministry of housing and urban affairs, states having the most number of unoccupied houses built under the JNNURM and RAY include Maharashtra (32,202); Delhi (29,245), Gujarat (8,654), Rajasthan (7,045), Uttar Pradesh (5,923) and Haryana (2,545).At least 10.6 million migrant workers left the cities and returned to their homes in the villages of states such as West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh during the coronavirus lockdown that was enforced on March 25, according to Centre’s estimate, as many factories and business establishments in urban centres shut.The AHRC scheme was approved by the Union cabinet in July, with the expenditure estimated at around Rs 600 crore. The scheme aims to cover nearly 300,000 beneficiaries.“Under model one of the scheme existing houses will be retrofitted and leased out. Around 1.8 lakh houses have been identified. These maybe in poor, dilapidated condition and are mainly identified in states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, UP, Tamil Nadu etc. It would take at least six to seven months for them to be ready. They will be the first ones to be ready and should be taken up by March to April 2021. We have identified 75,000 beneficiaries,” an official in the ministry of housing and urban affairs said.“Under model two we will look at construction of new complexes, but that would take another two years depending on the funding available, land availability, local surveys etc. The construction time should be around 12-14 months. To begin with 2.25 lakh houses have been planned. We have also added a clause for technology innovation for the contractors and will provide them a grant for six to seven months,” the official added, requesting anonymity.According to a request for proposal finalised by the ministry seeking applications from potential concessionaires, local authorities will fix the initial rent of ARHCs, based on surveys. Rent may be enhanced biennially by a maximum of 8%, subject to a maximum increase of 20% in aggregate over a period of five years effective from the date of signing a contract. The same model shall be followed over the entire concession period of 25 years.“There has been reverse migration of workers/ poor in the country due to Covid-19 pandemic. Urban migrants/ poor consisting of workers in manufacturing industries, domestic/ commercial establishments, health sector, service providers, hospitality industry, construction or other such sectors play an important role in urban economy. They come from rural areas or small towns for seeking better employment opportunities in urban areas. … Provision of rental housing options closer to workplace will improve their productivity. Therefore providing ease of living through access to dignified affordable housing close to their workplace is an imperative,” the RFP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-batch-of-houses-for-migrant-workers-likely-to-be-ready-by-april/story-y3FqOl8JGsZN8pO76VZbAL.html
01-10-2020||India||OFB dismisses army’s report on faulty ammo||The Ordnance Factory Board on Wednesday said it did not accept the figures given out in an internal army assessment that flagged concerns about faulty ammunition supplied by the board causing casualties and bleeding the exchequer --- the army note said 403 accidents over the last six years had resulted in the deaths of 27 soldiers and a loss of Rs 960 crore An OFB spokesperson said the board was not in possession of the army report, contents of which were widely reported in the media, including Hindustan Times. Also Read: India tests missile with target range of 400km“A number of newspapers have carried articles referring to accidents involving ammunition manufactured by OFB. The articles are allegedly based on an internal report of the Indian Army. OFB is not in possession of this report,” OFB deputy director general (corporate communication) Gagan Chaturvedi said in a press release issued on Wednesday. When HT reached out to Chaturvedi on Tuesday for comments on the army’s internal assessment, he said it was not factually correct and the board would issue a statement on Wednesday. Also Read: BrahMos supersonic missile with longer range successfully test fired“For the accidents that occurred in the period between January 2015 and December 2019, where defect investigation has been completed, only 19% of the cases are attributable to OFB,” OFB said, adding that accidents are complex phenomena and can have multiple causes such as poor gun maintenance, faulty firing drill, un-validated design changes in the weapon and faulty ammunition design. The army note said 159 soldiers were injured in accidents attributed to OFB-supplied ammunition and armament between 2014 and 2020. “Out of the total number of accidents where defect investigation has been completed, only 2% of the cases where casualties have been reported are attributable to OFB. In 98% of the cases where there have been casualties, these are not attributable to OFB. Between 2011 and 2018, there have been more than 125 accidents involving ammunition procured from sources other than OFB, both domestic and foreign. It is, however, seen that only cases where OFB ammunition is involved are selectively reported in the press,” the OFB statement said. The four-page army note, reviewed by Hindustan Times on Tuesday, said that army could have bought 100 medium artillery guns with Rs 960 crore that was lost due to poor quality production.  OFB said that logic that the amount expended on the allegedly faulty ammunition involved in the highly inflated figure of 403 accidents could have financed 100 artillery guns is specious at best. “The same logic, if applied to the faulty Krasnopol ammunition imported during the Kargil war amounting to Rs 522.44 crore could have financed another 55 artillery guns,” the OFB said. The government has set a one-year timeline for the corporatisation of OFB. It announced on September 11 the setting up of an empowered group of ministers (EGoM) under defence minister Rajnath Singh to oversee the corporatisation of OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories. Thefactories controlled by the board employ at least 80,000 people who are against the corporatisation move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ofb-dismisses-army-s-report-on-faulty-ammo/story-KVmcppBHTbDVNJITYneucP.html
01-10-2020||India||MP tiger reserve now a Maoist stronghold: Police||Bhopal: Kanha National Park, known for high density of tigers, spread across Balaghat and Mandla districts of Madhya Pradesh is now virtually under the control of Maoists, according to a police officer who asked not to be named. Kanha is considered one of the finest tiger reserves in the country . It has at least 130 tigers and the highest density of the big cats after Corbett National Park, Kaziranga National Park and Ranthambore tiger reserve. The park was doing well till about two years ago when Maoists facing pressure from security forces in Mahrashtra and Chhattisgarh decided that the dense and difficult terrain of Kanha was a safe haven. Police said that in 2017 the rebels formed a platoon to increase their influence in the region and started inducting locals. Abhishek Tiwari, superintendent of police (SP), Balaghat, said Maoists’ influence was earlier restricted to just buffer of Kanha tiger reserve, which they used as a route to and from Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.“Now Maoists of Vistar Dalam (the platoon) have shifted to the core area of the reserve in Mandla and Balaghat districts and are using it as a gateway to enhance their reach to other parts of MP including the Vindhya region,” he added.The SP said this was revealed by Maoist leader Badal Singh Markam, who was arrested by Balaghat police after an encounter on September 18. On basis of his interrogation, the police recovered three troves of arms, ammunition and essential items from the core area of Kanha.A tiger reserve is divided into buffer and core zones with the latter being the most carefully protected one on account of being home to the most animals. An officer of Madhya Pradesh’s anti-Naxal wing said Maoists’ presence in core area of the tiger reserve is a new and different type of challenge as movement of people is restricted in the core area, which has poor mobile connectivity.“The forest guards can help but they are scared and are providing dry ration to Maoists,”this person added, asking not to be named. Balaghat police have issued an advisory to forest officers of Kanha Tiger Reserve asking them to provide them information about the presence of rebels.“Forest department officials should cooperate with police as it is their fundamental duty,” said inspector general of police, Balaghat, KP Venkateshwar, who has issued the advisory. He added that the police have assured the forest guards of security if they provide information or action would be initiated against them.Kanha forest department officials refused to speak on record on the advisory. A deputy ranger at the reserve, who asked not to be named, said the forest guards have no option.“Armed Maoists come to patrolling camp located at every 8-10 sq km of core area and ask for ration from the guard. Our guards are unarmed and they have no option but to give them the ration. They can’t put their life at risk by challenging the Maoists.” MP’s additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), JS Chauhan, said: “Earlier, movement of Maoists was in the buffer zone so it was easy for police to take action but now their movement has shifted to dense core zone and it is difficult for forest authorities to locate them. The unarmed guards, who are protecting wildlife in the core area and living in camps can’t resist Maoists and take risk of their life by sharing information with police.”He, however, added that all possible help was being provided to the police. Police officials said Maoists movement increased in and around Kanha, especially during lockdown, when surveillance in the forest areas was low.The anti-Naxal wing office cited above said a senior Maoist leader, special zone secretary for Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone Deepak Teltumbde alias Jeeva has been spotted in Mandla and Balaghat regions. Maoists allegedly killed a 30-year-old migrant labourer in June this year in Balaghat on the suspicion of being a police informer. As many as 800 personnel of anti-Naxal Force have been deployed in Balaghat division to combat the Maoists, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-tiger-reserve-now-a-maoist-stronghold-police/story-0OavM2CeTnrQWoERI8eUPP.html
01-10-2020||India||Plea seeks CBI probe; NHRC issues notices||A social activist filed a petition on Wednesday with the Supreme Court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or a special investigation team (SIT) into the Hathras rape-murder, including the possible inaction by Uttar Pradesh (UP) authorities. The petition came even as the National Human Rights Commission issued notices to the UP government and the police, and members of the National Commission for Women and the Delhi Commission for Women sought action. “Police personnel after getting the dead body of deceased cremated the same without the consent of the family members of the deceased. Police authorities have not performed their duties towards the victim and (are) trying to shield the accused persons. Grave injustice had been done to the victim and the system is silent on the issue,” the petition by social activist, Satyama Dubey and two lawyers Vishal Thakre and Rudra Pratap Yadav said. The NHRC asked the Uttar Pradesh government and the state’s police chief to explain their position on the incident, taking suo motu cognizance of the matter. Delhi Commission For Women chairperson Swati Maliwal on Wednesday wrote to the Chief Justice of India demanding action against officials who were allegedly involved in what she described as a cover-up.Maliwal also demanded a high court-monitored investigation and a trial to ensure the strictest and swiftest possible punishment to the accused in the letter which was also addressed to the Supreme Court’s judges.“Immediate suspension and punitive action against all erring police and administrative officials including the senior-most officials who tried to coverup the incident. Setting in place definite mechanisms to ensure that no other daughter has to suffer the same fate,” the letter said, listing out her demands.The NCW too condemned the manner in which the Hathras gang-rape victim was cremated, saying it will seek explanation from the UP Police on it.“In UP Gang-Rape Tragedy, 2.30 am Cremation By Cops, Family was Kept Out. @NCWIndia condemn it strongly. Why the family wasn’t allowed in Cremation? Why at night?@Uppolice @hathraspolice,” NCR chief Rekha Sharma tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-seeks-cbi-probe-nhrc-issues-notices/story-2BFaVM2K35B5otSQIgsILK.html
01-10-2020||India||108% rainfall recorded as monsoon withdraws||The monsoon officially ended on Wednesday with the country recording rainfall that was 108.7% of the long period average (LPA) according to India Meteorological Department, although there were significant regional and temporal variations. For instance, August received the most rains in 44 years. This is considered an ‘above normal’ monsoon. In June, IMD forecast ‘normal’ monsoon rain of 102% of LPA with error margin of +/-4% for the season.Rainfall range of 96 to 104% of LPA is considered normal and 104% to 110% is considered above normal. Last year India recorded ‘above normal’ rain of 110% of LPA making 2019-20 consecutive years of above average monsoon. This season (June 1 to September 30), northwest India recorded 84% of LPA; central India, 115%; the southern peninsula, 129%; and east and northeast India, 106%. Since a +/- 19% band is considered normal this means rains in northwest India were not deficient, ahtough those in the southern peninsula were excess. Also Read: Monsoon retreats from DelhiLPA is the average of monsoon rain recorded between 1961 and 2010. This year 95.8 cm rain was recorded against long period average of 88.0 cm for June, July, August and September.Out of 36 meteorological subdivisions in India, two recorded large excess rain ( 60% over LPA ) -- Rayalseema (82%) and Saurashtra and Kutch (126%); 12 recorded excess rain (20% to 59% over LPA); and 17 subdivisions received normal monsoon rainfall (-19% to 19% of LPA) ; and only five subdivisions received deficient rainfall. These are Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura (- 32%), West Uttar Pradesh (-37%), Uttarakhand (-20%), Himachal Pradesh (-26%), and Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh (-33%). IMD’s map shows extremely heavy rainfall spells of over 20 cm were concentrated along the west coast; central India and northeast India.On Wednesday, the monsoon withdrew from most parts of Rajasthan, parts of Punjab, the entire western Himalayan region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. The withdrawal line is passing along Lakhimpur Kheri, Shahjhanpur, Alwar, Nagaur etc in northwest India according to IMD. Complete withdrawal of monsoon from the entire country is expected by October 15.Also Read: Monsoon ends 70mm short of all-time high in Mumbai; 67% excess rain over four monthsCyclone Nisarga which formed over Arabian Sea helped with timely monsoon onset over Kerala on June 1; it pulled the monsoon winds inland along the west coast. The monsoon advanced well and covered the country by June 26 but July rains were inadequate. The weak monsoon in July was mainly due to absence of any major monsoon disturbance formation over Bay of Bengal. The monsoon trough lay to the north of the normal position near the Himalayan foothills leading to prolonged and intense flooding in the north-eastern states and Bihar. Central and northwest India remained deficient in July.In August, there were back to back formations of low-pressure systems over the north Bay of Bengal and they moved mainly towards Gujarat and south Rajasthan. Five low pressure systems formed over Bay of Bengal which caused higher than normal rainfall over central and western parts of the country. The Arabian Sea was very active with stronger winds reaching up to 50-60kmph . There were two to three spells of riverine floods over Odisha, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, south Gujarat and south Rajasthan according to IMD. August recorded 127% of LPA, the highest in 44 years and the fourth highest in the last 120 years, said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at National Weather Forecasting Centre.The monsoon started withdrawing from the western parts of northwest India on September 28, delayed by 11 days compared to the normal date for commencement of monsoon withdrawal.“We are analysing the monsoon data and will soon release a comparison with our long range forecast ,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.The all India average of monsoon rainfall was normal as per definition. However, that doesn’t give much insight into the regional manifestation of the monsoon. “Extreme rain destroyed crop in many places. In Andhra and Telangana there were two spells of extremely heavy rain which destroyed vegetables, groundnut and pulses in many places. The market price for pulses now is 30 to 40% higher than MSP which is a huge problem for farmers. Another issue is that both Telangana and Andhra farmers dont have insurance this time because the states plan to launch their own insurance company soon. So it’s a really worrying situation,” said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/108-rainfall-recorded-as-monsoon-withdraws/story-cYXEwrX9sz2W3HnLy9qNkL.html
01-10-2020||India||Superspreaders led to 60% Covid-19 cases: Study||A tenth of all patients infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) become “superspreaders” and account for 60% of new infections, while 70% of infected patients do not pass the disease to anyone else, shows a study on transmission patterns of Sars-CoV-2 published in the journal Science — the first time numbers are being put to axioms that most people accept. The contact tracing study, perhaps the largest Covid-19 epidemiological analyses conducted in the world, looked at disease transmission patterns in at least 575,000 people who were exposed to nearly 85,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in two Indian states — Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.WATCH | Covid vaccine: Covaxin phase 3 trials on 3,000 people in UP, says ministerThe study also established that children are “active transmitters” of Covid-19. A group of researchers, led by Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Washington-based Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), also found that the case fatality rate (CFR) is higher in the age group of 40 to 69 years in India than in other severely hit countries and that close proximity travel is one of the biggest high-risk behaviours for Covid-19 transmission.Also Read: Covid-19: Data dilemma after third serological surveyThe trend in the CFR, however, drops off after the age of 80, where India stands in line with other countries — a phenomenon experts said was because of selections bias, as Indians who live past that age tend to be healthier and can thus fight off the disease better.The study, ‘Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states’, published in Science, also found that the median hospital stay before death due to the Covid-19 in the two states was around five days, compared to 13 days in the United States.Transmission factorsOne of the key findings of the report was that there was a wide variance in the number of people to whom infected people passed on the virus — while many were not infecting anyone, a handful of “superspreaders” were responsible for a majority of new infections. Of the 88,616 index patients studied in the report, 70.7% did not go on to infect anyone else, the researchers found.At the other end of the spectrum, follow-up testing of exposed contacts revealed that 8% of index patients accounted for 60% of observed new infections, what researchers said was the largest recorded demonstration of “superspreading”.“Superspreading is often mistaken to be just an event. In our study we find that some people, about a tenth of the population of infected individuals are far more likely to transmit the virus than others. This probably plays a big role in all countries, not just in India,” said Laxminarayan, the study’s lead author.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayIndeed, most experts have come to accept the role of superspreaders, though, until now, no study has quantified their impact. The analysis classified all contact into high- and low-risk incidents. If people shared a house and had close-range or direct physical contact with the index case, they were deemed as high risk contact. Low risk contacts were those who shared the same space (e.g. room) as the index case without meeting the high-risk exposure criteria. It also looked at interaction types and setting that caused Covid-19 transmissions. Close proximity travel (sharing a closed space in a car or a bus), the study showed, carries the highest risk of people infecting others, and had a ‘secondary attack rate’ (SAR) – the proportion of all tested contacts, who test positive — of 79.3%.Also Read: BMC releases stricter containment zone rules; more Covid-19 tests for MumbaiIt also found high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age, with children in the age group of five to 17 years as a proportion most likely to infect others. For every 100 index patients among the five to 17 year age group, 15.4 of their contacts tested positive, the highest proportion among the age groups analysed. Those between the ages of 18 and 39 years, were at the second spot, both infecting 12.3% of their contacts.“This likely reflects the higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and other co-morbidities in the Indian population,” Laxminarayan said.Also Read: BMC plans special study of Covid-19 trends in MumbaiThe report also found that men were 62% more likely to die from Covid-19 than women and that 3. 63% of those who died had at least one co-morbidity.Experts echoed Laxminarayan’s finding and said co-morbidities such as diabetes, in particular, is more common in India and may influence the CFR for people above 40 years of age.“The age group of 40 to 70 years in India would tend to have quite high number of co-morbidities because Indians anyway are genetically predisposed to diabetes. This would heavily cause the weighing down of the CFR in that age group,” said Dr Jacob John. “Add to this that Indians tend to have to see live in a more polluted environments, so our lungs take years of damage by the time we are in our 40s. So that can be a factor as well,” he said.“The interesting thing is that people who are above 65 have a lower CFR than abroad. This may be caused by a selection bias because in India our life expectancy is on an average 10 or so years lower than the western world. So those of us who survive are generally people who are in good health, so they end up fighting off the disease more effectively,” Dr Jameel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/superspreaders-led-to-60-cases-study/story-SjFFxsAYAnBNeMDAVTYSYP.html
01-10-2020||India||India, China hold one more round of talks||Indian and Chinese diplomats held another round of dialogue on the border standoff on Wednesday with little to show beyond a commitment to implement decisions made at the last round of military talks about maintaining stability along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The latest virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs provided both sides an opportunity to review the situation along the LAC and to hold “frank and detailed discussions” on developments since the body’s last meeting on August 20, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Also Read: India, China discussing foreign ministers’ 5-point agenda to ease border situation: Chinese officialBoth the Indian statement and a readout in Mandarin from China’s foreign ministry said the two sides “positively evaluated” the outcome of the sixth military commanders’ meeting on September 21. “They emphasised the need to implement the steps outlined in the joint press release issued after the last meeting of the senior commanders so as to avoid misunderstandings and to maintain stability on the ground,” the Indian statement said. “In this context, the need to strengthen communication, especially between the ground commanders, was emphasised by both sides,” it added. WATCH| ‘Current situation at India-China border uneasy’: IAF Chief RKS BhadauriaAlso Read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his hands | AnalysisThe Chinese readout spoke about following up on decisions made by the military commanders, including properly handling the remaining local issues and jointly maintaining peace in the border areas while maintaining dialogue. The military commanders, at their last meeting, agreed to “stop sending more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground, and avoid taking any actions that may complicate the situation”. They had also agreed to implement the consensus reached by the leaders of India and China, strengthen communication, and avoid misunderstandings and misjudgements. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that both sides were focused on ensuring there were no more flare-ups in the aftermath of several incidents earlier this month that saw Indian and Chinese troops firing warning shots – the first time guns were used along the LAC since 1975. Both sides have mobilised some 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh sector and the soldiers are now preparing to dig in for the harsh winter, when temperatures can dip as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius. Asked about the WMCC meeting at a regular news briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: “The main topics discussed are how to implement the five-point consensus reached in Moscow (on September 10) by the two foreign ministers to resolve outstanding issues on the ground and to ease the situation along the border.” The WMCC meeting, co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and Hong Liang, director of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry, attached importance to the meetings of the two defence ministers and the two foreign ministers in Moscow earlier this month. “They also noted that the agreement between the two foreign ministers should be sincerely implemented to ensure disengagement at all the friction points along the LAC,” the Indian statement said, referring to a five-point roadmap the two ministers had agreed on. Both sides further agreed to continue close consultations at the diplomatic and military levels, and that the seventh meeting of the military commanders should be held at an early date so that the two sides “can work towards early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreement and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity”, the Indian statement added. The Chinese readout said the two sides would implement the five-point roadmap reached by the two foreign ministers, strictly abide by border affairs agreements and take practical measures to improve and further cool down the situation and avoid any actions that may complicate it. The five-point roadmap agreed on by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi includes dialogue aimed at quick disengagement, maintaining proper distance between troops of the two sides and easing tensions, abiding by all agreements and protocols on border management, continuing dialogue through the Special Representatives mechanism and the WMCC, and working on new confidence-building measures once the situation eases. This was the WMCC’s sixth virtual meeting since the standoff in the Ladakh sector emerged in the open in May. The sharp differences that persist between New Delhi and Beijing became public this week, with India dismissing China’s contention that it abides by a 1959 definition of the LAC, the notional alignment dividing the two countries. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “It is the stalemate which is doing the talking. This is about both sides wanting to continue the negotiations but knowing that they won’t budge from their stated positions. “It’s somewhat akin to what used to happen under the Special Representatives mechanism – both sides would meet every year to take stock of the situation and agree to meet again. If there is no movement from the Chinese side, India can’t offer anything, and that is another sign of the stalemate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-hold-one-more-round-of-talks/story-sYDg8odgiaTjvz0U7ZRGwJ.html

The estimates are marginally higher than the 143.4 million tonnes produced during the kharif season of 2019-20. WATCH | ‘Farm laws are like dagger through farmers’ heart’: Rahul Gandhi attacks CentreThe increase in food output is largely due to higher estimated production of pulses at 9.3 million tonnes, up 20% year-on-year from 7.7 million tonnes last year.

Similarly, 5,089 tonnes of copra having an MSP value of ₹52.40 crore has been procured, benefitting 3,961 farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu against the sanctioned quantity of 123,000 tonnes for Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Also Read: ‘Delhi farmers to get free chemical to tackle stubble’: CM KejriwalThe procurement of paddy started from September 26 in Haryana and Punjab.

01-10-2020||India||Setback for CBI after three-decade probe||The decision of a Lucknow special court to acquit all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition conspiracy case comes as a big setback for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which, for 28 years, has maintained that there was a conspiracy to demolish the structure. People who have been following CBI’s investigation through the years say it will be interesting to see whether the agency, which has spent considerable time. money, and energy investigating the case, challenges the decision in a higher court . For now, CBI has chosen to be tightlipped. The agency spokesperson didn’t respond to the judgement or remarks it contained on agency’s investigation skills. CBI’s choice is made difficult by the fact that the current political dispensation is unlikely to be in favour of an appeal. The people, who asked not to be named, but who ar familiar with different stages of investigation in the case said that “it was a thorough investigation”. The agency’s case was that there was a conspiracy to destroy the disputed structure so that Ram Temple could be built at the disputed site“When CBI took over a total of 49 cases – the main case naming ‘lakhs of unknown karsevaks’ in December 1992; 47 related to attacks on mediapersons; and another case against 8 BJP leaders for giving provocative speeches – it was a challenging task as hundreds of kar sevaks who were present in Ayodhya and Faizabad didn’t want to talk to the agency officials,” one of these people added.

01-10-2020||India||Babri Masjid judgment: Experts point to inconsistent reading of conspiracy laws||The conspiracy angle in the Babri Masjid demolition case was keenly followed after a Supreme Court judgment in 2017 said conspiracy charges against the accused Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders could not be dropped. The special court on Wednesday acquitted all the accused -- including former Deputy PM LK Advani and former Union ministers Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti -- of conspiring to bring down the mosque.Top experts weigh in on the grounds, evidence and yardsticks that go into establishing a conspiracy case.WATCH | Babri case: Court acquits Advani & 31 others; says ‘demolition not pre-planned’“Essentially, for a conspiracy prosecution to succeed, there has to be a proven meeting of minds and action in pursuance of the conspiracy. We do not know whether or not the prosecution managed to prove that the crowd had assembled at the call of the leaders, that the leaders had instructed or instigated them to bring with them tools of destruction and that the destruction was carried out pursuant to an incitement or a signal from the accused. The judge seems to have believed that part of the assembled crowd turned into a mob which could not be controlled by the leaders who, in fact tried to ask them not to destroy the building,” senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.Also Read: Babri Masjid demolition case: Verdict counter to SC judgment, says CongressOn the nature evidence and yardstick applied for judging conspiracy, Hegde said that there have been various instances in which conspiracy charges have been applied when at the spontaneous call of one person, others have joined in to injure a person or beat him to death. “We do not know on a weighing of the evidence, how the judge has approached the task. But in other normal conspiracy and unlawful assembly cases, we have many times seen that when one person gives a call and three or fours other persons use sticks and somebody dies, then they all get roped in under criminal conspiracy read with section 149 of Indian Penal Code (which makes every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in pursuance of a common object by one person of that). But that standard does not seem to have been applied here,” said Hegde. Also Read: Babri demolition verdict: Shiv Sena happy, but cautiousThe inconsistent application of yardsticks to determine “conspiracy” has also been a subject of recent discourse.“Ever since the Supreme Court’s Watali judgment (NIA v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali), lower courts have been applying broader and broader yardsticks to judge ‘conspiracy’. An example of this was the Safoora Zargar order denying bail, where Zargar was neither present at the scene of the roadblocking, nor had at any point called for violence, but was nonetheless denied bail on the basis that “if you play with embers, the wind can take the fire anywhere.” The Babri demolition judgment seems to suggest that this extremely broad definition (in itself a problem) is also applied selectively,” legal academic and lawyer Gautam Bhatia said.Supreme Court lawyer Kanu Agrawal, however, said that standard of proof required at the stage of conviction is very high and charges of conspiracy are not easy to prove.“Legal practitioners must, before making any sweeping statements, remember that it is a 2,300-page judgment which will have to be read with the legal position in mind that the standard of proof required at the stage of conviction is ‘proof beyond all reasonable doubts’. In law, the cases of conspiracy are as difficult to prove as they are easy to allege,” Agrawal said.Hegde, meanwhile, was critical of the fact that Congress government at the time of the demolition did not take sufficient steps to bring the case to a swift conclusion.“The government of that day did not take effective steps for investigation or constitution of a special court. The government of that day probably wanted tempers to die down more so in anticipation of the elections which were due in 1996. Thereafter, the NDA government was in power for six years with Mr LK Advani as Deputy Prime Minister and the prosecution did not take off. But for the Supreme Court order of 2017 ordering a day to day trial, we would not have even seen this end,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-point-to-inconsistent-reading-of-conspiracy-laws/story-mpxSeZmXAbGfNKcyrhOc8N.html

The range has been increased from the existing 290 km. “The missile featuring an indigenous booster and airframe section along with many other ‘Made in India’ sub-systems was successfully flight tested for designated range at 1030 hours on Wednesday…It is one more major step in enhancing the indigenous content,” a defence ministry spokesperson said. The missile was tested for the second time. The missile cruised at a top speed of Mach 2.8 (nearly three times the speed of sound). The configuration of the existing missile --- the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile --- has been tweaked to enhance its range, the officials said. Increasing the missile’s range became possible after India’s induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in June 2016.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the BrahMos missile has achieved another milestone. “Brahmos Supersonic Cruise Missile has achieved yet another milestone with successful test launch showcasing enhanced operational capabilities and additional indigenous technologies. Congratulations to all the scientists and engineers. @DRDO_India @BrahMosMissile,” Modi tweeted.Defence minister Rajnath Singh also congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation and BrahMos Aerospace for the successful flight testing of the missile.“This achievement will give a big boost to India’s #AtmaNirbharBharat Pledge,” the minister tweeted. The existing BrahMos missile is deployed in the eastern Ladakh theatre where India and China are locked in a border row, the officials said. The successful launch has paved the way for the serial production of the indigenous booster and other indigenous components of the powerful weapon system, the defence ministry said in a statement. The missile, which has land, air and naval variants, is an Indo-Russian joint venture. India is also working on a hypersonic missile, BrahMos-II (K), capable of taking out hardened targets such as underground bunkers and weapon storage facilities at seven times the speed of sound (Mach 7) or 8,575 kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brahmos-supersonic-missile-with-longer-range-successfully-test-fired/story-caeMInKNFJj9LkvgMk0m0J.html

The latest edition of consultancy firm EY India’s Economy Watch said that a second stimulus is a must. “It is clear that in order to reverse the adverse growth trend in sectors such as public administration, defence and other services, and construction, a second round of stimulus is immediately called for.”India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2020-21 contracted steeply to 23.9% mainly because of a sharp decline in various economic activities such as mining [-23.3%], manufacturing [-39.3%], construction [-50.3%], trade, hotels, transport and communication [-47%] , financial, real estate and professional services [-5.3%] and public administration, defence and other services [-10.3%].Also Read: Dearness allowance: Has DA hike suspension order been withdrawn? Centre clarifiesIn May this year the government already raised its gross market borrowing target for FY-21 to Rs 12 lakh crore from Rs 7.8 lakh crore budgeted in February. The borrowing limit was increased to combat sudden outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent 68-day hard lockdown since March 25. DK Srivastava, chief economist at EY India said, “The borrowing limit [Rs 12 lakh crore] is about 5.8% of GDP. Given the shortfall in tax and non-tax revenues due to unprecedented economic slowdown because of the pandemic, additional resources will be required to boost the economy.”“Powerful stimulus is required else recovery will be delayed,” he said adding that even state governments are spending less. “There is a significant contraction in expenditure,” he added.In the interview with HT, the finance minister also pointed at available fiscal space with states. “Even as we speak, not even one state has exceeded the 3% of GSDP [gross state domestic product] limit available to them in a normal year. Of course, we have another six months to go for the end of the year. Over and above, we have allowed them to borrow another half a percent more unconditionally; another 1% with conditions; and another half percent contingent on certain reforms,” she explained.The industry called for some extra borrowing this fiscal year especially after a weak GDP numbers in Q1. “Here is a strong feeling that we would need a second round of stimulus. In such situation it is prudent this fiscal deficit to go up. So, it would be a very difficult situation for the government if they do not go for the much higher borrowing than Rs. 4.34 lakh crore to stimulate the economy,” said DK Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Indeed, ahead of Bajaj’s comment, the expectation on the street was that the government would borrow at least Rs 1 lakh crore more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-keeps-borrowing-limit-unchanged-for-fy21/story-2pBEQQgOjH2XfhNKYxWCBL.html

01-10-2020||Editorials||Babri Masjid case closed for now||Twenty-eight years after a mob demolished the Babri Masjid in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya town and sparked off a cycle of violence and riots across India that left thousands dead, a judgment was delivered on Wednesday. The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court held that there was no prior conspiracy on December 6, 1992, and acquitted all 32 persons — including senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti, and Kalyan Singh — accused in the case. Judge SK Sharma pointed towards insufficient evidence and possible tampering of video and audio proof and blamed anti-social elements for the razing of the structure. Despite coming after nearly three decades, the judgment raises more questions than it answers. The demolition of the mosque was preceded by months of political mobilisation across the country that whipped up sentiment. Multiple eyewitnesses and journalists have reported how mobs swelled around the disputed structure for days before the demolition, with the authorities doing little to disperse the crowd. Reports also underlined how the police stood by while groups of young men with pickaxes, shovels and ropes, scaled the domes of the fragile structure, with the intent of bringing it down. Even the Supreme Court, in its verdict last year that paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple, called the demolition a criminal act and awarded the Muslim parties five acres of land at an alternative site. The CBI court verdict raises pertinent questions about the nature and quality of the probe. After years of investigation, CBI presented around 350 witnesses and 600 pieces of documents — but the verdict found that the tapes were tampered with and the documents could not be relied on. This is a further indictment of India’s creaky criminal justice system. The verdict points to anti-social elements who demolished the mosque, but there is no clarity on who they were and whether the probe agencies have any plan to identify and punish them. The conclusions also appear to contradict the findings of the 1992 Liberhan commission that blamed senior political leaders for the event.The demolition of the Babri Masjid was a sombre moment. In many ways, Ayodhya and India have moved on. An impressive Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya and a mosque complex is coming up at an alternative site. But doubts about the criminal investigation, the lack of criminal and political accountability for those who brought the structure down and the precedent set are worrying. The case may be closed for now — pending an appeal — but it does not signal closure in this painful chapter of India’s history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/babri-masjid-case-closed-for-now/story-1a3JGJDYJn3z2TZsi2OIvL.html
