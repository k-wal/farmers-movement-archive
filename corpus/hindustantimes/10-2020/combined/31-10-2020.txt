31-10-2020||News||The challenge ahead for terror-hit France | Opinion||France has faced its own share of terrorist attacks, including from among its own radicalised Muslims. The latest cycle, which has left the country in shock, began with the beheading of Samuel Paty, a school teacher on October 16, killed by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee who was enraged because Paty had shown caricatures of Prophet Mohammed during his lecture on “free speech” to students, after advising them that those offended could leave. This was followed by a fatal stabbing of three, in a church in Nice by a 21-year-old recently-arrived Tunisian migrant on October 29.President Emmanuel Macron’s statement at Paty’s memorial service describing him as a symbol of “freedom and reason” and vowing that French freedom of expression means that “we will not give up our cartoons” has provoked angry reactions from Muslims in other countries, fuelled by incendiary responses from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Pakistani Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan and Malaysian leader Mahathir bin Mohamed.Erdogan said that “Macron needs a mental health check” and called for a boycott of French goods, leading France to recall its ambassador in protest. Behind his animus are growing differences on Turkish military interventions in Libya, in eastern Mediterranean against Greece and in supporting Azerbaijan against Armenia.If France sees itself as the torchbearer for democratic, liberal and secular values, Turkey under Erdogan (who has been in power since 2003 and ensured his continuation till 2028 through constitutional manipulations) has reversed the Ataturk reforms of the 1930s to reclaim its Islamic identity and role in a neo-Ottoman avatar.Imran Khan, facing domestic political unrest, issued a series of tweets blaming Macron for “hurting the sentiments and provoking millions of Muslims”. Parliament passed resolutions seeking the recall of its ambassador from Paris before realising that the new appointee hadn’t even joined. Mahathir Mohamed’s tweet that Muslims have the right “to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past” was taken down by Twitter for being offensive. Ironically, none of them has uttered a word about the incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims by China.Other European countries demonstrated solidarity. Germany, the UK, Italy and the Netherlands issued strong statements of support. In Delhi, the ministry of external affairs issued a statement “deploring the personal attacks” on Macron while condemning the “brutal terrorist attack” on Paty. PM Narendra Modi condemned the terrorist act conveying solidarity with France, even as foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was in Paris for talks where the radicalisation of Muslim communities would have been discussed.Secularism or laicite, separating religion and State, was legalised in France in 1905. A 2004 law prohibits the ostentatious display of “conspicuous religious symbols” in public institutions. While it alienated sections of Muslims by prohibiting the hijab, it applied to Catholics wearing a large cross or Jews wearing the yarmulke (skull-cap). Faith was restricted to the home to promote civic nationalism, in keeping with the sense of French exceptionalism.France is home to six million Muslims, the largest concentration in Europe. It has been aware of growing radicalisation in certain sections of the community. Earlier this month, in a long-awaited speech on October 2, Macron cautioned about the risks of Islamic separatism leading to a “counter-society” and said that new legislation would be introduced to prevent it. This would include measures to improve prospects for socio-economic mobility, tighter controls on financing and instruction in mosques and madrassas as well as monitoring cultural and sports organisations. The suggestion that Islam was “in crisis” and needed its own “enlightenment” elicited a mixed response within France but little comment outside.The challenge for France is not easy. The idea that education, hard work and following French laws and customs led to upward mobility has been challenged in recent years and Covid-19 has only highlighted it. A recent opinion poll among Muslims in France revealed that while an encouraging 60% believed that freedom of expression should include satire, the same poll also indicated that over 75% were unwilling to include caricatures of Prophet Muhammed as acceptable satire. This is the gap that Marine Le Pen, Macron’s most likely opponent in the 2022 election, will exploit with her populist, nationalist and anti-European Union platform. This is also the gap that Macron needs to bridge with his proposed legislative initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-challenge-ahead-for-terror-hit-france-opinion/story-uFqcQYbxChA93ye5ulSUEK.html

31-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Four held for burglaries, 60 mobile phones recovered||Noida: Four men of a gang were arrested on Saturday for allegedly being involved in several cases of theft and burglary in Noida and Ghaziabad. The police have recovered 60 stolen phones from them.The suspects were identified as Bharat Singh and Sajid, both residents of Delhi, and Sahadat and Abdul Mateen, both from Ghaziabad. According to the police, the four were nabbed by a team from the Sector 24 police station from near the Morna bus stand following a tip-off. All four are in their mid-twenties and educated, said the police. “The suspects would break into shops and industrial units to steal valuables in bulk which they would then sell,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1. Police officials said that they have recovered 60 stolen mobile phones from the suspects, along with one laptop, one countrymade pistol and two knives. Of the 60 phones, 33 have been traced to a burglary at a mobile store in Ghaziabad’s Loni area earlier this month, the police said.“We are looking for other cases in which the suspects may have been involved,” said the DCP. The officials said that the gang seems to have only the four members now, but they are on the lookout for the buyers to whom they sold the stolen goods. Their criminal history is also being verified and the police suspect them to have been active for the past at least six months.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-four-held-for-burglaries-60-mobile-phones-recovered/story-NmXCAO8lFX2mqEr9cZzmwJ.html
31-10-2020||Noida||NHAI staffer killed, 2 others hurt as truck rams patrolling party on Eastern Peripheral E-way||Noida: One staff member of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) died while two other staffers were injured when a speeding truck allegedly hit them, on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on Friday night in Badalpur, Greater Noida. The victims were at the spot to attend to a call of a vehicle breakdown.The complainant, Sadhan Kumar Tiwari, a resident of Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, said that his nephew, Atul Tiwari, worked as a driver for the NHAI’s patrolling team. “At 10.15 pm, Atul received a call for help as a Maruti Swift Dzire car had broken down near Bambawad village on the EPE. Atul and two other staffers – Kamal Kumar and Mukesh Kumar – went to the spot in a patrolling vehicle,” he said. However, as soon as the three got down from the patrolling vehicle to help the stranded motorist, a speeding truck came from behind and hit the three three, Sadhan alleged in his complaint.Dharmendra Sharma, station house officer, Badalpur police station, said the person to whose car had broken down – Amit Sharma – was going to Mathura from Haridwar with his family. “Amit’s car had stopped working and he had made a call for help. It appears a speeding truck hit the three staffers, in which Atul, the driver of NHAI patrolling vehicle, died while Kamal and Mukesh were injured. The injured were rushed to a private hospital where they are undergoing treatment,” Sharma said. The patrolling vehicle and Amit’s car were also damaged in the accident, the police added. Atul was from Raebareli while Kamal is a resident of Aligarh and Mukesh is a resident of Bulandshahr. “Based on the complaint, we have registered a case against unknown persons under IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death due to negligence), and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others. We are scanning CCTV footage of cameras installed on the EPE to identify suspects,” said police. Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI, said the three victims were contractual staff of the authority. “Primary investigation shows that a speeding truck hit the patrolling team. The truck driver might have been under the influence of alcohol. We have filed a complaint with the police in this regard. The contractor is looking into the medical and insurance claims pertaining to the victims,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nhai-staffer-killed-2-others-hurt-as-truck-rams-patrolling-party-on-eastern-peripheral-e-way/story-IQ752ibjAs6wS30ikOaOnL.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Wife, teen daughters held for man’s murder||Noida: A day after the body of a 50-year-old man was found near the Morna bus stand, the police on Saturday arrested his 45-year-old wife for allegedly murdering him. The man’s two minor daughters were also apprehended for their alleged involvement in the case, the police said. According to the police, the man, whose body was found in a ditch on Friday morning, lived with his wife and four children near the bus stand in Sector 35. “There were ligature marks around his neck which suggested that he was strangled, and the autopsy has confirmed this. Also, we suspected that he had been attacked by someone close to him as there weren’t signs of struggle,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.A case of murder was registered at Sector 24 police station on Friday based on the complaint of the man’s nephew. During the preliminary investigation, the wife herself confessed to the act, the police said.“It was surprising when she mentioned that their 13 and 16 years old daughters were also involved in the incident,” said a senior police official.The police said that the man worked as a private sweeper at the Morna bus stand and was an alcoholic. According to the family, he would often abuse them while intoxicated. Neighbours have also confirmed that the man would often hit the wife and daughters, the police said.“It seems that they were fed up with his behaviour, and in a moment of rage they attacked him on Thursday night, dumped his body in a small ditch and covered it with a fibre sheet. They used a dupatta to strangle him and even hit him on his face. They had also helped look for him before the body was found the next day around 7.15am. This was not a premeditated murder,” said the DCP.The couple has six children, two of whom are adults and live separately, the police said, adding that the two youngest ones were not involved in the incident.“The woman did not mention any sexual assault, but she did say that he would often hit the daughters and misbehaved with them. She also said that he was abusive and doubtful of her character,” said Rajesh.The woman was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, while the girls were sent in juvenile custody, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-wife-teen-daughters-held-for-man-s-murder/story-zjGpRIHgSLiKojmMCNVseI.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Noida begins drive to test salon visitors, public vehicle drivers, shopkeepers||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has begun a special drive to test people visiting beauty parlours or salons, besides auto drivers, rickshaw-pullers and small shopkeepers at different localities – mainly in and around the containment zones. Health officials have been stationed outside parlours and salons in many areas and to take the samples of visitors visiting them. With the festive season round the corner, lapses in self-regulation or partaking in large congregations might prove costly, said officials.According to data provided by the district health department, while samples of 1,371 auto-drivers and rickshaw-pullers have been collected so far, samples of as many 1,269 persons at different beauty parlours and saloons have also been collected. While one woman tested positive for Covid-19 at a beauty parlour in Dadri, while none of the public transport drivers have been tested positive via rapid antigen tests so far, said officials. The 15-day drive began on Friday. So far, 4,227 rapid antigen kit tests and 2,853 RT-PCR tests have been done under this drive.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that festivities without social distancing could cause sudden surge in the number of positive cases. “Being an industrial hub, the district already has a floating population. Going by doctors, the season nowadays has maximum viral load, which is always a good carrier for many virus-borne diseases. What is more alarming that people forget social distancing norms while enjoying the festive season,” he said. The DM further said that special testing in these places will give the actual figure of the Covid-19 spread. “While beauty parlours have a large turnout of ladies, auto drivers, rickshaw pullers and small shopkeepers mostly cater to middle class people – who have started venturing out to eke out their livelihood. The number of positive Covid-19 cases will give a clear picture of viral spread or second wave in the district,” he said. The DM, however, expressed his concern over the sudden surge in positive cases this week. On Saturday, the district recorded 205 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the district’s tally to 17,839. The number of active cases reached 1,225, up from 1,133 on Friday. Many people supported the administration’s decision to test visitors to beauty parlours. Jahnavi Nayak, an entrepreneur who lives in Greater Noida Extension, said exercising caution is important. “I appeal all ladies to take all safety measures while visiting parlours,” she said.However, shopkeepers in Noida believe that people are already taking precautions before coming out to markets. Sushil Kumar Jain, the president of Sector 18 market association, said the buzz usually seen preceding the festivals is absent this year. “On the one hand, there’s a cash crunch in the market, and on the other, people are scared due to the pandemic. Besides being particular about following Covid-19 protocols, we don’t have any option left other than to interact with the public to sell our wares,” he said. CB Jha, the president of the Atta Market Association, however, said that maintaining social distancing and other safety protocols have been partially side-lined by customers. “They are mostly from the lower economic strata. When we request our customers to carry masks and sanitisers, they say they would rather buy goods or than spend money on these safety items. However, we are voluntarily giving them masks and sanitisers,” he said. Meanwhile, district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri also agreed that any lapse in maintaining social distancing might prove to be costly. “Number of positive cases has started surging again. Though our recovery and case fatality rates are very good, venturing out for large gatherings and public places might be dangerous,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-begins-drive-to-test-salon-visitors-public-vehicle-drivers-shopkeepers/story-jg0iMqjmD8M7YkKxgLT8nL.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Permits for selling firecrackers will be issued after assessing pollution situation, say Ghaziabad officials||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad district administration on Saturday said it will issue temporary licenses for sale of fireworks only if pollution levels remain under control and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) gives its nod for the same ahead of the Diwali festival. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the administration has started receiving applications for issuance of licenses for sales of firecrackers ahead of Diwali. “Any decision for issuing licenses will be reviewed keeping in mind the pollution levels in the city. Further, an assessment of the situation will also be made by the UPPCB and only if they give a nod will we allow licenses to be issued. If we allow licenses, there will be bursting of firecrackers well before Diwali and this will deteriorate the air quality further,” Pandey said. On Saturday, the air quality index (AQI) for Ghaziabad stood under ‘very poor’ category with a reading of 363. According to officials, they have received 85 applications for issuance of licenses from city areas and another 13 from other tehsils in the district so far. They added that the state home department has also added certain conditions for issuance of the temporary licences. The conditions stated that the licensee shall not possess or sell fireworks of foreign origin; they will sell ‘reduced emission’ and ‘green crackers;’ crackers having compounds such as Barium, Lithium, Lead, Arsenic, Mercury, etc., will not be sold and there will be no sales of items such as ‘;ari’ (firecrackers joined in a string). WEEKLY OFF FOR MARKETS TO REMAINTaking further measures to keep a tab on heavy rush in markets, the administration said markets will not be allowed to open on all seven days. The officials said that they have decided that the weekly off day in markets will remain in place on their respective days. “There has been a lot of demand from the different traders’ associations to allow for opening of markets on all seven days in wake of the festival season. I have disallowed this and one weekly off day will remain in place. The decision has been taken in the wake of the Covid-19 situation as a lot of mixing of people will take place in markets before the festival. So, traders have also been asked to strictly adhere to the Covid-19 protocols,” Pandey added. “During these days, we will also send our inspection teams to different markets. If any shop owner is found violating protocols or social distancing norms are not followed at their establishment, the shop will be closed down for 24 hours,” he added further. The officials said that one of their primary tasks during November is to tackle the Covid-19 situation with the sudden spike in the number of fresh cases in Delhi, besides tackling the ongoing air pollution scenario during the festival season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/permits-for-selling-firecrackers-will-be-issued-after-assessing-pollution-situation-say-ghaziabad-officials/story-jpXuVQUca3PlDxSO0wUL2O.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Leftovers from festivals, polythene bags clutter river Hindon banks||Ghaziabad: The banks of the river Hindon near Arthala, adjacent to the GT Road, are strewn with leftovers, polythene material and other garbage items after the recent festivities of Dussehra and Durga Puja. The Ghaziabad municipal corporation said it will rush teams to get the area cleaned.The banks of Hindon, popularly known as Chhath Ghat where the annual event is held after Diwali, are lying in a dilapidated state. “Throwing garbage in the river and at the banks has been a recurrent problem which has persisted over the years in the city. This is why we moved a petition with the National Green Tribunal in 2015, after which the tribunal had directed for a fine of ₹20,000 on anyone found dumping garbage at the river banks,” said Vikrant Sharma, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. “However, despite all directions and penalty clauses in place, the authorities are not harsh on polluters. Even at daytime during the festival season, one can see people throwing puja leftovers at the banks and even inside the river. Before every Chhath Puja, the corporation has to undertake a major cleaning drive to get rid of waste material dumped before and after Diwali. There has to be a check on these things,” he added. An HT team went to the site on Saturday and witnessed garbage strewn around, and approached MS Tanwar, the municipal commissioner. “I have rushed a team to the spot and they will ensure that the river banks are cleaned and clutter is removed at the earliest. Action will be taken against the violators,” Tanwar said. According to environmentalists, the dumping of garbage in the river water can further deteriorate the water quality.“Already, the dissolved oxygen levels are very less in the waters of the Hindon and several drains empty sewage in it without treatment. Garbage dumping will further deteriorate the water quality. The polluters should be fined heavily so that they don’t turn up again near the river banks to dump puja leftovers or any other form of garbage,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/leftovers-from-festivals-polythene-bags-clutter-river-hindon-banks/story-8wWDz5lgxNyy7j9bbJOo8O.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad saw zero ‘severe’ air quality days this October||Ghaziabad: The past month was the first October in four years when air quality levels did not spike to the “severe” category in the two cities of Noida and Ghaziabad. According to records of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), although the air quality index (AQI) for both the cities deteriorated, it did not fall below the “very poor” category in October 2020.An assessment of the CPCB records by HT indicates that AQI had spiked to “severe” category in Ghaziabad and Noida in October of 2017, 2018 and 2019 but not this year. The AQI for Ghaziabad was in the “severe” category on four days in October 2018 and three days in October last year. Explaining the possible reasons behind this year’s progress, Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP-pollution control board (UPPCB), said: “There were favourable meteorological conditions, as well as the fact that the festival of Diwali this year falls in November. Besides, we had taken up awareness and enforcement measures at the local level. The work for the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) is also nearing completion, which is another factor that helped curb pollution. But the major challenge will be seen in November when the festive season is on full swing. For this, we have identified traffic hotspots, and the administration has also given directions for strict enforcement.”Noida had one “severe” category AQI day in October 2018 and three such days in October 2019. Last year, the festival of Diwali was on October 27, 2019, which could be one of the propellers for the rise in AQI around that time. Greater Noida, meanwhile, had one “severe” category air quality day in October this year, and three such days in October last year, however saw no “severe” days in October 2018.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.” The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that wind speed has been better this year, which, coupled with higher temperatures, helped in the dispersal of pollutants.“We had wind speed of an average of about 10-12kmph, besides which mercury also remained high during the day, at an average of about 30-33 degrees Celsius. Apart from this, instances of stubble burning started early this year and not concentrated to a few days around Diwali. So, all these factors have helped the situation this year,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. Experts, however, caution against letting the guard loose as commercial activities slowly regain their former strength and Diwali, when people usually burn firecrackers, is close.“As a result of the lockdown, industrial, construction and commercial activities are yet to reach their optimum levels, besides which the weather was clearer this October due to meteorological conditions. However, it will now depend largely on the authorities to take up strict enforcement in November during Diwali days. Otherwise pollution levels will further deteriorate,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. On the other hand, the primary pollutants of particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 still remain a major cause of concern as they dipped a little this October, albeit still multiple times higher than the prescribed limits, as compared to the same period last year. According to experts, prolonged exposure to the two pollutants often result in respiratory issues, allergies besides other ailments.In October 2019, the severity of PM10 levels had reached their highest – up to 6-6.7 times of its standard limit – at four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad. The levels were recorded in range of 3.7-5.6 times this October. Likewise, PM2.5 also ranged 6.7-8.2 times higher than the standard limit in October, 2019 at four stations in Ghaziabad. This October, they were recorded a little lower in range of 3.6-5.4 times than the standard limits. Similarly, PM10 levels were almost five-seven times than the standard limit in October last year at the four monitoring stations in Noida. But this year the levels came down and remained in the range of 3.6-5 times in October. Also, the PM2.5 levels in October, 2019 were 6-6.7 times higher than the standard limits but this October they were recorded in the range of 2.9-5.7 times. The PM10 has a standard limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) while PM2.5 has a standard limit of 60 mpcm. “Our primary focus is to ensure that no garbage burning incident takes place and there is strict enforcement at construction sites. Further, during Diwali days, there are also plans for a drive for strict enforcement of traffic rules,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-saw-zero-severe-air-quality-days-this-october/story-poHtUiVPPKxOmd8CuIbFVL.html
31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University yet to implement reservation roster for teachers’ recruitment||Months after the Panjab University (PU) syndicate decided to revise the reservation roster for the direct recruitment of teachers, its implementation is still pending at the university.PU in December last year had received a letter from the University Grants Commission (UGC) regarding the implementation of reservation in teachers’ cadre. The draft reservation roster for recruitment of assistant professors prepared by the university was taken up by PU syndicate in March but was not approved.Following the syndicate’s decision, a panel headed by syndicate member Navdeep Goyal was constituted by PU to revisit the reservation roster and remove the discrepancies in it. However, till now, the reservation roster was not taken up again in PU syndicate for approval. The panel has asked the departments to come up with objections (if any) in the draft reservation roster.Syndic Navdeep Goyal said, “The committee has finalised the reservation roster a few months ago. It is pending for approval as no syndicate meeting is being called.”In March 2018, the UGC in its notification had directed the universities to prepare a reservation roster keeping the departments or subjects as one unit for all levels of teachers as applicable. Also, it has notified that the roster, department wise, shall be applied to the total number of posts of each category (professor, associate professor and assistant professor) within the department.Roster under review: V-CPU, which is already grappling with faculty crunch, cannot appoint teachers without the reservation roster. During a meeting in January, PU syndicate had restricted the new appointments of assistant professors in the university till the reservation roster is prepared.In the draft reservation roster, which was tabled in the syndicate in March for the recruitment of assistant professors, out of total 978 posts of assistant professors, 146 have been reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates, 73 posts for Scheduled Tribes and 39 for physically handicapped.PU senator Rajat Sandhir said, “The university cannot initiate any recruitment till the reservation roster is finalised. It is high time to finalise the same so that recruitment could be initiated in the teaching departments soon.”“The reservation roster is under review,” said Panjab University vice-chancellor Raj Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-yet-to-implement-reservation-roster-for-teachers-recruitment/story-sJE0qCtSBLTlXoXavRJcaJ.html
31-10-2020||City||2 fake email ids created in name of hospital director; Mumbai Police register FIR||The director of a prominent cancer treatment hospital lodged a complaint with the Bhoiwada police after two fake email accounts were created in his name. The complainant told the police that emails were sent to his senior colleagues from the fake accounts, requesting them for ‘favours’, to ruin his reputation. The police have registered a complaint against an unidentified person and have begun investigating the case. In his complaint, the director said that on September 18, his colleague from the radiation department informed him that she had received an email from an id that had his name. According to the police, the email stated: “I need you to please purchase some e-gift cards for me online. There are some prospects that I need to send these to but I haven’t been able to get them myself as I am tied-up in a meeting. I can’t take calls now, so an email will be fine. Let me know if it’s possible to get them for me right now, so I can give further details. I’II reimburse you before the end of the day.” The director told his colleague that the email account did not belong to him and was a fake one that appeared similar to his. On October 23, similar emails were sent to three other senior colleagues of the director. “All the three emails stated: ‘Can you please drop me a mail if you’re free’,” a police officer said. The recipients found something amiss and informed the director. He then approached the police to file a complaint, based on which a first information report (FIR) (a copy of which is with HT) was filed against an unidentified accused under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation) and 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 66C (identity theft) and 66E (violation of privacy) of Information Technology Act. “The process of writing to the email service provider has already been initiated to get the details, including the internet protocol (IP) address, of the email sender,” said another police officer. Despite repeated attempts, the director of the hospital did not respond to calls or messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-fake-email-ids-created-in-name-of-hospital-director-mumbai-police-register-fir/story-l4k7o1sQauEkSBVjV1MVxN.html
31-10-2020||City||Celebrate November 8 to 14 as Children’s Week: Maharashtra education department to schools||Ahead of Children’s Day on November 14, the Maharashtra education department has asked schools in the state to celebrate Children’s Week from November 8 to 14. As a part of the initiative, schools have to conduct activities and upload photographs of celebrations conducted online. During the week, various competitions such as essay writing, elocution and video-making will be organised for students by the schools. The education department has also announced prizes in each category for students between Class 1 and Class 12. “Teachers can upload photographs of students using the hashtag #baldivas2020. They can share these photographs across social media handles,” stated the circular issued by the education department on Thursday. Taluka and district-level committees will be formed to judge student entries as part of the competition. Several teachers said that conducting these activities for an entire week will prove to be cumbersome for them at a time when they were struggling to complete their syllabus and exams. “The department should have left the activities to schools as following a rigorous timetable will be tough at the moment. Also, as some students do not have access to internet, communicating these events to them is a tough task,” said the teacher of a suburban school. Officials from the education department said that the idea of organising this event is to encourage students to take up activities when schools are online. “It would give them an opportunity to interact with teachers and peers which will be a good change from daily classes,” said an official from the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/celebrate-november-8-to-14-as-children-s-week-maharashtra-education-department-to-schools/story-huUh8uVlc45X1qf1y9is5H.html

31-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police career counsel juveniles with criminal past||For an 18-year-old boy from Shadipur, Diwali this year will be a life changing experience, much different from last year’s, which he says brought along “life’s worst horror”. The boy, who is the son of a driver and a homemaker, had spent last Diwali at a juvenile correction home after being apprehended in a case of attempt to murder. But now, with the help of Delhi police’s career counselling workshop organised especially for juveniles with criminal past on Thursday, the 18-year-old expects to be an earning member of his family this Diwali.The 18-year-old recalls how he was in a group of boys from his neighbourhood who had stabbed a passerby to rob him of his valuables last September. “I was also apprehended and was sent to juvenile correction home where I spent 28 days. My parents were heartbroken. I was 17 then,” he recalls.Aspiring to become a fashion designer, the boy is completing class 12 and will be enrolled in a job by next month. “During counselling, I expressed my interest in fashion designing. I have enrolled myself for a vocational course to start earning some money and be able to support my family financially and have also been guided by experts on how to pursue my dream career,” the boy said.As many as 200 juveniles having criminal past in cases like murders, attempts to murder, theft, rape, pickpocket and snatching, attended the event on Thursday.At least 1,000 juveniles are apprehended every year for their alleged involvement in different crimes. Majority of them were first time offenders. Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia, who organised the sessions for the juveniles on Thursday at Raj Ghat, said the juveniles were introduced to a variety of vocational training that they can enrol for and earn sustainable income. Many who are not in a position to pay for vocational courses were enrolled free of cost. They will all be placed in different jobs as per their interests, once they’re trained, the DCP said.Another boy, a 15-year-old from Prem Nagar, who had spent ten days at a juvenile correction home in June this year, for attempting a murder, was offered a vocational course free of cost.“In June, I was accompanying a friend who stabbed a tempo driver to death following an argument. I was apprehended too and sent to a correction home. I am out on bail and my case is still pending. My father works as a labourer at a steel factory and mother at a bedsheets manufacturing unit. Because I could not pay, I have been promised free of cost training. Since I am in class 10, I have also been guided how I can pursue higher studies,” the boy said.Bhatia said, apart from career counsellors there were also criminal psychologists who interacted with the juveniles and advised them on how to be strong-willed to be able to stay away from criminal activities even in future.Anuja Kapur, a criminal psychologist who counselled these juveniles, said the first thing is acceptance. “We need to look at things from that person’s perspective. Most of the first crimes are committed under peer pressure. While reforming these children and making sure they do not return to crime, we make them realise how the crime they commit also affects their own parents and loved ones in family, similarly as it affects their victim,” Kapur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-career-counsel-juveniles-with-criminal-past/story-YaUtCONl61kgHHuOKdbyRL.html
31-10-2020||City||Congress holds Satyagraha in Maharashtra against farm laws||As part of its ongoing protests against the new farm and labour laws passed by the Parliament last month, the Congress staged a state-wide Satyagraha on Saturday (October 31), which was commemorated as the death anniversary of India’s only woman prime minister Indira Gandhi and the birth anniversary of the country’s first deputy prime minister, late Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Senior party leader and Maharashtra unit in-charge HK Patil, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, ministers Nitin Raut, Vijay Wadettiwar, Yashomati Thakur and other leaders from Vidarbha participated in the main event at Sevagram Ashram in Wardha. Throat said that the Narendra Modi government was “crushing” the farmers and workers by implementing the laws. “The laws were passed in hastily without any discussion. The system of APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) will be crushed by these laws, leaving the farmers in a lurch,” he said. Patil said that the laws were enacted to extend the benefit to a handful of industrialists at the cost of the farmers’ livelihood. He said that his party will stand by the farmers and that the central government’s motive behind the enactment of the law was “suspicious”. Over the past five weeks, the party has already held a virtual farmer rally, a state-wide dharna and a social media campaign to protest against the legislations. It said in the coming days, it will hold a tractor rally to protest against the laws and its agitation will continue until the “anti-farmer” legislations were not revoked. The party has also set an aim of collecting 1 crore signatures from farmers to register their protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-holds-satyagraha-in-maharashtra-against-farm-laws/story-7fy99LRUA14ZdCk6fPODLI.html

31-10-2020||Mumbai||Fissures in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government? Congress ministers speak out on issues||Congress leader and public works department minister Ashok Chavan has complained that local bodies under Congress don’t get adequate funding, once again bringing to light the discontent within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The ruling alliance comprises Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. Chavan, who has been touring Marathwada, visited Parbhani on Friday. At a meeting with Congress party workers and local elected representatives, he said some local bodies get less funds from the state. The municipal corporations of Parbhani and Nanded and the district council in Jalna are controlled by Congress.“We have taken the issue to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and demanded adequate funding to these bodies. We have as many as 76 corporators of the total 81 in Nanded municipal corporation; we are in power in Parbhani and Jalna’s local bodies; but there are complaints of inadequate funding from the state government,” said Chavan.Chavan also alleged Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had tried to suppress Congress and its workers when BJP was in power. “Had it continued in power, Congress would have faced tougher times. Almost 90% of Congress legislators [after Assembly polls last year] urged us to ensure the party came to power,” he said. Also expressing discontent was Congress leader and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. Speaking in Nagpur on Friday, Wadettiwar said he would support protests by those who identify as other backward castes (OBC) if admissions and recruitments are delayed further because of the legal process of securing reservation for Marathas. “We are not against reservation for Marathas, but OBCs should not suffer because of them. I have told this to the CM and will not hesitate to take the battle to the streets if the injustice continues,” said Wadettiwar. Since the MVA government was formed 11 months ago, Congress leaders have expressed their reservations on multiple occasions. In June, Congress leaders met CM Thackeray to communicate their discontent at secondary treatment, particularly in the process of decision-making. In August, Congress legislator from Jalna Kailash Gorantyal threatened to go on hunger strike with 11 other party legislators, alleging unequal distribution of constituency development funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fissures-in-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-government-congress-ministers-speak-out-on-issues/story-Vu9m1uhXMEfmKiGQwfyeJP.html
31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Dissolve MC, let administration take over: Opposition councillors write to Chandigarh administrator||The councillors in Opposition in the municipal corporation (MC) House have written to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore asking him to dissolve the MC for the administration to take over so that “some development works can be carried out and the problems of the city residents can be addressed”. Miffed over the imposition of new taxes, the councillors said that: “It will be imperative for you as an administrator to interfere in the affairs of MC at this stage…. BJP has failed so miserably to run the MC that now it is putting all the blame on the officials, when the same BJP councillors have been putting pressure on the officials to pass all taxes in the House.”Leader of the Opposition in MC House Devinder Singh Babla said mayor Raj Bala Malik was the least successful mayor in the history of Chandigarh and that rather than undertaking any development for the city in the last seven months, she had only burdened the residents with taxes.“Ethically, the mayor should resign because the BJP councilors have boycotted their own mayor’s meeting which shows that BJP is only doing petty politics and has no interest nor any concern for the development of Chandigarh,” the letter to Badnore read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dissolve-mc-let-administration-take-over-opposition-councillors-write-to-chandigarh-administrator/story-jRBFlvxRmxI0inSDcH81LM.html

31-10-2020||Mumbai||Raj Bhavan not a place to practice politics: Shiv Sena on Maharashtra Governor’s nod for MLC nominees||Shiv Sena parliamentarian and its chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut, in an indirect remark on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, stated that nobody should practice politics in Raj Bhavan. In a veiled jibe at Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, Raut said that meeting the Governor, who does not have executive powers on issues pertaining to Maharashtra, is an insult of the state. Raut, who was speaking at a function of a journalists’ body, Pune Shramik Patrakar Sangh, said that he does not think there would be any dilly-dallying by Koshyari to clear the 12 names proposed by the state for nominations to the legislative Council from the Governor’s quota. “I don’t think there will be any politics over the names of the 12 MLCs (Members of Legislative Council). If the Governor wants to practice politics, then he must come out of Raj Bhavan and do so. This is applicable to all the Governors. Raj Bhavan is not a place to play politics. We keep the honour and prestige of the position,” Raut said when asked if the Governor would create any hurdles to fill the 12 vacant seats in the upper house of the state legislature. Raut also said that it has become a trend for political leaders to knock the doors of Raj Bhavan on matters of policy or execution. Recently, leaders from the MNS and Bharatiya Janata Party had met Koshyari and put forth several demands before them. “Meeting the Governor directly on state-related issues is an insult of Maharashtra. The chief minister and the government are elected by the people. All the issues must be first taken to the minister concerned and the chief minister. Everybody knows that the Governor does not have executive powers,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/raj-bhavan-not-a-place-to-practice-politics-shiv-sena-on-maharashtra-governor-s-nod-for-mlc-nominees/story-TtfnXZXabWaYelYrpQwN9K.html

Before Saturday, the state had reported 60 deaths on May 25. Maharashtra’s toll rose to 43,911, while its case tally stands at 1,678,406 with an addition of 5,548 Covid-19 infections. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.62%. Maharashtra has now reported less than 10,000 cases a day for two consecutive weeks, with October recording 293,960 cases and 7,249 deaths as against 591,905 cases and 12,079 deaths in September.

This in turn has improved the recovery rate of the state to 89.99%. Although Covid-19 infections and fatalities are on the decline in the state, authorities have a word of caution for citizens. “The dip in cases is a good sign, but at the same time, citizens should not be complacent. The possibility of a second wave still cannot be ruled out if people step out of their homes and violate Covid-19 guidelines. European countries and many states in the US have been witnessing it. We, too, have opened up almost all activities coinciding with the festivals and even the winter has set in. This could translate in the surge in cases in next few days,” said an official, on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, 60,577 Covid-19 tests were conducted across the state in the past 24 hours at the positivity rate of 9.16%, against the cumulative positivity rate of 18.72%.

31-10-2020||Mumbai||From Bombaim to Mumbai: City’s journey over the centuries narrated through postage stamps||The city of Mumbai has often been explained through books and movies but on Saturday, the changes that the city witnessed over the centuries were explained through philately or a collection of postage stamps. These stamps, part of the personal collection of city-based historian Pascal Roque Lopes, were presented to a host of citizens through a virtual presentation, explaining the changes witnessed by the city through its railway lines, trade and banking industry, university and education institutes, law and order, sports as well as individual personalities who became synonymous with the growth of the city.The presentation was part of a project put together by Mumbai Research Centre for the Asiatic Society. “The oldest stamp shown is from 1935, showing the Gateway of India and a portrait of King George V which was worth half anna back then, while the most recent stamp is from 2019 — a commemorative stamp of Churchgate station,” said Lopes, 42, a resident of Vasai.The presentation started with Lopes showing stamps highlighting the story of the Portuguese colony of Bombaim being gifted as dowry to the Portuguese princess at her wedding in early 1500s, followed by the takeover of the province by the British. It then goes to show the coming together of two key personalities — Jagannath Shankarseth and Jamshed Jeejeebhoy, who pushed development of the city with the formation of JJ School of Arts as well as the Victoria Terminus (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)). “Slowly the story goes to look at locomotive engines with a stamp released in 1953 which shows two train engines — one from 1853 and another from 1953. This was followed by the formation of the University of Mumbai and some of the first few educational institutes, all of which found their way to postal stamps,” he said.A computer engineer by profession, Lopes’s childhood interest in collecting coins or numismatics soon turned into passion for coins as well as stamps. At present, Lopes has a unique collection of over 3,000 coins and 1,000 stamps. “Coins and stamps bring out a lot of history of the city. While in the beginning I was only collecting coins from the British era, after pursuing my master’s degree in Numismatics and Archaeology out of passion, I got engaged in collecting stamps as well,” said Lopes, a stamp and coin collector. Along with commemorative events and historical buildings that have found their way to postal stamps over the years, the presentation also highlighted the people whose photos were printed on stamps. “The first living person whose face was on the stamp was Dhondo Keshav Karve, an educator who fought for women’s education, and this stamp was released in 1958 as a commemorative stamp for his centennial birth year. Since then, many personalities have found their way into postal stamps including cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar,” added Lopes.“The idea for this presentation is to get more people interested in the world of coins and stamps and make a different niche among historians and even those whose interest lies in history of the city. Hopefully more will participate in conserving our history through philately,” said Lopes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-bombaim-to-mumbai-city-s-journey-over-the-centuries-narrated-through-postage-stamps/story-HpURfBLWC7AEVFT1gymiGN.html

Two people have been arrested.A total of 24 Indian black spotted terrapin turtles which are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (WPA); 16 Indian tent turtles (Schedule I); three Alexandrine parakeets (Schedule I); 10 Indian palm squirrels (Schedule IV); 27 rose-ringed parakeets (Schedule IV); and eight plum-headed parakeets (Schedule IV) were rescued from a godown-cum-apartment in Lalbaug by the investigation team.Narendra Muthe, range forest officer (Thane), said that based on a sting operation by the department and WWA on Friday, two persons were apprehended from Thane for possessing three Alexandrine parakeets which is in violation of the WPA. “Interrogations led us to the storage area in Lalbaug from where we seized a host of live wildlife. However, the main accused who owns the property was missing. We have taken a statement from his mother and are currently tracing the person,” said Muthe adding, “For this reason, we are not making the names of the accused public as we do not know how big this nexus might be.”Meanwhile, the accused were granted custody till November 2 by a local district court.All rescued animals are under the care of WWA. “Their rehabilitation protocol has been initiated and hopefully they will soon be released back to where they belong,” said Aditya Patil, president, WWA.Patil added that wild animals were being poached in huge quantities and sophisticated supply-chain made the nexus difficult to trace. “These numbers are an indicator that illegal wildlife trade is on the rise. However, efforts by the investigation team saved these animals from being illegal pets. What’s worse, even the people who buy these species as pets are not aware of how they are equally guilty in this crime and are enhancing the demand for this illegal trade,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/illegal-wildlife-trade-88-animals-rescued-in-lalbaug-near-mumbai/story-xS0QvU4YXQkzW9vmmi4JWO.html

31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Manimajra remains Covid hotspot in Chandigarh||Among 93 sectors, colonies and villages in Chandigarh, Manimajra remains the major Covid-19 hotspot, accounting for nearly a tenth of the total cases, maximum deaths (13) and highest number of active cases (45).Of 14,212 cases reported in the Union Territory till October 28, 1,246 have surfaced in Manimajra alone. In fact, it is the only locality where more than 1,000 people have tested positive for the virus, and the number is equal to the combined tally of the first sixteen sectors of the city.Manimajra is one of the densely populated areas of the city, and thus the chances of infection spread are very high, said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director of health services and family welfare, Chandigarh. “Manimajra remains our focus area, and our strategy remains to identify the cases as early as possible, so that clusters do not develop. If around two to three families test positive in close vicinity, we seal the area around it. Health teams then undertake extensive testing in that area, with the goal being 100% coverage,” she said. Dr Kang said special camps for testing have been planned in Manimajra, and even Pulse Polio teams that will visit the area on November 1 and 2 have been directed to report any suspected Covid-19 case.In the early days of the pandemic, the cases were largely concentrated in Sector 26’s Bapu Dham Colony, which at one point of time accounted for 75% of the total cases in the city. However, as of now, it accounts for only 2.4% cases.A senior health official said that due to strict perimeter control, infection spread was contained in the colony, but the option was not viable anymore.“In the case of Bapu Dham Colony, strict restrictions were imposed accompanied by extensive testing. However, now many people are found violating containment restrictions. Many people in low-income neighbourhoods do so as their livelihood is at stake,” said the official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/manimajra-remains-covid-hotspot-in-chandigarh/story-m3TFLRLhfzqJ8k4Cc9lukN.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi government allows buses to run with all seats occupied||Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases, Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot on Saturday said passengers can travel on all seats of public transport buses from November 1, and cautioned that travellers will have to wear face masks and maintain physical distancing. Gahlot, however, said no passengers will be allowed to travel in standing position. With the rise in number of Covid-19 cases, Delhi government had in May fixed the number of maximum passenger in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Cluster scheme buses to 20.Lt Governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairman of Delhi Diaster Management Authority (DDMA) recently gave approval to Delhi government’s proposal to run the public transport buses with full seating capacity. In a tweet, Gahlot said bus travellers will require to wear face masks and appealed to people to observe proper physical distancing in view of the Covid-19 threat.“The passengers can travel on all the seats of buses from tomorrow. No passenger, however, will be allowed to travel in standing position. Wearing mask is compulsory and I appeal to all the travellers to maintain social distance to check the spread of Corona virus,” Gahlot tweeted.With the opening of various economic activities and government and private establishments in the city, people were forced to wait in long queues often at crowded bus stands, due to restricted number of passengers in buses. The number of DTC and Cluster buses seat up to 40 passengers. There are around 3,800 buses run by the DTC and over 2,600 run under Cluster scheme of Delhi Integrated Multi Modal Transit System.The DDMA chairman had also approved the proposal of the Transport department to resume inter-state bus service.

31-10-2020||Delhi||Satyendra Jain urges people to treat face mask as vaccine for Covid-19||Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain on Saturday said it is “impossible to wipe off” Covid-19 transmission through a lockdown as the virus has “spread through the community” and people should treat wearing a face mask as a vaccine till the real medication is made available.His remarks comes amid a massive spike in fresh cases with a record 5,891 incidences reported on Friday, the third consecutive day when over 5,000 cases have been registered in a day.Interacting with reporters, the minister said that the lockdown was imposed in the beginning as “it was a new virus then” and its behaviour was totally unpredictable.“There have been a lot of learnings from the lockdown, and a lot was also said that after the 21-day lockdown the virus spread will stop or with temperature going to 40 degrees Celsius, it will stop. Did it stop? So, the learning from that exercise has been that it is impossible to wipe off Covid-19 transmission through a lockdown as the virus has spread through the community,” he said when asked if lockdown-like restrictions could be imposed if spike in cases continue.The other learning from the lockdown has been that the use of mask is an effective way to reduce the spread of the infection, he said.“So, people should treat wearing a mask as a vaccine till we get the real vaccine, which is expected in a few months,” Jain said.The Centre late March had announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. From June 8, the central government brought in gradual ‘Unlock’, under which restrictions have been eased accordingly.The Delhi health minister flagged that a large number of people in the city had become carefree and were not wearing masks in public places, and warned that ‘challans’ (fines) are being issued and stricter action will be taken against those not wearing masks.In an interview to PTI early September, Jain had ruled out the possibility of another lockdown here, saying an economy “cannot be kept shut for eternity” as livelihood of a large number of people is dependent on it.He has also asserted that “extreme caution and not panic” should be the response of the city and people should exhibit greater alertness and responsibility in public places to deal with this health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/satyendra-jain-urges-people-to-treat-face-mask-as-vaccine-for-covid-19/story-LeBKS6QqztYLXM9rFjSuLI.html
31-10-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||BJP councillors in House are family that agrees to disagree Left high and dry by her own party colleagues during the October 20 Chandigarh Municipal Corporation general House meeting, mayor Raj Bala Malik got their support back when the Congress councillors launched an attack on her during the October 29 meet. When a Congress member stood up and demanded Malik’s resignation, all BJP councillors stood up in unison in her defence. “We have differences within the family but that doesn’t mean we will allow outsiders to attack our own,” said a BJP councillor, requesting anonymity. Chandigarh lawyer puts doli ceremony on hold to attend virtual court hearing A Chandigarh lawyer, who put his doli ceremony on hold to attend a hearing via video-conference was in for a couple of surprises last Wednesday. The court not only wished him a “blissful and happy married life” in the judicial order but also granted his client interim protection from arrest till the next date of hearing. While reacting to a state counsel’s request for adjournment, the lawyer apprised the court of his wedding the previous day and said that he had been waiting for four hours for the virtual hearing since morning even as the doli ceremony was on hold. The FIR in the case was registered in May 2019 and the police had failed to file the challan even after a year. The court sought a report in the case. Meanwhile, the lawyer and judicial order have become a talking point among lawyers on social media. No more allies, but personal equations keep SAD-BJP together in Mohali Though the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has pulled out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the farm laws, former councillors of both the parties can be seen together at several meetings in Mohali to work out strategies to counter the Congress. Last week, it was reported that 70% of wards of both the SAD and BJP councillors have gone into delimitation. Twenty-three of the 33 wards from where they won last time are either in for delimitation or have been reserved for women for the upcoming municipal corporation elections. Though both sides claim they will contest separately, they have already gone to court against the Congress. Some BJP councillors are in touch with the SAD for the ticket. They were even seen in the Akali war room on Thursday. Caught on wrong foot, cop suspended for gymming Can exercise be injurious to your job? Ask Chandigarh police inspector Rajdeep Singh, who was recently placed under suspension for indiscipline after he sought exemption from election duty for Baroda bypolls in Haryana on medical grounds. What went against Rajdeep was that he was spotted working out in the gym when he had been advised rest on medical grounds. “If he can go to the gym despite being advised rest, he can go for election duty,” a senior officer said, adding election duty was one of the most sensitive duties for the men in khaki. Fine follows Sukhna photo-op for couple without masks Sukhna is crowded even on weekdays during these Covid times. People head for the lake as though it’s the only place to unwind in Chandigarh. It becomes a concern when they ignore safety guidelines, forcing the authorities to fine them. A police team stationed at the lake was issuing challans to people found without mask. A middle-aged couple that arrived without mask was merrily clicking pictures of one another right under the nose of the officials issuing challans. Once their photo shoot got over, the team promptly handed them the challan of Rs 500 each. The couple was prompt to create a scene. God knows if the fine was paid or not but hue and cry sure did alert everyone in earshot to wear a mask. Garbage collectors’ strike and the collateral damage When the municipal corporation’s sanitation workers struck work last week, some sectors with private garbage collectors were also hit. Baljinder Singh Bittu, the chairman of the Sector 21 Resident Welfare Association (RWA) and chairman of Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said: “We had hired private garbage collectors and paid them Rs 8,500 per month from the RWA’s side. However, they also joined their MC counterparts on strike!” Then there were some garbage collectors who were unaware of the strike. In Sector 48, for instance, a garbage collector was seen working during the strike. PGI drills in Covid-19 safety at start of meetings The Post Graduate Insitute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) authorities have asked officers to ensure that every meeting begins with the message on precautions against Covid-19. The aim is to sensitise officers and staff about the pandemic. The messages focus on the importance of wearing masks, maintaining social distance, hand hygiene and adherence to the health ministry’s standard operating procedure. PU’s PR director works overtime to overcome Covid curbs Taking the Covid-19 lockdown challenges in her stride, Panjab University director, public relations, Renuka Salwan has ensured the smooth flow of information from the university to the media while working from home. Not taking even her day offs during the pandemic, she has ensured PU stays in the news, for the right reasons. Facilitating the flow of information and addressing media queries in such times hasn’t been easy, but she says she managed by putting in extra time and effort.

31-10-2020||Delhi||Raghav Chadha inspects water treatment plants||Delhi Jal Board vice chairperson Raghav Chadha on Saturday inspected the production of water at the Sonia Vihar water treatment plant, a day after the ammonia levels in river Yamuna shot up to dangerous levels, forcing the Sonia Vihar and the Bhagirathi water treatment plants to operate at 70-80% capacity. By Saturday evening, both these plants resumed functioning at full capacity, Chadha announced. Water treated at these plants is supplied to south Delhi, east Delhi and northeast Delhi and parts of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) areas, which was affected. “Happy to report that both Bhagirathi and Sonia Vihar water treatment plants are now functioning at full capacity. Owing to tireless efforts of the Delhi Jal Board engineers, ammonia discharge in Yamuna by Haryana has been brought within parameters. Normal supply of water now restored (sic),” Chadha tweeted on Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Chadha inspected the Sonia Vihar water treatment plant, where water production had decreased due to the increase in ammonia levels.He also held high-level meetings with officials concerned to ensure that water production increases at both the water treatment plants, Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi.The acceptable level of ammonia in the water is between 1.7 PPM and 1.9 PPM (parts per million), but on Friday, the level shot up to around 3.5 PPM, which is perceived as an extremely high level of toxicity and is not fit for human consumption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/raghav-chadha-inspects-water-treatment-plants/story-SXKwMHBwfPSz2jTU2OD3CN.html

31-10-2020||Chandigarh||History-sheeter wanted for murder during parole held in Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police on Saturday arrested a notorious criminal who was wanted for the murder of a painter in Mohali’s Balongi in June this year.A countrymade pistol and two live cartridges were also recovered from him. Identified as Balwant, 23, of the rehabilitation colony in Dhanas, he has 12 cases of murder, rape, dacoity, theft and rioting registered against him at various police stations in the tricity, and has been convicted in three of them.Balwant was on a motorcyle when he tried to turn back and flee at a naka set up near the Sarangpur botanical garden on the Mullanpur-Chandigarh road. As his bike stopped, he left it and ran towards the adjoining forest area. Police team, led by inspector Ranjit Singh, chased and caught him. Besides a pistol, which he claimed to have procured from Muzaffarpur in Uttar Pradesh, police seized his Bullet motorcycle. A case under Arms Act has been registered at the Sarangpur police station.12 FIRs, 3 convictionsUntil his recent conviction, Balwant had been booked for various crimes in seven cases in Chandigarh (registered at Sectors 11, 19, 34 and 49, besides Maloya and Sarangpur) and for dacoity in Sector 14, Panchkula, and rape in Zirakpur. He was awarded 10-year-jail in the rape case, seven years for the dacoity in Panchkula and four for a dacoity in Chandigarh. Amid the Covid-19 lockdown, he was granted parole as part of measures to decongest jails in March this year. Since then, he has been booked twice for rioting in area falling under the Sector-36 police station and for a murder at Badhmajra village in Balongi. Sanjay Yadav, 32, a painter, was allegedly stabbed to death by Balwant and his two aides on June 28. The trigger: Yadav’s wife had confronted them on spotting them urinating near her house. While they left initially, they returned at night with more men and called Yadav outside and started beating him up. When the wife tried to rescue him, the men assaulted her as well until she fainted. When she regained consciousness, she saw her husband collapsing on the road with stab wounds, while the assailants fled the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/history-sheeter-wanted-for-murder-during-parole-held-in-chandigarh/story-CtXDSzgNYtBXRerVDuXYFL.html

31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Three held for stabbing sanitation worker to death in Chandigarh||Three youths have been arrested for stabbing a 58-year-old man to death at his house in Ram Darbar on Friday night. Identified as Vishal, 21, Bobby, 22, and Ravi, 26, they reside in the same area and work for a private firm. Police have also recovered weapons used in the crime: a knife and an ice pick.Victim Attar Singh, who worked as a sanitation worker with the Chandigarh health department, had intervened to save his son from the three youths, who had reached their house to attack him following a confrontation in the afternoon. His son Anil, 28, who works as a sweeper at the government college in Sector 50, was also injured in the attack.The family had initially refused to cremate Attar Singh’s body, but relented after the trio was arrested by Saturday evening. Anil in the police complaint stated that he was returning home when he found the three youths standing outside his house and blocking the passage. When he asked them to give him way, the trio allegedly started arguing with him, which led to a scuffle. Later, around 8pm, when Anil was sitting outside his house with his father, the trio returned and attacked him. As Anil was stabbed, Attar Singh intervened, and was stabbed with a knife and an ice pick. When Anil raised the alarm and neighbours rushed to the father-son’s rescue, the assailants fled.

31-10-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Art versus administration in the tricity||Listen! There never was an artistic period. There never was an art-loving nation ... James Whistler, an influential American artist based in the UK, shocked London town by making this statement way back in 1885. Over 200 years later one remembered Whistler when UT adviser Manoj Parida recently said, “Government money cannot be left to private hands. Culture department manages these academies as the nodal department. It ensures that rivalry among artists is contained and political selections are curtailed.” Parida was speaking to the Hindustan Times on the unceremonious ouster of some of the Akademi chairpersons and handing over of the interim charge of the Akademis to secretary cultural affairs Vinod P Kavle instead of the vice-chairman.While Chandigarh has always been infamous for its babudom with even Nek Chand, creator of the world famous Rock Garden, being forced to toe the administration’s line, Kavle’s new role evoked sharp reactions on social media. “ This is truly disturbing and bureaucratic meanness at its height. Bureaucracy is trained to be small minded, suspicious and mean,” said veteran theatre director Neelam Mansingh. Senior painter Balwinder took a dig at the Chandigarh Lalit Kala Academy being spared by the administration since wives of senior bureaucrats were allowed to share exhibition spaces with established artists. “We the local artists perhaps deserve all this.By remaining mute spectators and playing minions to babus we have been treated thus. Otherwise, how could bureaucrats have continued heading the city museum for decades? Not just the museum, even the College of Art has not had a professional artist as principal, which has proved to be very discouraging for students who come to study art.”Things are looking gloomy for the entire tricity, which boasts of the cultural academies of Punjab and Haryana and the Central body of the North Zone Cultural Centre. For many years the Haryana state akademies lay dormant after the change of government. Another problem is that the same set of names keep cropping up at one academy or another as office-bearers. Can this order be changed? Control codeShould bureaucrats manage the tricity art scene?Will bureaucratic control of the akademis and Art College negatively impact the tricity art scene? Send your responses to chandigarh@hindustantimes.com by November 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/art-versus-administration-in-the-tricity/story-xH8iaQktuDGXa3OduNn5bM.html
31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: In Covid times, weddings can be simple, chilled out and joyful too||The Covid-19 lockdown restrictions could not dampen the enthusiasm of my son and daughter-in-law for the wedding. After all, their bosom friend was trying the knot with her long time beau. Dressed in ethnic party wear, they were all set to attend the wedding. In amazement, I watched them open their laptop, log into their Zoom link, and voila! There they were: Attending the marriage online with friends from different parts of the country and across the world.Online wedding! No, that is a misnomer. It was real wedding complete with all the rituals of jaimala (garlanding) and phere (when the couple circumambulate the sacred fire). The only difference was that the guests were present ‘virtually’ via video conferencing.It was all about technology doing wonders, creating a virtual reality when physical presence was not possible in unprecedented times.I sat in disbelief to watch the wedding sans band, baaja and baarat, the big fat Indian wedding reduced to a simple ceremony with just a few people around. No grandeur, no flashy decorations, no big pandals, no array of food stalls serving a variety of cuisines, it was just a simple wedding with rituals performed solemnly.Covid-19 has cast its shadow on everything and jeopardised big events. Plans to tie knots have got tangled up hopelessly as the pandemic shows no signs of abating, so weddings are simpler with the scale of celebrations downsized drastically. Fortunately, they are lighter on the pocket of the host too.Lockdown restrictions have meant significantly pruned lists of just a 100 guests, a number much smaller in comparison to the huge gatherings in the days before coronavirus. I recall the reaction of my son’s Australian colleague when he came to know that we were expecting around 300 to 400 guests for my son’s wedding, of course during the pre-coronavirus days. “Do you actually know so many people?” he asked.Well! It was not easy to explain to a foreigner that guests in India include not just the immediate family and extended family but also neighbours, colleagues and former colleagues and sometimes even acquaintances.Weddings in India are not supposed to be intimate family affairs, but big social gatherings offering opportunities to people to flaunt their riches and connections.But then, two people coming together in holy matrimony is a special once-in-a-lifetime occasion, meant to be celebrated with friends and relatives. Virtual participation of guests may be the new norm due to abnormal circumstances, but it can never replicate the feel of physical participation; in no way replace the real experience, even though weddings don’t have to be crowded affairs.One invisible virus has shown us how a wedding can be a chilled out affair with limited guests in an intimate gathering and spark off joy. Yes, such events can be simple and joyful too.The author is a retired associate professor of MCMDAV College in Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-in-covid-times-weddings-can-be-simple-chilled-out-and-joyful-too/story-LCb6Opyxow0xJVf1oqLjQL.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||Man, his friend arrested for forcing minor daughter into flesh trade in Mumbai||A 57-year-old man was arrested by Chunabhatti police for allegedly forcing his 13-year-old daughter into flesh trade. Police officers also arrested a 40-year-old woman who was helping the accused in getting customers. Both the accused were nabbed on Thursday after the police received a tip-off about the racket. Deepak Pagare, senior inspector from Chunabhatti police station, said, “On October 28, the police control received a call from an unknown man who informed about a girl’s father and his female friend taking her to the place which is not suitable for her. The information was relayed to us and we immediately laid a trap near City Mall in Nagpada and rescued the minor.” “She was afraid and didn’t want to talk initially. A day later, she opened up and told us that it was her father’s decision. Following this, we arrested him from Kurla,” Pagare added. Pagare said the accused, during questioning, revealed the name of his female friend and the role she played, following which we arrested her. Both the accused were produced before court and have been remanded in police custody till November 5.The accused have been booked under sections 376(2)(N) [commits rape repeatedly on the same woman], 376(2)(J) [commits rape, on a woman incapable of giving consent], 376(2)(L) [commits rape on a woman suffering from mental or physical disability], 370(1) [buying or disposing of any person as a slave], 366(C) [Procuration of minor girl] and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 (penetrative sexual assault), 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 8 (sexual assault), 10 (aggravated sexual assault), 17 (abetment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and sections 4 (living on the earnings of prostitution), 5 (procuring, inducing or taking person for the sake of prostitution) of the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act (PITA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-his-friend-arrested-for-forcing-minor-daughter-into-flesh-trade-in-mumbai/story-he2uWreuFprZcZXTM4mM3O.html
31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Adding years to life and life to years with gardening||If a Chinese proverb is to be believed, “Life begins the day you start a garden”. Interestingly, whenever anyone talks about gardens, or I read about them, the thought of my neighbours’ magnificent garden comes to mind.There are many of us living around this stunning work of art which, considering its size of roughly half a football field, is more of a park.Visitors to my home too are taken in by this green space that can be a great choice for magazine covers and, I am sure, can effortlessly win gardening contests. I also consider myself fortunate to have bedrooms facing the garden, as are some people in my locality. Even while cooking we can look out and get a glimpse of the wonderful trees and shrubs.Mornings too are special as we spot the green expanse immediately after getting up from bed in the morning and drawing the curtains.The first sight brings me joy, and like a ritual, makes me smile my first smile.A lot of activities happen in the garden. As I look on, I admire the riot of colours and course the birds – some exotic – which keep flying in.An active person, the gardener is kept busy as members of the house to which the garden is attached keep walking up to him and sometimes help him with his work.An elderly aunt takes her rounds of the garden in the morning and evening, inspecting each plant closely. The vegetable patch seems to be her favourite as fresh produce is picked up every day from there and distributed among neighbours.She also has long chats with the gardener, scolding him one moment and appreciating his work in the next. Whenever I happen to meet her and as usual, praise the garden, she echoes her favourite refrain: “If I am alive it’s because of this garden, where every plant is my child. It takes away all my worries and is the heart of the house …” It’s no wonder then that English philosopher Francis Bacon felt gardening was the ‘purest of human pleasures’, and why it is also aptly said that ‘gardening adds years to life, and life to years.’However, I also want to know why we forget to create green spaces at home – even if it has to be a small corner, in the concrete jungles we live in.Green spaces can be magical. According to a National Geographic article, researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School in England analysed data from 10,000 city dwellers and found that those living near green spaces reported less mental distress. The same article also points out that Dutch researchers found a lower incidence of 15 diseases – including depression, anxiety and migraines – in people who lived within about a half mile (800 meters) of green space. Not long ago, Richard Mitchell, an epidemiologist and geographer at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, found fewer deaths and less disease in people who lived near green areas, even if they didn’t use them. Ever since I read these facts, my love for my garden loving neighbours has grown.What they have created provides us abundant joys without them seeking anything in return.And certainly, adding life to years certainly lies in our own hands too as John Muir, a Scottish American author and naturalist has said: “Nature in her green, tranquil woods heals and soothes all afflictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-adding-years-to-life-and-life-to-years-with-gardening/story-5RzQmZqr8w6naoghzzMEzI.html
31-10-2020||City||Ragpicker held for hacking Ludhiana man to death||The Salem Tabri police claim to have solved the October 19 murder of a factory worker with the arrest of a ragpicker, who was his neighbour.Investigators have recovered the murder weapon – a hooked iron rod used to pick scrap – and the blood-soaked clothes of the accused, Dharminder Kumar, 30, who was arrested from Jassiyan Road on Saturday.A pillow recovered from near the body of the victim, Uday Bhan Rao, 50, helped the police crack the case.After murdering Rao with a sharp-edged hooked rod on the intervening night of October 19 and 20, Kumar had abandoned his shanty that was on the same plot as Rao’s residence in Gurnam Nagar.“After Rao’s body was found at a vacant plot near his house, investigators realised that nothing was stolen from him, which led them to suspect rivalry behind the murder,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP, north) Gurbinder Singh.“During further probe, a pillow similar to that lying near Rao’s body was found in an abandoned shanty, located close to the murder spot. Police started zeroing in on the shanty dweller, Dharminder Kumar, and traced him to Jassiyan Road, where he had moved to after the crime,” said the ACP.Attacked victim in fit of rage“The accused has confessed to killing Rao. He disclosed that he and Rao knew each other as they both belonged to Bihar. But, Rao used to abuse and humiliate him for picking scraps. On the night of October 19, Rao again passed offensive remarks about him. In a fit of rage, he attacked the victim with the sharp-edged hook of his scrap rod and fled,” ACP Gurbinder Singh said.Inspector Gopal Krishan, SHO at Salem Tabri police station, said Kumar later hid his blood-soaked clothes at a vacant plot near Old Session Chowk. These and the weapon used in the crime were recovered after information provided by him.Rao, who hailed from Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, had been living in a rented accommodation at Gurnam Nagar with a distant relative. He worked at a woollens’ factory in Ludhiana for nearly a decade and had planned to migrate back to his native place October 20.The accused is facing a murder case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He will be produced in court on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ragpicker-held-for-hacking-factory-worker-to-death/story-BDeOmQjSf5z8iGPDOvaFWK.html

31-10-2020||City||Congress stages protest over new land laws, “anti-farmer” policies||The Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee on Saturday staged a protest against the new land laws and “anti-farmer” policies of the BJP government.Congress leaders and workers led by former minister Raman Bhalla marched towards the Civil Secretariat, raising slogans to protest against the recently amended J&K land laws and farmers’ bills passed in the Parliament. Scuffles were witnessed between protesting Congress workers and policemen. The protesters were stopped by the police near Shalimar Chowk, where Bhalla addressed the workers and media.Bhalla said, “Recently amended J&K land laws are anti-people, anti-poor and anti-Jammu”.

My idea of the institutional mechanism under Mission Youth is to ensure that we have a concrete framework and a definite timeline to execute it on the fertile ground that we have prepared,” he said.On the occasion, Sinha also announced that a seed fund of Rs 200 crores has been earmarked for creating initial infrastructure and institutional support for meeting the initial needs of this program.The Lt Governor also sought support from the national-level investors and industry experts in creating robust infrastructure and employment avenues for the youth of the UT.During the workshop, Ashok Leyland proposed the establishment of rural schools where school dropouts could be admitted to learn skills and trained to deliver in trades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/l-g-inaugurates-workshop-on-youth-engagement-outreach/story-6B7vAupIJs5UAgGyy6X7vJ.html

Despite 64.7% seats having already been filled in the first three cut-offs, seats in several popular courses — like English (Hons), Mathematics (Hons) BCom (Hons), and Economics (Hons) — are still up for grabs in some colleges. While around 45,342 out of 70,000 available seats across DU colleges were filled in the three cut-offs, there have been around 4,500 to 5,000 withdrawals and cancellations of admissions . DU dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said, “The reason behind these cancellations and withdrawals is that results of entrance-based courses have been announced and admissions in non-collegiate women’s education board (NCWEB) have also begun. Some students have shifted to those courses. Things will start balancing themselves out in the fourth and fifth cut-off lists, as most of the entrance exam results have either been declared or will be in the coming days.”In the fourth list, seats are available in English (Hons) in around 18 colleges, including Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) (98.25%), Miranda House (98%), Ramjas (96.5%), and Gargi College (96.25%) and Hansraj College (97.5%). Similarly, seats are still available in BA (Hons) in Economics in at least 16 colleges — including Miranda House (97.75%), Daulat Ram (96%), and Ramjas (97.5%). Students wishing to pursue BCom (Hons) can still apply in 22 colleges — including LSR (98.25%), Shri Ram College of Commerce (98.12%), Hansraj (97.25%), and Gargi (96.5%).History (Hons) is available in at least nine colleges including the most-sought after colleges — such as Kirori Mal College (97.25%), LSR (97.75%), Miranda (98%), and Ramjas (97%). Seats in Political Science (Hons) are there in around 13 colleges in the fourth cut-off list, including LSR (99%), Ramjas (98%), Ramanujan College (93.75%).Officials across many colleges said that seats were available in popular courses in the fourth cut-off due to cancellation and withdrawals of admissions. Vipin Aggarwal, principal of Shri Aurobindo College, said that the college has witnessed over 200 withdrawals. “Most of the cancellation took place in the second list after the results of DU entrance exams were announced. We had closed the English (Hons) in the first list itself, but now we have reopened it in the fourth cut-off list after some withdrawals,” he said. Seats are also available in Science courses. For instance, BSc (Hons) in Mathematics still open in around 23 colleges, including Miranda House (96.5%), Hindu (98.25%), Gargi (95%), and Daulat Ram College (95.5%). BSc (Hons) in Chemistry is also available in around 17 colleges including Hindu (98%), Kirori Mal (95% ) Miranda House (96.67%), and Ramjas (95%). The process for admissions under the fourth cut-off will be conducted between Monday and Wednesday.In LSR — which had announced a 100% cut-off for admissions to Political Science, Psychology, and Economics in the first list — seats are still available in many courses. While the college has closed admissions in Economics (Hons) in the fourth cut-off in the unreserved category, it has dropped the cut-off by 0.25 percentage points for admission to Political Science (99%) and Psychology (99.25%). SRCC has closed admission to Economics (Hons) in the fourth list and for admissions to BCom (Hons), it has fixed the same cut-off as in the last list --98.12%. In Hindu College, admissions closed for the unreserved category in many courses, including English, History, Political Science, Economics, and Physics. The college has re-opened BSc (Hons) in Chemistry at 98% in the fourth list. At Miranda House, the cut-off has dropped by a marginal 0.5 percentage points for courses, including Economics and History.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-announces-fourth-cut-off-admissions-to-some-courses-reopened/story-jGB7Q136XkcjEtq2j8DzJL.html
31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Soldiers rose to the occasion||But fell like petals before their time, young blood staining white ice. Where soldiers rest in eternal sleep, flowers grow in memory’s bright glow. All along river valleys and tumbling water courses of the Ladakh war theatre are found sprawling bushes of xerophytic wild roses. The roses not only bestow upon the world’s highest battlefield, the Siachen glacier, its enigmatic name but their omnipresence lends them the status of the poet’s flower of remembrance for soldiers and airmen who laid down their lives battling two inimical neighbours since 1947.The roses, which go by the botanical nomenclature of Rosa webbiana, ornament battle sites from the Tololing nallah to Drass river to the Yaldor-Junk Lungpa nallahs in Batalik and Galwan river in eastern Ladakh. The abundance of roses in Ladakh is like that of Red poppies blooming in gay abandon across ravaged WWI battlefields of Western Europe. Derided once as a weed, the peerage of poppies was elevated after the Great War to assume grace in an official role: as an evocative and powerful symbol of remembrance for Commonwealth soldiers gone raging into the night.For long, two inimical neighbours have coveted Ladakh’s rich water resources and India has fought many a war over the water roses. “Wild roses at Siachen base camp were gorgeous. As I would fly in helicopter sorties from Sassoma and along the Nubra river valley to Siachen, I could see rose bushes coming alive along flowing water. But one could not stop thinking: here was a place of such beauty and out of the world roses and yet so many of our people were dying here,” Air Vice-Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), who flew in supplies to High Altitude Warfare School soldiers in the first ever landing on the glacier on September 20, 1978, in a Chetak, told this writer. A wee short of six years later, on Baisakhi 1984, the Army launched its finest super high-altitude operation capturing passes of Saltoro ridge that guard the glacier’s western flank. The officer in the vanguard of Op Meghdoot was Capt Sanjay Kulkarni of 4 Kumaon along with 29 soldiers. That small, indomitable platoon held on to Bilafond la for 90 days securing India the glacier. Having retired as director general, Infantry, Lt Gen Kulkarni shared a poignant aside from his finest hour. “Roses were all over the base camp and snout of Siachen. Each rose had precisely five petals. They were like buttercup roses and not the conventional roses we find in gardens,” Kulkarni told this writer.Currently additional DG, Centre for Air Power Studies, Delhi, Bahadur piloted helicopters of the Siachen Pioneers in two stints totalling 700 hours of flying in the highest theatre. “Had I been married at that time, I would have picked some charming Siachen roses for my wife, Vinita,” quipped Bahadur. “Siachen means the Place of Roses (in the Balti language, sia is rose and chen is place of). The threat they face at the Siachen snout is that they come in the way of Army activities, so they were uprooted, stems used as tent pegs or even as extravagant decorative pieces. The Army assured me they would protect the roses. Hopefully someday, there will be peace on Siachen. Roses (sias) will grow wild, ibexes will roam and mountaineers will explore and climb freely,” legendary mountaineer and author of Siachen Glacier: The Battle of Roses, Harish Kapadia, told this writer.When winters render food scarce, birds such as Yellow-billed choughs nibble at seeds of the benign rose bush. Petals yield ethnomedicinal cures for nasal bleeding, nose swelling, hepatitis, jaundice and liver diseases. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-soldiers-rose-to-the-occasion/story-VN2SsHI9LD7qIOk57PRuxL.html

31-10-2020||Pune||Election Commission is BJP’s branch: Raut||Shiv Sena Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha Sanjay Raut on Saturday alleged that the Election Commission of India (ECI) is a branch of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the constitutional authority is desisting from taking action against the party. Raut, while responding to a question on the ECI giving a pass to BJP’s promise to distribute Covid-19 vaccine for free, said that the opposition cannot expect anything better from the Election Commission. “The Election Commission is BJP’s branch. What can anyone do? What else we can expect?” Raut asked. The Sena MP, who is also the party spokesperson, said that while Bihar polls are being watched keenly, he would not be surprised if the Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav became the chief minister after the assembly elections. “The youngster does not have any support and investigation agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are hounding him. While his family members are in jail, he is challenging the Union government as it is suppressing opposition parties,” the Sena leader said, referring to Tejashwi. “Therefore, I will not be surprised if he became the chief minister of Bihar,” Raut added. He also hit out at National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti who have sought restoration of Article 370 which gave autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir. When asked about opposition leaders meeting Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari with their demands, the Sena leader said they should meet the ministers concerned instead. Meeting the governor directly shows disrespect for the state, he said. On Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s role in the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition, Raut said that Pawar advises the state government and no one should mind it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/election-commission-is-bjp-s-branch-raut/story-TyJKuyv974IXSSjrGbtKCL.html
31-10-2020||Bangalore||BS Yediyurappa promises cabinet expansion soon after assembly bypolls||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Saturday said cabinet expansion would take place soon after the November 3 assembly bypoll and that the BJP candidate in RR Nagar, Munirathna, would be made a minister “soon after he wins”.“It (expansion) has been put on hold for quite some time due to various reasons. I will go to Delhi to discuss it with party leaders. It will take place soon after the bypoll results are announced,” he told reporters ahead of a road show in Rajarajeshwari Nagar.Asked about his announcement at the road show that Munirathna would be made minister, he said “I am 100% going to make him minister after he wins the bypoll.” Congress state chief D K Shivakumar flayed the announcement on Munirathna, saying that it was a violation of the model code of conduct.“Let him be made chief minister, but now saying that he (Munirathna) will be made minister itself is a poll code violation,” Shivakumar told reporters.Addressing the road show, Yediyurappa asked voters to elect Munirathna by at least a 50,000 vote margin, “paving the way for him to be made minister soon after he wins.” He lauded the steps taken by Munirathna to help people of his constituency during the coronavirus induced lockdown and urged them to help him win by at least a 50,000 margin, “paving the way for making him a minister.” The Chief Minister said Rs 900 crore worth work has already been sanctioned in the constituency.Yediyurappa, seeking to silence his critics within and outside BJP, reiterated that he would continue as Chief Minister for the rest of the term and run the party and government.On October 21, senior BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had said that Yediyurappa would not remain Chief Minister for long and the high command had decided that his successor would be from the north Karnataka region.While BJP leaders downplayed Yatnal’s statement, saying there was no truth in it, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told a private news channel recently that the Chief Minister will not continue after the Bihar election.Basavaraj Horatti of JD(S) too had claimed a week ago that Yatnal has the backing of the BJP high command as he has not been removed from the party yet.The RR Nagar bypoll has become a prestigious battle with all three political parties -- BJP, Congress and JD(S) fighting it out intensely.The election was warranted as Munirathna, a former Congress MLA, resigned from the assembly last year and joined the BJP.The Congress has fielded former IAS officer late D K Ravi’s wife and senior leader Hanumantharayappa’s daughter H Kusuma, while the JD(S) has fielded V Krishnamurthy.The by elections at RR Nagar in the city and Sira in Tumakuru district will be held on November 3.Counting of votes is on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bs-yediyurappa-promises-cabinet-expansion-soon-after-assembly-bypolls/story-rOxU5ZhnyGM8hN2fAy8zbK.html

31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University senate’s term ends amid uncertainty over polls||The four-year term of Panjab University’s senate — the institution’s elected apex governing body — ended on Saturday amid uncertainty over fresh polls, which have been postponed indefinitely in the wake of the pandemic.It is for the first time since the Partition that fresh elections were not held before the end of the incumbent senate’s term. The term of the syndicate — an executive body elected from among members of the senate annually — will also end by the end of the year. On October 15, PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar had postponed the polls for the second time, citing the pandemic. Senators in favour of holding the polls had also written to vice-president of India Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the university’s chancellor .Syndicate member Navdeep Goyal says, “Respecting the PU calendar, senate elections should be held to ensure smooth functioning of the university and to avoid a vacuum.”The PU senate has 91 members, of which 36 are nominated by the chancellor. As per the varsity’s calendar the senate ‘shall have the entire management of, and superintendence over the affairs, concerns and property of the university and shall provide for that management, and exercise that superintendence in accordance with the statutes, rules and regulations for the time being in force’.Calling the indefinite deferment of senate polls an unfortunate development, senator Ashok Goyal said, “The university has never been in such a vacuum. The elections were postponed on unfounded grounds and we have demanded that term of senate, whose term ended on Saturday, should be extended till the next senate is formed.”Apprehensions over change in governing structure Members are also apprehensive that the governing structure of the varsity may be changed and the senate will be replaced with a board of governors. In a recent notice, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had asked higher educational institutions to initiate governance reforms in universities as per the National Education Policy (NEP-2020).Former Panjab University vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover said, “I am sad that the democratic structure at PU may not continue. However, the system had also been misused to an extent that it was no longer a democratic system. It needed reforms but the governing bodies at PU failed to bring about the much-needed changes.”A response from the chancellor’s office is awaited.A student body, Students for Society (SFS), has also demanded that the senate polls be held. The Punjab Educationist Forum also passed a resolution on Saturday expressing concern over the delay in senate polls and appealed to the vice-chancellor to conduct elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-senate-s-term-ends-amid-uncertainty-over-polls/story-fK85PScz1UVzwmn9N437qI.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||Man places grocery orders in others’ names, flee with items and change money||A 24-year-old man, who was into snatching and robbery until two years ago, was arrested Friday after he started a new con -- placing grocery orders in the name of some resident and then making off with groceries and change money, police said. Posing as a resident of different south Delhi neighbourhoods, the arrested accused Vikash Kumar would allegedly place orders over phone at local grocery stores, and collect the items from the delivery agent, after claiming to be entrusted by the resident to do so, and then decamp with the items as well as the change money for large denominations.Kumar kept up this con for two years until Friday, when one of the residents complained to the police, said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east).“It so happened that a grocery store owner received a call on Tuesday from Kumar who posed as a resident of Lajpat Nagar’s D Block. “He ordered ghee and a face wash and asked the store owner to send the delivery agent with ₹1,700 as change for a ₹2,000 note,” said the DCP.When the delivery agent arrived outside the house, Kumar stepped forward and said he was the house owner’s driver and had been asked to collect the items.“Kumar collected the two items worth ₹300 and also the ₹1,700 change from the delivery agent and left saying he would return with the ₹2,000 note, but he never did,” Meena said.When the shopkeeper got to know that no such order was placed by the owner of that house, he informed the police control room.The DCP said it was a rare occasion when any of Kumar’s victims had sought police help. “Kumar would place orders for products worth less than ₹1,000. He got away with it as hardly anyone would approach the police for that small a loss,” Meena said.But this time, the police registered a cheating case and began checking CCTV footage and call detail records. That led them to Kumar’s home in Dakshinpuri, from where he was arrested. The DCP said Kumar was into robbery and snatching until two years ago. He had eight such police cases against him. “We are ascertaining if his other victims had filed police cases in the past,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-places-grocery-orders-in-others-names-flee-with-items-and-change-money/story-VbvLWEIuPzAHGCVwLtZDaO.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||No water shortage in Delhi from Sunday as two water treatment plants resumes operation: Raghav Chadha||Water treatment plants at Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi which was shut as water from the Yamuna contained spiked levels of ammonia have now resumed working, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice president Raghav Chadha said on Saturday, after inspecting the plants.Raghav Chadha said that ammonia levels rise in the Yamuna was due to discharge pollutants from Haryana which impacted the capacity of the two water treatment plants. “Ammonia level had risen in Yamuna river so we had to shut two water treatment plants. The level of the pollutant is reducing now and the two plants have resumed operation. There’ll be no problem in the supply of water from tomorrow,” Chadha said.With the rise in levels of ammonia, people in parts of the city had complained of dirty water and water supply shortage. The DJB vice president, on Friday, had assured normal water supply in the city from Saturday.“The Yamuna river water coming from Haryana to Delhi had spiked levels of ammonia and reached 3 ppm (parts per million). Because of this, two major water treatment plants had to be shut. This affected water supply in few parts of north, north-west and south Delhi,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-water-shortage-in-delhi-from-sunday-as-two-water-treatment-plants-resumes-operation-raghav-chadha/story-LQuEgByEtXp4I7gABUojHI.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||Civil society comes forward to pay CBSE exam fee of class 10, 12 students in govt schools||From doctors and book publishers to grocery store owners and members of resident welfare associations, several civil society members have come forward and helped pay the board exam fee of Class 10 and 12 students of Delhi government schools. Saturday is the last date to pay the fee. In 2019, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had hiked the board examination exponentially. The fee of class 10 and 12 students (general category) in Delhi government schools was increased from ₹375 and ₹600, respectively, to ₹1,500 for five subjects. For SC/ST candidates in class 10, the examination fee was increased from ₹375 to ₹1,200 and for class 12 from ₹600 to ₹1,200. CBSE controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj had explained that the increase was necessary since CBSE is a self-financing board and the expenditure to conduct exams was likely to increase this time due to the Covid-related precautionsFollowing this, the Delhi government had announced that it would pay the fee for over 3.14 lakh Class 10 and 12 students in government schools. However, this year, owing to fund crunch, the education department asked heads of schools to follow the “2018-19 status”, meaning that the fee had to be paid by students themselves. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector-8, said, “We had initially planned to help around five or six needy students by paying the fee from our own pockets. But due to the coverage on the issue which raised much awareness, scores of people came forward to pay the fee and we managed to raise around ₹2 lakh, thus helping over 100 students.” On September 28, HT had reported that principals of government schools were setting up funds and expediting their efforts to arrange the money for needy students. The last date for payment of exam fee had been extended from October 15 to October 31. “From doctors to publishing houses, everyone contributed to the cause. It has also helped us in other ways. For instance, one of our students was working as a domestic worker to meet her education expenses. When we got to know that, we immediately helped her so that she didn’t have to work anymore,” said Jha, adding that even those who had taken loan to pay the fee were returned the money from the funds collected. The response is similar across schools. Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, said, “We raised about ₹1.22 lakh from donors, of which ₹66,500 was used to pay the CBSE board exam fee. The remaining money will be used to provide smart phones to financially weaker students. Alumni members, teachers, bureaucrats, retired officials, and even friends living in countries such as the USA donated money,” he said. “Grocery store owners, RWA members, and vegetable vendors from my locality also made contributions.” The All India Parents Association also ran a campaign to help class 10 and 12 students with the board exam fee. “The children of the poor should not be burdened with any kind of fee, particularly during a pandemic crisis. We have raised over ₹6.5 lakh, helping more than 250 students,” said advocate Ashok Aggarwal, national president of AIPA. A senior official from the education department had said the government was unable to pay the fee this year due to “major shortfall in revenue collection” due to the Covid-19 crisis. In October, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had told HT that the government was functioning “at less than 50% of its revenue collection”. Taking note of various people and organisations that came forward to help, the Directorate of Education had also released a circular on the matter on October 9. Through the circular, heads of schools were asked to “maintain proper records of such transactions including acknowledgement to the donor and information to the parents whose child’s fee had been paid.” The department also asked schools to refund the fee paid by students if a donor still comes forward to pay. “A number of requests have been received from parents, expressing their inability to pay the board exam fee of their children in class 10 or 12 due to loss of income during the pandemic,” said a senior DOE official.The official added that the education department had asked CBSE to waive the fee but the board had expressed its inability to do so. In such a scenario, people approaching schools to offer financial support as a welfare measure was welcome as “a noble cause” in the interest of students, the official added. Despite repeated attempts, there was no response from Delhi government spokesperson on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/civil-society-comes-forward-to-pay-cbse-exam-fee-of-class-10-12-students-in-govt-schools/story-ttcyBrzDSJs1OExn5Hb0XK.html

31-10-2020||City||Mansa DC office working hit, as farmers seek Rs 10 lakh ex-gratia for woman||Bathinda Public grievance redressal system in Mansa district has been severely hit for three weeks with deputy commissioner Mohinder Pal unable to attend office at the district administrative complex (DAC) since activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) laid siege to the secretariat. The union began the protest after an 80-year-old woman Tej Kaur, of Haryana, died after losing her balance on tracks during the ongoing farmers’ agitation on October 9. Due to this blockade, public dealing with the administrative head of Mansa district has been minimal. The senior bureaucrat avoids stepping out of the camp office or the official DC residence, as a large number of protesters is also on dharna there.BKU district president Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha said on Saturday the agitation would continue until the state government accepted their demands of ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh, government job for a family member and waiver of Kaur’s family’s debts.“The district administration has offered a compensation of Rs 3 lakh that we have rejected. Her family has an outstanding loan of Rs 26 lakh, which must be waived. We will continue the agitation,” said Bagha.Union activists are on round-the-clock dharna at the main gate of the DAC, BKU supporters gherao DC camp office from 11 am-4 pm daily, said the union leader.Mansa DC added authorities were sympathetic, but the administration had limitations to demands it could meet. “The woman was a registered voter at Ratia in Fatehabad district of Haryana where she lived with one of her four sons. Her sons also reside at Bare village in Mansa and they collectively have taken loans of about Rs 30 lakh. She had no financial liability and was drawing old-age pension from the Haryana government. We are trying to convince protesters to end their agitation,” said DC.“Protesters blocked entrance to the DC camp office from October 19. I could not step out of my residence for six days. Even now, I drive out only if there are a fewer number of protesters. The administration does not want to get into confrontation mode with BKU supporters,” he added. Sources said the general public has not been able to get their works done with the DC and additional DC (general) not available. “Due to a dharna outside the camp office, visitors cannot be allowed to meet the DC staff for security reasons. Traffic on road has also been disrupted,” said a source.Mansa SSP Surendra Lamba said movement of vehicles in the DAC had become troublesome, and even he was finding it challenging to visit the secretariat. Lamba said he visited the office on fewer occasions this week.“Due to the sensitivity, we are trying to pursue the BKU to end dharna. The administration awarded Rs 3 lakh compensation to the family of a farmer Jugraj Singh from Gurdi village, who died of a heart attack, while sitting on an indefinite ‘rail roko’ agitation against farm laws in Mansa on October 17. The issue is being handled at the government level,” said the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mansa-dc-office-working-hit-as-farmers-seek-rs-10-lakh-ex-gratia-for-woman/story-XIfK3eiVVx7Rbb5V1TNshJ.html
31-10-2020||Pune||Pune police chief urges builders to file complaints if threatened by local labour “unions”||Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta has urged builders in the city to come forward to file complaints against labourers, known locally as “mathadis”, i.e. labourers involved in lifting and loading consignments if harassed by them in any away. Gupta spoke at the special general body meeting of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) - Pune Metro on Friday. The association had sought help from the city police regarding threats from workers who coerced them into giving work. Gupta said, “There have been complaints against certain groups of people who have been harassing builders over random issues. We urge developers to co-operate with the police and file a complaint so we can take it forward and take action against such groups.”Gupta was attending a meeting wherein builders raised the issue of being coerced into giving work to a certain group of workers in various places. Suhas Merchant, president of Credai Pune said, “We have had multiple instances which were also reported even before the lockdown. There are groups of workers who enter the building premises and force builders to give them work despite the fact that the builders have their own head loaders and masons. These people come in specifically when the material is being loaded or unloaded and force them to give them work which is causing us trouble, we raised this issue with the commissioner who promised support.” Gupta who assured action against such offenders said, “We have an Economic Offences Wing (EOW) where developers can send their complaints online. We also want them to install CCTV cameras in all residential societies to ward off anti-social elements. There are already over 10,000 cameras in the city and we are planning to add 14,000 more. It will also help us tackle the issue of accidents on sites and make investigations easier. I also urge developers to take proper precautions and install warning signals at construction sites to prevent accidents. I want to make Pune a safe city for all.” Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) CEO and commissioner Suhas Diwase said that the PMRDA will have a crucial role to play in the coming years as the town planning will have to be done at a micro-level. “Sustainability of the resources will be the key and while making residential and industrial townships, we’ll have to focus on the issues of water, drainage, and solid waste management in each region. I urge CREDAI members to come up with schemes and implement new ideas to work on these issues,” he said.Diwase and members of Credai-Pune Metro including secretary Aditya Javdekar among others were present during the interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-police-chief-urges-builders-to-file-complaints-if-threatened-by-local-labour-unions/story-N9OXtKCXwxNHZh4g29LvQL.html

The parents have alleged that schools had discontinued the online classes of students who have not paid the fees.According to the order issued by Minakshi Raut, PMC’s education officer, now a three-member committee will conduct an enquiry in the matter.“The committee will conduct an enquiry of schools about whom we have received complaints. Parents have complained that schools have not sent login id or password and in some cases have sent them the school leaving certificate,” she said.“The committee will conduct an enquiry and submit a detailed report to the department,” said Raut.During the hearing in the Bombay High Court on October 14 regarding the order about fee payment during a pandemic disaster, the court had asked the government to bring the matters of coercive action by schools, if any, to the notice of the high court. If the school are not providing online education or expel the child for non-payment of fees or take any other action, now such actions by the school will be contempt of court.According to the court, the education authorities now have to take ‘administrative and criminal’ action and report it to the court as it will be contempt of the high court.Swapnil Pangare, a parent said, “Due to the current pandemic situation we are suffering a financial loss in business and many parents have even lost their jobs. How can we pay lakhs of rupees in fees right away? There should be some concession for this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-education-department-forms-three-member-committee-to-look-into-school-fee-payment-issue/story-hLwleFzJdDq1Rz9hRZ7fHK.html
31-10-2020||Pune||Parents of Class 11 students in Pune region demand beginning of admission process||At least one lakh students in the Pune region are awaiting the resumption of the Class 11 admission procedure, as it has been put on hold by the state education department. The wait has now started worrying students and parents, as delay in the admission may cost the students an entire academic year. Due to an interim stay by the Supreme Court (SC) on the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community in employment and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for Class 11 on September 9. Private coaching classes have started taking online classes for students who want to keep abreast of the Class 11 syllabus, but now parents have demanded that the admission process begin immediately. “This entire year has been very worrying for us. First our Class 10 examinations were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic; the last paper, Geography, was cancelled. Then there was a delay in the results and now, the admission process is halted. When the online admission process started I was hoping to get a good college of my choice, but the SC order came and the process stopped. It is uncertain when the process will resume. It will certainly hamper our future career plans,” said Tushar Mundada, a student waiting for his Class 11 admission. Four lakh students have applied for online admission in six divisions across the state. After the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) announced the SSC results in July, the online admission process began in August for Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati. Similarly, parents are worried about the admission process. Vandana Mhatre, a parent, said, “Our children were at home during the lockdown and couldn’t do anything during that time. When the unlock began, the online admission process started and we hoped that now online classes will resume once the admission is done. State government should have a solution and immediately start the admission process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/parents-of-class-11-students-in-pune-region-demand-beginning-of-admission-process/story-jPCm78wVWkjvjJMFcGR14H.html

31-10-2020||Pune||More than two months after the first survey, Pune’s second sero survey yet to begin||The second sero survey for Pune city is yet to begin, even though it has been over two months since the pilot survey was conducted by the Pune Municipal Corporation in the city.The neighbouring civic body, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), has begun its sero survey in association with DY Patil Medical College. The survey for Pune city to be undertaken by the BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital is yet to start. The survey indicates the prevalence of the virus by testing samples from random households and helps the administration to plan for containment zones accordingly and understand the spread of the virus. A serological survey assesses the prevalence of a disease in a population. It is done by detecting the presence of specific antibodies that are produced against the virus. IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test is conducted under the survey to estimate the proportion of the population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes Covid-19 The first sero survey conducted in July and made public on August 17 had collected 1,664 samples from five highly inflicted sub-wards to determine the spread of the virus. The study found a whopping 51.5% of the samples testing positive for antibodies against Covid-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pune is currently the worst affected district in the country with over 3.23 lakh Covid cases as of Thursday. However, the sample size and areas selected for the study were not representative of the entire city or district and so the second sero survey with a higher sample size and a wider area was declared. The first study was conducted in collaboration with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore and funded by Persistent Foundation. However, it has been more than two months now since the first results were announced, the second survey is yet to begin. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “The second sero has already started in PCMC area and it is being done by DY Patil along with the local civic body. For Pune district, which will include areas from both city and rural areas, it is more comprehensive. This survey is being planned by Sassoon and NIV.” A senior doctor from BJ Medical College said, “I have not yet got any message on the same. There is no update on beginning the survey anytime soon.” With the second wave possibly in December as projected by the Central team, a comprehensive sero survey will help the administration to ensure strict measures are put in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/more-than-two-months-after-the-first-survey-pune-s-second-sero-survey-yet-to-begin/story-zBdfKQt59qlGttWYm1fsZJ.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi sees coldest October since 1962, says IMD||India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Safdarjung observatory in Delhi has recorded October 2020 as the coldest in the national capital since 1962, with 17.2 degrees Celsius as the mean minimum temperature (MMT) this year.On October 29, Delhi’s minimum temperature plummeted to 12.5 degrees Celsius, three notches below the normal. It was also the lowest for this month over a period of 26 years.The normal minimum temperature for October is 19.1 degrees Celsius.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, New Delhi, told ANI that the Safdarjung observatory recorded 2020’s October as the coldest since 1991 in the corresponding month.“The reason behind dip in the temperature is the absence of the cloud cover, along with no impact of western disturbance on the plains (mainly in Jammu and Kashmir) now. Another important reason is north-westerly wind direction.”In 1954, the mean minimum temperature (MMT) in October was recorded as the lowest with 16.7 degrees Celsius. Later, in the year 1962, the October MMT was recorded at 16.9 degrees Celsius.In 1991, 1993, 1994, and 2007, the October MMTs were recorded at 17.6, 17.8, 17.9 and 17.5 degrees Celsius respectively, according to the IMD.The winter season mostly depends on western disturbance. When western disturbance approaches northwest India, winter commences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sees-coldest-october-since-1962-says-imd/story-vyCUBNZzDfdcC1udskEa1M.html
31-10-2020||Chandigarh||Post-Covid, Himachal’s placement initiative meets limited success||Since the Covid-19 outbreak in March, an estimated 2.4 lakh Himachalis working in domestic and international companies have been rendered jobless and have returned to their native state.With a majority of companies retaining experienced staff, the axe fell mostly on employees below 30 years in white-collar jobs such as professional desk, managerial or administrative work.Since June 1, the government’s Himachal Pradesh Kaushal Vikas Nigam (HPKVN) has been trying to provide jobs to skilled and semi-skilled natives through its portal, skillregister.hp.gov.in, but has met with limited success. HOW THE JOB PORTAL WORKSSkilled and semi-skilled unemployed citizens returning from other states register themselves on the portal, where companies and industries can also register their requirements, after which the HPKVN tries to provide job opportunities to applicants in the nearest company or industry according to their ability and eligibility.Despite government campaigns, so far only 16,406 people have registered themselves for employment on the portal.AS TOURISM TAKES HIT, HPKVN TAPS INDUSTRIESTourism, the biggest job provider industry in the state, has been adversely impacted by the pandemic and faces a loss of more than Rs 20,000 crore, limiting opportunities in the sector.The HPKVN approached industries in Una, Sansarpur, Kala Amb, Paonta Sahib and Baddi and Barotiwala and identified 1,802 job opportunities in companies such as Havells, Voltas, Tafe, Indoco Remedies and MT Autocraft.It mapped the jobs available with the eligibility, qualification and aspiration of applicants. “Based on this mapping, the HPKVN identified 1,685 eligible candidates for jobs in these industries,” says its managing director, Rohan Chand Thakur.Those who had lost their jobs were contacted, counselled and motivated to take up the opportunities available. Consequently, 405 candidates expressed interest to join. Of them, 282 appeared for interview and 102 were shortlisted in the past three months.“Those who could not make it are being further counselled and motivated by our team so that suitable jobs can be offered to them,” says Thakur.The major reasons for aspirants unwilling to join despite being qualified are the location of the work and higher salary expectations, he says, adding that the HPKVN is working on providing multiple offers to each candidate so that they have options to choose from.HIGH LITERACY BUT JOB CREATION BELOW PARHimachal Pradesh, which has the fourth best literacy rate of 86.6% behind only Kerala, Delhi and Uttarakhand, is the third state with the highest unemployment rate, according to thinktank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).Tripura topped the unemployment chart at 28.6% in December 2019, followed by Haryana at 27.6% and Himachal 20.2%. The national average was 7.7%.An estimated 60,000 youngsters of Himachal Pradesh join the queue for jobs every year. On the contrary, job creation has remained below par.According to government data from January 2018 to July 2019, 1.46 lakh jobs were generated; 6,637 in the government sector and 1.4 lakh in the private sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-covid-himachal-s-placement-initiative-meets-limited-success/story-vMdlWptAUHQE8unH7SzN2O.html

31-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: With Cong’s Luv and debonair debutants, BJP’s Bankipur set for a contest||Patna’s Bankipur assembly constituency, comprising 3.91 lakh voters, is set for an interesting contest. BJP’s Nitin Nabin (40), who is seeking his fourth successive win as a legislator here, is pitted against Congress’s Luv Sinha (39), son of actor and former Union minister Shatrughan Sinha who quit BJP last year and joined Congress. Luv Sinha is fighting his first election. So is Pushpam Priya (33), an alumnus of London School of Economics (LSE) who has floated The Plurals Party, a newly formed entity. Also in the race is Manish Barriarr (44), an Oxford University alumnus and academician. He is contesting as an Independent candidate. Altogether, there are 22 candidates in the fray from Bankipur constituency, which goes to polls on November 3. Located in the heart of Patna, Bankipur has its own issues. Traffic snarl-ups, water-logging, lack of infrastructure and civic amenities like public hygiene and sanitation, drainage, streetlight, encroachment of public property, illegal slums, poor public transportation, lack of auto-rickshaw and city bus stops, are the pressing ones. The incomplete Mithapur flyover, open drain in Mandiri and Bakerganj, delay in execution of projects under Smart City, the Namami Gange and the laying of gas pipeline because of which roads have been dug up, are the broader issues people want the government to address on priority. The youth on Ashok Rajpath, which has several private hostels for students, want better education and employment avenues. “There’s traffic mayhem on SP Verma Road, Fraser Road, Exhibition Road. The roads are poorly lit with either no streetlights or just a few of them. Public hygiene is poor, with garbage littered on flanks of roads and footpath, hardly leaving any space for commuters,” said Sadanand Agarwal, 51, a businessman, who resides on SP Verma Road. Also read: Bihar polls - ‘BJP’s Covid-19 vaccine promise not a poll violation,’ says ECIt’s all about water-logging, encroachment and illegal slums near the Buddha Murti in Kadamkuan. “Encroachment, leading to illegal slums, with urchins creating nuisance, is a worry in our area, especially around the Buddha Murti which should ideally have been taken up as a national heritage and converted into a tourist spot. Our area, which is low-lying, is perennially waterlogged during monsoon. The government should do something to improve its drainage and promptly address other issues as well,” said Dr Abhishek Kumar Sinha, 40, a resident of Justice Raj Kishore Path near Buddha Murti in Kadamkuan. Manish Kumar, 21, a student of Patna University on Ashok Rajpath, talked about the need for employment avenues. “Unemployment is the main reason for the migration of youth. Besides, higher education also needs to be improved,” he said. Ghanshyam Agarwal, 48, a resident of Mainpura, talked about the lack of parking facility in his area, animal shelter house, leading to cattle and stray dogs roaming freely on road, also the increasing incidence of dog bite, incomplete work on covering the Mandiri drain, besides encroachment and open manholes. “The government should also improve the crematorium at Bans Ghat and Gulbi ghat and not allow vendors by the roadside,” said Agarwal. However, Rashmi Kumar, 60, a school teacher, and resident of Maa Bhagwati Apartment on the Boring-Canal Road, had a different take. “I will vote for a leader who helps in strengthening the political leadership of our country. I prefer a seasoned political leadership over the youth. The government has done good work and will do better if we give it more time,” she said. “Our choice (of political leader) is not an issue, but party-based. I will vote for a strong and self-reliant India,” she said. The Bankipur seat, which came into existence after the delimitation of constituencies in 2008, has been a BJP stronghold. Nitin Nabin’s father, late Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha, won the 1995, 2000 and 2005 assembly elections from the Patna West seat, most areas of which now come under the Bankipur assembly constituency. In 2006, following his father’s death, Nabin won the Patna West seat in 2006 (by-election), and then Bankipur in 2010 and 2015 assembly elections. Also read: Lalu, Rabri’s native villages on boil over Nitish’s remarksCongress candidate Luv Sinha talks of the lack of development in Bihar. “Bihar is still the least developed for the last 27 years in terms of people living below poverty line, infrastructure, healthcare and education. People here also have less opportunity. I am here to bring about a change in Bihar,” said Sinha. “My priorities will be to improve education, work on industrialisation because they go side-by-side to increase employability. I will also work on town planning because Patna is quite unlike a state capital. It has no concept of town planning, which needs to be developed,” said Manish Barriarr. BJP candidate Nitin Nabin, on the other hand, countered allegations of slow pace of development work. “As for the Mithapur overbridge, there were some design issues, which the railways had objected to. It has now cleared the design and the work will be complete in the next three months. The Rs 65-crore project on covering the Mandiri drain was stopped at the order of the high court. After its clearance now, the work will recommence soon,” said Nabin. “We have also worked on the sump house and drainage to end waterlogging in wards 15 to 19 of Chirayantand, Chandmari Road and Khasmahal localities, besides the Congress Maidan in Kadamkuan. As many as 15,000 LED streetlights have been installed in the last three years and a Rs 3.5 crore foot-over bridge is coming up between Mithapur and R-Block. We have been striving for development and will continue to do so in the coming years,” he said.

31-10-2020||Delhi||As Covid-19 cases soar in Delhi, health minister Satyendar Jain lists reasons||The ongoing festive season, onset of winter and an increase in air pollution are among the reasons for a sudden spike in the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital, according to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. The Capital breached its record for the highest number of Covid-19 cases recorded in a day four times this week. An alarmed home ministry has called a special review meeting with officials of the Delhi government to discuss the issue on Monday. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853 cases and on Wednesday it reported a record 5,673 Covid-19 cases. As many as 5,739 cases were recorded on Thursday and 5,891 infections and 47 deaths on Friday.Also Read: Alarm over new Covid-19 cases in Delhi; Centre may step in“It’s a combined effect of the festive season, decrease in temperature and increased pollution. Experts had also suggested that at this time Covid-19 cases could rise,” Jain said on Saturday, according to news agency ANI. Delhi and the National Capital Region’s (NCR’s) pollution level has been a matter of concern for over a week now. The air quality index hovering dangerously close to the ‘severe’ zone in the past 10 days. On Thursday, a new umbrella agency was set up by the Centre to fight air pollution in the region.Jain also listed carelessness of people as one of the factors in the spike of Covid-19 cases. “People are giving less importance to wearing face masks. Masks can save us to a large extent from the winter pollution too,” he said. On Friday, Jain had urged Delhiites to consider masks as a vaccine against the coronavirus disease. Encouraging people to wear masks at all times, he said, “When we had imposed the lockdown, cases did not go down. If 100 per cent of people wear masks, Covid-19 infection can be controlled to a certain extent. Benefits of wearing masks are just as many as those of a lockdown, if not more. Until there is a vaccine, masks should be considered as vaccines.”Also Read: ‘Consider face masks like Covid-19 vaccine,’ says Delhi health minister Satyendar JainThe meeting called by the home ministry on Monday will be the Centre’s second such intervention to control the rising Sars-Cov-2 infections in Delhi. In July, Union home minister Amit Shah held meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other officials after which testing, contact tracing and sero-surveillance were ramped up in Delhi.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla will chair Monday’s meeting and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul, and other senior central officials will be in attendance, people familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-covid-19-cases-soar-in-delhi-health-minister-satyendar-jain-lists-reasons/story-Z4bHXGXCvN8dGlXHtsGITL.html

31-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai authorities to set up walk-in testing facilities for Covid-19||In an attempt to scale up its Covid-19 testing capacity up to 24,000 a day, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned to have at least four walk-in Covid-19 testing facilities in each of the 24 administrative wards of the city. All ward officials will be directed to identify spots where testing facilities will come up likely by next week.Citizens will be able to approach these facilities for Covid-19 testing between specified timings that are yet to be decided. Covid-19 tests conducted at civic-run or government-run facilities are free of cost. Authorities also anticipate a surge in Covid-19 cases in the upcoming festive month for which strict wearing of masks and no overcrowding will be enforced.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “We are chalking out the plan to execute walk-in testing facilities in all wards. The timings for testing and staff required will likely be finalised by this weekend. We are taking utmost care and have intensified our campaign for strict masking. The public movement on roads has also increased and it is necessary to ensure there is no overcrowding at places.”Civic officials said that the plan is to have adequate testing facilities in a decentralised manner. Currently, there are very few civic testing camps in several wards and some of the wards have even shifted these camps to major civic hospitals or civic dispensaries only. A senior civic official said, “Testing camps are intensified once there is a surge in cases from a particular area. Ward officials monitor their areas to decide how frequent these camps are to be set up.”Also read: J&J to test vaccine in children, Novavax plans an ethnicity-based studySince September, the BMC conducts anywhere between 8, 000- 15,000 Covid-19 tests on a daily basis, 30-40 percent of which were comprised of rapid antigen tests. The civic body has now marked a target of conducting up to 24,000 Covid-19 tests in the city daily. “Now as we see the pandemic receding, we do not want another Covid peak in Diwali. Increasing testing capacity is just one component of containing the spread of the virus but intensifying strict mask policies and avoiding overcrowding at places will ensure better results,” said Shashank Joshi, member of state’s Covid-19 task force.Mumbai crossed the 10-lakh-mark of Covid-19 tests on September 20 and has so far conducted 15.13 lakh tests. Of these, 2.56 lakh individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-authorities-to-set-up-walk-in-testing-facilities-for-covid-19/story-TGrsjnDEoqQ3MADiEDBfaL.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||At 365, Delhi’s air quality still in ‘very poor’ zone||Delhi’s air marginally improved on Saturday as winds picked up speed and the contribution of stubble fires from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana remained relatively low. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the hourly average air quality index of Delhi at 7am was 365, in the “very poor” category.The overall AQI of Delhi on Friday was 374, also in the same category. This was better than Thursday’s 395. At many monitoring stations, the AQI had entered the severe category on Thursday afternoon.An AQI reading of 301 to 400 is in the “very poor” category and is associated with respiratory illnesses, especially in children and those exposed to the bad air. An AQI of 400-500 is considered “severe”. IMD scientists said that strong winds helped clear off the accumulated pollutants and that winds are expected to be favourable over the weekend.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the wind speed on Friday remained in the range of 12-15kmph, which helped disperse pollutants. “For a brief period, the wind speed had even touched 16kmph. On Saturday, the winds will pick up more and we are expecting that the air quality index can even reach the poor zone,” Srivastava said.

After an advisory was given to him, he gave no further statements. The statement, which is being mentioned, is from October 13. I think this order is unfair. We are contemplating as to what legal suggestion has to be taken,” Singh said.“There is pressure being applied and it is not right,” he added.Election Commission of India had earlier revoked the star campaigner status of Congress leader Kamal Nath, citing repeated violation of the Model Code of Conduct.Digvijaya Singh said this in response to the statement of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who had stated that the stains on Kamal Nath will not be washed by washing powder“First ask Jyotiraditya Scindia Ji whether Shivraj’s blood-stained hands should be washed or not,” Scindia had said while he was in Congress that Shivraj Singh Chohan’s hands are stained with the blood of the farmers of Mandsaur.Singh was in Indore’s Sanwer to campaign for the Congress candidate Premchand Borasi.Voting on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh by-polls will take place on November 3 and the results will be declared on November 10.By-elections are due on 28 seats following the resignation of 25 MLAs and the death of three legislators earlier.In March this year, 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the state Assembly paving the way for BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan to take over as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister for the fourth time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/ec-order-withdrawing-kamal-nath-s-star-campaigner-status-unfair-digvijaya-singh/story-CZvcKJ2r73JLqhj8Pjn2eM.html

It also claimed to have attracted over 40 intents for investment of about Rs 45,000 from 10 countries that include Japan, the US, the UK, Canada, Germany and South Korea.Infrastructure and industrial development commissioner (IIDC) Alok Tandon and additional chief secretary (infrastructure and industrial development department) Alok Kumar said various industrial development authorities allocated nearly 426 acres of land (326 plots) for projects involving an investment size of around Rs 6,700 crore with the potential for creating nearly 1,35,362 jobs. They said the companies that had grounded their investment by getting land for the projects included the Hiranandani Group, Surya Global, Hindustan Unilever, MG Capsules, Kesho Packaging and Mountain View Technologies. Tandon said the companies that had shifted from China included Dixon. He also said the state government held two rounds of discussions with Microsoft for investment to set up their software development centre on about 10 acres of land in the state. A Microsoft team would visit the state soon, he added.He said the ease of doing business and infrastructure development had helped in attracting investment in the state. Uttar Pradesh had ranked second in the ease of doing business recently.Also read: Alarm over new Covid-19 cases in Delhi; Centre may step inHe said the state government launched new policies post-Covid-19. These include the “Post Covid-19 Accelerated Investment Promotion Policy for Backward Regions 2020”. The state government is providing attractive incentives to new industrial units to create growth centres in Purvanchal, Madhyanchal and Bundelkhand regions of the state to fast-track investment there. These regions have also witnessed the highest influx of returning migrant labourers.Under this policy, Ankur Udyog proposes to set up a steel unit in Gorakhpur. Another proposal for investment to set up a steel plant in the backward region has been received.Tandon said three centres of excellence, including one by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) for start-ups in artificial intelligence, were also coming up. He said Tata Technologies proposed to set up a centre of excellence for defence in Lucknow.The commissioner said the new Startup policy 2020 to promote non-IT based start-ups had been launched. The eligibility limits of private industrial and logistics park had been reduced from 100 to 20 acres in Bundelkhand and Purvanchal, 150 to 30 acres in Paschimanchal and Madhyanchal for private industrial parks and from 50 to 25 acres for logistics parks. Tandon said post Covid-19, seven projects worth about Rs 8,500 crore commenced commercial operations, while 19 projects of about Rs 6,400 crore had entered the active implementation stage.He said with this, nearly 43 percent of the leads generated worth around Rs 2 lakh crore were under active stages of implementation. The upcoming Jewar international airport in Greater Noida has accelerated activities in the region. He said with the airport, projects like MRO/cargo complex and aerotropolis were likely to come up there. MSME park, electronics park, apparel park, handicraft park and toy park were also proposed in the region.Tandon added that the state government recently announced a film city on a 1,000-acre plot located just about six kilometres from the proposed Jewar international airport. These schemes are expected to bring investment worth Rs 40,000 crore and around 2.5-3 lakh employment. He said a dedicated agency, Invest UP, had been recently established for facilitating and handholding investors. Unlike similar organisations in the country, which either focused on investment promotion or investment facilitation, Invest UP had been mandated to carry out both the activities to provide complete investment life cycle support to the investors.Covid-19 hits investmentsRs 750 crore of investments have been grounded in data centre by Hiranandani Group in Greater Noida region.

31-10-2020||Patna||100 years on, residents on lease struggle against ‘British rule’ in Patna||More than 70 years after Independence, a number of Patna residents are still struggling against the British rule, literally. And as they are about to vote in the assembly elections — their constituencies in Patna are going to polls in the second phase November 3 — they have decided to vote for the party that delivers them freedom from the rule created almost 100 years ago. In 1915-20, the British, who themselves settled mostly on the banks of the Ganges in Patna, created a number of settlements in the city, called Khas Mahal, where small and big plots were sold on lease to government servants, judges, doctors, big landlords and even political eminences for the purposes of building houses. The biggest Khas Mahal came up Kadam Kuan, in the heart of Patna, where plots ranging from two katthas to 12 katthas were sold to eminences which included political heavyweights like Anugrah Narayan Sinha, the eminent Congress leader and father of former chief minister Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Sundari Devi, sister of Lal Bahadur Shastri, Babu Jagjivan Ram, Jaiprakash Narayan and businessman Bachha Babu, owner of a number of ships that then cruised in the Ganges ferrying people across.Later, similar but smaller such settlements were created in other areas like Mahendru Mohalla, Chiraiyyatand, Chhajju Bagh and Patna Museum area. But the land ownership remained with the British government. Though some were given rights of perpetual lease, which continued from one generation to another, most others got land on a lease either for 99 years or for 66 years or 30 years and were obliged to get it renewed before expiry. Also read: Generational shift in Bihar’s political arena?In Bihar, there are over 3,700 acres of land under Khas Mahal area, of which 500 acres are in Patna alone. “The system continued even after Independence. People had paid heavy amount for this land. My grandfather, who was a deputy collector during the British period, along with others, had paid Rs 1,700 -2000 per kattha at the time when gold was available for hardly for Rs 5-6 per 10 grams. Despite this, they were not allowed ownership. More depressing thing is that the ownership is still being denied,” says Rakesh Sharan, a member of the Khas Mahal Citizens Welfare Society from Kadamkuan, which falls into Bankipur Assembly constituency. The limited ownership means there is always a danger that the lease may not be renewed for various reasons and the “owners” are not free to develop the property into commercial complexes. “During every election, political parties assure us that the system of lease will be eliminated, but we still have no ownership. This time, we have threatened to boycott polls. Even if we agree to join polling, we will vote only for political party which promises to take action in this direction,” says Sharan. Rajiv Sharma, vice-president of Khas Mahal Citizen Welfare Society, who lives in Naval Kishore Path, also a part of the Bankipur constituency in Patna, says, “The threat of losing rights of the lease and being ousted from their houses is always there. It’s all because of the system of lease. Renewal has always been a big problem. Though the amount is not big, it’s the system which has made things difficult,” he says. Also, no commercial use of the property is allowed as it was created by the British rulers purely for residential purposes, he says. “Many of the family members have now shifted to the other cities or are in foreign countries. They want to put the property on rent to some commercial enterprises. Many also want to dispose of the property. But nothing is possible unless the area is turned into freehold,” Sharma says. No alteration is possible in the old structure created decades ago over the land, he says. “Even if we plan to remodel our wash room, we cannot do so without prior permission of the government because we are the lessee. Do you think getting permission for any kind of construction or any other paper work is easy and smooth in this system? Recently, one of our neighbours lost patience and got created a structure for commercial purposes. Within a few days, the unit was sealed while the family was served notice of cancellation of lease. Now my neighbour who has marriage in her family and needs to get the houses painted, is scared of doing so without government permission,” says Sharma. More than 10,000 families in the state capital live in these Khas Mahals. Nitin Naveen, the BJP candidate from Bankipur constituency, said he would definitely try to sort out the issue and take concrete steps in this direction.

31-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A cab driver’s pandemic exodus||He is all cloistered within plastic, as if in an echo chamber of his own.This sight perfectly encapsulates the surreality of the age of coronavirus. Cab driver Dharmendra Partap Singh is sitting on his driving seat, sealed from the rest of the car by a cabin-like wrap of plastic; the side-window of course is free. “This (plastic) is to protect the customer in case the driver has the infection,” he says, referring to the ongoing pandemic.He doesn’t say it, but the sealing might protect him too, if it is the passenger who is shedding the virus.In his 20s, the masked Mr Singh is driving a client around the Millennium City, though he himself lives in Delhi’s Janakpuri. Parked for the moment outside a Gurugram market, he speaks about his dramatic acquaintance with the pandemic. Like thousands of people in the city, he too quickly left for native home in the countryside. But he started his exodus not in a car, as one would expect of a driver, but on foot. “Like so many others, I urgently wanted to go home when suddenly everything shut down, and we became jobless,” he recalls, explaining that he himself didn’t have a car of his own.Just before the lockdown began in late March, Mr Singh’s employer, a cab rental agency, was forced to relieve some of its drivers because of the sudden lack of work. Living in the city since 2011, he barely had savings to pull through. Besides, “mata ji (mother) in the village was worried about me... and I was also scared.”During the entire recalling, Mr Singh mentions the pandemic in cataclysmic terms by calling it “corona kaal”. His home is in a village near Allahabad, a night-long train journey from Delhi.“My long journey began on 27 March. There was no transport available in the city. First, I walked all the way to the Delhi-UP border, then I found a place on the roof of a bus but it was so packed with public that I got down a short time later.” Fortunately, he spotted an acquaintance from his village, riding a bike. Together they drove in turns, reaching the destination 22 hours later. His wife, mother and sister were anxiously waiting for him. “I first took a bath, and then had dal-chawal... home is home... one can never depend on a big city.”Mr Singh still needs the big city, though. He returned early this month, in the cab of a friend who was driving back to Delhi after dropping a client in Allahabad. “This time it took me 12 hours only to cover the distance.” He is again working for the same firm.Looking restlessly about the plastic wrap, the driver shakes his head, asking, “When will corona kaal end?”His quizzical eyes suggest that his question is not rhetorical. He expects an answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-cab-driver-s-pandemic-exodus/story-QAll1xjGl9FdBfScifGu8J.html
31-10-2020||Kolkata||Bengal custodial death sparks row||A political controversy has erupted in West Bengal’s Birbhum district after the mysterious death on Thursday night of a 15-year old boy arrested for the alleged theft of a mobile phone. While the police claim it was suicide; the boy’s family had insisted in the morning that he was beaten to death. However, later in the day the mother said that it would be futile to raise allegations as they have lost their son. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says he was killed because his parents are BJP workers. On Friday morning, irate villagers clashed with the police and blocked National Highway 114 by burning tyres; they hurled bricks at the police, who resorted to a lathi charge to disperse the crowd.The BJP has called a 12-hour-bandh in Mallarpur on Saturday. “A 15-year-old boy died inside the police station. He was arrested following all norms and brought to the police station on Thursday. At night he went to the toilet and hanged himself. We have ordered a magisterial probe and a post-mortem by a three-member medical panel following guidelines laid down by the National Human Rights Commission,” said Shyam Singh, superintendent of police, Birbhum district. The victim’s parents and villagers alleged that the boy was picked up at least three days ago and was never produced in the court. “He was arrested for stealing a neighbour’s mobile phone at least three days ago. When I went to the police station, they told me that my son would be released soon. But now he has been beaten to death. He was not produced in court nor sent to any home,” the victim’s father told media persons earlier in the day. “My son had started taking heroin and ganja over the past two months. I have lost my son. What will I do by raising a complaint against the police?” the victim’s mother told media persons. Although the protest was initially restricted to villagers from the victim’s village, BJP workers joined the protest soon. “How can a minor hang himself in the police station when everything, with which he can commit suicide such as a towel and even the sacred thread, is taken away in police lockup? He was treated like this because his family members were BJP supporters,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the West Bengal BJP unit. The ruling Trinamool Congress has however rubbished the allegations saying the BJP is politicizing the issue. HT couldn’t independently confirm that the boy’s parents are BJP workers. Later in the day, however, the victim’s father said: “I am not a supporter of any party. My son used to sometimes participate in TMC rallies.” “The BJP is a liar. When the parents are saying they do not support any party, how can the BJP say that the parents were BJP workers?” said Anubrata Mondol, TMC’s Birbhum chief. While the BJP has been claiming that more than 100 party workers have been killed in the TMC’s regime, the TMC has rubbished the claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-custodial-death-sparks-row/story-UylBhpJR4HusG3LhyQqjEJ.html

We are fighting for rights of people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh within the Indian Constitution to safeguard their rights,” he said.Rana recalled how post August 5, 2019, BJP leaders had assured that land and jobs will be protected for the citizens of J&K and that they won’t go to outsiders.“Today, we were holding a meeting to discuss land laws when a strong posse of police force surrounded the party office as if we are terrorists and anti-national elements. In the meantime, we came to know that Abdullah was not allowed to leave his house to offer prayers,” he said.“A leader like Abdullah, who is a symbol of secularism and nationalism in J&K, was not allowed to offer prayers. What sort of system is this? What kind of democracy is this?” he added.The NC leaders were not allowed to march towards Raj Bhawan in Jammu. Police laid concertina wires outside the NC headquarters to prevent protesters from coming out on Residency Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nc-protests-land-laws-restricting-farooq-from-offering-prayers/story-JFnvAAYXFaZeoG3vKkkgNK.html

31-10-2020||Mumbai||Will Mumbaiites wait for Metro network get longer?||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government managed to save green space by shifting the proposed car depot for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) out of the Aarey Milk Colony, but the move is expected to affect the schedule of construction of Metro network in Mumbai, at a time when Covid-19 pandemic has already affected the work. With the car shed shifted to Kanjurmarg, there will be changes in designs of Metro-3 as well as Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar to Vikhroli) line, which are expected to lead to time and cost overruns, which, experts say, is a highlight of infrastructure projects in Mumbai. Cases in point The foundation stone for the Bandra-Worli sea link was laid in 1999 when it was estimated to cost ₹660 crore. Mumbai’s first sea link, however, was delayed by five years, increasing the cost to ₹1,630 crore, with an additional interest cost of ₹700 crore, which is still being borne by Mumbaiites, 11 years after the line was opened for traffic in 2009. Another project, the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, was on the drawing board for three decades before the project work started in 2018, with its cost increasing from ₹350 crore when it was mooted in the 1980s to ₹17,843 crore, the cost at which it is being executed now. Mumbai’s first Metro – the 11.5-km corridor connecting the suburbs of Versova, Andheri and Ghatkopar – took six years to be executed. It has been six years since it was made operational and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and the Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which operates the line, are in a bitter tussle over the cost of the project. While the former claims it to be ₹2,356 crore, the latter says it escalated to ₹4,026 crore. World over, reasonable delays in project implementation are expected, however, the numerous legal, environmental, technical, political and contractual hurdles in executing infrastructure projects in the financial capital of the country mean commuting stays a nightmare in the city, especially as the railways are overburdened and roads are choked. Ground reality Currently, 180km of Metro lines are under-construction in the city. These include line 2A, 7, 3, 2B (DN Nagar-Mandale), 4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarwadavali), 4A (extension of line 4 till Gaimukh), 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) and line 9 (extension of line 7 from Andheri to the airport and Dahisar to Mira Bhayander). Another 42.6-km line is at tendering stage. These include 10 (Gaimukh-Shivaji Chowk), 11 (line 4 extensions till Azad Maidan) and 12 (Kalyan-Taloja). Three other lines of around 103km are at the detailed project report stage. These include line 8 (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport-Navi Mumbai International Airport), 13 (Shivaji Chowk-Virar) and 14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur). The total cost of the 337-km line is ₹1.40 lakh crore, of which ₹41,308 crore or close to 30% is being funded by national and international agencies. The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is funding Metro-3, will also have to approve the change in plan for it to go ahead. Impact of change In 2004, then Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government had made a plan for a 146-km network by 2021. The Mumbai Metro master plan underwent major changes in the last decade, but was put on fast track in 2014. Paresh Rawal, transport planner and public policy expert, said, “The Metros were a need of yesterday for the city. Its need has, in fact, increased in today’s scenario. All major infrastructure projects that were undertaken in the past few years were to further private transport. Nothing has been done to augment public transport in the city.” The earlier deadline for Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri) East was December 2019, which was later revised to December 2020. Now it is expected to be operational by May 2021. A part of Metro-3 (Aarey to Bandra-Kurla Complex as per the earlier plan) was estimated to be operational by June 2021, which was later revised to December 2021. Officials now estimate the line will be operational only by 2023-24. A per day delay in executing Metro-3 costs ₹5.87 crore to the exchequer. A committee appointed by the MVA government had in February 2020 stated that a delay of 2.5 years would lead to a cost of ₹5,356 crore. Zoru Bhathena, environment activist and member of Save Aarey Group, said, “Even if the depot at Kanjurmarg will take two years to be completed, Metro-3 is nowhere close to being completed in two years.” Nitin Killawala, an architect, who has been demanding underground Metro corridors, said, “It is common sense that optimising lands for a single comprehensive year instead of two years, in itself is a huge saving, especially if one can save a land as sensitive as Aarey forest.” The decision also means tweaking designs for Metro-6, which is already under-construction. Officials said the platform size for six stations will have to be modified to accommodate the line 3 trains which are of eight coaches, whereas all other Metros are designed for six coaches. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, who has been the brain behind the new plan, said system integration of two lines was possible. “MMRC has to make a new DPR for the extension and depot. For Metro-6, the platform will have to be worked out.” For the rest of the corridors, he said, the ongoing pandemic, which affected manpower and machinery for a few months might delay the timelines by around four-six months. “In terms of timeline, we expect a four-six month delay. However, we do not see major cost escalation for most of the corridors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-mumbaiites-wait-for-metro-network-get-longer/story-jrwal6RtV6y03Ljfs4Qs7J.html
31-10-2020||City||Police seize car used in killing of 3 BJP workers in Kulgam||The police on Friday claimed to have seized the vehicle used in the killings of three BJP workers in a “pre-planned” attack by militants.Three BJP workers — Fida Hussain, Umer Hajam and Umer Rashid Beigh — were shot dead by militants in the Y K Pora area of south Kashmir’s Kulgam district late on Thursday evening.Inspector general of police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said the attack was possibly pre-planned and carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants and The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be a shadow group of the LeT.“The militants came in an alto car and fired on the BJP workers indiscriminately. The car used in attack has been seized,” said Kumar adding that search and cordon operation has been launched at eight locations in south Kashmir to track down the attackers. “We are hopeful the group behind the killings will be neutralised soon.”Officials said that the BJP workers were without any security at the time of the attack. Their mortal remains were laid to rest in their respective villages amid emotional scenes on Friday.BJP leaders demand security for workers Outraged by the continued attacks on political persons in Kashmir, the BJP leadership has demanded security for its workers.Former legislator and BJP vice-president Sofi Yusuf said the killing of their workers was unfortunate. “They (workers) were moving without security and till it provided, such killings are likely to continue in the valley. We have already apprised the police about the security lapse and raised concerns about our workers in Kulgam district,” said Yusuf.Reacting on the security issue, the IGP said that 157 BJP workers have been provided security and PSOs while 30 persons have been given guards. “Security will be provided to all those who have more threat perception,” he ensured.Kumar added that protected persons have been advised not to move in sensitive localities without police protection. “I request all protected persons not to move in sensitive areas without gunmen and follow all the SOPs.”Congress condemns BJP workers’ killings Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) has condemned the killing of three BJP workers by terrorists in Kulgam district and conveyed condolences to the bereaved families. In a statement issued on Friday, the JKPCC described the killing of BJP workers as a highly condemnable, mindless and shameful act and demanded exemplary punishment to the culprits. Expressing serious concern over the deteriorating security situation in Kashmir, the party unit urged the government to take effective measures to prevent attacks on political persons and ensure their safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-seize-car-used-in-killing-of-3-bjp-workers-in-kulgam/story-77Oo1qdFKjToIChwpG80rL.html
31-10-2020||City||Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation likely to borrow ₹2,000 crore to continue operations, pay salaries||The cash-strapped Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), which runs buses across the state, hopes to secure a loan of ₹2,000 crore to continue its operations. During the lockdown, MSRTC has suffered a loss of ₹5,500 crore. State transport minister Anil Parab said on Friday that MSRTC is seeking ₹3,600 crore from the state, but may also borrow from the market.“I have given a proposal to the state seeking ₹3,600 crore to pay salaries of state transport employees, and for basic operations. Looking at the state government’s [financial] condition, I will not be able to depend on the state alone. Therefore, we are looking at raising funds from the market,” Parab said.MSRTC officials said they have carried out a primary evaluation of assets, which could help them raise ₹2,000 crore in loans from domestic lenders. The corporation will keep its properties and assets as security, Parab said. “Mortgaging doesn’t mean handing over property or buses to the bank. It [property and assets] is evaluated and a proportionate loan is provided. If we mortgage something, it doesn’t become their property. We will assess everything and ensure nothing [property/asset] goes from our hand and only then borrow. The money we are going to borrow will be for our immediate needs like salary, fuel expenses, tyres, etc,” said Parab.The minister said MSRTC had sustained a loss of ₹5,500 crore during lockdown and employees’ salaries have not been paid for the last three months. Daily revenue from ticketing was ₹22 crore prior to the pandemic and has now dropped to ₹5 crore.“Salaries are pending for the last three months, so around ₹900 crore is needed for salaries. We are discussing how fast we can give these salaries, but the amount is also not small. The total loss of the MSRTC is ₹5,500 crore. Since the source of revenue has not gone up, the losses are mounting,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-state-road-transport-corporation-likely-to-borrow-2-000-crore-to-continue-operations-pay-salaries/story-C1LLwy2plBlBNJLchE3zfM.html
31-10-2020||City||Actor Urmila Matondkar may start second innings in politics as Member of Maharashtra Legislative Council||After an abrupt end to her political journey, actor Urmila Matondkar is set to begin her second-innings in politics. The 46-year-old actor is likely to be nominated by either the Shiv Sena or the Congress on one of the 12 Governor’s nominated seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Council. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government is expected to recommend 12 names to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for nominations to the upper house of the state legislature by early next week. As Matondkar is from the field of arts and entertainment, she fits into the criteria for the Governor-nominated seats. Matondkar had contested the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai North constituency on a Congress ticket last year but lost to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Gopal Shetty. She later quit the party in September 2019, stating that her efforts to work for the betterment of the Congress did not find support and amid in-house politics. If Shiv Sena nominates the actor from its quota, it will have an additional resource to deliver its messages on a national level. Party insiders said that that Matondkar is a well-known face nationally, has a good social connect within Maharasthra and will become an additional voice for the party on issues. Currently, among the women faces, the Sena has Priyanka Chaturvedi, Neelam Gorhe and Manisha Kayande as spokespersons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/actor-urmila-matondkar-may-start-second-innings-in-politics-as-member-of-maharashtra-legislative-council/story-0oslO3GB2dmpcjc0WKK4LI.html

In case of J&K, a unilateral decision was taken by the Centre which is not acceptable to the people of J&K and Ladakh.”Later, the PAGD delegation held closed-door meetings with the leaders of the Kargil Democratic Alliance.Omar told the media that their motive was connecting with the people of Ladakh and bring them on board. “We will fight politically, legally and most importantly peacefully. We have no intentions to vitiate peace in the region,” he responded when asked how the PAGD would approach its goal.Omar also said he would like the Kargil leaders to participate in PAGD meetings.“We were not in touch with Kargil leadership in the previous rounds. How could have we invited him unless and until we talked to them? We talked to them today and we now would like to see they send their representatives to PAGD meetings,” he responded to another query.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti also welcomed the PAGD delegation’s visit to Kargil.“Glad to see all of you at Kargil to engage with the people. High time someone reached out to them since they too have grave apprehensions about the future,” tweeted Mehbooba.PDP youth president Waheed ur Rehman Para said that a multitude of narratives and political fractures in Ladakh reflect the unacceptability of August 5 decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/omar-led-pagd-delegation-meets-leaders-in-dras-kargil/story-pGel4VqK2USrtuC66m7ohL.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||Munger violence an attack on Hindutva, why is BJP silent on it: Shiv Sena slams former ally||The Shiv Sena launched an attack on former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the firing incident at Bihar’s Munger city. One person was killed after the police allegedly opened fire, following a clash over a delay in the Durga Puja idol immersions at Munger on Monday night. Around 30 persons were also injured in the clashes between pandal organisers and the police. Terming the incident an attack on Hindutva, Sena parliamentarian and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Friday questioned the alleged silence by the Bihar Governor and BJP leaders on it. “This is an attack on Hindutva. If such an attack on Goddess Durga’s devotee had happened in West Bengal or Maharashtra, then I am certain that the Governor [of the respective states] and the BJP leaders would have immediately called the state governments anti-Hindutva governments and called for their dismissal and demanded President’s Rule in these states. BJP is also in power in Bihar. What happened in Munger, is it not against Hindutva,” Raut said while speaking to reporters. The Sena also slammed the BJP in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana on Friday and said the national party has “put secular glasses” and is unable to see the insult of the idols of Goddess Durga by the police. “It is surprising that these hypocritical ravens don’t see the disrespect of Durga idols and firing as jungle raj. It seems that the BJP in Bihar has put on secular glasses, which is why it’s not seeing the anguish of Goddess Durga in Munger,” it said. Referring to the lynching of two sadhus and their driver in Palghar, the editorial also said that BJP had targeted the Uddhav Thackeray government over the incident. “Had this violence and firing happened in West Bengal or Maharashtra, then the bell tolling hollow Hindutvawadi would have started its vulgar dance... they would have demanded a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) probe in the matter. Why are you, the bell-ringing Hindutvawadi, silent on the firing at the Durga idol processions,” the editorial said. It also questioned how those who are calling for the reopening of places of worship in Maharashtra have chosen to remain silent over the Munger incident. Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is BJP’s poll in charge in Bihar. BJP leaders in Maharashtra have staged agitation demanding reopening of places of worship in the state. “Those ringing bells to reopen temples, those threatening to break the locks of the temples are not concerned about the violence in Munger or the insult on Hindutva. This is Hindutva of convenience. Hindutva is lying in a pool of blood in Munger,” the editorial added. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant also questioned the BJP over its silence on the Munger incident. Sawant asked why have those, who had demanded Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s resignation after the Palghar lynching case, not uttered a word on the police firing incident during Durga puja festivities. Meanwhile, state BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye was unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/munger-violence-an-attack-on-hindutva-why-is-bjp-silent-on-it-shiv-sena-slams-former-ally/story-C9fhx1z0SunG6HRDDr13YP.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police arrest 2 more people, including railway employee, for duping Gujarat businessman of ₹2.7 crore in tender scam||Mumbai crime branch unit 11 on Friday arrested two more people, including a 52-year-old section engineer posted with the Western Railway, for allegedly duping a Gujarat businessman of ₹2.7 crore on the pretext of helping him get tenders for projects related to the railways. The section engineer, Anil Kumar Ahirwar, is posted in EMU workshop at Mahalaxmi, and was arrested from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, while the other accused, Swapnil Gosavi, 33, was arrested from Nashik. On Wednesday, the police had arrested three other accused – Mayur Solanki, 34; Kiran Chauhan, 45; and Subhash Solanki, 42 – from Mumbai, and while probing them, learnt that Ahirwar was the mastermind of the racket. Based on Ahirwar’s mobile location, he was traced to Gwalior and later brought to Mumbai. All the five accused are now in police custody till November 6, said police inspector Sunil Mane of unit 11. According to the police, the complainant is a contractor and met Subhash, a Vile Parle resident, two years ago. Subhash told the businessman that he knew a person in Western Railways who can provide him a lucrative contract through which he would be able to earn a lot of money. The complainant was then introduced to the four other accused. They met on several occasions at Kandivli and Mahalaxmi and the accused assured the businessman that they would help him get a tender to supply hose pipes to link railway carriages. The accused demanded a commission and they first took Rs1.44 crore from the businessman to issue a purchase order and invoices. Later it was discovered that the purchase order and invoices were forged. The other documents had the logo of Indian Railways, watermark and stamps which were forged. They then demanded more money on various pretexts. The businessman paid a total of 2.7 crore between May and December 2019 in two to three instalments, said Mane. He waited for several months in the hope of getting the tender but the accused kept making excuses over the delay. The businessman then found something amiss and asked them to return his money. But the accused threatened to implicate him in a false case. The complainant then approached the police last week and the five were booked for cheating and forgery, along with other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-arrest-2-more-people-including-railway-employee-for-duping-gujarat-businessman-of-2-7-crore-in-tender-scam/story-MKvpSHjVTIR4AmQIx8RomL.html

Zade befriended the two complainants, one an 18-year-old from Waliv, Vasai and the other a 30-year-old from Vikramgad, by promising jobs at the municipal corporation, and demanded sex in return, said Gaikwad. When the victims complied, Zade would secretly record the act on video and then post it on the website and earned money, said the officer.In July, one of the survivor approached police after finding out that the act was recorded, following which a case of rape was registered against Zade under sections 376(n)(2), 452 (trespass) of the Indian Penal Code and section 67 of Information Technology Act. Zade was absconding at the time. In September, the other woman also filed a similar complaint with Waliv police after a relative informed her of her video on the website, said Gaikwad. “Zade kept changing his location and also did not attend work to evade arrest. We got information that he was hiding in the jungles at Pochade between Vikramgad and Jawhar, following which we arrested him on Thursday and handed him over to Vikramgad police,” said Gaikwad. Zade was produced before Dahanu court on Friday and has been remanded in police custody. The accused had also forced other women and made sex tapes of them, said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-transport-conductor-held-for-taping-sex-videos-uploading-them-on-porn-site-for-money/story-FDzFm1lrBs3igzQNATnztK.html

This was a slight improvement from the previous day’s AQI of 384, albeit in the same category. The level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s primary pollutant, was 362.45µg/m³ on Friday, as per data recorded at the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. As per the CPCB’s classification, an AQI reading from 301 to 400 in categorised as ‘very poor’ and can lead to breathlessness and respiratory illnesses in cases of prolonged exposure. Experts attributed the slight improvement to faster wind. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to improve but remain in the lower end of the ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ categories on the weekend. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said that air quality would improve on Saturday. “Wind speed picked up Friday due to which we have seen improvement in AQI. On Friday, wind speed was around 12-15kmph whereas calm winds had prevailed on Thursday. On Thursday it was less than 5kmph, which led to the accumulation of pollutants in the atmosphere,” said Srivastava. “The wind speed will go beyond 15kmph on Saturday. We expect the air quality to remain better on Sunday as well,” he said, adding that AQI is expected to deteriorate from November 2 when wind speeds fall again. On Friday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 30.5 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12 degrees Celsius. Both the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to stay in a similar range, as per the IMD’s forecast. Clear skies will prevail till Monday, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-marginal-improvement-in-air-quality-more-respite-expected-over-weekend/story-R8lqlF5tMhjTgtD33ZqBlI.html
31-10-2020||Gurugram||Over one third govt school students surveyed in rural Haryana did not receive learning material||Nearly one-third of government schools students surveyed in rural Haryana did not receive any learning material during a reference period during the pandemic, findings of the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2020 (Rural) Wave 1 have revealed. According to the findings of the report, released Wednesday, only 67.7% of the government schools students had received any learning material in the week prior to the survey, while the figure was 72.2% for private school students, in rural areas.The phone-based survey was conducted in 627 villages and covered 2,442 students in the age group of 5-16 years in the state. The survey was conducted over a span of ten days in September. The week prior to the survey has been treated as the reference week. As per the survey, WhatsApp was used widely as a medium through which students received learning material. Around 92.2% of the surveyed students received learning material through WhatsApp in government schools. In private schools, 96.3% of students used WhatsApp for the same. About 3.3% of students in government schools received phone calls from teachers, 4.5% were personally visited by teachers, the survey added.The survey also sheds light on factors due to which students did not receive learning material from schools. Among government schools in rural Haryana, 40.1% students blamed the schools for not sending learning material, 10% said they did not have access to the internet, 46.8% said they did not have smartphones, and 2.6% cited connectivity issues. In Haryana, out of the surveyed children enrolled in government schools, 29.8% did not do any learning activity in the reference week. Further, roughly 14% of government school students in rural Haryana don’t have access to textbooks, while around 18% of students of class nine and above in government schools don’t have books. The survey has also shown that a greater number of children had access to smartphones now, when compared to 2018. In Haryana in 2018, 39.7% of children enrolled in government schools and 71% in private schools had access to a smartphone. This year, 77.2% of children enrolled in government schools and 87.4% of children enrolled in private schools had access to a smartphone. The state government had launched the ‘Ghar se Padhao’ campaign in April to ensure that teachers are in regular contact with parents and students through WhatsApp during the lockdown period, which began late March. The campaign is being monitored and operated by the Saksham Haryana cell. Rakesh Gupta, nodal officer, Saksham Haryana, said that the department had revised its strategy in the last month and roped in Shiksha Mitras for providing learning material to students who didn’t have access to smartphones. “Under Saksham Haryana, we already had a WhatsApp network in place which was expanded for carrying out remote learning. We were able to reach out to a good percentage of students, however, not all could be connected initially. As per our assessment, around 30-40% of students were not receiving learning material. To ensure that learning material reaches such students, we have appointed Shiksha Mitras who stay in regular touch with students and provide learning resources,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-one-third-govt-school-students-surveyed-in-rural-haryana-did-not-receive-learning-material/story-pUT27UsH7w74ZnY8Dv4KGM.html
31-10-2020||Gurugram||Revised RT-PCR cost, festival season likely to reduce Covid-19 testing||The Haryana health department’s decision to slash the Covid-19 testing cost to the lowest in the National Capital Region (NCR) may impact the overall testing rate in Gurugram, said representatives of private labs in the city. According to such labs, revised testing rates are unviable as it would eventually affect the process of sample collection. This is likely to be further impacted by the festival season, as many people might not turn up for testing due to festive fervour. Representatives of private labs on Friday approached the district health department to reconsider the revised testing cost. Haryana government on Thursday had brought down the cost of Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test to ₹900 from ₹1,200 and antigen test to ₹500 from ₹650. Private labs submitted a presentation to the chief medical officer (CMO) seeking reconsideration on the decision. “One of the prominent labs has even given in writing hat they won’ t conduct RT-PCR below ₹1,200,” said Dr Virender Yadav,CMO. “Private labs want the decision to be reconsidered by the state. They think it is unviable as it does not cover the total cost incurred in conducting the RT-PCR test. Since Covid-19 cases are rapidly rising, we have asked them to continue with tests and increase the volume,” said Yadav. Presently, there are six labs in Haryana approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for Covid-19. Nearly five Delhi-based laboratories have tied up with Gurugram hospitals for Covid-19 sample collection. Impact on testingEarlier, private labs had expressed similar concerns when the state health department brought down the price from ₹1,600 to ₹1,200 in the first week of October. They complained that the revised charges did not cover the cost of ambulance, and consumables, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), and the cost of the kit used for testing. State health officials, however, have been saying the overall charge of conducting an RT-PCR test has been reduced taking into account several factors, besides the consent of the leading private laboratories. As per the orders issued by the state till now, testing charges include the cost of sample pick-up, packing, transportation of samples, documentation and reporting. “There are various associated costs with home collection which can’t be covered at the revised price. These include cost of sample collection, transport, logistics, skilled personnel and safety requirements like PPE kits among other. This makes home collection unviable in the current scenario,” said Mr Anand K, CEO, SRL Diagnostics.He said, “We will, however, continue to provide service to Gurugram customers through our drive-thru facility in Sector 29 and patient service centre in Sector 14 and DLF Phase-1,” said Anand.A doctor from private lab privy to the matter, who preferred anonymity, said, “The health department has asked to increase the testing despite the price cut. A peak in cases is expected next month. To handle the situation, we have been told to carry on with testing and make appropriate arrangements. We are working on our agreement with vendors who supply kits and reagents for tests. Testing can be increased once those terms are realigned.” Going by the health bulletin data, private labs and a government lab in Sector 10 together conduct more than 3,000 tests on an average every day. Of these, more than 85% is administered through RT-PCR, while the remaining tests are conducted through rapid antigen test. It is in the last two days rapid antigen testing has come down to less than 300. On Friday, a total 3,040 tests were administered, out of which 2,755 were RT-PCR and 285 antigen tests. According to Yadav, nearly 1,000-1,200 samples are collected in the government set up, while remaining in private diagnostics. Covid-19 peakAlthough labs are advised to ramp up testing, Yadav said that due to the festival season, testing can come down. “We are concerned that after Diwali there can be peak around November 20-21. The people might refrain from getting tested during the festival, the impact of it can be seen after Diwali. In all likelihood, people from other states would also be back to Gurugram which would lead to sudden spike in Covid-19 cases,” said Yadav. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “Gurugram is noticing the spike almost 15 days after the last unlock happened. This can continue if precautions are not taken during Diwali. There won’t be explosive outbreak but a rise in cases is expected. Therefore, testing should increase in government labs, if proportion of tests in private labs decline due to cost issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/revised-rt-pcr-cost-festival-season-likely-to-reduce-covid-19-testing/story-l6rA5tYVnL0yU4cPnFHPUO.html

HSVP officials said that the deadline for making payments and announcements of awards has been fixed for November 15. The decision follows a meeting the authority held with different agencies, including the GMDA, which is responsible for the construction of road networks in the developing sectors. The issue of road networks in developing sectors has been repeatedly raised by both the residents of these sectors as well as by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who had asked the agencies concerned to expedite the construction of these roads. Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, on Friday, said that it had been decided to make payments and announcements of awards for the lands which have been acquired by the authority for construction of roads. “We will resolve all pending issues by November 15 pertaining to the payment of compensation or removal of other impediments,” said Yadav. HSVP officials said that a final decision on these matters will ensure that at least six important roads in the new sectors will become operational after hindrances are removed. Officials said that they have finalised the payment of ₹20 lakh, which will be paid to property owners, whose houses have been acquired for Sector 68/70 road. An award for acquisition of these properties will be announced before November 17, they said. Likewise, the authority will ensure the fast-tracking of the compensation for the owners of houses falling in sectors 71/72, 71/73 and 73/74 dividing roads, for which a payment of ₹36.50 lakh has been finalised. The authority will also make payment to owners in Begumpur Khatola, whose structures are falling on the alignment of Sector 73/74 dividing road. To expedite the construction of road in Sector 68/69 road, the authority has also decided to ensure payment of around ₹70 lakh to residents of Nurpur Jharsa village. To facilitate the construction of another key road in Sector 77/78, the HSVP has decided to pay compensation for structures to the landowners so that work on road can be completed. Yadav said that with resolution of these issues, the work on these sector roads will be completed soon. “The movement of residents will become easier once these roads become operational,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-to-clear-payments-by-november-15-to-facilitate-road-construction-in-developing-sectors/story-fd8daQOIPLsO0yEcWyWciK.html
31-10-2020||Gurugram||Man booked for abduction of a nurse in Nuh||A 27-year-old man, who works as an advocate, was booked on Thursday for allegedly kidnapping and threatening a woman employed as a nurse at a primary health centre at Punhana in Nuh, earlier this week. The victim’s father alleged that the woman had told him last month that the suspect was stalking her and forcing her to convert and marry him. The father, a resident of Mahindergarh, complained to the police on Thursday that his daughter, 24, was kidnapped from her work place on October 26 and that her mobile was found to be switched off since the incident. The police said the woman’s father lodged a complaint against a man identified as Muhammad Iqbal, a resident of Neemka village, after which a case under sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping), 365 (kidnapping), 506 (criminal intimidation) and relevant sections of the SC/ST Act was registered at Bicchor police station in Nuh. Om Prakash, the father of the woman, said that his daughter was scared when she had visited them last month and had asked him to speak to the police as the suspect was stalking her and was threatening her to marry him. “The man was forcing her to convert and marry him. She has been refusing his moves for the last six months but he often intercepted her way and forced her to speak to him,” he said. Attar Singh, additional station house officer(SHO) of Bichhor police station, said on Friday that they had conducted aids at suspected locations but were yet to recover the victim. “We had gone to the village of the suspect. However, his father told us that although his son had come with a woman, they both left after staying in the village for a day. He has no idea where they have gone. We have taken the records of the call details of the suspect and the victim and are scanning them to get some leads in the case,” he said. The police said the last location of the suspect and victim were in Nuh. However, since October 27, their mobile phones have been switched off. Singh said they were questioning the staff members of the hospital and villagers to know the exact details of the abduction and if the woman was held hostage in the village before the suspect shifted her to another location. “We will add more sections once we record the victim’s statement. Based on her statement, it will become clear whether the suspect stalked her and forced her to convert,” he said. The police said six teams have been formed to conduct raids and have questioned nine family members. They are also tracking their call details to trace the suspect, if he ever tries to contact them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-booked-for-abduction-of-a-nurse-in-nuh/story-RWM1y26RHzsppczUosjEGP.html
31-10-2020||City||Delhi contractor abducted for R4 lakh ransom by employee and four others over payment dispute, three held||New DelhiThe Delhi Police on Friday said they have rescued a south Delhi-based 38-year-old floor polishing contractor from a forested area in Uttar Pradesh’s Sitapur district, where he had been kept in confinement after being abducted from Lakhimpur Kheri by a group of four men on October 24. The alleged abductors and the mastermind of the crime, who worked for the contractor and had a dispute over pending wages, had been demanding R4 lakh from the family for his safe release, the police said.Three men, including the main conspirator, Irfan,26, have been arrested for the crime. The other two were identified as Aziz Ali,35, and Bablu,24. Irfan’s brother Vakeel,31, and their associate Samim,30, are still absconding. Irfan was only part of the planning. He was not involved in its execution because the contractor, Ramesh Chandra from Panchsheel Park in Malviya Nagar, would have identified him, police said.“Irfan said he used to do polishing of marble and stone flooring under Chandra in Delhi for the past 18 months. He alleged Chandra had not been paying his wages of R15,000. Chandra, however, have denied the allegations,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.DCP Thakur said that Irfan planned Chandra’s abduction to teach him a lesson. He conspired with his brother and four associates to execute the plan. Irfan took Chandra to Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on the pretext of getting a big contract of floor polishing, he said.On October 23, Chandra left his home, boarded a bus and the next morning reached the Lakhimpur Kheri bus stand, where four men, including Irfan’s brother Vakeel, met him. The four men asked Chandra to sit in their Bolero car so that they could reach the construction site. However, they took him to a forested area, tied his legs and confined him in an abandoned hut at an isolated place, said the police.“The abductors made Chandra speak to his wife. The suspect later made her a couple of calls from different mobile numbers and demanded R4 lakh for her husband’s safe release,” said DCP Thakur.Chandra’s wife filed a police complaint. A case was registered and through technical investigation, the investigating team tracked the last location of Chandra’s cellphone to the forested area in Sitapur. Further probe pointed the needle of suspicion at Irfan. Accordingly, a team went to the forested area on October 28.“On seeing the police party, the abductors abandoned Chandra and fled. They were chased and three of them were caught. Chandra was safely rescued from the hut. All of them have been brought back to Delhi. Efforts are on to nab the absconding duo,” added Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-contractor-abducted-for-r4-lakh-ransom-by-employee-and-four-others-over-payment-dispute-three-held/story-Z5DcrZ3p5tp6HPNweOhVsK.html

On their return to Delhi, they are unable to get their due ration as their names have been struck off the list.”“It is hereby directed that names of all such beneficiaries which were struck off… during lockdown from March 2020 to October 2020 be restored with immediate effect herewith,” he said in the order issued on Wednesday.The department is expected to file an action taken report by Monday.Delhi has more 1.7 million ration card holders which covers around 7.2 million beneficiaries. Names of beneficiaries are usually struck off if they do not avail ration for three consecutive months.The department, however, could not provide data on how many names had been struck off of since March 25, after the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed to arrest the spread of the virus.The next few months witnessed large scale loss of livelihood and movement of people from Delhi to their hometowns and villages, even though the Delhi government made arrangement for temporary shelters and two meals a day.

31-10-2020||Mumbai||Thane has something to cheer about as Covid death rate drops to 1.03%||In what comes as a relief, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has not recorded a single Covid death in the last few days. The total number of deaths till now is at 1,206.In the month of October, the death rate has decreased to 1.03 per cent from 5.70 per cent in April.Strict measures implemented by the TMC to ensure timely treatment and proper care as per ICMR protocols have ensured a decrease in the death rate, claimed the civic authority.Dr Raju Murudkar, medical health officer, TMC, said, “The death rate is gradually getting to lesser than one per cent. We have formed a team comprising chest physician, intensivist, consultant and health officer. We made surprise visits to private hospitals and did a detailed study of all the patients. Those who are in ICU are closely monitored. Through this, we could keep an eye out for those not following ICMR guidelines.“We also monitored if proper medication and treatment were followed. This process takes a while. So, every day the team manages to check three patients only. Repeated visits to a particular hospital with more Covid cases are also made. If any foul play is noticed, we do not wait for any inquiry. Immediately, notice is served and necessary action against the hospital is taken.”There are only 18 private hospitals with Covid status now and among these, 2,400 beds are vacant. Earlier, there were 24 dedicated Covid hospitals in the city.Dr Santosh Kadam, president, IMA, Thane, said, “Despite Unlock, the situation in the city is under control now. The number of deaths due to Covid has decreased drastically and within a month we have less than 1 per cent civic deaths. Earlier, even the medical staff were not well prepared to handle the pandemic. However, there is a protocol to be followed based on symptoms and age group of the patient. This has helped in providing timely care and proper treatment to patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-has-something-to-cheer-about-as-covid-death-rate-drops-to-1-03/story-qB16yJ29i4mJpGrATBL1LJ.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi air remains polluted despite stronger winds||Delhi’s air improved marginally on Friday as winds picked up speed and stubble fires from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana contributed less to pollution in the national capital. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that pollution levels will reduce further over the weekend. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) on Friday was 374, in the ‘very poor’ category, marginally better Thursday’s 395. However, on Thursday, the average hourly AQI for most of the day remained in the ‘severe’ zone. IMD scientists said strong winds helped clear accumulated pollutants, and the winds are expected to be favourable over the weekend. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed during the day remained in the range of 12-15kmph, which helped disperse pollutants. “For a brief period the wind speed had even touched 16kmph. On Saturday, the winds will pick up more and we are expecting that the air quality index can even reach the poor zone,” Srivastava said. He said that on Sunday too, weather conditions will remain favourable. Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said that the number of stubble burning cases in Punjab and Haryana had also dropped to 1143 from 2912 a day before, which also brought some respite to the national capital. “A significant improvement is forecasted for Sunday, when the AQI is likely to come down to the lower-end of very poor to poor category. The SAFAR synergized stubble fire counts significantly decreased and stood at 1143 on Thursday. Although the boundary layer winds direction is favourable for pollutant transport towards the region, improved ventilation conditions likely to bring down the concentration levels in Delhi,” the Safar summary said. It added, “The stubble burning share in PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) decreased and is estimated to be 19% for Friday. In summary, increased surface wind speed and faster dispersion are likely to significantly improve the situation by Sunday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-air-remains-polluted-despite-stronger-winds/story-F3r29MtS83OWYeLm04mFIK.html

31-10-2020||Delhi||Enforcement under new ordinance could be tricky, warn experts||The process of penalising polluters in Delhi-NCR region under the union government’s Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area Ordinance is likely to be a “tricky process”, officials from Delhi’s pollution control board and environment experts said on Friday. Senior officials of the Delhi Pollution Control Board (DPCC) said since the ordinance says the CAQM “shall prevail in all matters relating air pollution”, there is no clarity if DPCC can continue to levy fines over the set limit of R1 crore -- the maximum amount payable as fine for flouting pollution norms according to the Centre’s ordinance. DPCC is the capital’s primary air quality monitoring and enforcement body.The ordinance says polluters in Delhi-NCR can be fined up to Rs1 crore and/or face imprisonment up to a term of five years for violations. The officials said because of a likely confusion on whether their enforcement teams would be able to issue ‘on-the-spot’ fines or not , there is a possibility of violation of air pollution norms increasing this time. “We were issuing fines under the Air Act (1981), which does not have any such limit for penalties. However, technically now that the commission has been declared the sole authority for all pollution-related matters in Delhi-NCR, we are not sure to what extent will the state board be able to exercise this power,” another DPCC official said. Since October 15, when the winter segment of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) came into effect, DPCC teams have imposed two fines worth R1 crore on municipal agencies for garbage burning in the open. Fines ranging between R20 lakh and R50 lakh have also been issued to construction agencies for flouting dust-control norms in the city. Over 40 ready-mix concrete plants and illegally operating industries have been issued fines ranging from R5 lakh to R20 lakh. According to the new ordinance, if the commission wants to penalise a polluter, they will have to present the case before a first-class magistrate, who will probe the violation and order the penalty if the charge is proven in court. This can make the entire process more time consuming, giving a window to polluters to get away, experts said. Environment experts said while a fine up to R1 crore and/or imprisonment of up to five years may seem “progressive”, in reality it puts a limit on the fine that can be imposed, which is contrary to the polluter-pay principle. Environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta said since the commission is an executive body and not a judicial body, it can only issue directions. For instance, if an agency is found to be flouting pollution norms, the new body can direct it to stop operations but it does not have the power to directly fine it. “They (CAQM) will have to file a complaint case before a magistrate. An investigation will be called to prove the violation. It will be a judicial trial; it will not be an executive order for punishment. They can tell the court that they want to impose a fine but to get it implemented, they will have to prove that the violation was committed and this could take as much time as it does,” Dutta said. Dutta said the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) had the same power of imposing fines (earlier up to R1 lakh), but in its 22 years of existence they could not extract a single penalty. “This route has proved unsuccessful earlier, and we are resorting to same route again,” he said. Shibani Ghosh, an environmental lawyer and a Centre for Policy Research (CPR) fellow, said the provision for monetary penalties and imprisonment and the process of imposing such a penalty via courts is similar to what is available in the Air Act and the Environment (Protection) Act.“If you look at National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports, convictions under the Air Act and EP Act are very low. The fear of criminal prosecution is only a deterrent if people notice that polluters are prosecuted and convicted. But it rarely happens. So, in that sense, I don’t see how the provision for criminal penalties in the ordinance could be an effective deterrence,” Ghosh said.Ghosh, however, said since the ordinance has only just been passed, the nuts and bolts of how things will work out with existing institutions will have to be seen once the commission starts functioning.A union ministry of environment, forest and climate change spokesperson said the commission will be constituted at the earliest and enforcement under it will be stricter against all kinds of air pollution-related violations. “This special body was formed because the action taken by the earlier teams was lacking in some way. This commission will ensure action is taken,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/enforcement-under-new-ordinance-could-be-tricky-warn-experts/story-bevJ7jJtT6t0aVeqjP0e9K.html

People ignore this board and dump waste below it. This road is otherwise very wide and clean. The dumping activity makes the road look dirty now,” said Rahul Shinde, 35, who takes the 90 Feet Road to reach Kalyan.Earlier, the residents in the vicinity of this road had complained about illegal parking of two wheelers on this stretch.“The waste has been dumped on the road since the last two-three days, and nobody has come to pick it up. The civic body should install CCTV cameras on such major roads to catch the violators and fine them on the spot,” said Mansi Pandit, 40, a resident of 90 Feet Road.An official from KDMC, requesting anonymity, said, “We will pay a visit to this road and take the necessary action without delay. Since we have eliminated the use of garbage bins, there are some spots where people have started dumping on the roads. We will keep a track on this and take action.”In KDMC, there are 113 ghanta gadis, 43 RCC van and six dumpers. Further, the civic body has plans to acquire two more ghanta gadis for each ward as per the requirement.“We do have enough workers for waste management but sometimes they remain absent. We are trying to resolve this issue through surprise visits and taking action against such employees. Once the workers remain present and do their job efficiently, there won’t be any such complaints regarding waste found on road,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/garbage-dumped-on-thakurli-road-despite-board-asking-not-to/story-IgffA34kDN0ILMB2SAAxkN.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar over MCD functioning||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of Delhi (MCD) over the issue of financial debts and their inability to pay salaries to doctors, which led to recent strikes by healthcare workers in the city.“The BJP has put a massive burden of debts on the residents of Delhi. They cannot even pay salaries to doctors. The BJP-ruled MCDs have to take Rs 18,000 crore from the central government and must return Rs 8,500 crore to Delhi government,” said AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.He said, “The MCDs have sealed Delhi’s big markets and illegally taken conversion fee and parking charges, yet shops are sealed, shopkeepers are devastated. They should hand over the charge of the civic agencies to the AAP. We can operate them with a surplus budget.”The Delhi BJP’s spokesperson said, “In 1994, the BJP has run Delhi government with a surplus budget. There is no debt burden on Delhi residents due to the MCDs. The sealing in a few markets faced by traders is due to failure of the Kejriwal government in terms of failure to issue appropriate notifications in the right time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-spar-over-mcd-functioning/story-fAtmoM1MZ04DhXmD5QpOXM.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||NGO report: MCD councillors skipped house meetings, asked fewer questions||The performance of municipal councillors in Delhi’s three civic bodies — North, South and East — had fallen in the year 2019-20 as compared to previous years in terms of attendance in House meetings, the number of questions asked and the relevance of issues raised, a report card released by Praja Foundation, a non-government organisation, said on Friday.The report titled “Delhi Councillor Report Card 2020” is prepared annually by the Praja Foundation where it rates elected representatives of the three civic bodies on the basis of data accessed through RTI and public accounts.The report suggests the attendance of the councillors in Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled civic bodies — North Delhi Municipal Corporation, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) — has fallen compared to previous years. “The performance of councillors has fallen in all three corporations in 2019-20. The attendance score fell in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation from 75.32% in 2017-18 to 66.38% in 2019-20, in SDMC from 75.10% to 66.61% and in EDMC from 81.83% to 71.27%”, said Milind Mhaske, director, Praja Foundation. The attendance percentage of councillors in 2018-19 was 70% in North Corporation, 71% in SDMC and 76% in EDMC.Mhaske said the overall questions raised by councillors fell by 29% from 18,128 in 2017-18 to 12,879 in 2019-20. The highest fall was in north corporation, where the number of questions raised fell by 35%, followed by SDMC with a 27% fall and EDMC, which reported 16% fall. The report said 55 councillors (54%) in North DMC, 56 (54%) in SDMC and 37 (62%) in EDMC scored less than 50% in raising the issues of their areas (obligatory duties) and showed “poor quality of deliberation”. The report said seven councillors (3 north corporation, 3 SDMC, 1 EDMC) asked zero questions in 2019-20.The report gave scores to the councillors and ranked them on parameters of attendance in the House, number of issues raised, relevance of issues and their accessibility. Ravinder Kumar of Chandni Chowk (North Corporation), Satpal Kharwal of Vishnu Garden (SDMC) and BS Panwar of Shahdara North (EDMC) were given the first rank in their respective corporations.Anamika Mithilesh, south Delhi mayor, said she has not yet seen the report and refused to comment on it. Mayors of the north and east corporations also refused comment citing similar reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngo-report-mcd-councillors-skipped-house-meetings-asked-fewer-questions/story-fc5rPUmNKInbKYfXHkyGeP.html

The drive will continue for 15 days, in which the KDMC team will target illegal stalls, extensions of shops and hawkers on the footpath.In February this year, the KDMC had initiated such a drive in which most of the major footpaths were cleared with the help of the traffic police and ward office staff. However, the encroachments have returned to the footpaths all over again.“The footpaths, which are made for the pedestrians to walk freely, are mostly occupied with illegal encroachments. Before the drive, we have informed the shopkeepers and housing societies to make sure they themselves remove the encroachments from footpaths,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner.The drive was initiated by the civic body since February 27. However, it came to a halt due to the lockdown imposed for Covid-19 pandemic across the Maharashtra state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kdmc-to-remove-footpath-encroachments-in-second-drive-from-nov-1/story-GPpk8Crwje5iAqrEavcniI.html

While the police’s initial probe revealed that the firecracker that triggered the mishap was picked up by children from a Ramlila site, the boy’s family alleged that such crackers were being sold illegally at small general stores in the neighbourhood. This festive season, like last year, only shops licensed to sell green firecrackers are allowed to sell these . As of Thursday, only 138 such licences were issued by the Delhi Police. In the Outer North police district, where this mishap occurred, only five such shops have been granted licences. Still, as evident by the noise level last year during Diwali, when few crackers are supposed to have been available, a huge illegal trade of firecrackers does carry on, and not all of the explosives sold meet green norms as they are supposed to. Jitendra Kumar Meena, serving temporarily as the additional deputy commissioner of police of outer north district, said that the police were in the process of registering a first information report. “The death happened on Wednesday, but no one made a call to the police. The boy was brought dead to a hospital and his family then decided to take the body away,” said Meena, adding that the police got to know of the death only on Friday through social media.The boy, identified only by his first name, Prince, lived with his parents in Om Vihar Colony of Alipur. His father is a labourer and his mother works in a farm. His mother, Babita Devi, said that she and her husband were away at work on Wednesday evening when her son and his friends purchased firecrackers from a local shop. She said that no old firecrackers were stored in her house. According to another police officer who didn’t want to be identified, the boys decided to have some fun by placing a steel tumbler on a cracker before lighting it. When the cracker didn’t go off, Prince approached it to take a look. “It was at that moment that the cracker went off and the tumbler flew and pierced his stomach and chest. It stayed inside his body and the loss of blood killed him before he could betaken to a hospital,” said the officer. As per laws governing the issue of licences, firecracker shops should be located only in commercial areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/9-year-old-boy-dies-in-freak-firecracker-accident-in-n-delhi/story-BXs6Bh01LnQxQJopvBe7kN.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||ISBTS likely to reopen from November 1: Kailash Gahlot||Interstate bus services and ISBTS in Delhi are likely to reopen from November 1, even as senior Delhi government officials on Friday said they hoped the 20-passenger cap on buses would be lifted by next week.State transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the decision to resume interstate buses and reopen the city’s three ISBT’s was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in a meeting held on October 23. “The minutes of the DDMA meeting held on October 23 were issued on Thursday and received by the transport department today (Friday). The department is now preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed in ISBTs and aboard inter-state buses. While the order will be issued by the transport department on Saturday, it is likely that resumption of interstate bus movement will be effective from November 1,” Gahlot said. The minister said no decision had been taken regarding lifting the restriction of 20 passengers in each of our Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses in the DDMA meeting. Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had advised that the matter may be examined in light of the social distancing norms laid out for Covid-19 management. “We had sent a proposal to increase the capacity of buses to 40 per bus after the October 23 DDMA meeting. I am yet to receive the file,” Gahlot said. A senior official in L-G Baijal’s office said the LG has, in all likelihood, approved the proposal to increase the passenger capacity in DTC and cluster buses. The resumption of these services would mean that all three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi — in Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate, and Sarai Kale Khan — will also reopen after being shut for more than seven months.In Delhi, interstate bus services were suspended on March 21. But before the onset of the pandemic, the three ISBTs saw a combined footfall of over 250,000 every day. At least 3,467 buses from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Chandigarh would ply through these ISBTs every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/isbts-likely-to-reopen-from-november-1-gahlot/story-JPWuXTdgXXvAQA5nacYaEP.html

The accused would befriend them on social media and often, on the pretext of marrying them, would ask them for money.The accused, Milind Deshmukh, a resident of Thane, would pose as PSI Ganesh More and send Facebook friend requests to women constables. In his latest con, Deshmukh sent a request to a 27-year-old constable attached to the Shivaji Nagar police station in Mumbai.The constable, a resident of Kalamboli village in Navi Mumbai, accepted the request on October 11. Her husband is stationed outside Mumbai while she lives alone.Deshmukh’s profile picture is in a police uniform, which he used to build trust with his victims, officials said.“As the constable was a little attentive, she picked up red flags in his behaviour and was able to identify his con. This helped bust his con within two weeks before he was able to dupe her of more money,” said an officer from Kalamboli police station.After the constable accepted his request, Deshmukh told her he was attached to the Thane police. While keeping his conversations friendly for over a week, on October 22, Deshmukh told her he had lost his wallet and was in need of money.As Deshmukh claimed he was stuck in Thane without money and cannot get back home, the next day, the woman agreed to give him ₹10,000. She transferred the amount using an online cash transfer application.Deshmukh had bragged about knowing two more women constables from Mumbai, with whom the complainant was acquainted. After the accused asked for more money from her under a different pretext, she decided to do a background check and contact the other constables. She learnt he had borrowed money from them as well.The woman then asked Deshmukh to meet him. They decided to meet at Kalyan railway station at 2 pm on Monday. While she was waiting for him, Deshmukh approached her. She was unable to recognise him, since he used a fake picture.Police said Deshmukh then allegedly confessed to having created a fake account and claimed his real name was Kailash. The woman constable brought him to the police station and after preliminary investigation, the police learnt his real name is Deshmukh.“We have learnt that he had at least two cases against him in Navi Mumbai where he posed as a sub-inspector. We suspect Deshmukh had conned more than three constables and have urged the victims to step forward with a complaint against him,” said Sanjay Sadigale, assistant inspector at Kalamboli police station.The accused has been remanded to police custody till Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-posing-as-police-sub-inspector-dupes-women-constables-arrested/story-uvZfLGAjwzmUKQKVhKHVyO.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||45 villages in Thane rural stay Covid free||The Mhasa village in Murbad taluka, Thane rural, one of the villages that never had a single Covid case, has fool proof system in place to maintain status quo. They allotted different days of the week for different kinds of shops to open so that all opened once a week. These included groceries, vegetable vendors, farming tools and seeds-related shops.This has helped in maintaining social distancing and ensuring that people do not step out in large numbers. Moreover, they conducted regular awareness drives and ensured isolation was strictly followed by those visiting the village.Like Mhasa, there are around 45 villages in Thane rural, mostly comprising villages from Murbad and Shahapur taluka that did not have a single Covid positive case till date.Apart from adopting all the practices shared by the zilla parishad, some of these villages have implemented proper health care facilities in advance that have helped the respective villages to manage well despite the pandemic.Sanjay Asawar, Gram Sevak, Mhasa village, said, “We kept a tab on each household. Teams were allotted to every area and they visited all the houses, met every family member to know their health. This helped keep a track on anyone with any illness. They were immediately taken to the health centre and related medication was provided. Everyone was told by the social service volunteers about the pandemic situation and the rules to be followed. They were even taught how to wash hands for 30 seconds.”Chandrakant Pawar, deputy chief executive officer, zilla parishad, Thane, said, “From regular sanitization to awareness and social distancing norms, everything has been the same for all villages within Thane zilla parishad. However, these 45 villages ensured to follow these norms in a more disciplined manner. They are now gaining the benefits as there isn’t a single positive case in these villages.“We did not adopt any inhuman practices like isolating outside the village for those coming in, awareness was created regarding the pandemic and the rules to be maintained. Strict isolation was followed by those who travelled to different places during this period. It was the cooperation of the gram sevaks, anganwadi teachers and volunteers who diligently conducted awareness and screening camps across the zilla parishad jurisdiction. We distributed sanitizers, soaps and arsenic tablets to every village, asked them to ensure that hygiene and cleanliness were followed in all villages,” added Pawar.Similarly, Vehlonde village in Shahapur taluka had a doctor visit it and conduct regular health camps. They also trained the anganwadi volunteers in screening and awareness camps. “We ensured that a regular temperature chart of every family member in each household was maintained. Temperature and oxygen levels were monitored regularly. Our village does not have any migrant population. Everyone has his own field for farming and a majority of the population involve tribals. So, mostly everyone is self-sufficient in his own household in terms of basic food essentials,” said Jitesh Vishe, deputy sarpanch, Vehlonde village.“Moreover, we have set up CCTVs across the village through which we ensure that social distancing norms are followed. We also have a centralised announcement system with speakers across the village. This helps in making announcements without going to every doorstep during the pandemic,” added Vishe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mhasa-village-in-thane-rural-sets-example-in-staying-covid-free/story-UYgVxFT9wbP4oFYLynZ3IJ.html
31-10-2020||Delhi||South, west districts worst mask offenders in Delhi||Amid a fresh surge in coronavirus disease cases, an analysis of Delhi Police’s data shows that south and west police districts are the worst in maintaining mask discipline with the maximum number of violations -- highlighting the difficulty in enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.According to data (updated until October 27) seen by HT, at least 47,795 people were fined for not wearing masks in the police’s south district that spreads from Ambedkar Nagar and Kalkaji to South Campus near Moti Bagh. Until two months ago, south district -- which also includes areas such as Defence Colony, Lodhi Colony, Greater Kailash, RK Puram -- did not figure in the top or even the second in the list of violators. In west Delhi, which stood second after south with 40,556 violations, Rajouri Garden police station reported the maximum number of people without masks. 5,123 people were prosecuted in Rajouri Garden. Also Read: Alarm over new Covid-19 cases in Delhi; Centre may step inThe maximum number of violations two months ago (data up to August 27) 22,136, were reported from Outer Delhi district, which includes places such as Mangolpuri, Aman Vihar, Sultanpuri and Kanjhawala. The west district was number 2 on the list then too with 16,772 people fined. The police data had then suggested that citizens in south Delhi were much better at following the mask rule compared to other districts.Earlier this month, a report prepared by the National Control for Disease Control (NCDC) had cautioned that the Capital needs to gear up to tackle a surge of up to 15,000 cases per day during winter and in the festival season.  In the backdrop of daily cases crossing the 5,000-mark, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday reiterated the importance of wearing masks. He said everyone should consider wearing a mask as a vaccine for Covid-19 for now. On Friday, 5,891 new positive cases were reported in Delhi, according to the government’s health bulletin.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe latest police data seen by HT shows that in south Delhi, the Kotla Mubarakpur police station registered the highest number of violations at 4,335, followed by CR Park with 4,192. A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “Every district DCP has been assigned the task of identifying a different area each day in each police station, where police have to strictly enforce the mask rule. It could be outside a temple, a mosque or at a market area.”Kotla Mubarakpur police station includes areas such as the South Extension markets, Ring Road, Sewa Nagar and Kidwai Nagar. Police said their focus in the festive season will be markets. They will also fine shopkeepers who allow shoppers inside without masks.The local MLA from Kasturba Nagar, Madan Lal, said he will launch a special drive to ensure residents adhere to the rule.“It is good the police are active and issuing challans to those not wearing masks or violating guidelines. The Delhi government has been creating awareness and appealed to people to always wear masks.”A police officer from the west district said their focus will be on markets such as Rajouri Garden, Tilak Nagar and Jankapuri, where people have started coming out for festive shopping. Police data shows West Delhi continuously featured among the top three districts with most violators. “We have started making public announcements in markets. People must wear mask at all times,” said a mid-level police officer from west Delhi. Dhanwati Chandela, MLA from Rajouri Garden, said, “ We are carrying out campaigns to raise awareness. The number must be high because many people from outside come to eateries here and flout rules.”An on-the-spot fine of Rs 500 is imposed for not wearing a mask, under a rule passed by the government in June. A drive to penalise those moving about in public spaces without masks was launched on June 14. Until October 27, Delhi Police fined 432,049 people for not wearing masks and collected at least Rs 21.60 crore in fines. Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine, AIIMS, said cases could reduce drastically if everyone adheres to the mask rule and ensure social distancing. “Festival or no festival, people should always wear masks in this pandemic. The problem in Delhi is most people think only those with comorbidities or age-related illnesses may catch it. People are letting their guard down. Wearing mask is a proven measure. But let me add that the rise in number of the cases is also because the government has started conducting a large number of RTPCR tests now.”According to the state government’s health bulletin, a total of 17,058 RTPCR tests were conducted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/south-west-districts-worst-mask-offenders-in-delhi/story-pbAOOmm21DvLLLSdKdvbaP.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||NGO gives Bhiwandi sex workers hope for respectable living||After being forced into prostitution 15 years ago, a 30-year-old woman from Nepal now has a hope to live life respectfully.The woman residing in Hanuman Tekdi, a red light area of Bhiwandi, lost business during the lockdown and is now learning skills like tailoring and making incense sticks among others to earn a living. More than 87 per cent of the women living in this area are now finding hope and looking for alternatives to earn a living.The lockdown might have been bad to most migrant workers and power looms in Bhiwandi. However, it came as a boon to the hundreds of sex workers residing in Hanuman Tekdi.Losing business in the initial months, though, seemed to be difficult. But, with the help of NGOs, these sex workers are now looking at a respectable living.The woman said, “I got married when I was barely 11 and was thrown into prostitution in Bhiwandi when I was 15 and had children. I used to send money to my family back in Nepal. Though I tried to leave the business, many a time I was scared of the world outside and had no support system.”She said that during lockdown, when she lost her income, NGO Shree Sai Seva Sanstha helped her find an alternate job. “They arranged shelter for us and gave us small jobs to earn a living,” she said.The NGO conducted a study on the sex workers in the area during the pandemic and started working on their welfare. They are training the sex workers in various skill-based programmes to provide a dignified source of income.Dr Swati Singh, founder of the NGO, said, “We found in the survey that prostitution came to a halt due to fear of transmission of the virus and the sex workers were sitting idle for more than seven months. The finding revealed around 60 per cent of the sex workers in Hanuman Tekdi have taken loans from friends in the neighbourhood, shopkeepers, local money lenders and their own brothel managers.“Hence, due to the lockdown, they were not able to repay the loan and the lenders were abusing them. With no business, they can’t even pay the room rent.”The red light area at present has around 500 sex workers including 56 per cent foreign nationals. Around 46 per cent women are from Bangladesh while 10 per cent are from Nepal. Only 4 per cent of them are from Maharashtra. The remaining are from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kolkata.The NGO is at present training around 150 sex workers in different skills. They approached the women during the lockdown, provided them with food and medical aids and gained their trust.Singh said, “We started the session in May and had opened bank accounts for every one of them. Not everyone was interested in tailoring. Some were interested in education, a few in dance, some in packing agarbatti, making papad and many in social working. Accordingly, we train them.”She added that most of them did not have their paperwork in place and thus did not get loans from banks, and hence fell prey to the abuse of local money lenders. She said that government should have certain policies in place to help these people seek employment.S D Kokate, senior police inspector, Bhiwandi city police station under whose jurisdiction the red light area lies, said, “We often come to know about a minor or a woman lured and brought from some state or country and forced into prostitution in this area. We try to rescue them. Things are quiet since lockdown and it is good that the NGOs are helping these women to get their life back on track.”The survey found that the women were either trafficked across the borders or they migrated for work and eventually got trapped into the flesh trade.A majority of them are not into sex work by choice. About 78 per cent of them were either forced into prostitution by someone they knew like a relative, friend or even their husbands or trapped due to poor financial circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ngo-gives-bhiwandi-sex-workers-hope-for-respectable-living/story-gSwU75HvaDWwMMCQnBvvUL.html

The stress has been on creating awareness. It has so far collected ₹49 lakh in fine from various violators.Explaining the need for the SVS, municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar, said “For the past two weeks, there has been a drop in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city. Though it is a relief, it is important that all precautions continue to be taken, especially in the upcoming festive season as the virus spreads fast and we still do not have a vaccine for it.”NMMC has set up an SVS in the jurisdiction of each of the eight wards in the city. While the ward committee will continue with its work, the SVS will concentrate on taking action against those indulging in violations concerning health security rules.Bangar said, “Each SVS will consist of two NMMC personnel and as many police personnel. The presence of the police personnel will ensure effective action against non-usage of masks and social distancing violations. Independent vehicles have been given to each of the eight SVS. We appeal to all the residents to cooperate with us and help fight the Covid menace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/special-vigilance-squads-to-monitor-covid-19-violations-in-navi-mumbai/story-SdxyO4l6sZL3TNy7yJilUP.html
31-10-2020||Noida||New police stations proposed in Airport area for better policing||The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) has requested the Uttar Pradesh government to set up six new police stations for better policing now that the new international airport and other mega projects are coming up under its jurisdiction. The work on airport project is expected to begin by mid-2021 and become operational three years later. In the meantime, Yeida is planning to develop the surrounding areas and investors who have bought land to set up factories, manufacturing units and other businesses are also expected to begin development soon. “We have sent a proposal to the state government for setting up the six new police stations to handle the policing in a better manner in this region. We have proposed a dedicated police station for the airport and other stations will be useful in their respective areas. The authority will provide required land and other resources as and when we get an instruction from the government on this issue,” said Arun Vir Singh chief executive officer of Yeida.The proposed police stations are in sectors 18 and 20 (allotted for residential projects), 22D, 21 (where the 1000-acre Film City is planned), 32 and near the Jewar airport. There are 22 police stations in Gautam Budh Nagar district to handle the law and order situation. Currently, Gautam Budh Nagar has 3,869 police personnel — 42 inspectors, 459 sub-inspectors, 972 head constables and 2,396 constables. Officers said with the proposed new system, an additional 1,600 personnel will be posted to Gautam Budh Nagar.“These and other resource enhancement measures are being comprehensively examined and will appropriately respond to City’s future requirements,’ said Alok Singh police commissioner Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/new-police-stations-proposed-in-airport-area-for-better-policing/story-4SyauKxQTL1er2aPelEbrJ.html

31-10-2020||Noida||Yamuna Authority set to buy 150 acres land for developmental projects near Jewar airport site||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) is set to buy about 150 acres of land near the Jewar airport site for developmental projects. At least 80% of the owners have agreed to give their land, paving the way for direct land buying from each farmer, said officials of the Yeida. There are two ways to acquire land – one is through direct buying from farmers, and the other is to implement the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. However, direct buying is convenient because the acquisition through the Land Act takes longer.A team of Yeida officials on Wednesday met a group of farmers from the villages of Nagla Hukum Singh and Karoli Bangar at the Government Inter College for their consent to buy land directly. According to rules, if 80% of farmers, out of the total number of farmers from whom the land is sought, agree then the handover can be made directly from the farmers, said officials of the Yeida.“We will use this land for developing industrial plots to be allotted to those who want to invest in industrial projects near the Jewar airport site. Farmers are willingly offering their land for industries and other infrastructure projects,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The 150 acres fall in the Sector 29 area, where industrial plots are being sold to investors. This sector is in close proximity to Jewar, where the Noida International Greenfield Airport is scheduled to be developed. Switzerland Company Zurich International AG has signed an agreement with the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited to start work at the site from mid-2021, said officials.To attract investment, boost growth and create jobs, Yeida has floated an open-ended scheme to allot plots to those who want to set up businesses here. As per the scheme, anyone can apply to get a plot along the Yamuna Expressway.“For plots less than 4,000 square metres, the authority decides the allotment via lucky draw. For plots of above 4,000 square metres, the authority calls for an interview after evaluating the documents of the applicant to decide the allotment,” said Singh.The Yeida has taken 1,334 hectares of land from farmers for the airport so far for the first phase of construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yamuna-authority-set-to-buy-150-acres-land-for-developmental-projects-near-jewar-airport-site/story-2HFc9gmcYCOGf9A670OBSJ.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||Researchers from Maharashtra develop first-of-its-kind artificial silicone-based prosthetic flipper for Olive Ridley turtle in India||A team of researchers under the Maharashtra forest department along with an architecture student developed and fitted first-of-its-kind silicone-based prosthetic flipper for an Olive Ridley turtle at Vengurla, Sindhudurg.Over the course of the past month, a team led by Dr Santosh Walvekar, veterinarian under the Kolhapur circle of the Maharashtra forest department, studied international methods on how to invent and non-surgically fit a 270 gram and 13-inch prosthetic flipper for the large turtle from scratch, and managed to succeed in their efforts. The team comprised veterinary students Vanshika Kamble and Sanika Sawant; zoologist Rushikesh Mestri; architect Chandrakant Halyal from JJ School of Architecture, Mumbai; and other volunteers.Maharashtra forest department and the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA), an international non-profit organisation working on turtle conservation, said this was the first such successful prosthetic flipper fitted on a turtle in India so far. TSA India is supporting the team with their counterparts from South Carolina, the Unites States for the rehabilitation of the turtle.Last month, a 12-year-old male Olive Ridley turtle was rescued from Vengurla coastline by Shashikant Vengurlekar, a local, after it was found stuck in the fishing net. “Three-fourth of the turtle’s left front flipper had been cut off while the hind flipper was also brutally damaged in the process of disentanglement from the net,” said Vengurlekar, adding that he contacted wildlife rescue group Konkan Wildlife Rescue Forum, which in turn contacted the forest department. Forest officers said they transported the turtle to their range office in Kudal but there was very little chance of its survival. “We contacted Dr Walvekar for help,” said an officer.Walvekar said emergency treatment was provided to the turtle for around 10 days at the transit treatment centre in Kolhapur. “Only then the turtle was stable and began self-feeding again. We were positive that the turtle would survive but were worried about its condition as its right hind flipper was badly injured while the front left one wasn’t there,” he said.Once sure that the turtle could survive, Walvekar gathered the team and began researching prosthetic flippers. “We came across social media videos where such experiments had been successful,” he said. Walvekar then got in touch with Halyal who drew up measurements of the prosthetic flipper based on a mirror image of its existing flipper. The team designed and developed two clay moulds. Then Walvekar met with silicone manufacturers and acquired the equipment required for the experiment. Following this, with the help of Krushnat Powar from a neighbouring dental lab, the team got an impression of the portion of the cut flipper. “We then placed the silicone by removing the clay from the mould, and finally attached two steel plates inside the silicone that would help the turtle move its flipper while swimming. The prosthetic flipper could be placed and used by the turtle as one fourth of the original flipper (stump) was still remaining. The fact that this turtle had a stump made it a special case,” said Walvekar.On October 27, the team placed the turtle in a large tank and the turtle was able to swim and stay afloat. “We realised our experiment had succeeded,” he said.Halyal then got in touch with TSA India and shared videos and images of the design. “Though there have been various efforts to fit prosthetic limbs, especially across south India, this is the first such successful experiment in India. We are evaluating how this animal can be rehabilitated with help from international veterinarians from TSA’s sea turtle centre in South Carolina, and we are proud to see India achieving this feat,” said Shailendra Singh, programme director, TSA India.V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest (Kolhapur), Maharashtra forest department, said, “For the first time an effort has been made by our veterinary team to treat the damaged limbs of an Olive Ridley turtle. The effort has been successful and the animal is recuperating.”DAHANU VETERINARIANS HAD SUCCESSFULLY FITTED TURTLES WITH FIBERGLASS PROSTHETIC LIMBS IN 2017While the state forest department and international conservation groups claimed that the silicone-based prosthetic limb was the first for India, Dr Dinesh Vinherkar, in-charge of the Dahanu marine animal rescue centre, had non-surgically fitted two turtles with prosthetic flippers made of fibreglass in February 2017. It was termed the Dahanu flipper, similar to the Jaipur foot for human stumps. “We must realise that these artificial flippers only help certain turtles with stumps. The prosthetic limb helps exercise the other three flippers through physiotherapy. However, such turtles should not be released with the artificial flipper as they cannot be used after a certain time and do not serve the larger purpose. We are now working on other methods for faster rehabilitation for such turtles,” said Dr Vinherkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/researchers-from-maharashtra-develop-first-of-its-kind-artificial-silicone-based-prosthetic-flipper-for-olive-ridley-turtle-in-india/story-Z99IDzKeAhXW3P8kUhD2gL.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Illegal construction thrives around upcoming Jewar airport||Ever since Zurich International AG signed the agreement to start work on the international airport project along the Yamuna Expressway in Jewar, illegal housing projects have mushroomed in this region. At times, developers who “buy” these plots, for high price considering that an airport and other related infrastructure is expected to come up here, do not know that it is illegal as it did not have approval from the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) that owns the land.On Thursday, the authority demolished illegal construction over 200,000 square metres of agriculture land in Tappal area in violation of rules. The estimated cost of this land, as per the market rate, was ₹200 crore. A day earlier, it had demolished at least five structures, including restaurants and shops, in Mathura along the expressway.“To make sure the illegal housing or other kinds of projects do not come up in our jurisdiction we are exercising zero tolerance and taking tough action against those involved in such unauthorised activities. Also, we appeal to general public not to buy plots or other property here without our authorisation,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Yeida, which has the sole authority to plan or approve housing or other projects along the 165-km expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra. “We have appealed to people that if they buy plots in such unauthorised projects then they will be held responsible. We have been warning people not to fall into the trap laid by the illegal developers. We will demolish all kinds of illegal construction coming up in our jurisdiction.”The modus operandi of fraudsters are relatively simple-- they construct an illegal boundary wall, carve out “residential plots” and offer them at a rate lower than Yedia’s.“And they claim that the project is approved by the authority. Later, the plot buyer has to face the trouble,” said Yeida official, not authorised to speak to media.Property consultants say that buyers must first check directly with Yeida to ensure that the land that they are offered was genuine.After the announcement that the work on airport likely to be started soon, land mafia is building illegal structures and also housing projects without approvals in place as the demand for property is on increase,” said Om Raizada property consultant based in Greater Noida. The Yeida has requested people to support the fight against illegal construction.“If anyone gets to know about any illegal construction activity or project they can file a complaint so that we can act,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/illegal-construction-thrives-around-upcoming-jewar-airport/story-p9BUbpeNZZbueYLUz5egoL.html

31-10-2020||Noida||Three persons including food delivery boy arrested for bike theft; 6 bikes recovered||Police on Friday arrested three persons of a gang and recovered five stolen high-end motorcycles from them in Greater Noida. The suspects were identified as 25-year-old Mainpuri resident Ashwini Kumar, 24-year-old Dankaur resident Kaushlendra Nagar, and 25-year-old Rohtak (Haryana) resident Hitesh Panchal who worked as a delivery agent for Zomato, said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida. “Panchal used to wear the company’s t-shirt, enter different residential societies and pass on information to his accomplices, who then stole the motorcycles,” said Sujeet Upadhyaya, SHO Sector Beta 2 police station. The SHO said that police team was conducting a checking drive in Sector Beta II area when they spotted Panchal and Kumar on two of these motorcycles. “They couldn’t produce the vehicles’ registration papers. On questioning , police found that they had tampered with the registration number plates too,” he said.

31-10-2020||Noida||Under-billing by meter readers causes heavy loss to discoms, consumers||Gurugram resident Sandeep Sharma owns a flat in Noida sector 51, which he had rented out. The tenant, during his 14 months’ stay, had always paid the electricity bill, which was roughly around ₹2,000 per month. “One month after my tenant vacated, the power distribution company (discom) Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) served me a bill of ₹1.8 lakh stating that the meter reader had been under-billing till now,” he said. Similarly, Rajeev Goyal received a bill of ₹5.5 lakh in October for his sector 22 house that he had rented to someone to run as a paying guest house facility. “When I enquired about it with the discom, they said that over 63,000 units had not been reported. It is obvious that the tenant, in connivance with the metre reader, paid less than the actual consumption. Now, when I am asking him to clear the dues, he is daring me to get him to vacate the house,” he said, adding that he is contemplating legal action.Goyal and Sharma’s stories are among the many that PVVNL, which distributes power to west UP districts, has unearthed during its drive to reduce revenue loss. The public sector company outsourced the meter reading duties to a private company. It has now come to light that people who read meters deliberately under reported the power consumption. Discom officials say that under billing has not only caused revenue loss, but is often believed to be line loss -- due to loss during transmission. Arvind Mallappa Bangari, the managing director of PVVNL, said that in the last six months, FIRs against over 200 meter-readers have been lodged in different districts falling. “Alarmed with poor revenue collection in some areas of these districts, we started checking the actual meter reading. Consumers in whose name the meter is now have no option than to pay it, even if it was the tenant who bribed the reader,” he said. “Since these meter readers are from private companies, we have intimated this to their top management. We are also creating awareness among the consumers that the better revenue collection will ultimately benefit them as it will reduce the power tariffs.” Under billing, however, will not carry any penal interest unlike late payment of bills, he added.Virendra Nath Singh, Noida divisional chief engineer of PVVNL, said that Noida division has achieved around 100% target of revenue collection in October. “We have so far disconnected power lines of around 12,000 defaulters, who have yet not cleared their power dues of over ₹25 crore. We have also recovered over ₹8 crore from nearly 5,000 consumers, who paid this amount in fear of disconnection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/under-billing-by-meter-readers-causes-heavy-loss-to-discoms-consumers/story-NwWr0JkHNobgSfDC72HrDI.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Respite soon for Noida residents as Air quality likely to improve, preventive measures intensified||Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida suffered “very poor” air on Friday,as per the central pollution control board (CPCB) bulletin at 4pm. However, throughout the day, different pockets of the cities even experienced “severe” levels of air pollution that could affect healthy individuals. If it not for meteorological conditions, the average air quality index (AQI) for the day could have been “severe”. Weather analysts predict some in the coming two days with wind speed likely to pick up. “The wind speed increased on Friday to an average of 10 kmph (which is the minimum speed required to disperse pollutants in the national capital region, NCR) in the north-westerly direction and brought in smoke and dust from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. For a short duration, the speed was even 15 kmph, allowing better ventilation,” said Mahesh Palawat, director of private weather forecasting agency Skymet. He added that on Saturday and Sunday the wind speed are likely to increase to an average of 15 kmph which will further help with dispersion. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), stubble burning accounted for 19 per cent of the day’s pollution, down from 36 per cent on Thursday. “Increased surface wind speed and faster dispersion are likely to significantly improve the situation by 1st November,” read the Safar forecast. Districts’ officials said that they have intensified the pollution control measures like intensive water sprinkling on the roads and discouraging stubble burning. According to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution control Board (UPPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 379 against 383 a day earlier. For Greater Noida the AQI was 394 against 412 a day earlier. For Ghaziabad it was 382 against 389 a day earlier. Loni in Ghaziabad, Knowledge Park-V in Greater Noida and Sector-62 in Noida were among the most polluted areas were AQI oscillated between 422 to 402 considered ‘severe’ on Friday. For Greater Noida, the PM10 589.02 was microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m³)and PM2.5 levels were 275.6 µg/m³. For Noida, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 459.99µg/m³and 240.05µg/m³respectively. For Ghaziabad, the PM10 level was 438.36µg/m³ and PM2.5 was 255.13µg/m³. The CPCB standard limit for PM2.5 is 40µg/m³while that of PM10 is 60µg/m³. Agriculture department distributes decomposers to discourage stubble burning As the stubble burning peaks, the officials at the district agriculture department said that they are distributing decomposers among the farmers to convert stubble into manure, and discourage stubble burning. “This is the peak time of the harvesting and therefore chances of stubble burning intensify. Thus the department is distributing decomposers among the farmers. It’s a liquid in small bottles that is mixed with about 200 litres of water and sprayed over the stubble. This converts stubble into manure and the farmers don’t have to burn the stubble to improve the fertility of farms,” said Manveer Singh, deputy director, Agriculture, Gautam Budh Nagar. He added that over 10,000 bottles of decomposers are being distributed among the farmers. Each bottle of decomposer has about 150 ml of decomposing chemicals that is mixed in 200 litres of water and converts stubble into fertiliser within seven days. “We are also intensifying the awareness drive to discourage stubble burning. The November first week is the peak of paddy harvesting as farmers have to meet the short window to prepare the fields for wheat by November end,” Singh added. Road washing intensified Meanwhile, the Noida Authority has intensified the mechanical sweeping, sprinkling and washing the roads as dust controlling measures. “We have also started washing the roads using machines as dust control measure. A total of 60 kilometres of road length across different parts of the city was washed at night. Apart from that 105 to 110 kms of road are being sprinkled with help of 75 water tankers and mechanical sweeping is being done acorss the length of 243 kms of road,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, health, Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/respite-soon-for-noida-residents-as-air-quality-likely-to-improve-preventive-measures-intensified/story-d00pfHoIezBYAK6KHuAr3J.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Load-testing exercise for Delhi-Meerut Expressway underway, traffic diverted||Ghaziabad: For the next two months, commuters travelling on the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) Phase 2 will have to deal with frequent diversions as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) starts with the load testing process for three major structures. The work, which will be taken up in a phased manner, is being conducted for the Hindon canal overbridge near UP Gate, river Hindon river overbridge near Chijarsi, and the flyover at Lal Kuan.Officials said that these three major structures, under the 19.2km Phase 2, have four sections each – two on each side of every stretch for traffic – between Delhi and Ghaziabad. For now, the NHAI has started load testing work for the Hindon canal overbridge (on the Ghaziabad to Delhi side) near UP Gate and traffic has been diverted with the help of the traffic police. “During the three days of the load testing exercise, vehicles going to Delhi will be diverted to the expressway lanes. Commuters can also use the underpasses to move to other localities on either side. Each of the four spans of the structures will take three days for load testing works. During these three days, we will place fully laden trucks in a formation and will assess the strength of the structures,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.Once work at the Hindon canal overbridge (near UP Gate) is over, NHAI will do the same at the Hindon river overbridge at Chijarsi, and then the Lal Kuan flyover. “To avoid inconvenience to motorists, load testing works will be taken up on different dates. For instance, the first part, at the Hindon canal overbridge near UP Gate, is being taken up for three days during the weekend. Likewise, the time frame for other structures too will be decided. The entire load testing exercise will go on till the end of December,” Garg added. Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), Ghaziabad, said that traffic has been diverted by putting up barricades near UP Gate. “The shutdown has been given for three days, after which one of the sections of the overbridge will be opened. The NHAI will provide us dates for load-testing at other structures. After this, suitable diversions will be put in place,” he added. Phase 2 is about 89% complete in terms of physical progress and is estimated to cater to about one lakh passenger car units once it becomes operational. It comprises 14 lanes with six internal lanes on each side dedicated to the expressway, which will have predefined entry/exit points, while the outer four-lanes on each side will be dedicated to highway lanes which will connect commuters to adjoining areas of Ghaziabad and Noida. “We have also received approval from NHAI headquarters for installation of automatic number plate readers at all entry/exit locations of the expressway lanes. The device will read the registration plates of vehicles at entry/exit points and calculate the fare based on distance travelled by the vehicle. It will have a provision whereby the fare will automatically get deducted from the wallet account of the commuter,” Garg added.The NHAI has proposed six entry/exit points over the 60km expressway route from Akshardham in Delhi to Meerut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-load-testing-exercise-for-delhi-meerut-expressway-underway-traffic-diverted/story-IWWjdA4Ct2UgZGtIJkSW9N.html
31-10-2020||Noida||‘Desi’ breed search and rescue specialists, NDRF trains first lot of stray dogs||Blaze and Tiger are trainees at the National Disaster Response Force’s (NDRF) dog squad used ins search and rescue operations. However, they are not German Shepherds or Labradors but stray dogs. In all, the NDRF’s eighth battalion has four such strays adopted from the campus. Blaze and Tiger are the oldest aged about 17 months each, while two more puppies -- Tony and Lucky-- are aged about 50 days. Usually, India’s forces -- be it police, defence or even rescue teams -- preferred breeds that were naturally obedient and hence easier to train. But the stray dogs had other advantages -- they were already acclimatised to Indian situations, less bulky and hence can easily push themselves through gaps and have more stamina. So training the four strays-- sometimes called desi -- into a battalion that already has 20 well trained non-desi dogs was a unique experiment.“The Prime Minister had earlier this month had given a call to people to go for local brands this festive season to help local business. We were also directed by our directorate to explore roping in of stray dogs. Till now, we had been training and involving German Shepherds and Labradors as part of the dog-squad for search and rescue operation,”said PK Tiwary, commandant of the eighth NDRF battalion at Govindpuram in Ghaziabad. “The strays definitely have an edge in terms that they are already acclimatised with the local environment and require less care than the other breeds.” Both Blaze and Tiger have completed 40 weeks of training in which they underwent physical training and obstacle courses.“Now is the crucial aspect of how to perform search and rescue operations while teaming up with German Shepherds and Labradors. This will be tough as the desi breed is not friendly to the other breeds. But they will be trained,” said NDRF dog handler Sandeep Kumar. For now, both Blaze and Tiger are kept separate from their counterparts and have separate trainers. “The strays are very agile and sometimes it becomes difficult to get them to concentrate. But over a period, they have become attuned to the commands. The other breed dogs are more obedient, sincere and can be handled easily even by other handlers. Strays are more like to take commands from only their own handler,” Kumar, said. Over a period of time, dogs have become indispensable part of the NDRF always accompanying them on missions. Their training includes obedience and familiarisation with public places so that they keep their composure to do the job at hand. The dogs from the eighth battalion had proved their mettle during Tsunami rescue operations in Japan, earthquake in Nepal and have even served in different missions across the country. They have also taken part in local operations during Akash Nagar building collapse in Ghaziabad and Shahberi building collapse incident in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/desi-breed-search-and-rescue-specialists-ndrf-trains-first-lot-of-stray-dogs/story-50Z5Ex5ZVsMmfhqfJlcB8K.html
31-10-2020||Noida||Noida police gears to launch Eco-Friendly traffic awareness month – November||With air quality touching new lows every day, the Noida Traffic Police have planned a month-long traffic awareness programme beginning November 1 with special emphasis on environment friendly initiatives. On Thursday Noida recorded 383 AQI (very poor) and Greater Noida 412 AQI (severe). Ganesh Saha, DCP Traffic, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “We will encourage fuel efficient driving, low emission vehicles and electric vehicles. People will be informed to keep the vehicle in good condition and regularly check pollution.” Saha said motorists would be advised to turn off their engines at traffic lights. “During peak hours, sometimes the waiting time is up to two minutes. Switch off the vehicle saves fuel,” he said. The traffic police will also seize polluting vehicles. The force has also set up a control room from where officials will call about 50 Noida residents everyday and seek their suggestions and feedback. “We will ask if they are satisfied with the traffic policing. If they inform us about a traffic jam or unauthorised parking, encroachment, etc. we will take necessary measures,” said Omkar Singh, a head constable at the control room.Residents can inform traffic police on – 9971009001 (call) and 7065100100 (WhatsApp only)The department has identified 35 black spots in the district where accidents have become frequent. Some of these black spots include Rajnigandha Chowk, Mahamaya Flyway, zero point of Noida-Greater Noida expressway, zero point of Yamuna Expressway, Gijhore intersection, Sector 137, NSEZ, Yamaha Chowk in Greater Noida, Jewar Toll Plaza, etc.  “We will audit these black spots done and then take necessary corrective measures,” Saha said.Gautam Budh Nagar has recorded a sharp fall in the number of road accidents amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. According to the data from the district transport department, the district witnessed 317 mishaps from March 1-September 15 this year as against 653 last year. The fatalities due to road accidents also went down this year, with the district recording 162 deaths during the period, while 278 deaths were reported during the same period last year.In 2019, the Noida traffic police had issued 6,99,708 challans and collected ₹14.76 crore fine from violators.

31-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks woman booked for abusing Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aditya Thackeray to appear before cyber cell||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed Sunaina Holey, a resident of Navi Mumbai, booked by the Mumbai and Palghar Police for posting offensive remarks on social media against chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and state minister Aaditya Thackeray in July, to appear before the cyber cell of Mumbai Police at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) on November 2. Holey had approached the HC to quash the first information reports (FIRs) against her.Earlier, the HC had directed a Nagpur resident Sameet Thakkar, who was booked under similar charges, to cooperate with the investigation and appear before the cyber cell at BKC as well. A division bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik, while hearing the application by Holey to quash the three FIRs registered against her, was informed by assistant public prosecutor JP Yagnik for the state government and police, that the FIRs were registered after several persons, including Rohan Chavan, a member of the Yuva Sena had lodged complaints against her for offensive remarks made against the CM and Aaditya.Apart from the offensive remarks against the CM and his son between July 25 and 28, Holey had also shared a morphed caricature of the father-son duo. Holey was booked under sections 505 (punishment for statements conducting public mischief) and 153 (A) (punishment for promoting enmity between different religious groups) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act.Yagnik submitted that though Holey had been issued notices under section 41-A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), she had not appeared before the concerned investigating officer at the BKC cyber police station in Mumbai. Hence, he sought directions of the court to make her do so at the earliest. Advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud who represented Holey, however, said that his client was unwell and could not appear on the earlier occasion, but was willing to report to the BKC cyber cell on November 2. The court accepted the same and asked her to be present at 11am. In September, Holey had moved the court seeking protection in the form of an application for pre-arrest bail. The court had, however, refused to grant her protection after police assured the court that she would not be arrested if she was willing to cooperate and report to the Azad Maidan and Tulinj police stations. After she failed to report to the said police stations, investigators sought her presence at the BKC cyber cell. After hearing the submissions and accepting an assurance of Holey, the court observed, “The job of police officers is difficult during these times. Sometimes they have more than 12-hour shifts. Then they have to do bandobast for morchas and processions. With all these odds, Mumbai Police is considered one of the best in the world after Scotland Yard.” In light of this, the bench observed that Holey was expected to extend cooperation, which Dr Chandrachud agreed to.The court posted further hearing on the plea to November 23 and said that if there was any urgency, the petitioner was at liberty to move to the appropriate court seeking relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-woman-booked-for-abusing-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-and-his-son-aditya-thackeray-to-appear-before-cyber-cell/story-xd9jnpMJv6GNBmRoxpPWoN.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government plans app, colour-coding mechanism to avoid crowding on Mumbai local trains||The Maharashtra government, which has proposed to open local trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for all commuters, plans to use technology to prevent overcrowding at stations and in trains. The state government is developing a web-based application (app) to help commuters book tickets and decide the time slot during which they wish to travel. The government also plans to introduce a colour-coding mechanism, which will specify the time slot during which the ticket can be used to broad trains.“We will soon develop the app. We are also working on the colour-coding mechanism to restrict the number of passengers in suburban trains,” said Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department of the state government.An official, on condition of anonymity, said, the app and colour-coding mechanism will enable railway authorities to issue a stipulated number of tickets in a bid to prevent overcrowding in trains. Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) authorities had raised concerns about overcrowding given the number of services they run. The CR currently operates 706 daily services, while WR runs 704 services as against their regular of 1,774 and 1,367, respectively.The state government, however, has maintained that appropriate steps are being taken to prevent overcrowding in trains. “We have allowed 30% of private sector employees to travel by trains, which have reduced around 20 lakh daily commuters. Besides, another 20 lakh commuters have become less owing to closure of schools, colleges and other educational institutions. If the railway authorities operate at their full strength of 3,100 train services, no overcrowding will occur during peak hours. We have also suggested running a special train for women passengers every hour. The move is in line with encouraging staggered office hours. More ladies specials will help women commuters to travel during non-peak hours,” said a state government official, requesting anonymity. The official added: “We don’t want to impose more restrictions, but encourage passengers with staggered timings. Now, it’s up to the railway authorities to operate at their full strength.” Mumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said the state administration would work out ways to ensure reopening of train service for all commuters at the earliest, despite the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-plans-app-colour-coding-mechanism-to-avoid-crowding-on-mumbai-local-trains/story-XQ9fBvFXayM5QDfu7IqkjK.html
31-10-2020||Mumbai||Teachers’ groups oppose 50% attendance mandate in SOPs, write to Maharashtra education department to withdraw rule||A day after the state education department released standard operating procedures (SOPs) for teachers and mandated 50% attendance, teachers from across the state have opposed the decision. On Friday, several teachers’ groups wrote to the education department, urging officials to withdraw the attendance rule. “Schools are shut, and teachers are imparting online education to students on a daily basis. The department has also planned to gradually reopen schools for students. So, what is the need to call teachers to school at this point,” asked Anil Bornare from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) teachers’ cell. Several principals from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) schools said that civic officials had asked them to take photographs daily as proof of teachers’ attendance. Teachers have also been asked to visit various localities and teach students as per their needs. “Teachers travel from all parts of the city and come to school. Now with restrictions on travel, they will have to shell out huge sums from their own pockets to come thrice a week. Besides, schools do not have the necessary infrastructure for online learning. Conducting online classes with so many issues is a big hurdle,” said a school principal, requesting anonymity. Rajesh Pandya of the Teachers Democratic Front, said, “Teachers are already burdened with online teaching, and to make things worse, they are being asked to report to school. It is an unfair step.” As per the SOPs released on Thursday, teachers from across the state can be called to their respective schools for work related to online learning or other academic duties. Schools have been asked to ensure that they sanitise their premises, get temperature checks done. Teachers have been asked to follow safety guidelines like wearing masks and follow social distancing.

I request them not to do such politics in the interest of the nation,” Modi said on Saturday during a two-day visit to Gujarat, in remarks aimed at the opposition.On February 14 last year, 40 troopers were killed in a suicide attack on a convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) by a member of the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.Pakistan’s science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhry on Thursday said in the National Assembly that his country had entered India and beaten it on its own soil. “Hum ne Hindustan ko ghuss ke mara hai (We have entered and attacked India),” Chaudhry had said.But on Saturday, the Pakistan foreign office said Modi’s remarks “is a brazen attempt to twist the remarks of the federal minister, who was referring to the befitting response given by the Pakistan Armed Forces in broad day light to India’s ill-conceived misadventure of 26 February 2019, in violation of the UN Charter and international law.”It said, “It is the BJP leadership’s incurable obsession with Pakistan that impels them to invariably blame Pakistan for their own failings and shortcomings.”“Most notably, it has been a part and parcel of the BJP’s electoral strategy to raise the Pakistan ‘bogey’ in the attempt to galvanise voters’ support, while seeking to divert public attention from their domestic and foreign policy failures.”“Pakistan firmly believes that the biggest beneficiary of the February 2019 Pulwama attack was the BJP government, as it resulted in BJP’s landslide victory in Lok Sabha elections following their virulent anti-Pakistan electoral campaign,” it said. “On the other hand, to this day, India has failed to provide any credible evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pulwama attack.”“The BJP regime is advised, once again, to stop dragging Pakistan into India’s domestic politics, especially at the time of elections in India,” it said. “Instead of mobilising the electorate through stoking of anti-Pakistan sentiments, the BJP leadership would be well-advised to win voter support by demonstrating actual performance in meeting the expectations of the Indian people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-sees-red-at-pm-modi-s-remarks-on-pulwama-terror-attack/story-7QA7eoVJzJvlLbUni8mbSL.html

31-10-2020||World||France church attack: Assailant’s family seeks answers||A third suspect is in French custody Saturday in connection with an Islamic extremist knife attack that killed three people in a Nice church, as the distraught family of the suspected Tunisian assailant asked to see video footage of what happened.Investigators in France, Tunisia, and Italy are trying to determine the motive of chief suspect Ibrahim Issaoui, and whether he acted alone and whether he premeditated Thursday’s attack on the Notre Dame Basilica.Authorities have labeled the attack, which took place amid growing tensions around cartoons published by a French newspaper mocking the Prophet Muhammad, an act of Islamist terrorism.Issaoui, who transited through Italy last month en route to France, is in critical condition in a French hospital after being wounded by police as they arrested him.A 35-year-old man who had met with Issaoui in Nice was arrested overnight, a judicial official said Saturday. A 47-year-old man who had met with Issaoui the night before the attack was already in custody, bringing the number of detained suspects to three. Their connection to the attack remains unclear.A previously unknown Tunisian extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack, and Tunisian and French authorities are investigating whether the claim is legitimate.In Issaoui’s hometown of Sfax, his family expressed shock and appealed for peace. But they also expressed bewilderment that this young man who drank alcohol and showed no outward signs of radicalism would flee to France and attack a church.“We want the truth about how my son carried out this terrorist attack. I want to see what the surveillance cameras showed. I will not give up my son’s rights outside the country. I want my son, dead or alive,” his mother Gamra told The Associated Press(AP), her words often interrupted by tears.His father and brother Wissem said that if Issaoui indeed carried out the attack, he should face justice.“We are Muslims, we are against terrorism, we are poor. Show me that my brother committed the attack and judge him as a terrorist,” Wissem said. “If he was the attacker, he will take his responsibility.”On the dusty Tina Street, amid low-rise homes in the working class Nasr neighborhood of Sfax, friends and neighbors said Issaoui sold gasoline for motorcycles and while not starving or homeless, he was poor like many in the area. That poverty is driving more and more young Tunisians to seek jobs and opportunity in Europe this year.He had small-time run-ins with the law as a teen, but nothing that alerted Tunisian authorities to possible extremist leanings.That meant that when he was served an expulsion order from Italy, he could go where he pleased.Italy’s interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, told the AP that Italy’s overburdened repatriation centres had no place for him.“Obviously, we give precedence to people who are signalled by law enforcement or by Tunisian authorities,’’ Lamorgese said. “The number of spots are not infinite, and he could not therefore be placed inside a repatriation centre.’’A friend believed to have hosted Issaoui in Alcamo in western Sicily for a couple of weeks told police that Issaoui found work in the area for some days picking olives, then abruptly departed, Italian newspaper La Republicca reported Saturday. Police also searched the friend’s home, Italian media reports said.Meanwhile, anger at France remains high among many Muslims abroad over France’s defence of the prophet cartoons and President Emmanuel Macron’s pledges to crack down on Islamist fundamentalists.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been at odds with Macron on several fronts lately, said Saturday: “All kinds of insults towards our prophet target all Muslims.”Indonesian President Joko Widodo, the leader of the world’s most populous Muslim nation, on Saturday strongly condemned terrorist attacks in France as well as comments by Macron seen as offensive toward Islam.The French Embassy in Jakarta issued a statement seeking to calm spirits, saying “there was no intention at all to generalize” and that Macron “clearly distinguished between the majority of French Muslims and the militant, separatist minority that is hostile to the values of the French Republic.”Macron himself gave an interview to broadcast network Al-Jazeera scheduled to air Saturday, and spoke with Pope Francis about the attack on the church and current religious tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-church-attack-assailant-s-family-seeks-answers/story-eRoIXFUkTm7fb2EVoS0qvN.html

A row is also escalating with Turkey, whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the French leader needs to undergo a mental examination.Macron, who had earlier said Islam faced a “crisis,” told broadcaster Al-Jazeera that his remarks have been distorted to make it appear as though he were supportive of the cartoons, which he said were published by independent media.“I understand that one can be shocked by cartoons, but I will never accept that violence can be justified. Our freedoms, our rights, I consider it our vocation to protect them,” Macron told the broadcaster, according to an official at the presidency. Al-Jazeera will air the full interview later on Saturday.Macron’s government has vowed to crack down on Islamist radicals after an assailant beheaded a teacher in Paris earlier this month who had showed the cartoons in a class discussion about freedom of expression.Al-Jazeera reported that Macron said most victims of terrorism are Muslim, and the acts committed in the name of the religion were a blight on them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-prez-macron-says-he-understands-muslim-feelings-on-prophet-image/story-Z15YBcxklPhgANk4aCRTBK.html
31-10-2020||World||‘Obamacare’ sign-ups begin as millions more are uninsured||Millions of Americans who have lost health insurance in an economy shaken by the coronavirus can sign up for taxpayer-subsidized coverage starting Sunday.It’s not a new COVID relief program from the government but the return of annual sign-up season under the Affordable Care Act, better known as “Obamacare.” Open enrollment runs through December15.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs HealthCare.gov, says premiums are down slightly on average for 2021 and most people will have at least three insurers from which to pick plans. Lower-income people and even middle-class families may qualify for tax credits that can greatly reduce what they pay monthly for premiums.But President Donald Trump, unrelenting in his opposition to President Barack Obama’s signature domestic program, is asking the Supreme Court to overturn the entire law.Trump has been promising a much better replacement since before taking office, but never came out with his plan. The justices are scheduled to hear the case November 10, and the administration is doing little to promote sign-ups, having previously slashed the program’s ad budget.“Affordable health coverage is more essential than ever during the pandemic,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who’s urging people to enroll even if Trump keeps trying to do away with the law.Hard numbers on how virus-related job losses have affected health coverage are not available because the most reliable government surveys will not be out until next year. Estimates range from 5 million to 10 million newly uninsured people.“There is a coverage crisis happening, ” said Stan Dorn, a health policy expert now with Families USA, a liberal advocacy group. “And there are fewer resources available to help, thanks to the Trump cuts.”Dorn worries that’s “a setup for epic failure,” and many people will remain uninsured even as states across the country are seeing alarming increases in coronavirus cases.Administration officials say HealthCare.gov is open for business and ready to handle sign-ups online or via its call center. “We’ll be working through the upcoming open enrollment period...to ensure a smooth user experience,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma said.More than 11 million people currently have coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-run health insurance markets offering subsidized private plans. The health law also covers another 12 million people through its Medicaid expansion, adopted by all but 12 states.Medicaid enrollment has gone up by nearly 4 million people since March, but it’s still unclear how many laid-off workers are coping after the loss of employer coverage in the coronavirus economy.Those who are healthy most likely have other priorities, such as finding another job. Workers who were furloughed, but not laid off, may have been able to keep their coverage. Some appear to have switched to a spouse’s plan, and those age 65 and older can get on Medicare.The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 80% of those who lost workplace health insurance are eligible for coverage under the law, either through the insurance markets or Medicaid.Some private businesses, such as HealthSherpa.com, have created a niche market helping people enroll in HealthCare.gov plans. Former Obama administration officials are trying to promote sign-ups through GetAmericaCovered.org. Community organizations also play a role helping people with paperwork.But, Dorn said, “a lot of people who need health insurance may not know there this is there chance to sign up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obamacare-sign-ups-begin-as-millions-more-are-uninsured/story-v6qgCDtaAupAulmEtHI3vK.html
31-10-2020||World||Sean ‘James Bond’ Connery passes away at 90||Sean Connery, who epitomised the suave yet cold-hearted spy James Bond in seven iconic thrillers and won several awards, including one Oscar, has passed away aged 90, his family said on Saturday.Knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000, the Edinburgh-born Connery took up odd jobs in early years and appeared in some films, before James Bond happened. His dialogue, “Bond, James Bond”, defined his portrayal of the spy, widely considered the best among actors who played the iconic role.The seven films Connery appeared as James Bond are: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983).Born Thomas Sean Connery on August 25, 1930, he was the son of a factory worker and a domestic cleaner. His initial years were difficult, working as a coffin polisher, delivering milk and briefly joining the Royal Navy.Connery took to bodybuilding and worked as a model at the Edinburgh College of Art. He briefly played for Manchester United, but driven by the acting bug, took to the stage. He was noticed while participating in the 1953 Mr Universe competition.One of his first appearances was as an extra in the 1954 film, Lilacs in the Spring, before he got his first lead role in Blood Money (1954). Then James Bond happened, with Connery selected to play the lead in Dr No, after other actors such as Cary Grant and Richard Burton were considered.His other notable films included The Hunt for Red October, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Rock.Connery was married twice; first to Australian actress Diane Cilento, and then to Moroccan-French painter Micheline Roqubrune. He was a member of the Scottish National Party that seeks independence for Scotland, and funded it until 2001..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sean-james-bond-connery-passes-away-at-90/story-T0opOwm5pdyHYwDczFzzyJ.html
31-10-2020||World||England set to join EU nations in Lockdown 2||After new expert modelling showed a greater number of deaths and cases than the March lockdown, the Boris Johnson government was on Saturday considering another ‘fire-breaker’ lockdown for a month from next week, joining similar measures across Europe.The second lockdown is being considered for England, the largest and most populated constituent of the United Kingdom, with local lockdown and tighter restrictions already in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Johnson has so far resisted the lockdown option, implementing a three-level alert level with varying degrees of restrictions regionally in areas with spike in new cases to ensure some areas of the economy continue to function. However, experts and the opposition Labour insist the regional approach has not been effective.As experts said the virus was now “running riot” across all age groups, official figures show that as of Friday evening, there were 24,405 new cases and 274 new deaths across the UK. The UK’s cumulative death figure of 46,229 is the highest in Europe.Latest modelling of deaths by experts at five centres, including at Imperial College London, University of Warwick and the University of Cambridge shows at least over 2,000 deaths per day – more than twice the peak earlier this year – by December, if lockdown is not imposed. One of the models envisages 4,000 deaths per day.Johnson is expected to announce the new lockdown, with exemptions for schools and universities, on Monday, if not earlier, reports said, adding that the cabinet is likely to meet over the weekend to consider various aspects, including its impact on an already battered economy.Epidemiologist and government advisor John Edmunds told BBC that the only way to have a “relatively safe” Christmas is to take “stringent” action now, while another advisor, Calum Semple, added that another month-long lockdown would bring new cases down dramatically.Semple said: “Unlike the first wave, where we had a national lockdown which protected huge swathes of society, this outbreak is now running riot across all age groups.”France, Belgium and Germany have already imposed tighter restrictions as the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps across Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-set-to-join-eu-nations-in-lockdown-2/story-3eeIn0JKHoVfrNwvNTFMrL.html
31-10-2020||World||Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s assault on Emmanuel Macron is the height of cynicism||Almost three decades after the late Samuel Huntington hypothesized a coming “clash of civilizations,” there are those who — for their own cynical purposes — would actually welcome exactly that. Among them is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.This month, he has once again picked a fight with Europe, and specifically France. The country is constitutionally Islamophobic, he claims. President Emmanuel Macron should get a mental-health checkup, he has said repeatedly,and Muslims everywhere should boycott French goods, Erdogan has urged, pretending to speak on behalf of an entire faith.But Erdogan is picking this fight, like so many other unnecessary conflicts, only to distract Turks from his failure to govern, so that he can keep posing as the restorer of Turkish greatness, defined in opposition to the West. Neither Muslims nor Europeans of other faiths should fall for the provocation. It would be like stooping to the taunts of a bully in a sandbox — pointless, unedifying, and yet dangerous.To recap: In a suburb of Paris this month, a teenager born in Chechnya beheaded Samuel Paty, a schoolteacher. Paty had shown his students caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed in a civics lesson on free speech, which included a discussion of the terrorist attack five years ago on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. In an apparent copycat crime this week, a Tunisian in Nice decapitated a woman and killed two other people.In response, Macron has been cracking down on some of the extremist breeding grounds that produce such terrorists. Erdogan seized on this reaction to pretend that Macron, France and implicitly all Europe are enemies of Islam, like latter-day Crusaders. Let’s separate the strands of action and reaction. The decapitations and other murders are barbaric crimes in France just as they would be in Turkey or any other country. They must be prosecuted accordingly. Furthermore, Macron or any other leader is justified in clamping down on the extremism that motivates such atrocities, just as governments must pursue any variety of terrorism.Macron was also right to defend freedom of speech, which in his proudly secular country includes, as he put it, the “right to blaspheme.” But he then arguably overshot, as is his wont. It wasn’t for him to assert that Islam is “in crisis all over the world today.”The worst that can be said about Macron is that he’s tone deaf. By contrast, Erdogan is cynical in a more malevolent way.There was a time when Erdogan didn’t see the West as Turkey’s enemy and even wanted to join the European Union(EU), but, feeling spurned by Brussels, Berlin, Paris and other Western capitals, he has turned populist, irredentist, and belligerent. He used a failed coup attempt at home as his pretext to stamp out civil liberties including the freedom of speech for which France now stands, and he’s mismanaged Turkey’s economy.To distract Turks from these failures, he tries to claim the mantle of former Ottoman and Islamic grandeur. So he rejects the secular legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (“father of the Turks”). That’s why, for example, Erdogan has turned Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia into a mosque. Built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in the sixth century, it was for centuries the largest church in Christianity, until the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II in 1453 converted it into a mosque. In 1934, Ataturk turned it into a museum. By making it a mosque again, Erdogan signals that he’s a new sultan.In his mind, Erdogan wants Turkey to replace Saudi Arabia and Egypt as the guardian power of Sunni Islam, as the Ottoman Empire once was. And he wants to project power in all directions, toward Moscow as to the West. This is why he’s meddling in conflicts around the region, from Syria to Libya and the eastern Mediterranean, and now also in the battles between (ethnically Turkic) Azerbaijanis and Armenians. In several of these conflicts he faces France on the opposing side.Nominally, Turkey is a member of The North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)and still officially interested in applying to join the EU. In reality, Erdogan needs to portray Europe as the enemy. Because he’s weak at home, he’ll seize on any propaganda opportunity he gets. The danger is that in the process he might unleash passions and hatreds far beyond his or anybody’s control, potentially causing more violence, suffering, and perhaps war. Europeans and Turks of any faith should see through Erdogan’s vanity and cynicism — and tactically ignore him.(Andreas Kluth is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.

He had revealed why Imran Khan’s government decided to release Abhinandan Varthaman, saying Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s “legs were shaking” while Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told the meeting of parliamentary leaders that India was about to attack their country.His statement was heavily criticised by ruling party ministers and also prompted the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) chief Major General Babar Iftikhar to hold a presser in which he sought to “correct the record” regarding the events.“But these are political differences. Their attempt to associate my statement with the armed forces of Pakistan was not a service to the country,” Dawn quoted Sadiq as saying. “You (the government) have played into the hands of Indian media and you have not done justice to Pakistan. I am standing by my stance and you will see in future, I have many secrets. I had been heading the National Security Committee,” it added.Information Minister Shibli Faraz has slammed PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq for his remarks recalling the incident that led to the release of Abhinandan.“The remarks by Ayaz Sadiq are beyond apology. Now the law will take its course. Weakening the state is an unforgivable crime for which Ayaz Sadiq and his companions must be punished,” Faraz tweeted on Friday.Wing Commander Varthaman came into the limelight after he shot down a Pakistani aircraft F-16, which had transgressed into the Indian airspace during a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani air force on February 27, 2019 and in the process, his plane crossed over to the Pakistani side and was shot down.Abhinandan was returned to India from the Attari-Wagah border on March 1, 2019. He has been awarded the Vir Chakra on Independence Day by President Ram Nath Kovind for his exemplary bravery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-lawmaker-ayaz-sadiq-stands-by-indian-wing-commander-abhinandan-varthaman-s-release-statement/story-NbZVF2aVYoZNjl2erh6p8H.html
31-10-2020||World||Road to 270: Joe Biden has options, Donald Trump walks narrow path||President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden each has a path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House. Biden’s is appreciably wider.The former vice president is competitive in all the battleground states Trump carried in 2016 and has put a handful of traditional Republican states, including Georgia and Arizona, in play. That has Trump scrambling to defend a wide swath of territory and putting the incumbent’s hopes for reelection on two of the most populous swing states, Florida and Pennsylvania.A look at the most likely roads to victory:BIDENTRUE NORTHBiden can win an electoral majority most simply by carrying the three states where Trump stunned Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Those states were carried by Democrats for decades before 2016. They would give Biden 279 electoral votes, as long as he wins all the other states in Clinton’s column. Under this scenario, Biden would not need to win any other states Trump won in 2016.The three northern industrial states have been Biden’s sharpest target for advertising dollars. He spent almost $150 million — 30% of his total national ad spending since June — in the three, according to Kantar/CMAG’s review for The Associated Press.The fiercest struggle among the three is in Pennsylvania. Biden has had a slight advantage in most polls, while some suggest Trump remains within striking distance. Biden, who was born in Scranton, claims some favorite-son status in the state. Trump’s hopes have been boosted by Biden’s recent call for phasing out fossil fuels, though Biden has said he would not ban fracking.___SOUTH BY SOUTHWESTIf Biden loses Pennsylvania, it would require him to find 11 electoral votes elsewhere.Once reliably Republican Arizona, offering exactly 11, and North Carolina, with 15, are states Trump won four years ago that are well within Biden’s reach.Democrats are particularly bullish about Arizona, last carried by a Democrat in 1996. Trump won the state in 2016 by 3.5 percentage points, the smallest margin in 20 years, and this year, the Democrats’ Senate candidate, former astronaut Mark Kelly, is running a strong race.The Arizona alternative supposes, as most of Biden’s paths do, that he also wins Nevada, last carried by a Republican in 2004. Trump has campaigned in the state, though Democrats say they are comfortable with their prospects there.The race for North Carolina appears tighter, but there is recent precedent for a Democrat carrying the state. In 2008, Barack Obama was the first Democrat to take it in 32 years. Although he narrowly lost there in 2012, as did Clinton in 2016, waves of college-educated newcomers are swelling its booming suburbs, a boost to Biden’s chances.THE REST IS EXTRAThere’s another scenario for Biden: a more comfortable Electoral College victory.Should Biden win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and either Arizona and North Carolina, he would capture at least 290 electoral votes.He’s also competing for Ohio, which Trump won by 8 percentage points in 2016; Iowa, which Trump won by nearly 10 percentage points; and Georgia, which Trump carried by 5 percentage points. Victories in those states would boost Biden’s electoral total above 300.Biden made two stops in Georgia this past this week and on Friday had his first fall campaign visit to Iowa. He’s spent almost $5 million but hasn’t visited Iowa since the state’s caucuses in February. Biden has campaigned lightly in Ohio but has spent almost $7 million in advertising. Surveys and operatives in both parties said the two states were very close heading into the campaign’s final weekend.Oh, and remember Florida? The perennial battleground offers 29 electoral votes and is, per usual, exceedingly close.There’s one more big prize on the table: Texas. Democrats have been eyeing the state for years, but this is the first year in decades where it may really be within reach for the party.The state’s new battleground status highlights not just Trump’s struggles in the suburbs, which are booming outside Texas’ major cities, but also his weaknesses in nearly every state with a diverse electorate.“Biden has more of an opportunity to win by a larger electoral number than Trump does,” said Republican pollster Glen Bolger, who is surveying in several battleground states but not for Trump’s campaign. “It doesn’t mean Trump can’t win.”___TRUMPFLORIDA OR BUSTTrump almost certainly cannot reach 270 electoral votes without carrying Florida, where polls show a tight race. Some have suggested a slight Biden advantage.Trump’s rally Thursday in Florida was his third campaign trip to the state this month, underscoring why Florida is so important to his reelection. He plans to return before Tuesday’s election.His stop Thursday was in swing-voting Hillsborough County, where Clinton beat him by about 41,000 votes. Hillsborough is next to — and shares a media market with — Pinellas County, the most populous county in the state to flip from Democratic in 2012 to Republican in 2016.Trump won some counties in the surrounding area by more than 60% of the vote, and his campaign hopes it can further run up the score with first-time and less regular voters in these places.Trump planned to accompany first lady Melania Trump when she votes Tuesday near Palm Beach County. The Trumps moved their residence from reliably Democratic New York to Florida last year.___PENNSYLVANIA AVENUEEven if Trump nets Florida and holds battlegrounds he won in the South and Southwest, he would still be short of 270 electoral votes.The president is wagering much on Pennsylvania as the best chance of moving within striking distance of that threshold. After a trio of rallies this past week, Trump was set to hold four more in the state on Saturday.He’s been making stops across Pennsylvania, from counties outside Philadelphia, the largest metro area, to the rural northwest corner of the state.Among his upcoming stops: Bucks County. It was once Philadelphia’s most GOP-heavy suburb but has been trending Democratic and is an example of the obstacles Trump is facing. He lost the county by less than 2 percentage points in 2016 and has seen his standing in the suburbs steadily erode since then.Trump’s argument to Pennsylvania voters was recharged after Biden, during their Oct. 22 debate, called for phasing out fossil fuels. That created an opportunity for Trump in a state with a robust natural gas industry.“Biden’s plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry — you saw that?” Trump noted at a rally last week in Lansing, Michigan, recalling Biden’s call for phasing renewable fuels in and fossil fuels out over time. “Will cripple our nation and send us into an absolute deep depression.”___THE REST ISN’T THE BESTEven if Trump wins Florida and Pennsylvania, he would still be short of the magic number if he can’t carry most of the states he won in 2016.He could nose ahead in Ohio, long one of his strongest states, but would still need to cobble together a series of states he won in 2016, such as Iowa, and some he lost narrowly and continues to trail.That more complicated path would include flipping Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire. That, however, would defy political logic for an incumbent to lose in places won four years ago and win in places lost back then.Grasping for every vote he can, Trump has even campaigned in Maine and Nebraska, where electoral votes are awarded by congressional district and to the overall state winner. A week ago, Trump was in Levant, Maine, near the hub of the state’s GOP leaning north, Bangor, hoping to hold the single electoral vote in its 2nd District, and in Omaha, Nebraska, on Tuesday, hoping to hold that metropolitan district’s single vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/road-to-270-joe-biden-has-options-donald-trump-walks-narrow-path/story-Bb2qHXHbcv9USzETHYAu1L.html

Environment Minister Murat Kurum said some 100 people had been rescued so far.More than 800 people were injured in Turkey, and the area had been hit by some 470 aftershocks, the country’s disaster agency said. In central Izmir, rescuers were seeking to save a mother and her four children from the remains of a building. Relatives waited outside another collapsed building. One Izmir resident, who didn’t want to be named, said both her parents were still trapped. “I couldn’t get any news. I couldn’t get any news,” the woman told Reuters, when asked about attempts to reach them. Search and rescue operations were complete in eight buildings, while operations continued in nine others, officials said.The leaders of Turkey and Greece - caught up in a bitter dispute over exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean - spoke by phone late on Friday. In a rare show of warmth between the two countries, Turkish and Greek leaders exchanged solidarity messages. “I just called President (Tayyip Erdogan) to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted.Erdogan responded in a tweet:“I offer my condolences to all of Greece on behalf of myself and the Turkish people. Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life.” Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. Cooperation between the two countries after a devastating earthquake in 1999 led to a period of warmer ties between them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rescue-efforts-on-as-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-27-in-izmir-turkey/story-zKZ0Eaqi3iwAM7QFMnmVdK.html
31-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Expect a lot more of the same if Donald Trump wins a second term||Expect to see a lot more of the same if there’s a second Trump administration.President Donald Trump has consistently pointed to tax cuts and regulatory relief as key successes of his first four years in office. He has repeatedly pushed for the end of the Obama-era health law but has yet to deliver a plan to replace it. And he has spent most of this year defending his response to the coronavirus pandemic while fighting openly with scientists and medical experts about vaccines, treatments and more.If he gets another four years in office, there’s no indication of any big policy shift.A glimpse at how a second Trump term might look:___ECONOMY, TAXES AND THE DEBTLow unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump’s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market clawed its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the pandemic began exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.And by Friday, Wall Street had closed out another punishing week with the S&P 500 posting its first back-to-back monthly loss since the pandemic first gripped the economy in March. Much of the market’s focus has been on what’s to come for the economy when coronavirus counts are rising at troubling rates across Europe and the United States.Trump has predicted that the US economy will rebound in late 2020 and take off like a “rocket ship” in 2021. He promises that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics will soon be available, allowing life to get back to normal. His push for a payroll tax cut over the summer was thwarted by stiff bipartisan opposition. But winning a second term — and a mandate from voters — could help him resurrect the idea.An analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump’s plan would increase the debt by about $5 trillion over 10 years. That’s on top of the $13 trillion in deficits the country is already expected to run up during that time.The national debt now stands at more than $20 trillion.___CORONAVIRUS PANDEMICTrump insists that the country is “rounding the corner” on the pandemic and has stepped up calls on Democratic governors to lift coronavirus restrictions in their states. But Trump’s sunny outlook belies the ground truth in many states — including several critical to his path to 270 Electoral College votes — that have seen a surge in the virus.The president has often disputed medical experts in his own administration, among them infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, on key issues surrounding the virus, including the timing of a vaccine, the need for social distancing and the importance of masks to contain the virus. His campaign rallies were filled with people gathered less than 6 feet apart without masks. His announcement of the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court was widely regarded to be a super spreader event after he and several other people in attendance were diagnosed with the virus.Trump spent three days at Walter Reed National Medical Center after his diagnosis. One of the drugs he received, remdesivir, has since been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Covid-19.Trump also says he’s “pretty damn certain” that vaccines and new treatments for the virus are coming in the not-so-distant future. Scientists are more cautious about the timing.Congress passed and Trump signed into law a more than $2 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this year, but the two sides have been unable to agree on an additional aid package.___HEALTH CAREAs a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would “immediately” replace former President Barack Obama’s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide “insurance for everybody” with lower costs. Americans are still waiting for a pan that Trump has been teasing for many months.He may be counting on the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear a case challenging “Obamacare” soon after the election. The court now has a solid conservative majority with the confirmation of Barrett as a justice.Trump officials say the administration has made strides by championing transparency on hospital prices, pursuing a range of actions to curb prescription drug costs and expanding lower-cost health insurance alternatives for small businesses and individuals. But those incremental steps fall far short of the sweeping changes he promised.The number of uninsured people has gone up on Trump’s watch, from 27.6 million people under age 65 in 2017 to 29.2 million last year, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. There are no solid statistics on uninsured Americans this year, after millions lost job-related coverage in the pandemic.On prescription drugs, Trump came into office promising change so Americans would see the lower costs common in other economically advanced countries. But he backed away from a 2016 campaign promise to authorize Medicare to negotiate prices. And a big, bipartisan deal with Congress to reduce costs for Medicare recipients and restrain price increases eluded him.His administration did reach a narrower, yet significant agreement with drug companies and insurers to limit out-of-pocket costs for insulin for seniors to $35 a month. A series of regulations to try to curb drug costs remains a work in progress.___IMMIGRATIONTrump worked through his first term to sharply curtail both legal and illegal immigration. Expect that to continue if he wins a second term.One of his top priorities would be to use agreements with Central American governments as models to get countries around the world to field asylum claims from people seeking refuge in the United States, a top adviser, Stephen Miller, recently told The Associated Press. He said the agreements would help stop “asylum fraud, asylum shopping and asylum abuse on a global scale.”Miller also forecast a broader offensive against so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, saying the administration would use its “full power, resources and authority.” He vowed more efforts toward legal immigration “based on merit.”Trump’s pledge to build a wall along the US border with Mexico was a hallmark of his first presidential campaign and four years in office. Trump is expected to continue to trumpet progress after having completed nearly 400 miles of wall construction, though most of that replaced existing smaller barriers.Trump has yet to outline second-term immigration priorities in detail, though he has openly toyed with trying to repeal a constitutional right to citizenship for anyone born in the United States.His administration has long pursued a zero-tolerance policy to crack down on illegal immigration, and thousands of children were separated from their parents after crossing the border illegally. The administration was roundly criticized for its actions.Administration officials also sought to restrict legal immigration, including higher fees and increased scrutiny for people seeking to legally emigrate to the US. The administration slashed the number of refugees allowed in the country by about three-quarters to its lowest level in decades.Trump has also sought to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program that allowed people brought to the United States illegally as children to remain as legal residents, though his effort was halted, at least temporarily, by the courts.___FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITYTrump’s foreign policy centers on his mantra of “America First,” but in the months leading up to the election, he engaged in diplomacy.The Trump administration scored a big win in recent weeks by nudging three Arab states — Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates — to normalize relations with Israel. Trump officials also brokered an economic cooperation agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, bitter foes in the Balkan wars.He counts as another major achievement his efforts to cajole more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.Trump also pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, saying it was one-sided in favor of Iran. He’s announced that the U.S. is withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty with Russia and the Open Skies Treaty, which permits 30-plus nations to conduct observation flights over each other’s territory. He later said he might reconsider pulling out of that treaty.The president has reduced to about 3,000 the number of troops in Iraq. The US plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to at least 4,500 in November, although Trump wants them all withdrawn by the end of the year. He also counts his engagement with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as a foreign policy victory, yet he’s been unable to prod Kim to give up his nuclear program.___PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTA Trump second term would begin to see a US transformed by the scores of public health and environment rollbacks in Trump’s first term, when the administration weakened protections in landmark pollution laws that had stood for a half-century.Trump’s biggest environmental rollbacks include removing federal protections for millions of miles of wetlands and waterways. That means mining companies and other industries will be freer to dump waste into the fragile habitats or destroy them outright, removing buffers against storms and flooding and making it harder for cities downstream to clean public water supplies, environmental groups say.Another major rollback means neighborhoods nationwide will find themselves having less say about highways or other big projects tearing through their communities. Other rollbacks enacted in Trump’s first term — in regulations ranging from endangered species to oil and gas and mining in federal wilderness to power plant pollution to water-thrifty dishwashers — will take effect.On climate change, Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris global climate accord would become official Nov. 4, the day after the presidential election. Trump is still fighting California and other Western states over his plans to ease future vehicle mileage standards, undoing another legacy climate effort of the Obama administration.A Supreme Court made more conservative by Trump’s appointments will decide pending court challenges by states and environmental groups to many of the rollbacks.The Trump administration says it wants to focus on helping minority communities that are disproportionately harmed by polluting industries in a second term. Environmental groups point to the administration’s efforts to slash funding for such programs, and call it an empty election-year promise.___EDUCATIONTrump believes that a key to economic recovery from the virus is fully reopening schools, though Americans are wary. Only about 1 in 10 think day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.He is calling for the expansion of charter schools and school choice programs, including a proposed tax credit for people who contribute to scholarships sending students to private schools and other education options. Under his watch, the federal government has also increased funding for historically Black colleges and universities — an effort he often cites as one of the things he has achieved for Black Americans.Trump frequently rails against what he has described as “radical left indoctrination” in schools. He is pledging to create a commission to promote “patriotic education” in schools. Amid complaints that conservative voices are stifled on college campuses, he also sought to cut federal funding to colleges that do not protect speech rights.Trump’s administration has revoked several Obama-era initiatives, including guidance intended to curb racial disparities in school discipline and a rule that sought to cut federal funding to for-profit colleges that left students with heavy debt.The Education Department under Trump has also created rules telling schools and universities how to respond to sexual misconduct, with more protection for the accused.___ABORTIONBefore becoming a presidential candidate, Trump described himself as a strong abortion-rights proponent. But after coming to Washington, he pushed for overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that 47 years ago established a constitutional right to abortion.Anti-abortion groups hope the addition of Barrett to the Supreme Court will provide a majority to overturn Roe. Barrett has declined to characterize Roe as a “super-precedent” that must not be overturned, although she says that she sets her personal views aside when weighing cases.Trump also has barred federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions. He supports the Hyde Amendment, a series of federal laws that ban the use of taxpayer money to pay for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the woman’ s life.___SOCIAL SECURITYEven before the coronavirus shutdown sent the economy on a roller coaster ride, government experts estimated that Social Security would be unable to pay full benefits starting in 2035. The program’s insolvency date is now likely closer than that, because layoffs have cut into Social Security tax collections from workers and employers.Trump kept his promise not to cut Social Security benefits, but this summer he sent confusing signals with a plan to temporarily suspend collection of certain taxes that fund the program. While the White House staff said it was a limited measure that would have no lasting impact, Trump kept hinting to reporters that he had much bigger tax cuts in mind. Early in the year, he told an interviewer he wanted to tackle “entitlements,” or benefit programs, in a second term.___GUNSTrump has flirted at times with tighter gun laws. After the Parkland school shooting in Florida two years ago, Trump chided Republican lawmakers for being too “scared” of the National Rifle Association to tighten gun laws. And after back-to-back mass shootings in Ohio and Texas in 2019, he embraced calls for “strong background checks.” He backpedaled quickly in each instance.In the campaign, the president has repeatedly promised to “defend our Second Amendment.” The NRA’s political action committee has endorsed Trump.___VETERANSTrump frequently touts an expanded program at the Department of Veterans Affairs passed by Congress in 2018 that allows veterans to choose a private physician outside of the government-run VA system and still receive taxpayer-paid medical care.The program, first passed as a temporary measure during the Obama administration, was spurred by a 2014 scandal in which veterans died while waiting months for appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center. Trump supports giving veterans wide access to private-sector care if they are dissatisfied with VA treatment, and he has suggested he may issue additional regulations in a second term that will make it even easier.Trump has boosted telehealth services at the VA and broadly promises an improved U.S. economy in a second term that will reduce veterans’ unemployment. He created a federal task force last year to address veterans suicide. In October, he signed into law a bipartisan bill that creates a new three-digit 988 phone line — similar to 911 — that will be reserved for mental health emergencies. It becomes active in fall 2021.About 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration.___TRADETrump views the signing of two major trade deals — an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and the first phase of a China agreement — as signature achievements. The US and China signed in January, less than two months before the pandemic put an enormous strain on US-China relations. Trump says the first phase would lead to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in US agricultural products, energy and other American products.In return, the US canceled or reduced tariffs on an array of China imports. So far, China is significantly behind in meeting its purchasing commitments, according to tracking from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The second phase of the deal is expected to focus on tougher issues between the countries, including Trump’s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the “China virus,” it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he’s “not interested” in talking to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-expect-a-lot-more-of-the-same-if-donald-trump-wins-a-second-term/story-nALsj2wvue7kOL8Ia9gZyH.html
31-10-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson considering a new national lockdown for England||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering imposing a new month-long national lockdown in England next week after scientists warned the coronavirus was spreading faster than their worst predictions, local media reported.The pandemic is spreading in most parts of Britain, where the official death toll of 46,299 is the highest in Europe.Johnson is expected to hold a news conference on Monday to announce the new measures, which would allow only essential shops and schools, nurseries, and universities to remain open, The Times reported.The new measures were still under discussion, and no final decision had been made, the paper said, citing a senior government source.The Prime Minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.Currently, the government has a three-tier system of restrictions for local areas in England, with Level 3 the highest. Scotland, Wales and North Ireland run their own policies on fighting the pandemic.A member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warned on Saturday that the virus was “running riot” across all age groups.“For the naysayers that don’t believe in a second wave, there is a second wave,” Calum Semple, a professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told the BBC.“And unlike the first wave, where we had a national lockdown which protected huge swathes of society, this outbreak is now running riot across all age groups.”A new lockdown would heap fresh pressure on finance minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England(BoE) to increase their already huge support for the UK economy, the world’s sixth biggest. The economy slumped a record 20% in the spring and has been struggling to maintain its recovery.In the current system, Tier 3 includes a ban on mixing of people in different households, pubs and bars are closed, wedding receptions are not permitted, and travel to or from the area should be avoided.The Government is also considering tougher regional measures, known as Tier 4, but ministers are said to be in favour of a nationwide policy, The Times said.The BoE is widely expected to increase its bond-buying programme on Thursday for the third time since the pandemic struck in March. Economists polled by Reuters mostly predicted a 100 billion-pound top-up. Some analysts have said the regional restrictions on businesses imposed in recent weeks will cause the economy to contract again in the fourth quarter and a national lockdown would inflict greater damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-considering-a-new-national-lockdown-for-england/story-CFD7qfhYBn6kWmzlepfbfI.html
31-10-2020||World||Death toll reaches 27 in earthquake that hit Turkey, Greek island||Rescue teams on Saturday plowed through concrete blocks and the debris of eight collapsed buildings in search of survivors of a powerful earthquake that struck Turkey’s Aegean coast and north of the Greek island of Samos, killing at least 27 people. More than 800 others were injured.The quake hit Friday afternoon, toppling buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third largest city, and triggering a small tsunami in the district of Seferihisar and on Samos. The quake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks.Early on Saturday, onlookers cheered as rescuers lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment block in Izmir’s Bayrakli district. Her dog, Fistik, was also rescued, Sozcu newspaper reported. Friends and relatives waited outside the building for news of loved ones still trapped inside, including employees of a dentist’s surgery that was located on the ground floor.In another collapsed building, rescuers made contact with a 38-year-old woman and her four children — aged 3, 7 and 10-year old twins — and were working to clear a corridor to bring them out, state-run Anadolu Agency reported.Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were brought out from the rubble of another toppled two-story building earlier on Saturday.In all, around 100 people have been rescued since the earthquake, Murat Kurum, the environment and urban planning minister, told reporters.Some 5,000 rescue personnel were working on the ground, Kurum said.At least 25 people were killed in Izmir, including an elderly woman who drowned, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD.Two teenagers were killed on Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured on the island, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalized on the island, health authorities said.The small tsunami that hit the Turkish coast also affected Samos, with seawater flooding streets in the main harbour town of Vathi. Authorities warned people to stay away from the coast and from potentially damaged buildings.The earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centred in the Aegean northeast of Samos. AFAD said it measured 6.6. and hit at a depth of some 16 kilometers (10 miles).It was felt across the eastern Greek islands and as far as Athens and in Bulgaria. In Turkey, it shook the regions of Aegean and Marmara, including Istanbul. Istanbul’s governor said there were no reports of damage in the city, Turkey’s largest.Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 87,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece too.Authorities warned residents in Izmir not to return to damaged buildings, saying they could collapse in strong aftershocks. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage, the DHA news agency reported.More than 3,000 rescue personnel were sent to Izmir, as well as relief supplies. The Turkish Red Crescent set up kitchens.In a show of solidarity rare in recent months of tense bilateral relations, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity while the presidents of Greece and Turkey held a telephone conversation.Relations between Turkey and Greece have been particularly tense, with warships from both facing off in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over maritime boundaries and energy exploration rights. The ongoing tension has led to fears of open conflict between the two neighbours and NATO allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-reaches-27-in-earthquake-that-hit-turkey-greek-island/story-7SLMyfV4EC7HFFEsSemUZM.html
31-10-2020||World||New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern secures Green Party’s support for new government||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has secured the backing of the Green Party for her next term of government.Ardern announced Saturday that her Labour Party entered a cooperation agreement with the Greens that gives the smaller party two ministerial posts outside cabinet in return for its support on matters of confidence and supply in parliament. Ardern will announce her new cabinet on Monday, with ministers to be formally sworn in on November 6.Ardern won an outright majority in the October 17 election, the first since New Zealand introduced proportional representation in 1996, and doesn’t need the Greens to govern. But the Greens supported her first administration and it is in her interests to maintain a good relationship with a party she may have to rely on again in the future.“This cooperation agreement reflects the positive working relationship between our two parties and our areas of shared interest, while respecting the mandate voters gave Labour to form a government,” Ardern said in a statement. “It will deliver stability and cooperation in key policy areas while allowing the Greens to take an independent position from the government on all other matters.”Green Party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson have been made ministers outside cabinet, with Shaw retaining his climate change portfolio, and Davidson to be appointed to the new position of minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence. She will also take on the role of associate minister of housing.Ardern said the agreement strengthens the government’s stability and will ensure a strong majority in parliament on the most important votes.“As we accelerate our recovery from Covid, strong stable government is essential to New Zealand,” she said. “Between this agreement and our existing parliamentary majority we won’t be held back from getting on with the work needed to rebuild our economy and continue to keep New Zealand safe from Covid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-secures-green-party-s-support-for-new-government/story-LUWNbVMqveF0dlmG4xBz9L.html
31-10-2020||World||Typhoon Goni to hit Philippines early Sunday after gaining strength||Typhoon Goni is expected to hit the Philippines earlier than expected on Sunday as it continues to gather strength, according to the Philippine Tropical Cyclone Advisories website.The storm may be upgraded to a super typhoon in the next 12 hours and could make landfall in the eastern provinces of Catanduanes and Camarines early Sunday, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said in its 8 a.m. advisory. The typhoon was earlier predicted to reach the Philippines in the afternoon.Goni’s winds are forecast to hit 185 to 215 kilometers (115 to 134 miles) an hour as it moves inland. The cyclone comes days after Typhoon Molave lashed the country, leaving at least 22 dead and causing a minimum of 1.81 billion pesos ($37.4 million) of damage to crops.The Philippine weather bureau as of 2 p.m. placed Catanduanes province and parts of Camarines and Albay provinces under typhoon signal No. 3. Winds greater than 121 kilometers and up to 170 kilometers per hour are expected to hit these areas starting in at least 18 hours, it said.Beginning early Sunday, Goni will bring heavy-to-intense rains over the central and southern provinces of Luzon island, including Manila, the state weather bureau said. The center of the storm was 410 kilometers east-northeast of Catanduanes as of 1 p.m. local time, with maximum sustained winds of 215 kilometers an hour near the center and gusts of up to 265 kilometers per hour, it said. The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center categorizes Goni as a super typhoon while at sea, according to its measurements. The storm will pass through Manila and most of the main island of Luzon, it said.About 159,000 people in Camarines Norte began evacuating from high-risk areas on Friday, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported, citing provincial authorities. Quezon, a neighboring province, has been placed under red alert, it said.Another typhoon, Atsani, is forecast to enter Philippine territory Sunday but is less likely to bring severe weather over the next three days, according to the nation’s weather forecaster.Goni is the world’s strongest typhoon this year with sustained winds of 285 kilometers per hour as of Friday, putting it at Category 5-equivalent strength and surpassing Hurricane Laura, which was Category 4 at its peak, the Weather Network reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-goni-to-hit-philippines-early-sunday-after-gaining-strength/story-s6bZJaX5HsFbKvzfMNaT7J.html
31-10-2020||World||Armenia PM asks Putin to start talks on providing security amid Karabakh war||Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Saturday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin “urgent” consultations on providing security amid a conflict with Azerbaijan after fresh talks failed to agree a ceasefire.Pasninyan sent the letter to Putin after Armenia and Azerbaijan failed to agree a fresh ceasefire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict during talks in Geneva on Friday and as fighting continued overnight and Saturday morning.The announcement, released by the Armenian foreign ministry, raised fears of an escalation in fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Some observers are concerned it risks sucking Yerevan’s ally Russia and Turkey, which backs Baku, into the conflict.Armenia and Azerbaijan have been engaged in fierce fighting for more than a month over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan controlled by Armenian separatists in the wake of the break-up of the Soviet Union.The flare-up of the conflict has left more than a thousand dead, with world powers so far unable to persuade either side to stop fighting. Russia has a military base in Armenia and has a defence treaty with Yerevan.“The prime minister of Armenia has asked the Russian president to begin urgent consultations with the aim of determining the kind and amount of aid which the Russian Federation can provide Armenia to ensure its security,” the foreign ministry in Yerevan said in a statement. Russia has previously said that its defence pact with Armenia does not extend to the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh.But Pashinyan in his letter to Putin said that hostilities were getting closer to Armenia’s borders and reiterated that Azerbaijan’s ally Turkey was backing Baku, according to the statement.He requested Moscow’s help, invoking the two countries’ close ties and a 1997 treaty on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance.Armenian officials did not provide further details when reached by AFP.“One step closer to a wider war?,” tweeted Carey Cavanaugh, a former US ambassador and co-chair of the OSCE Minsk group.Armenian political analyst Hakob Badalyan told AFP that he did not rule out that Pashinyan’s plea for help was “for now a political step to stress Russia’s role in this region”.Hikmet Hajiyev, an aide to the Azerbaijani president, told AFP Baku would not comment.On Friday, mediators from France, Russia and the US said in a statement from Geneva that the warring sides had committed to “not deliberately target civilian populations or non-military objects in accordance with international humanitarian law”.But the defence ministry of the Karabakh separatist leadership on Saturday accused Azerbaijan of violating the Geneva agreements and targeting the main city Stepanakert and the strategically important town of Shusha.The ministry said there were “wounded among civilians” in Shusha. Baku denied targeting the Karabakh main city.Azerbaijan and Armenia have been locked in a bitter conflict over Karabakh since Armenian separatists backed by Yerevan seized control of the mountainous province in a 1990s war that left 30,000 people dead.The current clashes broke out on September 27 and fighting has persisted despite the repeated international attempts to secure a ceasefire.The warring sides have three times agreed to ceasefires during recent talks mediated by Russia, France and the United States but the truces have all quickly fallen apart.More than 1,200 people from both sides have been reported dead since the fighting began, but the actual death toll is believed to be substantially higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-pm-asks-putin-to-start-talks-on-providing-security-amid-karabakh-war/story-0gQJCnhMVPjyj3aUHt8FEM.html
31-10-2020||World||Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai distances his newspaper Apple Daily from Biden report||Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai distanced himself and his newspaper, Apple Daily, from the funding of a report by a non-existent author to discredit US presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying his assistant had worked on the project.NBC reported on Friday that a 64-page document making claims involving Joe Biden’s son and business deals in China was produced by a “fake intelligence firm” called Typhoon Investigations.The author of the document is listed as Swiss security analyst Martin Aspen, which NBC said is a fabricated identity. Blogger and academic Christopher Balding took credit for contributing to the report and said it was commissioned by Apple Daily, according to the broadcaster.Lai said in a tweet on Friday evening that he had nothing to do with the document but that his assistant, Mark Simon, had been involved with it.“I’m sorry that Apple Daily was implicated by the NBC article. But Apple Daily has nothing to with it, I’ve nothing to do with it,” the Next Digital Ltd. founder said in the tweet. “My assistant Mark Simon now informed us that he worked with the project, although had not commissioned it.”NBC said an Apple Daily spokesperson had informed it that the newspaper had worked with Balding on the document. The Hong Kong-based media company issued a statement Friday saying it had never commissioned Balding or any anyone else to write the document.Simon used funds from Lai’s private company for the research, Lai said in a separate tweet. “It’s only US$10,000 so he didn’t have to have my approval,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-mogul-jimmy-lai-distances-his-newspaper-apple-daily-from-biden-report/story-yl9m48wBu8jPAakTXhej9O.html

Although she no longer needs support to govern, coalitions are the norm in New Zealand as parties look to build consensus.Under the agreement offered to the Green Party - one of Ardern government’s coalition partners prior to the election - the two portfolios would be held by the Green Party’s co-leaders.James Shaw would be minister for climate change and would be associate environment minister, while Marama Davidson would become the minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence.“On election night I said I wanted to govern for all New Zealanders and to reach as wide consensus on key issues as possible,” Ardern said at a televised news conference. “This agreement does that.”In return, Ardern said, the Greens would not oppose the government on confidence and supply votes. They would also support Labour on procedural motions in the parliament.The Green Party would be able to take their own position on issues not covered by the ministerial portfolios and areas of co-operation.The cooperation deal could still be rejected by the Green Party membership who were to vote on it on Saturday, but Ardern said she would announce the composition of the government on Monday regardless of the Green Party’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-to-announce-government-on-november-2/story-kwkX10K5ifnf5slSQGii9O.html
31-10-2020||World||Indian immigrants set new record for permanent residencies in Canada||Indian immigrants accounted for one-fourth of the total permanent residencies granted by Canada in 2019, setting a new record. India was easily the largest source country for permanent residents (PR), with 85,593 admitted last year, a number that is larger than the total for the next four nations taken together. The data was revealed as the 2020 Annual Report on Immigration to Parliament was tabled.India has been the biggest source country since 2017, when it overtook China among PRs, but the numbers have jumped in recent years, with an increase of over 20% between 2018 and 2019.Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship Marco Mendicino also tabled the 2021‒2023 Immigration Levels Plan. The Canadian government is hiking the number of immigrants to be taken into the country between these years to make up for the projected shortfall this year due to the travel and other restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.While the previous plan set targets of 351,000 PRs for 2021 and 361,000 for 2022, these have been increased to 401,000 and 411,000. The figure for 2023 is even higher at 421,000. The majority of the admissions, 60%, will be in the economic class, which has been dominated by Indians in recent years.“Immigration is essential to getting us through the pandemic, but also to our short-term economic recovery and our long-term economic growth. Canadians have seen how newcomers are playing an outsized role in our hospitals and care homes, and helping us to keep food on the table. As we look to recovery, newcomers create jobs not just by giving our businesses the skills they need to thrive, but also by starting businesses themselves. Our plan will help to address some of our most acute labour shortages and to grow our population to keep Canada competitive on the world stage,” Mendicino said in a statement.According to a statement from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Canada’s population growth between 2018 and 2019 was at 1.4%, the highest among G7 nations and this was “overwhelmingly driven” by the “arrival of immigrants and non-permanent residents” who accounted for 82% of the rise.It also noted that by the early 2030s, Canada’s population growth will rely entirely upon immigration and with many of its major source countries for immigrants facing similar challenges of lower fertility rates and an aging demographic, “Canada must be prepared to compete internationally for young, skilled and mobile workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-immigrants-set-new-record-for-permanent-residencies-in-canada/story-hBJOtM4RA1mTQ6m4EV6BsL.html

Canada recorded its highest single-day increase in cases of coronavirus infection on Friday at 3,457, an increase of over 20% over a fortnight.“If we increase, or if even maintain our current rate of contact, the epidemic in Canada is forecast to continue increasing steeply,” the country’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said, during the course of a media briefing on the situation.To “bend the epidemic curve” and “reduce transmission to lower levels”, it was necessary to reduce the “number of contacts as much as possible,” she said.She also released new modelling projections which indicated that at current levels of the infection rate, Canada could record approximately 262,000 cases by November 8, up from 231,753 currently, with another 300 fatalities. The death toll from the crisis in Canada is at 10,100 at present.Several provinces in the country, including Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have witnessed steep rises in cases over recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-asks-people-to-cut-social-contact-amid-spike-in-covid-cases/story-7CZVX0gnOVFcqpmHt26JdK.html

And he was not happy about it. “Your far-left Democrat attorney general, Keith Ellison, and your Democrat governor (Tim Walz) tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom of assembly,” Trump said to supporters. “They thought we would cancel—but I will never abandon Minnesota!”Trump lost Minnesota in the last election, but so narrowly that he has been tempted to seek a win there to offset vulnerabilities and potential reverses in his 2016 pathway to victory.But just four days from the close of polling on Tuesday, Trump is trailing Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, in the state by a wide margin of 8.1 percentage points at this time, in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 4.7 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. The American president is behind Biden countrywide, in fact: by 8.9 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 7.9 points in the aggregated average of RealClearPolitics, which also has the former vice-president in the lead by 3.2 points in the top battleground states — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Biden was in Minnesota earlier in the day at a drive-in rally, which he has preferred to Trump’s old-style rallies, with mask-less supporters packed in shoulder-to-shoulder.“And did you hear what he said again today?” Biden said, referring to remarks by the president earlier at another rally. “He said that our doctors who are putting their lives on the line busting their necks, are making up deaths from Covid because they “get more money”.”“Doctors and nurses go to work every day to save lives — they do their jobs.”The American president had alleged at an earlier rally that doctors were getting paid more to attribute deaths to Covid-19 as opposed to other causes as the reason for the high toll in the US, seeking to shift the blame for it at the same time from his administration’s shoddy handling of the crisis to medical professionals battling the deadly virus. Biden and Trump addressed rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin, the other battleground states, seeking the support of voters there as they presented their closing arguments in what has been a tumultuous campaign under the shadow of a devastating pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans and infected 8 million, including the president, his wife Melania Trump and their son Barron Trump.Trump and Biden will be crisscrossing battleground states over the remaining four days, with more than 87 million Americans having voted already in person or by mail in what is proving to be an unprecedented turnout in early voting allowed in the wake of Covid-19.On Saturday, Biden will address a rally in Michigan along with his former boss and most popular surrogate, former president Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-addresses-smallest-rally-biden-hits-him-for-blaming-doctors-for-covid-toll/story-BB1OsYiY4oRHp3VSK3LriO.html
31-10-2020||World||‘Remarks on French attacks taken out of context’: Mahathir Mohamad||Former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad stood by his widely condemned comments on attacks by Muslim extremists in France, saying Friday that they were taken out of context and criticising Twitter and Facebook for removing his posts.Mahathir, 95, sparked widespread outrage when he wrote on his blog Thursday that “Muslims have a right to be angry and kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past.” Twitter removed a tweet from Mahathir containing the remark, which it said glorified violence, and France’s digital minister demanded the company also ban Mahathir from its platform.“I am indeed disgusted with attempts to misrepresent and take out of context what I wrote on my blog,” Mahathir said in a statement. He said critics failed to read his posting in full, especially the next sentence which read: “But by and large Muslims have not applied the ‘eye for an eye’ law. Muslims don’t. The French shouldn’t. Instead the French should teach their people to respect other people’s feelings.” He said Twitter and Facebook removed the posting despite his explanation, and slammed the move as hypocritical.“On the one hand, they defended those who chose to display offending caricatures of Prophet Muhammad ... and expect all Muslims to swallow it in the name of freedom of speech and expression,” he said.“On the other, they deleted deliberately that Muslims had never sought revenge for the injustice against them in the past,” thereby stirring French hatred for Muslims, he added. On Twitter, however, that sentence was not deleted. A Mahathir staff member said the entire posting was removed by Facebook. Facebook Malaysia said in an email that it removed Mahathir’s posting for violating its policies. “We do not allow hate speech on Facebook and strongly condemn any support for violence, death or physical harm,” it said.The comments by Mahathir, a two-time prime minister, were in response to calls by Muslim nations to boycott French products after French leader Emmanuel Macron described Islam as a religion “in crisis” and vowed to crack down on radicalism following the murder of a French teacher who showed his class a cartoon depicting Prophet Muhammad. His remarks also came as a Tunisian man killed three people at a church in Nice, France.The US ambassador to Malaysia, Kamala Shirin Lakhdir, said Friday that she “strongly disagreed” with Mahathir’s statement. “Freedom of expression is a right, calling for violence is not,” she said in a brief statement. Australian High Commissioner in Malaysia Andrew Goledzinowski wrote that even though Mahathir wasn’t advocating actual violence, “in the current climate, words can have consequences.” Mahathir’s second stint as prime minister lasted from 2018 until he quit in February 2020.He has been viewed as an advocate of moderate Islamic views and a spokesman for the interests of developing countries. At the same time, he pointedly criticised Western society and nations and their relationships to the Muslim world while he himself was denounced in Israel and elsewhere for making anti-Semitic remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remarks-on-french-attacks-taken-out-of-context-mahathir-mohamad/story-v8NBu7WWpJ4DjV17V9RuvL.html
31-10-2020||World||Philippines orders evacuation as world’s strongest typhoon approaches||Philippine officials on Saturday ordered evacuation of thousands of residents in the southern part of the main Luzon island as a category 5 storm that is the world’s strongest this year approaches the Southeast Asian nation.Typhoon Goni, with 215 kph (133 miles) sustained winds and gusts of up to 265 kph (164 mph), will make landfall on Sunday as the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines since Haiyan that killed more than 6,300 people in November 2013.Pre-emptive evacuations have started in coastal and landslide-prone communities in the provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, while Albay provincial government would order residents in risky areas to leave their homes, Gremil Naz, a local disaster official, told DZBB radio station. “The strength of this typhoon is no joke.”Typhoon Molave last week killed 22 people, mostly through drowning in provinces south of the capital Manila, which is also in the projected path of Goni, the 18th tropical storm in the country.Authorities are facing another hurdle as social distancing needs to be imposed in evacuation centres to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Philippines has the second highest Covid-19 infections and deaths in Southeast Asia, next only to Indonesia.Relief goods, heavy machinery and personal protective equipment are already positioned in key areas, Filipino Grace America, mayor of Infanta town in Quezon province, told DZBB radio. “But because of the Covid-19 pandemic, our funds for calamity concerns and expenses are insufficient.”Local officials cancelled port operations and barred fishers from setting sail.Typhoon Goni, moving westward at 20 kph (12 mph) from the Pacific Ocean, will bring intense rains over the capital and 14 provinces nearby on Saturday evening, and threats of floods and landslides.Another typhoon, Atsani, is gaining strength just outside the Philippines. Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-orders-evacuation-as-world-s-strongest-typhoon-approaches/story-QmaISB4S4Ruc4QIeifB8zO.html

The peak of the first wave in March was 1,050.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who has said hospitals would be stretched beyond capacity at around 6,000 daily infections, will announce new restrictions on Saturday afternoon. He has said an economically damaging second lockdown would be a last resort, but Austrian media reported tough measures in the works.Also Read| Britain may impose new national Covid-19 lockdown from Wednesday: Report“The dramatically rising infection numbers in Austria and many European countries will require restrictions on public life and also affect the domestic economy,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement, adding that it was working on additional economic aid measures to save jobs and keep companies afloat.Austria’s current anti-coronavirus measures are relatively loose - bars, restaurants and theatres remain open. Several Austrian media reported on Friday evening that a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. was planned, albeit with exceptions allowed for those going to work or simply exercising outdoors.Restaurants would no longer be allowed to serve guests but could provide take-away service outside curfew hours, theatres and cinemas would have to close and hotels could only accept new guests travelling for work or training, national broadcaster ORF said, citing a draft of the planned government decree.Several other media also said they had obtained the draft text and published extracts, saying it was due to expire at the end of November, but it was not clear when exactly it was intended to go into force.Influential tabloid Kronen Zeitung said ski lifts would only be open to top athletes and in exceptional cases such as rescues.Shops and schools would, however, remain open, several media reported, with shops having to limit the number of customers allowed in at one time to one person per 10 square metres of floorspace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-s-covid-19-cases-rise-as-nation-awaits-new-restrictions/story-2BKMneyYgHrLqmhOgUJ53K.html

Lockdowns, aggressive testing, timely provision of drugs or medicines are some of the ways in which governments are trying to avoid the recurrence of another spread of the viral disease, which has infected nearly 46 million people and killed 1,193,744.Another crucial factor that governments are taking into consideration to successfully combat Covid-19 is the development of a vaccine. Several companies and organisations, either independently or in collaboration with government authorities, have come up with vaccines which are undergoing a testing and approval process. They are yet to complete the several stages of trials. China, which has been the origin of Covid-19 and has been criticised by many for not revealing the spread of the disease on time, has also stepped up its vaccine research and production.Here are the latest developments of the Covid-19 vaccine:1. American medical device company Johnson & Johnson has planned to start its experimental vaccine in children falling under the age group of 12-18. The company in a statement said that it is currently in discussions with regulators and partners regarding the inclusion of the paediatric population in its vaccine trials. It also plans to include even younger children in its trials afterwards.2. Another American company in the vaccine race, Novavax Inc, has outlined specific diversity targets for its large-scale vaccine study which is expected to start next month in the United States and Mexico. The company at a meeting of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it plans to include 10% to 20% Latinos, 15% Black or African Americans and 2% Native Americans in its study.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know today3. In India, the Union health ministry has urged states and union territories (UTs) to set up committees in order to monitor and coordinate vaccination at ground level while ensuring that there are minute interruptions in other health care services. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to states and Union territories said the committees will coordinate cold chain augmentation, capacity building activities of vaccinators and field staff if required.4. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is likely to submit a proposal to its ethics committee in order to start the Phase 3 trial Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate in Delhi. Last week, Bharat Biotech got an approval from the drugs controller general of India (DGCI) to conduct phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine candidate named Covaxin and AIIMS Delhi is one of the sites which has been selected for carrying out trials across India.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic5.

With infections hitting record levels in some countries, many are now resorting to severe restrictions again.Also Read: US may need France-like lockdown to beat Covid-19In France, concerns were growing that rising infections would swamp the country’s health system, so authorities ordered another four-week lockdown beginning Friday. Many areas of the French capital resembled a regular lazy weekend morning — on what would normally have been a bustling weekday. Those who were out frequently clutched permission forms proving they had an exemption that allowed them to to be on streets.The only places that were busy were grocery stores and markets as people stockpiled food and other necessities.All of France’s 67 million people have been ordered to stay at home at all times with no visitors, or risk steep fines or prosecution. There are a handful of exceptions, such as being allowed out for one hour of exercise a day within a half-mile (1 kilometer) of home, to go to medical appointments, to a place of work, or to shop for essential goods. Restaurants and cafés are shuttered, apart from those that offer takeout.“Going to friends’ houses, having friends over and moving around for anything other than the reasons set out” will be impossible, Prime Minister Jean Castex explained firmly on Thursday.That will hit hard for many.“It’s not nice because I left my country to enjoy the experience of living in another country,” said Laura Beimberg, 28, an intern at cosmetics giant L’Oreal who is from Mexico. “And this experience of being between four walls, far away from family and friends is so hard.”French President Emmanuel Macron implemented the lockdown as a last resort to curb the steep spike in infections across the country, where new daily cases are currently averaging around 50,000. That means that, on a per capita basis, France is seeing about two and a half times the number of new cases each day that the United States is.But France is not alone. Many of its European neighbors are experiencing rising infections, some even beyond what they saw in the spring. In Belgium, the average number of daily cases is around 150 per 100,000 people, compared to France’s approximately 62.The government in Belgium is meeting Friday to consider even tougher restrictions on movement that would amount to a quasi-lockdown. Germany, which is also seeing an increase in cases though on a much less dramatic scale, agreed this week to a monthlong shutdown of restaurants, bars, theaters and other leisure facilities, dubbed “lockdown light.”Such measures have taken a brutal toll on economies around Europe, and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire gave grim predictions during an interview on France-Inter, raising his estimate for the depth of the recession. He forecasted an 11% fall in GDP this year.Also Read: Covid-19: French Prez Emmanuel Macron announces new lockdown rules amid surge in casesFrench residents could perhaps be forgiven for thinking it was groundhog day, just a few months after they emerged from one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.Some were accepting of the reality.“We just have to live with it. You have resign yourself to it,” said Yoann Boullé, 28, a sanguine evening manager at a Parisian brasserie.But many Parisians, who had had enough last time around, didn’t wait to be confined to their typically cramped apartments for four weeks.Carlo Ponti, a 54-year-old interior decorator, was among those who fled Paris, but he did it by train. He called the departure of the Parisians a “historic exodus.”He left Friday morning with his husband after finding all trains were booked Thursday night.“The minute the French president gave his speech (announcing a lockdown), the entire national train website went down, was overloaded. Everyone wanted to book to get away,” Ponti said.He plans to stay in his second home in the French region of Burgundy until over Christmas.“During lockdown, the quality of life in the capital is terrible and so everyone who can do, tries to get away,” he said.Highways around the capital descended into scenes of traffic chaos during the night as residents fled the capital. French media reported that the logjams were more than double the usual in the region around Paris, reaching near record levels as many headed for country or family homes with more space.The traffic was worsened by the fact that many were also leaving for the Nov. 1 All Saints’ Day holiday.Macron said that authorities would be “tolerant” about families returning from the holiday on Monday, but otherwise interregional travel is strictly prohibited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/700-km-traffic-jams-in-paris-as-residents-flee-ahead-of-2nd-covid-19-lockdown/story-bEy5Ldbywp8bhbnnRyhOcJ.html

Minnesota law requires that mail-in ballots be received by Election Day. But that deadline was extended through a settlement Simon reached with a citizens group that sued earlier this year.Under that settlement, which was approved by a judge, state election officials could count ballots received until November 10 as long as they are postmarked by November 3. Two Minnesota Republicans, James Carson and Eric Lucero, challenged the settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-opts-against-asking-supreme-court-to-block-mail-in-ballots-ruling/story-Iq643TAGIVwv4fnrmgVkTJ.html
31-10-2020||World||Georgia governor tests negative for Covid-19 after exposure||Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tested negative for Covid-19 after having had “direct exposure” to someone who tested positive, but he is quarantining as a precaution, according to a statement posted to his official Twitter account Friday.The statement said first lady Marty Kemp also tested negative and is “not known to have been exposed to a confirmed case.” It was unclear whether she was quarantining with her husband. An earlier statement from the governor’s spokesman Cody Hall said she was.In a separate announcement Friday, U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson of West Point, Georgia, said he had tested positive for the virus.Both Kemp and Ferguson attended a Thursday night campaign event inside a barbecue restaurant in Hogansville, Georgia, with between 100-150 people in attendance, according to the LaGrange Daily News.Hogansville Mayor Bill Stankiewicz, who attended the event, said, “It was close quarters and Drew (Ferguson) did not have a mask on ... for much of the evening,” the newspaper reported.CDC guidelines state that anyone “who has had close contact with someone with Covid-19 should stay home for 14 days after their last exposure to that person.” People can test positive several days after exposure even if initial tests come back negative.It was not clear if Ferguson is the person Kemp’s statement was referring to. Hall did not respond to a phone call and text from The Associated Press seeking clarity.Ferguson said he would self-quarantine and work from home.Georgia has had nearly 360,000 confirmed cases of the virus. More than 7,950 people in the state have died after contracting the virus, according to data from the state Department of Public Health.Kemp has shied away from mandating restrictions to control the virus. He was among the earliest to allow businesses to reopen and has eschewed a statewide mask mandate, including during the summer, when Georgia recorded the highest per-capita number of new infections nationwide.Kemp did ban gatherings of more than 50 people when they can’t stay more than 6 feet (1.83 meters) apart, but the governor has repeatedly violated that order in recent weeks at political rallies, including the one with Ferguson.News of Kemp’s potential exposure comes three weeks into a new round of rising virus cases in Georgia. The daily average of newly reported Covid-19 infections was up 40% through Thursday from the most recent low on Oct. 8, according to figures kept by The Associated Press. Hospitalizations, which usually trail new infections, have been rising since Oct 12.Neither new daily reported infections nor the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 is yet approaching the peaks of late July. But state public health officials agree the trend is real and worrying. Kemp has spoken little about the respiratory illness since he held a news conference on Oct. 7 touting “great progress” as cases were reaching a low point.Kemp on Friday signed a 15-day extension of the social distancing order and other rules regarding the operations of businesses and nonprofit groups.

As many as 196 aftershocks were felt with 23 hitting over magnitude 4.0, news agency ANI said quoting Turkish media. According to the US Geological Survey, the major earthquake hit 14 kilometres (nine miles) off the Greek town of Karlovasi on Samos. Search and rescue operations are underway at Turkey’s Aegean resort city of Izmir, which suffered much of the damage.Here are the latest updates on the earthquakes:1. Turkey’s western Izmir province and Greek islands in the vicinity were rattled after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 caused massive loss of life and property.2. As a result of the earthquake, a small tsunami struck the Seferihisar district south of Izmir province, causing floods in the area.3. One person died of drowning, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency. 4. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the global body was “closely following” the situation in Greece and Turkey after the earthquake. “We will work with the two countries to ensure that emergency medical care is provided for those in need. Our thoughts are with all those affected,” he said.5. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to offer his condolences and support. They also tweeted their support to each following the tragedy. “Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,” Mitsotakis said on Twitter. “Thank you, Mr Prime Minister,” Erdogan tweeted in reply. “That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life.”6. The United States hailed both leaders’ gestures of diplomacy. “It’s great to see both countries putting their differences aside to help each other during a time of need. The United States also stands ready to assist,” said Robert O’Brien, the national security advisor.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-0-magnitude-earthquake-with-over-100-aftershocks-kills-22-in-turkey-greece-latest-updates/story-LJTLAvG9ZAEL0UaI7mW1cN.html

Depending on safety and other factors, the company plans to test in even younger children afterwards, Sadoff, a vaccine research scientist at J&J’s Janssen unit, said.J&J started testing the vaccine in adults in a 60,000-volunteer Phase III study in late September. It had to pause the trial earlier this month because of a serious medical event in one participant.

Speaking at a rally in Texas on Friday, Harris, 56, accused the Republicans of creating a confusion on votes. “Everyone should vote to bring a change at the White House. Need to realise the power of vote and the opponents are for creating confusion on votes,” Harris, who is the first Democratic vice-presidential candidate to address an election rally in Republican stronghold Texas in decades, said. “They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. We vote to honour the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake,” Harris added.She said the country is undergoing a major health crisis, with the death of more than 220,000 Americans due to coronavirus pandemic and blamed President Donald Trump for the situation.“We want to make sure we see it through and then let’s make sure on Election Day, everybody we know has made sure that their voice, their powerful voice, is represented in this election through their vote, because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote,” she said.US is the worst impacted nation by the coronavirus, with the total number of infections and deaths standing at 9,034,925 and 229,544, according to Johns Hopkins University.“We’re in the midst of a public health pandemic. You also have a situation where we have a president who, while we are seeing spikes around our country, talking about we’ve turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people,” she said.She said that because of the pandemic, the worsening of the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. “We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry,” she rued, adding that the US is in the middle of a hunger crisis.The Democratic Party under the leadership of Joe Biden, she asserted, is a plan to fight coronavirus, and is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than USD 400,000 a year, and is also committed in investing in working people in America.“Biden understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities. We need to acknowledge them, difficult though they may be, to think about, much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we’re doing around healthcare. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system,” she said. She accused President Trump of ruining America. “A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, who as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban. America, we deserve better,” she said.“That does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities, as a nation that knows we are our strongest when we are unified, knows that we have so much more in common regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language your grandmother speaks,” said the Senator from California.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-urges-voters-to-vote-in-large-numbers-bring-change-at-white-house/story-dhCEU17NFceJ5PStF09zxJ.html
31-10-2020||World||UN defeats Russia resolution promoting women at peace tables||The U.N. Security Council defeated a Russian resolution Friday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a U.N. measure demanding equal participation for women in activities promoting global peace, with opponents objecting to its failure to adequately address human rights and the key role of civil society in pushing for gender equality.The email vote on the resolution was 5-0, with 10 countries abstaining, far less than the minimum nine “yes” votes required for adoption.Also Read: ‘UN needs to address crisis of confidence’: PM Modi calls for ‘reformed multilateralism’The Russian draft was supported by Russia, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and South Africa. The countries that abstained were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Dominican Republic, Germany, Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tunisia.Opponents said the Russian draft weakened the initial U.N. resolution adopted in 2000 and nine follow-up resolutions -- which Russia strongly denied.Germany’s U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said his calls for strong language on the human rights foundation of all the resolutions, and for “the adequate reflection of the critical role of civil society, women peacebuilders and human rights defenders” in implementing the measures were not reflected in the Russian draft.What is needed is “action and implementation,” he said, “not more words.”U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft said the Trump administration and the other countries that abstained were protecting the women, peace and security agenda from an attack by Russia and China, which contributed to the draft resolution.She said the draft resolution “was designed to undermine and reverse the progress of the past 20 years,” and “it is evident that our Russian and Chinese colleagues ... do not believe women should be fully empowered to prevent conflict, or sit at the table to pursue peace and reconciliation.”Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the current Security Council president, told a news conference after announcing the vote that the defeated draft did reaffirm and urge implementation of all 10 previous resolutions — and he dismissed claims that it was a step back or watered down as “not true.”“Civil society, human rights were all there,” he said. “We are for the civil society and human rights. To accuse us that we are trying to strike out the references to this is at best unworthy.”Civil society and human rights are mentioned in the defeated resolution’s introductory paragraphs -- but not in its binding operative paragraphs. They were in the operative paragraphs in earlier drafts, but diplomats said the were dropped at China’s insistence.The Russian resolution would have commemorated the 20th anniversary of the initial women, peace and security resolution and noted “with deep concern persistent barriers” to its implementation.At a council meeting Thursday commemorating the anniversary, the head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality said the resolution’s demand for equal participation for women in peace negotiations has failed.Women still remain “systematically excluded” from talks to end conflicts where men make decisions affecting their lives, UN Women’s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said.Also Read: The UN must reform to stay relevant | HT EditorialDespite some good initiatives, she said that in peace negotiations from 1992 to 2019 only 13 percent of negotiators, 6 percent of mediators, and 6 percent of signatories to peace agreements were women.Mlambo-Ngcuka said negotiations elevated and empowered “the actors that have fueled the violence,” instead of empowering women and others who are peace-builders — and women were either confined to “informal processes or relegated to the role of spectators.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated to the council that “gender equality is first and foremost a question of power, and wherever we look, power structures are dominated by men,” starting at the top where women lead only 7 percent of countries.Britain’s acting U.N. ambassador Jonathan Allen said after the vote that the UK held the widely shared view that the Russian draft lacked “sufficient language on implementation” and on women’s human rights and the protection of civil society.“The adoption of this text would have undermined the significant achievements made on this critical agenda and the enduring efforts of so many women’s rights activists,” Allen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-defeats-russia-resolution-promoting-women-at-peace-tables/story-LP65qD5sC5KVz5TQRCNqYN.html
31-10-2020||World||Donald Trump pitches ‘back to normal’ as Joe Biden warns of tough days||President Donald Trump dangled a promise to get a weary, fearful nation “back to normal” on Friday as he looked to campaign past the political damage of the devastating pandemic. It was a tantalizingly rosy pitch in sharp contrast to Democratic rival Joe Biden, who pledged to level with America about tough days still ahead after Tuesday’s election.In a campaign that has been dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 227,000 Americans and staggered the economy, the candidates’ clashing overtures stood as a reflection of their leadership styles and policy prescriptions for a suffering U.S.A.Trump and Biden both spent Friday crisscrossing the Midwest, the hardest-hit part of the nation in the latest surge of virus cases. Trump was in Michigan and Biden in Iowa before they both held events in Wisconsin and Minnesota.With four days until the election and more than 86 million votes already cast, time is running out for Trump and Biden to change the contours of a race framed largely around the incumbent’s handling of the pandemic. Biden is leading most national polls and has a narrow advantage in many of the critical battlegrounds that could decide the race.Trump, billing himself as an optimist, says the nation has “turned the corner” from the outbreak that still kills about 1,000 Americans each day. He speaks hopefully of coming treatments and potential vaccines that have yet to receive approval. Biden dismisses Trump’s talk as a siren song that can only prolong the virus, and pledges a nationwide focus on reinstituting measures meant to slow the spread of the disease.“He said a long dark winter,” Trump scoffed Friday at a rally in Michigan. “Oh that’s great, that’s wonderful. Just what our country needs is a long dark winter and a leader who talks about it.”Trump’s rallies, which draw thousands of supporters, have served as representations of the sort of “reopening” he has been preaching. With spotty use of masks and a lack of social distancing, they flout state and local guidelines that he deems too onerous as he speaks as though the virus has largely disappeared.Trump and his aides speak openly about seeking the backing of those “fed up” by state restrictions, and he has encouraged chants among his supporters calling for the imprisonment of local officials who have instituted them. The president believes they represent part of a “silent majority” that will help him pull off another come-from-behind victory on Tuesday.Biden, for his part, referenced Trump’s comments last summer that the virus “is what it is.” He told supporters in Des Moines, Iowa, that “it is what it is because he is who he is! These guys are something else, man.”Biden has seized on comments by Trump’s chief of staff that the virus can’t be controlled and that the administration is focused instead on vaccines and therapeutics. By contrast, Biden is promising to step up the fight to contain the spread, including a mask mandate on federal property and pressure on governors to apply it in their states, and pledging to follow the advice of public health professionals on potentially strict safety rules.Still, Biden appeared sensitive to Trump’s closing cry that the Democrat would impose draconian measures more damaging than the the virus itself.“I’m not going to shut down the country. I’m not going to shut down the economy,” Biden tweeted Friday, responding directly to Trump’s attack lines. “I’m going to shut down the virus.”Trump’s closing appeal to “Make America Great Again, Again” paints a bright image of the nation ‘s condition during pre-coronavirus times that contrasts with Biden’s charge to “Build Back Better.” The president’s focus on returning the nation’s economy to the boom times of 2019 resonates with some voters, but overlooks the divided and rancorous politics that swirled around impeachment and the persistent problems of inequality.As the nation set new records for confirmed cases, Wall Street closed out a punishing week Friday with the S&P 500 posting its first back-to-back monthly loss since the pandemic first gripped the economy in March.Friday marked the beginning of the critical final stretch before the election. Trump’s closing sprint includes four stops in Pennsylvania on Saturday and nearly a dozen events in the final 48 hours across states he carried in 2016.Biden, after visiting Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota on Friday, will hit Michigan on Saturday, where he’ll hold a joint rally with former President Barack Obama.Biden will close out his campaign Monday in a familiar battleground: Pennsylvania, the state where he was born and the one he’s visited more than any other in his campaign. The Biden team announced the candidate, his wife Jill, running mate Sen. Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, plan to “fan out across all four corners of the state.”After stopping in Green Bay on Friday, Trump will be back in Wisconsin on Monday for a visit to Kenosha. He appears to lag in recent polling behind his 2016 numbers in the GOP-leaning suburbs around Milwaukee, a key area for successful Republican campaigns in the state.A new Marquette University Law School poll shows Trump with support from 52 percent of likely voters in the eight counties that form the half-ring around Milwaukee. In 2016, he received a combined 61 percent of the vote in the eight counties when he won the state by fewer than 25,000 votes.Attendance at the president’s later stop in Rochester, Minnesota, has been capped at 250 people at the insistence of state and local officials.“We have 25,000 people in Minnesota, which is our last stop today — 25,000 people want to be there. And they say you can only have 250 people,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. “They thought I’d cancel. But I’m not canceling and we’ll find out what happens.”The Minnesota Department of Health has linked 28 coronavirus cases to other recent Trump campaign events in the state.Biden aims to hold his election night event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Trump, who had been scheduled to hold a party at his Washington, D.C., hotel, appeared to be rethinking his plans as a result of the city’s Covid-19 restrictions.“So we have a hotel, I don’t know if you’re allowed to use it or not, but I know the mayor has shut down Washington D.C.,” Trump said as he headed out from the White House. “And if that’s the case, we’ll probably stay here or pick another location.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pitches-back-to-normal-as-joe-biden-warns-of-tough-days/story-zEGKVdf33KzHXlGaX4xYxM.html

Greek seismologists said the magnitude reached 6.9. Multiple casualties and fatalities are being reported by the two countries as crisis control works continue.“I want to start by noting that WHO is closely following the unfolding situation in Greece and Turkey after the earthquake today. We will work with the two countries to ensure that emergency medical care is provided for those in need. Our thoughts are with all those affected,” Tedros told a virtual briefing.Two children were found dead under a collapsed wall in the Greek Island of Samos. The search operation continues.The death toll from the quake in Izmir has reached 12 at the time of the writing and 419 people were confirmed injured. Numerous buildings have collapsed and rescue teams are still underway sorting out the rubble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-closely-following-situation-in-greece-turkey-after-deadly-earthquake/story-DoYiSuIBYvAs43dNRqdDLL.html
31-10-2020||World||How the Google litigation may play out in US court||Alphabet Inc’s Google and the US Justice Department are set to face each other in court on Friday for the first time since the government sued the company for illegally monopolising internet search.The hearing marks the first time attorneys for Google and the government will come together to start mapping out the litigation process.“We’re at the top of the first inning of a very long game,” said Mark McCareins, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.The government’s first task is to convince the court that the markets laid out in the complaint are the right markets to assess the case. It then must demonstrate that Google has monopoly power in one or more of them.The government says Google has monopoly power in three markets: general search services, search text advertising, and search advertising.General search services is the market for search queries through search engines, which includes competitors like Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Search text advertising consists of ads sold by search engines that are designed to resemble organic search results. Search advertising is made up all types of ads generated in response to search queries.“If the government can’t prove monopoly power in any of those markets, then the case is over,” said Sam Weinstein, a former Justice Department antitrust official.Google likely will counter by pushing to expand the scope of what’s included in the three markets.Google, which controls some 90% of web search, will have a tough time rebutting claims that it dominates the general search services market because it would have to show that there are venues other than search engines where consumers can perform an internet search, said Jennifer Rie, a litigation analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.Google is likely to say that a large percentage of product searches begin on online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. Google earned 73% of US search advertising revenue, according to a 2019 report by EMarketer, but Amazon’s share has been rising steadily.Exclusionary dealsIf the Justice Department can prove Google is a monopoly in at least one market, it will then have to show that Google illegally keeps control of the markets by using a web of exclusionary agreements to block rival search engines from competing.Google uses agreements, under which device makers can get a cut of Google’s advertising revenues in exchange for making Google the default search engine.Google is expected to show that its agreements with device makers serve a variety of business purposes other than squashing competing search engines.Federal district court judge Amit Mehta will have to weigh the two sides’ arguments in what’s called a “rule-of-reason” analysis, in which he will balance the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects that each side demonstrates, said Peter Mucchetti, an antitrust lawyer at Clifford Chance.Harming consumersTo prove that Google’s agreements are illegal, the Justice Department must show that they have harmed competition.Competing search engines don’t have access to the same distribution channels on mobile devices because of Google’s exclusive partnerships, according to the government. The harms to rival search engines have in turn hurt consumers, the US says. The search engine’s conduct also harms advertisers, which must “pay a toll” in the form of higher prices, the US says.“What the government has to do is say that consumers are injured, but not in price,” said John Lopatka, an antitrust professor at Penn State Law.In this scenario, Google will probably argue that its distribution agreements aren’t the reason rival search engines have failed to win market share. Instead, Google is expected to say its product is superior.The precedentThe Google complaint mirrors arguments the government made against Microsoft in 1998, the last major monopoly case brought in the US.In that case, the Justice Department successfully argued that Microsoft illegally maintained its monopoly in computer-operating systems by requiring computer makers to set its web browser as the default on their machines.Google will try distinguish itself from Microsoft. For one, consumers can switch to another search engine more easily than they could switch browsers on their PCs two decades ago, said Cardozo Law’s Weinstein.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-google-litigation-may-play-out-in-us-court/story-MgsiiNglwAjJRrdPA5RubN.html

Trump is facing Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the November 3 presidential elections. “We haven’t made a determination. We have certain rules and regulations. You know Washington DC is shut down. The mayor has shut it down. So we have a hotel (Trump International Hotel).. I don’t know if it’s shut, if you’re allowed to use it or not, but I know the mayor has shut down Washington DC,’ Trump told reporters here, when asked where would he be staying on Election Night “And if that’s the case, we’ll probably stay here (White House) or pick another location. I think it’s crazy Washington DC is shut down,” said the president. On Election Night in 2016, Trump was in New York. After becoming the president in 2017, he moved his residence from New York to Florida. On Friday, Trump is travelling to Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The president has been carrying out on an average three election rallies everyday, each of them attracting thousands of supporters. “We’re doing a lot of travelling. We’ll be doing a lot of rallies. We have some big ones. We’re having a problem with some people in Minnesota where they have a cap because Biden goes there and he can’t draw flies; he can’t draw anybody. Gets a few cars, I guess, and they honk their horn,” he said. “We’ve got the biggest crowds in the history of politics, and I think you will all be witness to that because there has never been anybody that has ever had bigger crowds or more enthusiasm than we have,” he said, adding that there will be 25,000 people at the rally in Minnesota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-election-night-donald-trump-says-he-would-probably-stay-at-white-house/story-Yyw1Ud2StRhgJ1Mrh2R3FM.html
31-10-2020||World||Twitter deletes former Malaysian PM’s tweet for glorifying Nice knife attack; France seeks account suspension||Social networking platform Twitter on Thursday removed former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s tweet, for violating its rules banning the glorification of violence, shortly after a violent knife attack in Nice, which left three people dead.In a series of tweets, Mahathir Mohamad had said that “Muslims have a right to be angry and kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past”. It sparked an angry outburst on social media with many users calling out the former Malaysian prime minister.Cedric O, France’s Secretary for Digital Sector also condemned the post and urged Twitter to suspend the account of the former Malaysian prime minister and said in a tweet: “If not, Twitter would be an accomplice to a formal call for murder.”“I just spoke with the Managing Director of Twitter France. The account of former Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad must be immediately suspended. If not, Twitter would be an accomplice to a formal call for murder,” Cedric O tweeted.Twitter first labelled the tweet with a disclaimer stating that the posting violated its rules but was being left up because it was in public interest. The networking site later completely deleted the tweet but left the remaining of the Twitter thread intact.Earlier today, Mahathir Mohamad had asserted that Muslims have a right to be angry and “kill millions of French people” for the “massacres of the past”. This comes following French President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of radical Islam after a school teacher, was beheaded by an 18- year old for showing cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed in class.In a series of 13 tweets, Mahathir Mohamad posting from his personal Twitter handle lashed out at Macron for not being “civilised” and for being “very primitive in blaming the religion of Islam and Muslims for the killing of the insulting school teacher”.“Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past. But by and large the Muslims have not applied the “eye for an eye” law. Muslims don’t. The French shouldn’t. Instead the French should teach their people to respect other people’s feelings,” he said.He further said, “Since you have blamed all Muslims and the Muslims’ religion for what was done by one angry person, the Muslims have a right to punish the French. The boycott cannot compensate the wrongs committed by the French all these years.”France’s Secretary of State’s remarks comes after another attack was witnessed on Thursday where a knife-wielding man killed two women and a man at the Notre-Dame Basilica in Nice and injured several others. The police detained the attacker and launched an investigation on terrorism grounds.The attack in Nice was followed by a knife-stabbing attempt in France’s southeastern city of Avignon and another one at the French Consulate in Saudi Arabia.A few days ago, Samuel Paty, a school teacher, was beheaded by an 18-year-old teenager on the outskirts of Paris after he showed cartoons depicting the Prophet during a lesson. Paty was posthumously granted France’s highest award, the Legion d’Honneur, and commemorated in the national ceremony at the Sorbonne University in Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-deletes-malaysian-pm-s-tweet-for-glorifying-nice-knife-attack-france-seeks-account-suspension/story-IIZUvGsPbZLkCzvRGUUfHO.html

The members of the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of the 900-bedded hospital had been protesting for the past several days and had gone on an indefinite strike, seeking the release of salaries due for the past three months.  Seniors doctors under the banner of the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) later had also gone on an indefinite strike, and both associations had called off the stir on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hindu-rao-nurses-threaten-to-go-on-indefinite-strike-from-nov-2/story-FTbb7GJZRhdwAxc7P2xk1L.html

Jaishankar made the remarks while delivering the Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture on the theme “India and the post-Covid world”. The speech contained an overview of India’s relations with major powers such as the US, Russia and China, and outlined the government’s vision to enhance the country’s standing in the world order emerging from the Covid-19 crisis. Noting that relations with China had remained stable for three decades, he said peace and tranquillity on the border had allowed the two sides to expand cooperation in other domains. “But as the pandemic unfolded, the relationship has come under severe stress,” he said. “To restore normalcy, agreements between the two countries must be respected scrupulously in their entirety. Where the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is concerned, any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo is unacceptable,” Jaishankar said. “The relationship cannot be immune to changes in the assumptions that underpinned it. Large civilisational states re-emerging in close proximity will not have naturally easy ties. Their interests are best served by a sustained engagement based on mutual respect and mutual sensitivity,” he added. India has said Chinese troops had hampered patrolling by its forces along the LAC since April this year and violated border agreements and protocols. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in June and warning shots have been fired by both sides – the first time guns were used along the LAC since 1975. With winter approaching, tens of thousands of troops mobilised on both sides are set to remain deployed in Ladakh region as several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have been unable to take forward the disengagement process. Jaishankar also highlighted the importance of border infrastructure in national security, saying the periphery will reflect the capabilities of the heartland. Leaving parts of the border underdeveloped has its risks and “safeguarding borders is a 24x7 exercise [and] not only an appropriate response to an emerging situation”, he said. India’s experience in the past few years in expediting the creation of border infrastructure in the north shows how much difference sharper focus and better implementation can make, and the shift from declarations to delivery is in keeping with the outlook of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, he added. “Underlying it is, of course, a basic willingness to fully recognise the challenges that the nation faces. By playing down issues like cross-border terrorism or competitive geopolitics, there has been a tendency to look away from the hard choices. In a more difficult world, that is going to be less possible,” Jaishankar noted. With the US, successive governments on both sides have pursued a “non-partisan endeavour”, and strong economic and technological complementarities have laid a strong foundation for the relationship, he said. “But it is in the face of emerging multi-polarity that both nations have developed a serious interest in more intensive engagement,” he added. India’s relations with Russia have held remarkably steady and the “strategic logic that has sustained this relationship since its early days still remains largely relevant”, Jaishankar said, adding that India has also ramped up its engagement with European states, which are taking a greater interest in the Indo-Pacific region. There is also a strong case for accelerating the partnership with Japan, which has been responsible for catalysing many aspects of India’s modernization, he said. Looking at the world order emerging out of the Covid-19 crisis, Jaishankar said it was apparent even before the pandemic that the existing international system was under great stress due to multiple and complex reasons, including the disenchantment with a globalised economic system that created unequal gains. “The Covid-19 pandemic could well be the last straw on the back of a fraying global consensus,” he said. “India will approach the world in a more proactive way in the aftermath of the pandemic...The pressures of the pandemic will naturally impart a different urgency to such engagements...Indian diplomacy will be more integrated with our defence and security needs, more supportive of our economic and commercial interests, more aware of our technology capabilities and offerings, and more sensitive to the diaspora,” he added.

Commenting on the ongoing standoff between India and China, the foreign minister said ties were stable for three decades as two nations addressed inherited challenges and new circumstances. “Peace and tranquillity in border areas provided basis for expanded cooperation on other domains,” Jaishankar said.Agreements between the countries must be respected scrupulously in the entirety to restore normalcy, Jaishankar said.The foreign minister has commented several times on the India-China standoff and reiterated that the immediate focus should be on restoring peace and tranquillity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/any-attempt-to-unilaterally-change-status-quo-is-unacceptable-jaishankar-on-lac/story-bwG6i8xo1g1lfSGJGAKLXP.html

In the complaint, the victim and other nuns who supported her said he was frequently posting threats and objectionable materials to portray them in bad light. Later the case was handed over to the cyber wing which arrested the church activist from his house on the outskirts of Kochi. During investigation, the cyber wing found that he was posting many messages discreetly to discredit the victim and others. A staunch supporter of Franco Mulakkal, he used to appear in TV debates representing the Indian Catholic Forum, a body associated with the Catholic church. The trial against the former bishop is going on in a special court in Kottayam. Earlier his plea to quash the case was dismissed by the Kerala High Court and later the Supreme Court. The case surfaced two years ago, when a 43-year-old nun, also a mother superior, had complained to the police in Kottayam in central Kerala that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016.The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. Mulakkal denied the charges, saying he was implicated after he took action against the nun for financial irregularities in the convent. Later, a special investigation team arrested him in September 2018 and subsequently he was removed from the post of bishop. The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year. There were allegations that the accused was trying to delay the trial. The petitioner had also complained that some of the witnesses were threatened by the followers of Mulakkal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-church-activist-threatens-nuns-over-franco-mulakkal-case-arrested/story-STsw54i1tuNUuwueOK0NGO.html
31-10-2020||India||Amit Shah on 2-day Bengal tour from November 5, JP Nadda’s visit cancelled||Home Minister Amit Shah will be on a two-day visit to West Bengal from November 5 to take stock of the party’s preparations ahead of the 2021 assembly polls.BJP president JP Nadda’s visit to the state was cancelled late on Friday night after the party got confirmation from the home minister about his scheduled trip. “There was a sudden change in program on Friday. Instead of Nadda, Shah would be coming to West Bengal and hold meetings on November 5 and 6. Earlier too it was decided that Shah would come. But as his health was not permitting, the schedule became uncertain,” said Dilip Ghosh, head of the BJP’s state unit in Bengal. Nadda was supposed to come on November 6 and 7. This would have been his second visit to the state. He had been to north Bengal on October 19 just ahead of the Durga Puja. Out of the BJP’s five organizational zones in the state, during his visit Nadda had addressed the BJP workers of north Bengal zone.Shah, during his two-day stay, will address two meetings, covering two zones in each meeting. While the meeting on November 5 is in Bankura, on November 6 the meeting will take place in state capital Kolkata. After the BJP’s impressive performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, in which the party won 18 out of the 42 seats, the party is now eyeing for the West Bengal assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed Bengali people and BJP workers on the first day of the Durga Puja, virtually sounding the bugle for the 2021 polls and setting the tone for the party’s poll campaign. With the Durga Puja over and only a few months left for the polls, the BJP’s central leaders want the state unit to hit the road with full steam from November. The entire movement will be monitored from Delhi. On Thursday, West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had met Shah in Delhi and had made serious allegations about the law and order situation in the state.“He is the Union home minister. Every day, he receives multiple complaints about party-men being killed and police doing nothing. It may be that he wants to see everything with his own eyes. Apart from addressing party meetings he has a lot of other meetings,” said Sayantan Basu, state general secretary of BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-on-2-day-bengal-tour-from-november-5-jp-nadda-s-visit-cancelled/story-I4HX9zYOeNWhEDMPhRFPCL.html

I always wanted to be a part of something worthwhile after being disappointed on many occasions. But, I didn’t let my love for acting fade away while I was writing and training others,” said National School of Drama (NSD) alumnus. Telling more about his early days, Hemant said, “After my course, I did some work but it was not up to the mark. Then I got a writing offer for a show ‘Shabaash India’ (2006) and along with that I continued doing theatre. I wrote shows like ‘Dance India Dance,’ ‘Indian Idol’ and also donned the hat of a creative director for other shows.” Simultaneously, he started training anchors and actors for shows as an acting coach. “All this continued and I deliberately avoided taking acting projects where my role was insignificant. I was actually happy training and writing shows but the actor in me was restless.”Hemant has impressed one and all with his performance of Ashwin Mehta in the web series, ‘Scam1992.’ “My audition for this role went very well. When I came to know that the story is about Harshad Mehta, who made headlines for the 1992 Indian stock market scam, and the character is that of his elder brother, I felt this can be the project I have waited for all these years. Thank God, I accepted it and it did click! I mean look at the high ratings and rave reviews it’s garnering. Hansal (Mehta) sir was well armed and left nothing unresearched or unexplored.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/best-is-always-worth-waiting-for-says-hemant-kher/story-ddcKoh3LuY7HL0dncWMauK.html
31-10-2020||India||India-Bangladesh border sees spike in wildlife smuggling, says BSF||The highly porous India-Bangladesh border in south Bengal has witnessed a spurt in wildlife smuggling this year, a top official of the Border Security Force has confirmed. While in 2018, the BSF’s south Bengal Frontier had seized 22 such consignments, in 2019 the number went down to 13. This year, however, despite the pandemic and the lockdown when infiltration had dropped, the BSF has seized at least 25 consignments till October. The last in the line is the rescue of 13 white cockatoos on Thursday which are native of Indonesia and were being smuggled into India through the international border in North 24 Parganas district. “There has been a rise in animal trade, mostly birds, in this year. We are trying to analyse the trend. There has been no specific reason which has come to light so far. The BSF is alert and keeping a watch,” said SS Guleria, DIG of BSF’s south Bengal frontier. Senior officials of the BSF said that this year till date around 14 gecko lizards, 31 cockatoos, 77 parrots and 95 pigeons have been seized. In 2019 only around 64 pigeons and 46 parrots were seized. The list of exotic bird pets seized this year include eight helmeted-curassow, a large terrestrial bird usually found in forests of south America, macaws and keel billed toucans, among others. The cost of some of these birds such as the curassow, toucan and macaw can run up to lakhs per pair. The India-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state across the country. Out of the 4096.7 km long border, West Bengal alone shares 2216 km with the neighbouring country. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people, respectively, along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India, according to data presented by the Union ministry of home affairs before Parliament in March. “In most of the cases the traffickers managed to flee taking advantage of the dense vegetation and darkness abandoning the boxes containing the birds. The birds were sent to the zoo in Kolkata after being rescued. Only four persons have been arrested this year,” said a BSF official. The lockdown had taken a heavy toll on infiltration attempts across the country’s longest and most porous international border - the Indo-Bangla border in West Bengal. Smuggling activities however were still going on. Data shared by the Border Security Force shows that around 20 persons were arrested while they were trying to enter India in April and May – the two months in which total lockdown was observed - this year. In 2018 and 2019, the BSF had arrested 314 and 171 persons during the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-border-sees-spike-in-wildlife-smuggling-says-bsf/story-ydB6YU0oB0PQyIfhfrNLRN.html

On Friday, Delhi reported 5,891 new cases — the highest single-day number of all time. The government health bulletin revealed that 41 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours. Over 44,000 people have been tested in the same period of time.There are 3,274 containment zones in the Capital and over 20,000 people are under home isolation at present.The sudden spike in the number of daily cases after a period when Delhi was believed to have tackled Covid-19 effectively has become a cause of worry. The Centre has called for a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue.Also Read: As Covid-19 cases soar in Delhi, health minister Satyendar Jain lists reasonsThe spike began on Wednesday when Delhi crossed the 5,000-mark for the first time with 5,673 new cases in a span of 24 hours.

The nomination papers of Jogi’s wife Richa Jogi, who had filed nomination for the same seat, were also cancelled on the same groundThe reserved seat for schedule Tribes (ST) Marwahi seat, which falls in the newly formed Gaurela-Pendra-Marwahi (GPM) district, fell vacant following the death of sitting MLA and Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) chief Ajit Jogi in May. The elections are scheduled on November 3. In a written statement, Jogi said that he was informed by the JCC (J) legislative party leader Dharamjeet Singh and party leader Rajendra Rai that they have decided to extend support to BJP candidate Gambhir Singh. Jogi further said that he had not spoken directly to BJP leaders in this connection but the support is temporary.“The Congress chief minister and his party members have been continuously insulting my father Ajit Jogi that goes against the tradition of the country and basic morality. Hence, we have decided to extend support to the BJP in the bypoll and I appeal to the people of Marwahi to vote against the Congress and teach them a lesson,” said Jogi.RP Singh, senior Congress leader and party spokesperson, reacting over the support of JCC to BJP, said that there is nothing new and Congress and people of Marwahi were aware of the tie up from the beginning.“What is the promise BJP has given for the support? Is there any kind of deal? People have the right to know. As far as the question of insult to Ajit Jogi is concerned, it was the BJP who raised questions on the tribal status of Ajit Jogi since he entered politics,” said Singh.It is worth mentioning that both BJP and Congress have fielded doctors in the Marwahi constituency. The BJP fielded a tribal surgeon, Gambhir Singh, as its candidate while the ruling Congress has put up veteran Dr Krishan Kumar Dhruw, who had a long stint as the block medical officer (BMO) in the area.“Everyone knows that Congress has snatched the democractic right of the Jogi family, which should be condemned. As far as support for our party candidate in Marwahi, we welcome it. Amiy Jogi’s party has a huge vote bank and its support will strengthen the democratic values,” said senior BJP leader and spokesperson, Sacchinand Upsane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-amit-jogi-extends-support-to-bjp-in-marwahi-bypoll/story-QUbrTm8YCkpxrDOHoTYtPP.html

The couple after two girls presumed that the third would be a girl as well and struck a deal.The couple got to know later that the newborn was a male child and they then approached the police seeking their help in restoration of their infant boy. Inquiries revealed that the couple demanded an additional amount of Rs 4 lakh from the adoptive parents since the child was a baby boy.“We have arrested the adoptive father and also the couple for selling the infant, besides another woman who brokered the deal. All the four accused were produced before the court and remanded in 14-day judicial custody,” Nacharam police inspector T Kiran Kumar told Hindustan Times.According to police, Meena - a servant maid living at Nacharam along with her husband Venkatesh, a cab driver - gave birth to girls in her first two deliveries. While the first girl child died soon after delivery four years ago, the second girl is 18 months old.“She became pregnant again last year and feared that she might give birth to a girl child again. So, when Meena was in her fourth month of pregnancy, the couple thought of selling the new-born baby to a childless couple. They contacted Janaki, a sanitary worker, who managed to find a couple – Rajesh and Nagina, who agreed to buy the infant soon after the birth,” the inspector said.The deal was struck for Rs 1 lakh, which Rajesh had paid in instalments. “In May, Meena gave birth to a male child. But the mediator hoodwinked her saying it was again a girl child and that she had given the baby to Rajesh,” the police official said.A few days ago, Meena came to know from some other source in the hospital that she had actually given birth to a male child. She and her husband went to Rajesh and demanded that they be given their male child back. When Rajesh refused, the couple demanded that they be given at least another Rs 4 lakh as compensation. When he refused, the couple went to the Nacharam police station and sought police’s help to restore their child.Police recovered the child from the adoptive parents and handed him to the childline authorities of state women development and child welfare department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worried-about-girl-child-hyderabad-couple-sells-newborn-arrested-police/story-Gl88C4hGVo9lfg9ISMjE7H.html

The party central committee on Saturday said there was no need for him to quit and parents can’t be held responsible for the doings of grown-up children.“The party and government are intact and the latest developments have nothing to do with both. If Bineesh Kodiyeri has done any wrong he has to face music. The party won’t protect him. But citing this, we will not allow anybody to weaken the government,” said senior politburo member S Ramachandran Pillai in the state capital.Another politburo member MA Baby also said there was a concerted move to weaken the government using the central agencies. “The Union government is implementing the RSS agenda to weaken the secular government in Kerala. All agencies are busy nitpicking. The party and government will emerge stronger because people are with us,” he wrote in a Facebook post. He also said the party won’t protect Kodiyeri and it was his duty to come clean.In Delhi, party general secretary Sitaram Yechury also echoed the same view. “Bineesh Kodiyeri is not holding any position in the party. The party has no role in things he has done at the personal level,” he said. The opposition Congress and BJP said the central leadership was not in a position to touch the state secretary. “It shows the degeneration of the proletarian party,” said state opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. Kodiyeri was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in Bengaluru on Thursday and a court later remanded him to the ED’s custody for four days. In a statement, the central agency said the main accused in the drug case Anoop Mohammad was just a “benami” (proxy) of Kodiyeri who ensured funding from various sources for the thriving drug business.Two key arrests - CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s former secretary M Sivasankar in the gold smuggling case and the party secretary’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri in the narcotics case - have roiled the state’s ruling CPI(M). With six months left for the assembly election, the party has its task cut out to convince supporters and voters that it is in the clear. Analysts said this is fast becoming the biggest crisis of CM Vijayan’s tenureIn another trouble for the government, the customs have summoned higher education minister K T Jaeel next week. Earlier, he was grilled by the National Investigation Agency and Enforcement Directorate in connection with the import of religious books and dry dates from the United Arab Emirates flouting foreign contribution norms.Jaleel landed in trouble after his name figured prominently in the call list of Swapna Suresh, main accused in the gold smuggling case. Soon after the list surfaced, the minister held a press conference in Malappuram and said he called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate. But this clarification invited more trouble as he was not supposed to accept any fund or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs. The opposition alleged that some of the consignments carried smuggled gold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-firm-behind-kodiyeri-balakrishnan-after-his-son-s-arrest-in-drug-case/story-mDhx1YTxTxAXIfhbvSwp1O.html

His nomination, however, was rejected during the scrutiny of papers the next day after a day long drama in which seven BSP MLAs, including the four who had signed the nomination of their party candidate Ramji Gautam, gave an affidavit that their signatures had been forged.The seven MLAs, who are said to have met SP president Akhilesh Yadav, were later suspended by BSP president Mayawati who also declared that her party would vote for any other political outfit, including the Bharatiya Janata Party to ensure the defeat of the Samajwadi Party in the upcoming elections to the Upper House of the Uttar Pradesh assembly and the Rajya Sabha.She had also termed her decision to join hands with the Samajwadi Party ahead of the last year’s general elections a “mistake”, lamenting that she should not have withdrawn a 1995 case against Akhilesh’s father Mulayam Singh Yadav.Speaking after paying floral tributes to Acharya Narendra Dev, Akhilesh Yadav also said there was a need to deliberate on how to restore economic growth amid the persisting Covid-19 pandemic.The big question is how are we going to achieve prosperity, he said lamenting that despite great men showing the path, the governments have not followed it resulting in severe problems.“We resolve every year to serve the society and country through the path shown by Acharya Narendra Dev. We also pay our respect to Sardar Patel and Maharshi Valmiki on their anniversary today,” he said.“It is an important day. We are passing through one of the most difficult days. People have lost their jobs and farmers are not getting the right price of their produce,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-supported-independent-rajya-sabha-candidate-to-expose-bsp-bjp-ties-akhilesh-yadav/story-WxgtItsL5s68fk2mvzx42O.html

Addressing an election rally in Patna, the senior BJP leader said that the Congress was spreading misinformation about India-China issue. Lobbing a challenge to the Opposition, Rajnath said once he makes a disclosure, those who are questioning the Army today will not be able to show their face.“Some political parties.. Congress... are questing the bravery of our jawans. They are saying China has captured 1200 square kilometre of land. If I make a disclosure, it will be difficult for them to save face. And you all are educated people. You have been following the state of affairs since 1962 to 2013. As the defence minister, I take immense pride in saying that our jawans had made India proud.The issue of the ongoing India-China standoff has surfaced several times in Bihar election campaign. In their first election rallies in Bihar before the first phase of Bihar Assembly Election 2020, both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi evoked Bihar’s pride of sending jawans to protect the country. The Prime Minister had said that the Opposition should be ashamed of seeking votes in Bihar when they want Article 370 of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir back. Rahul Gandhi also questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi denied transgression by Chinese Army.On Friday, Rahul Gandhi shared a report which quoted Ladakh’s former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang saying that the Chinese troops have further transgressed into Indian territory and occupied positions in Finger 2 and 3 of north bank of Pangong lake. The Centre has denied this claim and said it was fake news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-be-difficult-for-them-to-save-face-rajnath-singh-attacks-congress-on-china-issue/story-xqe9WIcWwgPm2Gb6sLHt9O.html

31-10-2020||India||Nirmala Sitharaman wanted me out of finance ministry, says former secretary Subhash Garg||Subhash Chandra Garg, the former finance secretary who was shunted out of the finance ministry within three weeks of Modi-2.0 government’s first budget last year, on Saturday alleged that new Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman got him transferred out. Garg, who took voluntary retirement soon after being moved from the finance ministry - where he handled the Department of Economic Affairs - to power ministry, said Sitharaman, unlike her predecessor Arun Jaitley, had “a very different personality and knowledge endowment”. Both Ministry of Finance and Sitharaman’s office refused to comment on the blog Garg wrote on the day he said he would have in normal course retired from the government service but for the VRS. Garg said he “did not share a good and productive working relationship” with Sitharaman, who came to the finance ministry “with some pre-conceived notions about me”. “She did not seem to have confidence in me. She was not quite comfortable working with me as well,” he said adding differences over surplus RBI should give as dividend to the government and dealing with problems of non-banks had surfaced within months of her takeover. “Serious difference also developed on some key issues like economic capital framework of RBI, a package for dealing with problems of non-banks, resolution of non-banks, partial credit guarantee scheme, capitalization of non-banks like IIFCL and other financial entities and the like. “Very soon, not only had our personal relationship soured, but the official working relationship also became quite unproductive,” he wrote. Sitharaman wanted him out in June 2019, ahead of the July 5 budget presentation, he said but did not say why her request wasn’t immediately accepted by the government. Garg was transferred out on July 24, 2019, as Secretary, Ministry of Power and he applied for voluntary retirement within half an hour of receiving the order. “Mrs. Sitharaman asked for and insisted on my transfer from the Ministry of Finance in June 2019 itself, within one month of her taking over as FM,” wrote Garg, who exited the government after serving the mandatory notice period on October 31, 2019. Praising her predecessor Jaitley for his deep knowledge and understanding of the economy, he said his successor “Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman, has a very different personality, knowledge endowment, skill-set and approach for economic policy issues and also for the officers working with her. “It became quite apparent very early that working with her was going to be quite difficult and it might not be conducive to undertaking necessary reforms for the attainment of the objective of building a USD 10 trillion economy of India.” The former finance secretary alleged that Sitharaman, for reasons not very clearly known to him,  came with some pre-conceived notions about him. “Very soon, not only had our personal relationship soured, but the official working relationship also become quite unproductive.” Garg recalled he made up his mind in June 2019, much before the Budget was presented, that he would take voluntary retirement from the service to be able to work on the wider economic reform agenda outside the government. “I drafted my months’ notice for voluntary retirement sometime in the fourth week of June after going through the rules relating to voluntary retirement and decided to seek it from October 31, 2019,” he said. Garg also said that he had discussed with the then Additional Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office, PK Mishra about his relationship with Sitharaman on a few occasions. “Both of us agreed that the best course would be for me to make way for the new FM to ‘function smoothly’. Mishra offered me to choose any job in the government or outside the government in regulatory bodies or elsewhere,” Garg said. The former finance secretary, however, informed Mishra that he had already made up his mind to seek voluntary retirement. “I filed for voluntary retirement on July 24, the day I was transferred to the Ministry of Power instead of October 31, 2019, the date I had originally intended,” he recalled. Garg, however on July 26, 2019, had asserted there is no connection between his transfer from the high profile Finance Ministry and decision to take voluntary retirement, saying he had already discussed the retirement matter with the Prime Minister’s Office on July 18. The 1983 batch IAS officer of Rajasthan cadre, Garg came to the Center in 2014 and was appointed Executive Director in the World Bank where he stayed till 2017 when he was appointed DEA Secretary in June 2017. In March 2019, he was elevated as the Finance Secretary. Jaitley, he said, was “a mastermind with an uncanny ability to sift through massive amounts of information and government files to discover the pith and substance of the public policy issue involved. He also had the right temperament and ability to forge consensus.” Jaitley focused on broader policy issues, leaving the running of the departments and implementation of policies to the Secretaries, he said adding Jaitley genuinely encouraged contribution on major policy issues to come from the Secretaries. “He made the Secretaries present the policy proposals to the Prime Minister’s Office as well as to the media and the public. He was a very magnanimous and broadminded person,” he said. Under Sitharaman, the Indian economic policy was getting distracted from what was required to attain her stated goal of building a USD 10 trillion economy by the early 2030s, Garg said adding that it was also one of the reasons for his leaving the IAS and quitting the government. “The reform agenda and the investment plan for attaining the goal of USD 10 trillion economy articulated in the Interim Budget 2019-20 however, got side-tracked and was virtually forgotten,” he said. “The Government was turning populist as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirmala-sitharaman-wanted-me-out-of-finance-ministry-says-former-secretary-subhash-garg/story-VxsetLJz62OXIcOKkpH6FM.html

CTR officials said seven women have been selected by the Corbett administration after holding a guide recruitment test on Wednesday. These selected women will be registered as guides and given responsibilities after a training and orientation programme. The CTR officials said 488 candidates appeared in the guide recruitment test held in Ramnagar, out of which 102 were women. A total of 67 candidates cleared the test, including seven women. “This is the first-time women are getting a chance to become nature guides. Till now, males used to dominate this domain. This concept is being implemented to generate livelihood for local women villagers who live in the periphery of the CTR,” said Rahul (who goes by his first name), director, CTR . Madan Joshi of Corbett Gypsy Safari Operators Welfare Association said there are around 105 nature guides in Corbett, who are all men. “This will be for the first time that women will be nature guides here”, he said.Joshi said for a safari of four hours, nature guides get around Rs 700. AG Ansari, a Ramnagar-based wildlife expert, said the initiative of having women guides is based on the concept of providing equal chance both men and women without any gender bias. “These selected women guides will be given around a 14-day training in various aspects of working as a guide, after which they will be registered as nature guide in Corbett.” “It is a matter of joy that all seven women hail from eco-development committees located in the periphery of CTR. There are around 40 villages along the boundary of CTR. This will also help in providing livelihoods to many families”, he said. Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is spread across 1,288 square kilometers, is one of the most loved tourist destinations in the state. The gates of Corbett open on November 15 every year for six months till mid-June. Corbett witnesses a footfall of around 300,000 tourists every year. There are 231 tigers inside CTR and 266 using the reserve according to the latest report on tigers. This is the highest number of tigers in 50 tiger reserves in India. Earlier this month, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat announced the creation of a new tourism zone in Corbett Tiger Reserve, which will be known as Garjiya Tourism, Zone. Currently, CTR has Bijrani, Dhikala, Dhela Durga Devi, Jhirna, Pakhro and Sonanadhi zones for tourism activities. But with the arrival of thousands of tourists every year, there is a lot of pressure on these zones. With the opening of this new Garjiya Tourist Zone, tourists will get to see a new place in CTR and the pressure on other zones will be comparatively reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-corbett-tiger-reserve-to-have-women-nature-guides/story-KvIwuos3GVVApiwq1cejjP.html

When Balasaheb Thackeray was there it (centre) was Mumbai but now all important people are in Pune. Even though some people were thinking this type of government won’t be formed but people like me were of the opinion earlier as well that it will be formed. The government has completed one year on October 28,” said Raut during a press conference. “I would say Uddhav Thackeray has managed to fight Covid-19 very well. If you go to other states you will realise it,” he added.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Shiv Sena leader further stated that there are various challenges before the Maharashtra government. Central leaders feel there should not be opposition or opposition leaders but Raut is always of the opinion that there should be a strong opposition party or leader.“Today we see the Bihar election....A youngster who has nobody’s support, his family members are in jail, CBI and Income tax is behind him. A youngster like him creates a challenge....If Tejaswi Yadav becomes Chief Minister then I won’t be surprised at last these are public feelings/sentiments,” he added. Raut further said if NCP chief Sharad Pawar gives advice then nobody should have a problem with it, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to take his advice earlier.“Chandrakant Patil needs to learn a lot many things till now. Sharad Pawar is the senior-most leader with experience in the state and if we don’t take that benefit then we are useless. Pawar saahab is our leader, if the Governor is also sending people to Pawar Saahab then it’s good, I welcome it. If the Governor needs guidance from Sharad Pawar then I would advice Pawar Saahab that he must guide him as well,” said Raut. Raut also said that if any Governor, be it from any state wants to do politics he must come out of governor house and do it, governor house is most respected and we maintain it.“Nobody from Delhi says this (Maharashtra) government will fall and even now state leaders have slowly started accepting it. “Till one year ago, there was a difference between the Hindutva of BJP and Shiv Sena, we used to present it aggressively and we do it even today. I always tell Balasaheb Thackeray’s statement--I want to become Khumaini (Afghanistan) of Hindutva’. I don’t feel Shiv Sena has used Hindutva for politics and if somebody has done it we didn’t stop them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-managed-to-fight-state-s-covid-19-situation-well-sanjay-raut/story-hrodeSW9c9hfZS8Of8qfxM.html
31-10-2020||India||Back home, migrants prepare to vote in Bihar after long||Suraj Kumar, 28, worked in Srinagar for 14 years before the Covid-19 pandemic left him jobless and forced him to return to Bihar this summer. He has since set up a paver block unit at Madhopur-Bairiya village in West Champaran district as he tries to pick up the pieces back home. The pandemic upended the lives of tens of thousands of migrant workers, brought untold sufferings, and forced many of them to walk back to their homes. But it has also pushed people like Kumar to stay put and get back on their feet in Bihar, which means they can also vote, something that they hardly ever did. “I have the privilege to [now] exercise my democratic rights,” said Kumar, who previously worked at a paver block unit in Srinagar and has since June employed 40 workers. Kumar is not alone in the village. Nine groups of migrant workers have started textile, apparel, embroidery, woodwork units with the government’s help and employ over 90 returnees there. Most of these returnees are excited about voting for the first time after having spent years outside Bihar. Most of them have never seen an electronic voting machine. Sikandar Pandey, 55, a migrant worker, last voted when paper ballots were used in the noughties. “Past is past. Our expectations from the next government are that it will facilitate the reverse migration of the workforce.” An official said they have made it a point to register tens of thousands of migrant workers as voters. “Efforts are also on to help the migrants become entrepreneurs,” said the official, who did not wish to be named. The migrant workers are expected to play a key role in deciding the outcome of the assembly elections. Congress lawmaker Vinay Verma said the migrant workers are aggrieved and feel cheated by the kind of treatment meted out to them during Covid-19 lockdown. “We are in constant touch with them and they are naturally with us. We will see that we make a comprehensive programme to empower them.” Ram Niwas Sahani, who worked in Mumbai, said political parties have been seeking their support. “We will take a judicious decision. The lockdown was a bad time. Everybody faced a rough time. We are not an exception. But things have certainly changed a great deal.” Bhartiya Janata Party leader Renu Devi said a beginning has certainly been made to make the migrant workers self-employed. “We are looking forward to encouraging their reverse migration and settlement in Bihar to provide the impetus to the economic development of our state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/back-home-migrants-prepare-to-vote-in-bihar-after-long/story-MeBjhTiQXL5vqYg9VXrXtI.html

The status prevented people from outside the state from buying or owning immovable property.In a statement calling for the strike and peaceful protests, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led Hurriyat Conference said the Centre’s imperial approach was bound to fail. It accused the Centre of “issuing incessant anti-people orders at frequent intervals to intimidate and psychologically torture the people”.The statement said the amalgam reiterates its “principled stand of engagement and dialogue among stakeholders for resolution of the Kashmir dispute”. It accused the Centre of attempting to “undermine all attempts of pursuing a peaceful resolution”.“A policy of permanent demographic change is aggressively being pushed to snatch our land, destroy our identity and turn us into a minority in our own land. One after the other laws are being invented and amended by New Delhi and forcibly thrust upon the people...”It added the Centre first brought in the “arbitrary” domicile law that gave residency rights to non-permanent residents and then allowed them to get jobs. “...now our land laws have been brazenly repealed to allow anyone from across India to own land in Jammu & Kashmir,” it said.Abdul Majid, a grocer in Srinagar’s Lal Chowk, said now nothing has been left for them. “The new laws introduced after the nullification of Article 370 [that gave Jammu & Kashmir the special status] and division of the state are anti-people and efforts are made to disempower the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shops-down-shutters-as-hurriyat-calls-strike-in-kashmir-over-land-rules/story-O3xNHMTwYwkwlT9jA5Wb0O.html

The police have filed a case against the accused under the Indian Penal Code sections including those pertaining to deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings by insulting religion or religious beliefs, public mischief, and identity theft under the Information Technology Act.

31-10-2020||India||Covid-19 pandemic was something as if the heavens fell, says CJI||Inaugurating India’s first-ever e-resource centre Nyay Kaushal in Nagpur, Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde on Saturday said how the Covid-19 pandemic created a huge challenge for physical hearings and subsequent virtual hearings could not become a proper solution as it created a divide between those who could afford technology and who couldn’t.“We tried to let the SC function in a restricted way but realised it wasn’t possible to safely continue court in that way... The pandemic was something as if heaven fell. A walk around the Court showed that no social distancing was being maintained. But there is an old saying in law that let justice be done though the heavens may fall. I’m very proud to say that along with my colleagues, we have managed to ensure that the rule of law is maintained,” the CJI said.Talking about advocates who have ended their careers, who wanted to end their lives in the aftermath of the pandemic, the CJI said, “ I know a case, where the advocate resorted to selling vegetables. Some states started mobile vans with portable Wifi, where litigants and Advocates can use the Wifi for hearings. It is time to remove these inequalities. This centre which we are inaugurating is the step in that direction.”The centre that was inaugurated on Saturday will facilitate filing of online cases starting from district courts to the high courts and the Supreme Court. The internet speed in 300 MBPS, reports said and the hearing room has been made soundproof. There is also a waiting room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pandemic-was-something-as-if-the-heavens-fell-says-cji/story-jdPx9h9PTfqUcGDVDcyi0I.html

The members of the delegation, which is visiting Ladakh, include NC leader Nasir Aslam Wani, PDP leaders Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura and Waheed Para, and Awami National Conference leader Muzaffar Shah. On Friday morning, the delegation met leaders in Drass enroute Kargil and discussed with them the PAGD agenda. Thereafter, the delegation reached Kargil where it discussed the agenda with Kargil Democratic Alliance, which revolves around restoration of Article 370 and 35-A that were revoked on August 5 last year. Talking to scribes, Omar said that the motive was connecting with the people of Ladakh and to take them on board. “We will fight politically, legally and most importantly peacefully.

31-10-2020||India||Amit Shah to begin two-day visit to West Bengal ahead of 2021 Assembly polls||Ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections in West Bengal, Union Home Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) leader Amit Shah will be on a two-day visit to the state from November 5 to take stock of the party’s organisational matters.According to party sources, Shah will be on a two-day visit to West Bengal on November 5 and 6.The Union Home Minister was earlier scheduled to visit West Bengal on the occasion of Durga puja but the trip was cancelled. During his two-day visit, Shah will be meeting party state leaders, reviewing poll preparations, looking into organisational matters and also discussing the party’s strategy for the upcoming Assembly polls.Earlier this year, Shah had addressed a virtual rally for West Bengal. This will be his first visit to West Bengal after the Covid-19 induced lockdown. He had last visited the state on March 1 amid the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests.West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had recently met Shah in the national capital and discussed the “state of affairs and affairs of state”. Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over several issues.Banerjee had earlier accused Dhankhar of running a “parallel administration” in the state.A few days ago, BJP’s West Bengal unit witnessed a major organisational change, as incumbent state general secretary (organisation) Subrata Chattopadhyay was removed and his deputy Amitava Chakraborty was elevated to the post by the central leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-begin-two-day-visit-to-west-bengal-ahead-of-2021-assembly-polls/story-AiuJKzKaMhFwP7MBYo4a6N.html
31-10-2020||India||Central leadership will decide on participating in Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration: J&K Congress||The Jammu and Kashmir Congress on Saturday said it would take a call on participating in the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) after consultations with the party’s central leadership, even as it asserted that there is a need to have a common platform to fight for the rights of the people of the erstwhile state.Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) president Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who was a signatory to the “Gupkar Declaration” on August 4 last year -- a day before the Centre revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status as accorded under Article 370 of the Constitution -- has skipped two meetings of the alliance, which was given a formal shape recently.Mir said while he was not feeling well when the first meeting of the alliance took place on October 15, the second one on October 24 was called at a short notice and he was not in Srinagar.Speaking to reporters at the party headquarters here after paying floral tributes to former prime minister Indira Gandhi on her 36th death anniversary, which the Congress observed as “Kisan Adhikar Diwas”, Mir said the JKPCC would have consultations with the party’s central leadership over the issue and take a decision after that.“I was not feeling well when the first meeting took place. The second meeting was called at a short notice. Being a national party, the Congress has to discuss such things with its central leadership. When I was told about the meeting just three hours before, I was not even in Srinagar,” he said.Mir said he had asked to defer the meeting of the PAGD as the Congress’s central leadership was busy with the Bihar polls.“I told them to defer the meeting till after November 10 as we had to take on board the Congress’s central leadership, which was busy with the Bihar polls, but they went ahead. So it was not possible for me to attend that meeting on that day,” he said.Asserting that all the signatories to the “Gupkar Declaration” have common concerns as regards the decisions taken by the Centre on August 5 last year, Mir said there can be differences in the intensity of the language “being used while fighting for the cause, but the basic concerns are the same”.“When the next meeting takes place, I will take up the matter with the party’s Kashmir Policy Planning Group and whatever the top leadership decides, I will follow that direction,” he said.Apparently referring to PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s controversial remarks on the national flag, the Congress leader said while it is a political fight for the people of the erstwhile state, “it should not seem, in any language, that we are fighting personal battles with other people of the country”.At her first press conference after her release from detention, Mufti said PDP members would not hoist the national flag unless they are allowed to raise the flag of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.On the amendments to land laws, which allow outsiders to buy land in the Union Territory, Mir said it was “one more betrayal with the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.“They (Centre) had said this on the floor of Parliament that the land and job rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir will be protected. But they have backtracked on their own promises. The Congress party condemns it and will fight this,” he said.Mir said the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are united in their fight for the repeal of such laws and there is a need to have a common platform to fight for their rights.“There could have been differences of opinion in Jammu and Kashmir over the decisions taken before, but I am happy that there is unity on this issue and people are rejecting these laws. The Congress and other like-minded parties should work on a common platform to fight for the repeal of these laws because it concerns the emotions of the people of Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh -- whether Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs or Buddhists,” he said.Asked how the party views the law authorising the Army to declare any area as “strategic”, Mir said such steps are not good for the spirit of democracy.“Giving a direct authority to the Army or other defence forces in any manner is not good in a democratic country. The Army is in support of the civil administration, we, the civil administration, are not under the control of the Army. Therefore, such steps are not good for the spirit of democracy and we have already raised voices against it at different forums,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-leadership-will-decide-on-participating-in-peoples-alliance-for-gupkar-declaration-j-k-congress/story-PgZMJGxA9rcaREISNRj1HO.html
31-10-2020||India||Won’t be surprised if Tejashwi becomes Bihar’s CM, says Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut||Asserting that Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav is creating a substantial challenge against the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Bihar Assembly Elections, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said he will not be surprised if Tejashwi Yadav becomes the Chief Minister of Bihar.“Today, we see in the Bihar election that a youngster who has nobody’s support, whose family members are in jail and agencies like the CBI and the Income Tax are behind him is creating a challenge for others. If Tejaswi Yadav becomes Chief Minister tomorrow, I won’t be surprised because these are the public sentiments,” Raut said addressing mediapersons here.When asked about the Election Commission giving a pass to the BJP’s Covid-19 vaccine promise in Bihar polls, he said the ECI is a branch of the BJP now and nothing else can be expected from it. “One can not expect anything else from them. I believe it was a clear violation,” he said.Raut, who was speaking with mediapersons in an interaction organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists, spoke about several issues.He also attacked the Maharashtra Governor over his recent remark about sending people for help to Sharad Pawar instead of the Maharashtra government.“Pawar Sahab is our leader, if the Governor is also sending people to Pawar Sahab then it’s good and I welcome it. If governor or BJP needs guidance from Sharad Pawar then I would advise Pawar Sahab that he must guide them as well,” he said.On claims that Sharad Pawar is running the Maharashtra government and not Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey, Raut said “Manohar Joshi was the Chief Minister from Shiv Sena in the past and that time also there were allegations that Balasaheb Thackeray runs the government and not Manohar Joshi.”“The NDA was part of that government. But when such a type of government is formed where more than one party is part of the government, an experienced leader is there to advise or guide. If Sharad Pawar guides the government then nobody should have a problem with it. Even PM Modi used to take his advice earlier,” he added.Asked about people meeting Maharashtra Governor instead of the Chief Minister with their grievances, he said, “Meeting governor over questions itself is an insult to Maharashtra. There is a Chief Minister. One must meet relevant ministers to get the work done. Governor does not have administrative rights.”Slamming actor Kangna Ranaut over avoiding Mumbai Police summons, Raut said, “She is an accused in a case now and she must appear before the police. Police have sent her summons and I don’t know why she is avoiding it.”Raut also said if National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah or PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti wants to reimpose Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir with the help of China, then they should be immediately arrested and sent to jail in Andaman prisons.Mufti had earlier targetted the Centre over the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and said she will only raise the tricolour when the “flag of Jammu and Kashmir” is brought back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-be-surprised-if-tejashwi-becomes-bihar-s-cm-says-shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-raut/story-hHqXUT10dlWMiHQn18J3NJ.html
31-10-2020||India||Election Commission had not given me any notice, says Kamal Nath after losing ‘star campaigner’ status||A day after the Election Commission revoked the ‘star campaigner’ status from former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath over multiple violations of Model Code of Conduct, the senior Congress leader said he had not received any notice from the Commission. Reiterating that his ‘item’ comment was not meant to hurt anyone, he, however, questioned whether star campaigner is a post. “Which post or position this star campaigner has? The EC had not given me any notice, nor had it asked me about it. Why they are doing this in the last two days of campaigning only they know,” Kamal Nath told news agency PTI.Also Read: EC revokes ‘star campaigner’ status of Kamal Nath over violationsCampaigning will end on November 1.

The BJP, on the other hand, will retain the state if it wins nine seats as that would make the majority mark of 116 in the 230-member Assembly. During campaigning, Kamal Nath used the term “item” against a woman minister for which his ‘star campaigner’ status has been revoked. Defending his comment, Kamal Nath said when he said ‘item’, he meant agenda. “I was in Lok Sabha for so many years. There it is mentioned in the agenda sheet, item number 1, item number 2... That was on my mind. I did not say it to disrespect anyone,” he said. “Yet, I had said that if someone feels insulted, then I express regret,” Kamal Nath said.Also Read: EC order withdrawing Kamal Nath’s star campaigner status unfair, says Digvijaya SinghNath also claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi did not express disapproval about him in particular after the episode, but only said disrespectful language should not be used against women.On the BJP’s demand for apology from him over the remark, Nath said, “It is not anyone’s demand. I do what I feel is right and proper, because it (disrespecting the woman minister) was never my intention.” The costs of star campaigners’ rallies are borne by the party, and are not added to the election spends of the candidates for whom they campaign. “The Commission has carefully considered the matter and has observed with displeasure that Kamal Nath, despite being a leader of a political party, is repeatedly violating the model code of conduct and breaching the ethical and dignified behaviour,” the Commission said in its order issued on October 30.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-had-not-given-me-any-notice-says-kamal-nath-after-losing-star-campaigner-status/story-Xpk9QZ7s4aIo9ixtT77EuL.html

It added the Union home ministry cannot be restrained from issuing them as per the citizenship law.Anne married Arunoday Singh in 2016 and was issued an OCI card. She received the first notice instructing her to surrender her card after the divorce last year.Anne moved the high court as she has filed an appeal against a family court that granted the divorce. She pleaded she has also separately sought restitution of conjugal rights, and both the matters were pending.The high court noted the OCI card issued in her case is liable to be cancelled upon dissolution of marriage.It noted that the decree of divorce by the Bhopal family court was neither stayed nor suspended. The high court referred to the proceedings at a court in Mumbai’s Bandra and said it related only to a flat in Mumbai and is inconsequential as such.OCI cardholders enjoy benefits like multiple entry visas, exemption from foreigners’ registrations, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-refuses-relief-to-canadian-citizen-whose-oci-card-was-cancelled-after-divorce/story-yRfOhWzMATmn4x3r4ZDEYM.html

31-10-2020||India||BJP to organise business event in West Bengal||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is planning an event in West Bengal in December or January to attract investments to the state and prepare a roadmap for the revival of its economy.“We want to initiate a process of serious dialogue with all potential investors, industrialists, entrepreneurs and start-ups so that we can have a greater idea of what they want. As a political formation, we can respond to that. We hopefully would be able to get this initiative through by December 2020–January 2021. Whether it would be virtual or real, will depend on the Covid-19 situation,” said BJP lawmaker Swapan Dasgupta.The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) dismissed the idea as a gimmick before the 2021 assembly elections.“This is nothing but a poll gimmick. A business summit can only prove to be successful if it is organised by the government – Centre or state. The BJP-led government at the Centre has not been able to attract investment in the country. Instead, it is selling off assets,” said TMC lawmaker Saugata Roy.The assembly elections are scheduled for 2021. A resurgent BJP has emerged as the main rival to the ruling TMC. In the 2019 parliament elections, BJP won 18 out of West Bengal’s 42 seats and TMC 22.Dasgupta said other measures which they want to take up at the event include how to free-up land, which is one of the biggest problems. “We want to explore how the frozen assets can be opened up through a process of proactive intervention by the state and legislation if necessary,” Dasgupta added.A BJP leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the party basically wants to find out the faults and loopholes in TMC’s industrial policy ahead of the elections that could be highlighted.The TMC government’s annual Bengal Global Business Summit is also scheduled to be held in mid-December.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has criticised the annual summits saying more money has been spent in organising them than the investments they have attracted.State finance minister Amit Mitra wrote to Dhankhar saying the annual business conclaves have helped improve the state’s GDP and enhanced investor perception.Dasgupta said they are planning to have consultations in an organised way. “We are not so foolish to call it a sham business summit,” Dasgupta said when asked whether it would be a business summit to counter the state-sponsored event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-organise-business-event-in-west-bengal/story-3FIWNlBSkolPeJe8529UFP.html

31-10-2020||India||HC rejects firm’s petition against IFIN’s decision to declare Rs 100 crore loan as NPA||The Bombay High Court on Thursday rejected petition filed by Wavell Investments Private Limited, challenging the decision of IL&FS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) to declare it’s Rs 100 crore loan account as a non-performing asset (NPA).The bench comprising Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Milind Jadhav refused to believe in Wavell’s claim that it was a victim of the loan scam at IL&FS group and that the petitioner company was used to route the amount from IFIN to an IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd. and the entire amount was passed on to the IL&FS group company.Wavell further claimed that since the loan account was wrongly declared to be an NPA, it was also entitled to the benefit of six-month moratorium extended in view of Covid-19 pandemic.The claim of innocence, however, failed to impress upon the HC. The bench said the claim can be examined from a common-sense point of view.“No prudent commercial entity would enter into a transaction of such a large amount without making necessary enquiries regarding bonafide and legality of the transactions,” said the bench.Also read: ‘BJP’s Covid-19 vaccine promise not a poll violation,’ says ECThe judges said the petitioner claimed to have suffered a loss in this transaction. “The obvious question arises why then the petitioner chose to be part of the transaction? Why would a commercial entity enter into a transaction of Rs 100 crore and then suffer loss willingly,” the judges asked.“The petitioner’s behaviour is contrary to ordinary commercial prudence. It is not possible to believe that the petitioner was not aware of the implications of the transactions,” said the bench.The HC also took into consideration that the interim forensic audit report of February 2019 has indicated that loans worth about Rs 2,270 crore were routed to IL&FS group companies through third parties like the petitioner and the exact role played by these third parties was still unclear. “Considering the totality of the circumstances, the simplistic foundation of the petitioner’s case cannot be accepted. We are not convinced of the bonafide of the petitioner as asserted in the petition,” the HC said while refusing to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-firm-s-petition-against-ifin-s-decision-to-declare-rs-100-crore-loan-as-npa/story-FbvvdEDMoX1wlR0YDGPTRN.html

The ongoing Phase II clinical trial, whose interim results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, tested three different doses of LY-CoV555, a monoclonal antibody derived from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient.“For me, the most significant finding was the reduction in hospitalisations,” said the study’s co-first author, Peter Chen from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the US.“Monoclonal antibodies like this have the potential to reduce the severity of Covid-19 for many patients, allowing more people to recover at home,” Chen said. According to the researchers, monoclonal antibodies work by attaching themselves to a virus and preventing it from replicating. They said LY-CoV555 binds to a particular protein on the novel coronavirus, called the spike protein, which the virus needs to enter human cells and replicate.By preventing the virus from replicating, the scientists said the antibody slows down the replication process, allowing the patient’s own immune system time to kick into gear. “What we’re doing is preventing the virus from causing too much damage early on in the process,” Chen said. “We’re buying the patients time, so that their bodies can start developing their own immunity to fight the virus,” he added.In the study, the patients were given intravenous doses of either 700, 2,800 or 7,000 milligrams of the antibody, or a placebo. “In this interim analysis of a phase 2 trial, one of three doses of neutralising antibody LY-CoV555 appeared to accelerate the natural decline in viral load over time, whereas the other doses had not by day 11,” the scientists wrote in the study.The researchers used a nasopharyngeal swab to test patients’ viral load before administering the antibody and again at several points after administering the drug. They also gave the patients a questionnaire about their subsequent symptoms and treatment. According to the study, nearly 300 patients received the treatment (100 patients per dosage level), and approximately 150 patients received the placebo. Of the three dosage levels, the scientists said the 2,800-milligram dosage was shown to be effective in reducing viral load. By day 11, they said the viral load was substantially diminished for most patients, including those in the placebo arm. However, the researchers said further studies will be needed to validate these results.“The publication of these data in a peer-reviewed journal adds to the growing body of evidence for the potential utility for neutralising antibodies as therapeutics for people recently diagnosed with mild to moderate Covid-19, particularly high-risk patients,” said Ajay Nirula, another co-author of the study. “These data show LY-CoV555 may be effective in treating Covid-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms and the risk of hospitalisation in outpatients,” Nirula said.At day 29, the study noted that hospitalisation rates were only 1.6 per cent in the antibody-treated group, compared with 6.3 per cent in the group that received the placebo. The researchers said the reduction in hospitalisations was seen across all demographic groups, including those in high-risk categories -- adults older than 65 and those with a high body mass index (greater than 35). For high-risk patients, they said the hospitalisation rates were 4.2 per cent in patients treated with the antibody, compared with 14.6 per cent in placebo-treated patients. The safety profile of patients treated with LY-CoV555 was similar to that of placebo-treated patients, the study noted. “We know that Covid-19 is especially hard on the elderly, the obese and people with certain pre-existing health conditions,” Chen said. “Antibody treatments like this may have the most benefits for people in these higher-risk categories,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-antibody-therapy-may-lower-hospitalisations-emergency-visits-study-finds/story-DTomK5t7fltBPRXKY7BtwK.html

But this year, the birds have arrived a week in advance. Low pollution level due to lesser vehicular traffic during the lockdown may be a reason for their early arrival.”Gyaneshwar Chaubey, also from BHU’s zoology department, said that the arrival of the Siberian birds is a very good sign. It means the global pandemic has had no impact on migratory patterns of these birds.Also read: 12 states conduct more Covid-19 tests per million per day than national averageBoatman Shambhu Manjhi is also happy with the arrival of the winged guests. He hopes that the birds will attract more people to the ghats and boatmen will get more passengers.“Every year, after the arrival of these birds, a large number of people visit the ghats to watch them. Many of them take boat rides and offer gram flour sev to the birds. The birds are fond of the sev and gather around the boat as soon as it is offered to them,” he said.Many a foreign tourist used to spend hours on the ghats, clicking pictures of the birds flying and landing on the Ganga, playing with the tourists.Manjhi said that with the arrival of the winged guests, life and activity will return to the ghats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-arrival-of-siberian-winged-visitors-spurs-hopes-of-hustle-bustle-returning-to-varanasi-ghats/story-fw5CRcPsBi5tg1NEIM4PzH.html

The Western Naval Command has also been asked to spread out its assets with Karwar base in Karnataka as focus.The plan follows a security assessment that pitched concern around China’s PLA Navy way over the maritime threat from the Pakistan Navy. Also Watch | Aiming missiles, drones: How new US pact helps India against China in LadakhAlso Read: China draws up a peace plan on Ladakh. India sees right through itIn this context, the national security planners are considering raising another amphibious brigade, one for eastern and western seaboard, for offensive operations in the future. As of now, India has one dedicated amphibious brigade, whose elements are spread between Thiruvananthapuram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands Command in Port Blair. The amphibious forces are specialised in launching a counter-offensive from sea using landing ship tank (LST) vessels such as INS Jalashwa and projecting power in the region and beyond. The planners are considering having one full brigade in Thiruvananthapuram, and the second stationed either at Visakhapatnam or AN Islands.India’s island territories are at the heart of Indian Navy’s operational plan in the Indian Ocean as they dominate the major shipping lanes from Suez Canal and Persian Gulf to South-East and North Asia via Malacca Strait. The Indian Air Force fighter jets, armed with Brahmos missiles, can strike at any moving target in and around Malacca, Sunda or Lombard straits in the worst-case scenario. These three straits are the only way to access the South China Sea from Indian Ocean. Shipping costs mount manifolds if the ships have to be diverted from the Malacca Strait to other two straits.Also Read: Mike Pompeo’s attack on China signals a shift in India’s approachDespite the strategic leverage that the island territories represent, the Indian Navy is still largely focused on Mumbai and Visakhapatnam with the AN Command left to the tri-services headquarters. With the military theatre commands in the offing, both AN Islands and Lakshadweep are going to be the hub of India’s maritime strike capabilities. Lakshadweep lies on the Nine Degree Channel, the most direct route for East Asia-bound ships from the Persian Gulf.Given that India and the US have tied up for Indian Ocean Region with institutionalised tie-ups with American Indo-Pacific, Central Command and African Commands, the QUAD countries will project maritime surveillance and dominance in their region with assets communicating and sharing information through secure military communication channels among air, surface and underwater combatants made possible by the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement signed in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-china-india-will-raise-2nd-amphibious-brigade-to-counter-pla-navy/story-BXOnFMItufSAw0MOPuf8BN.html
31-10-2020||India||12 states conduct more Covid-19 tests per million per day than national average: Data||India’s national average of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests per million per day is 844, with at least 12 states performing more tests per million per day than the national average, shows government data.Testing in Kerala is the highest at 3,258, followed by Delhi with 3,225 tests and followed by Karnataka with 1,550 tests.The World Health Organisation recommends 140 tests per million population per day. “And 35 states and union territories are currently performing more than the WHO recommended number, which is enough to say that as far as testing goes, India is doing fairly adequate Covid-19 testing,” said a health ministry official, who did not want to be named.Other states and territories that are performing more tests per million per day than the national average are Andhra Pradesh (1,418), Bihar (1,093), Odisha (1,072), Goa (1,058), Jharkhand (994), Jammu & Kashmir (984), Telangana (947), Tamil Nadu (936), and Haryana (863).India has tested 107 million cumulative samples for Covid-19 so far, of which 81,36,232 have returned positive.On January 23, the first Covid-19 test was conducted in India at ICMR- National Institute of Virology in Pune using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).On average, India performs a little over one million tests to determine Covid-19 daily. It has the capacity of performing at least 1.5 million tests in a day across 2,000 labs in the country.One of the reasons for the increased scale of testing has the introduction of rapid antigen-based testing on June 14. “Wherever mass deployment of tests is needed such as containment zones, migrant camps, quarantine centres, etc, rapid antigen tests come in handy. True positives are 100% confirmed, and for symptomatic negatives, ICMR has recommended repeating the test using RT-PCR for confirmation. The rule was also revised later for asymptomatic negatives asking this category of people to be monitored for a couple of days for symptoms, and those who show symptoms must be made to undergo a Covid-19 test. This way we manage to minimise the risk of missing infected cases,” said an ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-states-conduct-more-covid-19-tests-per-million-per-day-than-national-average-data/story-FwgHkfM2veRIeKvnaRracM.html

The move has triggered concerns among the party’s lawmakers many of whom are up in arms against the party leadership and may seek Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress’s tickets, they added.BSP chief Mayawati has started preparations for the elections by revamping the party’s organisation. She has also started looking for new candidates and is collecting feedback about the performance of the party’s 18 lawmakers, many of whom have been told they are unlikely to get tickets.Seven BSP lawmakers, who were on Thursday suspended for opposing the nomination of Ramji Gautam for the Rajya Sabha election, have been told they will not be renominated.The lawmakers have said they have been humiliated and left with little option but to oppose Gautam’s nomination. They have met SP leaders to get tickets for the assembly polls.BSP coordinators are holding meetings in their constituencies and the rebels have not called for them while the probable candidates have been introduced to the party cadre.The BSP is expected to take a call on getting into an alliance for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections after the polls are over in Bihar, where it is a part of the Grand United Secular Front (GUSF). The GUSF comprises Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Samajwadi Janata Dal Democratic, Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and Janvadi Party Socialist.Some parties in the alliance also have a presence in Uttar Pradesh and want the GUSF to contest the polls in the state too.“Fearing that new alliance might damage their prospects, the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and BJP have launched an attack on the BSP,” said a BSP leader.Shaukat Ali, the AIMIM’s Uttar Pradesh unit president, said the GUSF should contest elections in Uttar Pradesh too to stop the BJP from returning to power.SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar said the GUSF alliance partners will hold a meeting for continuing the alliance for the Uttar Pradesh assembly election as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mayawati-begins-work-to-regain-lost-ground-in-up/story-f3L8VY1IK2SwHA1fhZUGvK.html

Despite every effort, with every passing day, the chances of recovery are getting lower. We are giving our best to get him better. Let’s hope for the best,” Dr Arindam Kar, who is leading the team of doctors treating the actor, told media late on Friday. Chatterjee, 85, had to be hospitalised on October 6 after testing positive for Covid-19. He has been in the ICU for more than 20 days and on ventilator support since October 26. He had shown marginal improvement on Thursday and on Friday his condition was stated to be stable but critical. His cardiac functions were good and his kidney functions started bouncing back as antibiotics were working well, doctors said. “From Saturday, we would try to come with some strategies to improve his neurological parameters. We would try our best to reverse the encephalopathy,” Dr Kar added. One of the most celebrated actors in Bengal, Chatterjee has received many awards and honours, including the Padma Bhushan, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, National Awards, and Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna. He is best known for his collaboration with Oscar-winner Satyajit Ray and the Feluda series.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-fighting-against-time-to-revive-soumitra-chatterjee/story-zVd4lMu4jWHoyZ45jIFjLP.html

31-10-2020||India||Govt lays out norms for using remote sensing devices for monitoring vehicular emission||The Centre has drafted guidelines for the installation of remote sensing devices to monitor on-road vehicular exhaust emissions, collect data, and recommend pollution thresholds for different vehicles and fuel types.A remote sensing device measures exhaust emission through absorption spectroscopy without interfering with the vehicle or its driver. The device comprises a light source and a detector that is placed on the side of the road or at a height to transmit a laser beam. The beam measures the exhaust fumes remotely through spectroscopy when vehicles cross its light path.The measurement of exhaust emissions from vehicles during normal, on-road operations is key to any effective system for controlling air pollution. Remote sensing can alter the way emissions are currently monitored from on-road vehicles and allow more efficient screening of highly polluting vehicles. It is essential for detecting discrepancies between certification-test performance and actual real-world vehicle emissions.Vehicular emissions are one of the biggest contributors to PM2.5 pollutants, which are fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters that are generally 2.5 microns, or about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair. India recorded the world’s highest annual average concentration of PM 2.5 exposure in its air in 2019, according to the State of Global Air 2020 (Soga 2020) report released this month.The norms for installation of remote sensing devices come in the backdrop of a directive issued by the Supreme Court in 2018 on the recommendations of the Environment (Pollution and Prevention) Control Authority (EPCA), instructing the Delhi government to explore remote sensing technology for on-road screening of polluting vehicles.“We have drafted the guidelines to help state governments set up these devices as it is a new technology. They can be installed along roadsides and capture the emissions of the vehicles. It will be instrumental in analysing the emission of vehicles on road. A pilot had been done too after the directions of the Supreme Court,” an official said, requesting anonymity.The transport ministry has drafted guidelines specifying the minimum technical and performance requirements for the remote sensing equipment. HT has reviewed a copy of the guidelines, prepared by the Automotive Industry Standards Committee (AISC). The standards need to be approved by the permanent CMVR Technical Standing Committee (CTSC). CMVR is short for Central Motor Vehicles Rules.After approval by CTSC, the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune, being the secretariat of the AISC, will publish the standards.“The matter of control of in-use vehicle emissions was deliberated at the 60th Meeting of Standing Committee on Implementation of Emission Legislation, held on 22nd August 2019 and subsequently an AIS panel under the Chairmanship of Director-ICAT was constituted with a focus to finalise technical guidance on remote sensing equipment, remote sensing data reporting which specifies design, construction, networking and data sharing of the motor vehicle and recommend polluter thresholds for a different vehicle and different fuel types,” the draft guidelines say.“In the 61st Meeting of Standing Committee on Implementation of Emission Legislation held on 13th February 2020, it was directed to consider polluter thresholds based on prevalent emission norms and in the absence of authentic data for these thresholds, the Committee had agreed to consider the first year as monitoring phase to arrive at threshold values. This standard is technology-neutral and does not restrict any arrangement for implementation based on the recommendations for implementing of remote sensing of emissions of in-use vehicles for on-road monitoring as per the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the EPCA Report No 99 dated 26th July 2019,” the guidelines add.The remote sensing devices will be fitted with emission analysers. The devices will be linked to the central vehicle database, Vahan, and also to each vehicle’s FASTag, which allows electronic toll collection at highway plazas, according to the draft guidelines.“The RSD [remote sensing device] must be GPS/IRNSS enabled – to identify the location of the device and communication with the authorized servers for data exchange [real-time data transfer]. There must be a system to capture the image of the registration number of the vehicle at a rate of 99% or greater of the vehicles passing through the RSD measurement location,” the guidelines say.GPS stands for Global Positioning System and IRNSS for Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System.The system must also be equipped with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or any other suitable technology to identify the registration numbers of vehicles. It will also have a FASTag reader for mapping the registration.The pollution thresholds must be decided categorically while differentiating from the following parameters: category of the vehicle, the emission norms (Bharat Stage), and fuel type. A monitoring phase shall be established to capture vehicular emissions and define accurate polluter thresholds, the guidelines say. The monitoring phase will determine threshold limits for different vehicles, different emission norms and different fuel types with a focus on vehicles of category M (passenger vehicles) and N (goods vehicles).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-lays-out-norms-for-using-remote-sensing-devices-for-monitoring-vehicular-emission/story-5qsnRVGJgiVc0lkW9mLr7L.html

The organisation’s statement comes close on the heels of reports that the Centre was engaged in deliberations over the two key demands of the NSCN-IM, which was stalling the negotiations.“There is no scope provided to have separate talk on Naga flag and constitution. By having separate talk on flag and constitution, GoI is sending a wrong signal that is not in sync with the Framework Agreement,” NSCN-IM said in a statement.Pointing out that the framework agreement, signed between the group and the government of India in 2015, embraces the Naga flag and constitution, the NSCN-IM asserted that the Centre should not undo its commitment and backtrack from the agreement by distorting what has been agreed upon.Under the given situation where the focus of the talks is now mainly on Naga flag and constitution, the organisation stated it was critical to dwell deeper into the framework agreement lest reckless interpretation comes into play. The outfit remarked that in the ongoing talks, with both sides respecting each other’s position, shared sovereignty and defined competencies, wherein it was defined how certain part of Naga sovereignty and vice versa was to be shared with the union of India.“With this arrangement, we are confident that it will provide for an enduring inclusive new relationship of peaceful coexistence of the two entities,” the statement read.The NSCN-IM said it should be understood that the Framework Agreement that speaks of the unique history of the Naga people and their sovereign independence identity embraces the flag and the constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naga-flag-and-constitution-should-be-part-of-ongoing-talks-nscn-im/story-5Nf9p5aW5aRIV3O0eAH2LI.html

The All India Station Masters Union (AISMU) had said on Thursday they have been protesting the move from October 7 and the decision to organise a token hunger strike was taken after their demands remained unattended.They demanded that the government withdraw an order which stated that all officials above the basic pay of Rs 43,600 per month were not to be paid night duty allowance. “We demand that the sealing of the allowance and the orders to recover the night duty allowance already made since 2017 be withdrawn, a Rs 50 lakh insurance be provided to the line staff and the privatisation and corporatisation of railways be stopped. We will hold a 12-hour hunger strike, which will be the fourth phase of our protest,” AISMU said in a statement. The railway ministry has said that as per Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) instructions in July 2020, all officials who have the basic pay of above Rs 43,600 are not to be paid the night duty allowance. “The directives have already been implemented in other ministries. Implementation of the directives of DoPT is in line with the implementation all across the government. Nothing exclusive is being implemented for Railways. In government, all employees are treated on par across the board on the basis of the basic salary. As far as the issue of recovery of the Night Duty Allowance, the matter is being examined,” a railway spokesperson said according to news agency PTI.The All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) in an official note to the chairman and CEO of the Railway Board had earlier sought withdrawal of upper pay ceiling for entitlement of Night Duty Allowance (NDA). Night Duty Allowance is claimed by the Essential Train Running, Operating and Maintenance Staff for performing night duty, work of whom revolves around train operation, safety, maintenance etc under 7th Pay Commission. AIRF said the upper ceiling of Rs 43,600 for entitlement of night duty allowance by the railway staff be removed immediately.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railway-station-masters-to-protest-sealing-in-night-duty-allowance-work-on-empty-stomach/story-9VIcDhd0Mm0WG4darHhxYL.html

Further investigation is on,” he confirmed.He added that Pandey created a letter pad of the trust and used a picture of PM Modi on the letterhead.A senior police officer said Ajay Pandey, a resident of Kabir Nagar area in Varanasi, registered the ‘Adarsh Narendra Damodar Das Modi Jankalyankari Trust’, Varanasi, on July 14. Pandey associated himself with the trust as chief manager/trustee/founder and made some others its members. The so-called members included Pradeep Kumar Singh, Sonu Kumar Gupta, Vikas Mishra, Priya Srivastava, Anil, Ranjita Singh, Shahbaz Khan (all from Varanasi) and Avinash Singh and Rabindranath Pandey from Ballia.The police officer said Pandey wrote a letter to the Varanasi district magistrate on July 24 and July 31, asking him to identify and allocate around 190 bigha land for the Adarsh Narendra Damodar Das Modi Antarrashtriya (International) Vishwavidyalaya to be set up in Varanasi under the trust. Pandey signed the letter as the trustee, the police officer added.Also read: AIIMS to submit proposal for phase 3 trials of Covaxin next weekIn the meantime, he wrote another letter to the district magistrate on October 29, asking him to allocate the land for the university and extend help in its construction.The police officer said that as the matter reached the district magistrate, he suspected something was amiss and instructed the registrar to probe the issue.On the DM’s instructions, sub-registrar-2 (Sadar) Harish Chaturvedi conducted a probe and found that Pandey was cheating prominent people in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He informed the DM who then instructed Chaturvedi to lodge a case with police immediately.Chaturvedi filed a complaint at Cantt police station, following which a case under Sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of document), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the IPC was registered against 10 people, the officer said.A person privy to the matter said Pandey wrote letters to several MLAs and MPs, asking them to provide funds for the Adarsh Narendra Damodar Das Modi Antarrashtriya Vishwavidyalaya to be set up under the trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-booked-for-registering-fake-trust-in-pm-s-name-4-taken-into-custody/story-vEnO5Wx3CnTMfS6D3hkHVM.html
31-10-2020||India||Hurriyat Conference to protest against new land laws in J-K today; calls for complete shutdown||The Hurriyat Conference has called for peaceful protests on Saturday against the new land laws in Jammu and Kashmir. In a statement, Hurriyat leaders said the government of India had been issuing incessant anti-people orders at frequent intervals to intimidate and psychologically torture the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) reiterates its principled stand of engagement and dialogue among stakeholders for resolution of the Kashmir dispute. The Union was attempting to undermine all attempts of pursuing a peaceful resolution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue,” the statement said.While denouncing the “incessant anti-people orders” issued by the government of India to “intimidate and psychologically torture” the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Hurriyat said this “imperial approach” was bound to fail. It further stated that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are not ‘dumb driven cattle’ who will ‘withstand assaults upon the motherland.’The statement has also asked people to hold peaceful shutdown to register their resentment against the laws and also demanded their immediate withdrawal.On October 28, the Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Congress party joined the other mainstream parties in opposing the new land laws notified by the Centre for the Union territory. “The Congress party rejects the new land laws and vows to fight for the protection of people’s rights,” JKPCC president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said while addressing a public gathering in the Gurez area of Bandipora district. He termed the new land laws as an assault on the rights of people and said the Congress party would not accept such “anti-J&K decisions” by the Centre.The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, an amalgam of various mainstream parties in Jammu and Kashmir including the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had also condemned the amendments to the land laws and pledged to fight it on all fronts.On October 27, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) amended several Jammu and Kashmir land laws and introduced some new one to allow any person from across India to buy land in the region.

France is the first stop of Shringla’s three-nation tour that will also take him to Germany and the UK and his interactions in all three countries are aimed at boosting relations in a wide range of areas. India has already condemned the terror attacks in Paris and Nice and backed President Emmanuel Macron for his stance against radical Islam. During his interaction with a cross-section of leading members of the academia, media and think-tanks, Shringla said India stands by France following the attacks of the past week in Paris and Nice. The two countries cannot pretend such actions “come from lone wolf initiatives and misguided individuals”, as there is “an infrastructure of radicalism, including its online manifestations, that comes into play”, he said. These forces also have the backing of states and organised institutions and the two countries cannot and should not postpone a coordinated and definitive response, he added. As Shringla began his two-day visit to France, a knife-wielding man killed three people during a terror attack at a church in the city of Nice. Samuel Paty, a professor who used controversial caricatures of Prophet Mohammed from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in a class on freedom of expression, was beheaded in an attack in Paris on October 16. During Friday’s interaction, Shringla described France as India’s oldest strategic partner and a steadfast friend in several domains, ranging from terrorism to global warming, maritime security to sustainable development, and norms-based international institutions to technology and innovation. Following the stressed on the international system due to the Covid-19 pandemic, multilateralism needs to be reformed, he said. As instinctive multilateralists, India and France have to take on responsibilities together, especially at the UN Security Council, he added. India and France also recognise the dangers of climate change with clarity and consistency, and their work on the International Solar Alliance and the Paris agreement are testimony to this, Shringla said. The same globalist philosophy should be taken to new areas such as cyberspace or the Indo-Pacific, since India and France are forces of stability working for the greater common good, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-attacks-in-france-not-result-of-lone-wolf-initiatives-harsh-shringla/story-mhQBFI1HDmjabrnBv9TIoL.html

These lady passengers are briefed about all precautions to be taken during the journey and told to dial 182 in case they face or see any problem in the coach,” according to an official statement. The RPF team will collect the seat numbers of the ladies and convey them to stoppages en-route. The platform duty RPF personnel at the stopping stations en-route will keep watch over the concerned coaches and berths and if the need arises, they will interact with the lady passengers. The RPF teams will collect the feedback from the identified lady passengers at the destination point. The feedback is then analysed and corrective action will be taken accordingly. If some distress call comes from a train covered under the ‘Meri Saheli’ initiative, the disposal of the call will be monitored at the level of senior officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railway-police-force-launches-meri-saheli-for-security-of-women-in-trains/story-5zYaOJ0g17ftzcxlwCgehK.html

31-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Wednesday, October 28, the world saw another grim coronavirus disease (Covid-19) milestone. The number of new cases recorded that day crossed half a million — the first time this was happening. Both the New York Times database and worldometers.info show this. They also show that the trend continued on Thursday. According to the NYT database, the world saw 524,554 cases that day; worldometers.info put the number higher, at 545,936. To be sure, the World Health Organization’s database shows that while the number of daily cases is nudging half a million, it is yet to cross it.The continuing surge of the pandemic highlights another interesting feature: a decline in cases in one region has always been more than offset by a surge elsewhere, with the result that there has been no let-up in the march of numbers. To elaborate, in mid-March, Europe was driving the numbers; between then and mid-August, the Americas took over this role, with some help from Asia (mostly India); then, between mid-August and mid-September, Asia was largely the driver, with some help (albeit, very little) from Europe; starting mid-September, Europe was back in the driver’s seat, initially on its own, and then with the Americas. There have been similar ebbs and flows within the regions too, but the overall numbers have continued to increase.Also Read| Covid-19: Third American wave breaking all recordsMost of the cases continue to be concentrated in the northern hemisphere, and the onset of winter will only make things worse — as it was expected to. Data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center shows that things are already getting worse (the seven-day average of infections is trending upward) in nine of the 10 most-affected countries. India (now pushed to the third spot in terms of daily cases by France) is the only one where they seem to be getting better — the country is currently at or towards the end of the first wave of the pandemic, and the second wave is yet to start. The other nine countries (where things are getting worse) are: the US, France, Spain, Brazil, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Russia, and Poland. Seven of these (including Russia) are in Europe; two are in the Americas. In most European countries, the raging second wave of the pandemic has seen daily case numbers reach new highs — just as they have in the US, which is seeing its third wave (on Thursday, the country crossed 90,000 daily cases, and looks set to be the first to record in excess of 100,000 cases a day).Unfortunately, the ebb and flow of Covid-19 cases across regions does not appear to be following a temporal cycle. Instead, this is likely to be a function of the infection rate itself, and the response (in the form of restrictions), with a resurgence in cases usually being preceded by significant opening up. For instance, the UK’s ongoing second wave may have been caused (at least in part) by the country’s “eat out to help out” scheme where the government subsidised, through August, meals in pubs and restaurants. According to a study by the University of Warwick, reported by Reuters on Friday, “between 8% and 17% of newly detected infection clusters could be linked to the scheme during that period”. The link, the study found, was very strong. “Areas where there was a high uptake of the scheme saw an increase in new infections about a week after it started,” the Reuters story added. And “the research said the same areas saw a decline in new infections a week [after] the discount offer finished”.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage In theory, this would mean someone could use mobile phones and the Google Mobility Index to actually build a predictive model of where cases can be expected to spike -- and at a very localised level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-QCsqWdT8H9GAQJUKYPVcHI.html
31-10-2020||India||Alarm over new Covid-19 cases in Delhi; Centre may step in||Covid-cases in Delhi surged to a new high on Friday even as a concerned home ministry has called for a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue.For the fourth day in a row, new Covid-19 infections in Delhi on Friday set yet another single-day record even as the positivity rate continued to rise at alarming levels with a tenth of all tests in the past 24 hours returning positive results, highlighting what is clearly the third and worst wave yet of the outbreak in the Capital.Worried about the continuous spike in Delhi’s infections during the ongoing festive season, and at the start of winter, the Union home ministry has called a special review meeting with Delhi government officials on Monday to check the spiralling rate of Covid-19 cases in the Capital, people familiar with the matter told HT.  The meeting, chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, will take stock of the situation and suggest concrete steps to the Delhi government to address the issue. Apart from Bhalla, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul, and other senior central officials will interact with Delhi health officials, the people cited above added.Also Read: Set up panels for Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, govt tells statesThis will be the second intervention by the Centre into rising Covid cases in Delhi. In July, Union home minister Amit Shah held a round of meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other officials after which, testing, contact tracing and sero-surveillance were ramped up in Delhi with the two governments working in coordination.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to messages and calls seeking comment on the matter.Cases in Delhi have risen to unprecedented highs in the past week. With 5,891 new cases on Friday, Delhi set a new record for the highest single-day new infections for the fourth day in a row, pushing the total number of cases to 381,644.On average, Delhi has reported 4,749 cases every day in the past week, which means that the current trajectory is far above the peak of what is considered the second wave (4,174 average cases reported for week ending September 17). In contrast, cases in the rest of the country have steadily declined through at least the past month, making Delhi one of the only two regions (besides West Bengal) currently witnessing a peak.What is alarming experts, though, is the rise in the Union territory’s positivity rate. The seven-day average of positivity rate has risen more than 3.5 percentage points in just three weeks – from 5.3% for the week ending October 8 to 8.8% on Thursday. Experts stressed the need for the Delhi government to further increase testing and said that a fast-rising positivity rate is an indicator that a region is not testing adequately. “Delhi is witnessing a severe spike in cases for the third time. A specific study should be conducted in the city at this juncture. There are also studies that suggest that air pollution contributes to transmission of the virus. That makes the situation in Delhi much worse. The number of tests being conducted needs to be further scaled up,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore.Also Read: AIIMS to submit proposal for phase 3 trials of Covaxin next weekPollution levels in Delhi have been worsening recently with the air quality index hovering dangerously close to the ‘severe’ zone in the past 10 days. Many international research papers have found that air pollution worsens Covid-19 mortality rates. A study published on Tuesday in the journal Cardiovascular Research had said that around 17% of Covid-19 deaths in India could be linked to long-term exposure to air pollution, higher than the 15% seen on average across the world. A study from the Harvard University has also shown that with every 1 μg increase in PM2.5 long term exposure, Covid-19 mortality went up by 8%.HT reported on Monday that the data showed the tests need to be scaled up now irrespective of the daily volume since the positivity rate is well over the acceptable 5%-7% level, and rising.Many European nations, such as Germany and France, which are seeing a second wave of cases, have all announced restrictions over the past week, especially keeping in mind the festive season. The Delhi government, however, ruled out the possibility of re-imposing any form of restrictions that were put in place during the lockdown.“We have seen a lockdown. But that has not been able to stop transmission of the virus. People will have to strictly adhere to social distancing and always wear masks. People should consider wearing masks as a vaccine until real Covid-19 vaccines are available for the masses. Masks can save us to a large extent from the winter pollution too,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday.On Thursday, Jain attributed the surge in cases to the festive season and said that a “change” in the administration’s contact tracing strategy was helping identify more patients. “We have changed our strategy by strengthening our contact tracing system now. This is why the positivity rate is increasing. So, now we are trying to test 5-7 contacts per Covid case to break the cycle of infection.” Even at this rate, however, Delhi’s contact tracing target would remain considerably short of what experts say is ideal. At the Union ministry’s health briefing on Tuesday, Dr Paul said that “contact tracing can only be considered successful if at least 10 contacts” of every positive case are traced and tested by the local governments.Experts said the rise in cases is a reflection of the fact that with the festive season and winter here, people are not taking Covid-specific precautions.“Many people are venturing outdoors and participating in gatherings in the light of the festive season. And they are clearly not taking adequate safety measures. That is definitely leading to increased transmission of the virus. This demands innovative awareness campaigns that contribute to behavioural change. Also, the winter months witness more respiratory illnesses and Covid-19 is one. That is contributing to the numbers too,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital.

31-10-2020||India||Air quality still ‘very poor’; watchdog will take shape next week||The newly constituted Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas — formed through a Central ordinance on Thursday to tackle the bad air crisis in the region — will be appointed next week by a selection committee that includes four Cabinet ministers and the Cabinet secretary, according to people familiar with the matter.The average air quality index on Friday for Delhi was 374, in the “very poor” category — a level at which doctors recommend reduced physical activity for healthy individuals, and vulnerable people face problems.The selection panel for CAQM — Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, commerce minister Piyush Goyal, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, health minister Harsh Vardhan (who is in the committee in his capacity as the science and technology minister), and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba — will pick six full-time members including the chairman of the commission, who will be a former secretary to the Government of India or chief secretary in a state government.Two of the other full-time members need to be former joint secretaries to the Union government, and three must be technical experts with experience in tackling the air pollution problem, according to the guidelines laid down in the ordinance. The other 12 members will be ex-officio — representing the states that are part of the NCR region, and from the central pollution board and other Central scientific agencies. CAQM can also co-opt additional members from the ministries of road transport, power; urban affairs, petroleum,agriculture and commerce, and representatives from industry associations.“Framing of rules for the functioning of the Commission and selection of members will take place simultaneously at the earliest, possibly within a week,” said Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, responding to HT’s query.Senior environment ministry officials on condition of anonymity said they are not aware of who the selection panel has in mind for the six full-time positions. “It is entirely the discretion of the selection panel which includes the cabinet ministers,” an official said. With the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) disbanded, and the Commission yet to be constituted, no body is mandated to take and implement region-wise decisions to tackle a spike in pollution levels in the interim.To be sure, however, Epca in 2016 devised a Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to tackle air pollution in the NCR region, and several measures under the scheme are currently in place.“The decision on what measures are to be implemented in the intermediate period will be taken only if the need arises. The Commission is likely to be appointed next week. The full-time members will be selected by the selection committee and the ex-officio members will be selected by concerned organisations or state governments,” additional secretary Ravi Agarwal said.“We are aware that air pollution can peak during this time. In the absence of Epca and the Commission, decisions may be taken by the [Central and state] pollution control boards,” said another official, who asked not to be named.“The irony is that the petition in SC was filed seeking monitoring by SC of the air pollution and stubble burning situation in addition to SC. Now we have situation where EPCA is gone, the one-man committee to oversee stubble fires is also gone and the Commission has not been constituted yet. We only have an ordinance. Even for the Commission to prepare and start functioning will take time. What was the hurry to bring in an Ordinance?” asked Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer.The Delhi government had already expressed its scepticism about the move, with state’s environment minister Gopal Rai saying on Thursday: “The powers to monitor and enforce pollution control norms were with Epca, and are also with our state-level body, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the central body, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). But unless there is action on the ground, no agency can help.”Punjab cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said the setting up of commission is unjustified and overrides the powers of states, adding that the Centre “needs a rethink”.Officials in the Uttar Pradesh government welcomed the move. “The ordinance and the commission are the steps in the right direction. But we have not yet received a copy of it. Whatever little we know, we have come to know through media. Once we get the copy, the government will study it minutely ...We will have internal meetings. Only then will we be able to comment and start playing our role,” said Sudhir Garg, UP principal secretary (environment).Some experts have suggested that the Commission — both in its composition and functions — may be too centralised.“There is no doubt that Epca long outlived its utility. Unfortunately, it is being replaced by a body which is bureaucratic and has similar limitations as EPCA. Instead of including members from other states, it has excluded significant stakeholders — the most prominent being the farmers and their representative groups,” said lawyer Dutta.Farm fires in Punjab and Haryana contributed to 19% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 load, according to modelling by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) under Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). Every year, pollution levels spike in October and November in Delhi when meteorological conditions change—winds become northwesterly and wind speed reduces leading to accumulation of pollutants closer to the surface. The contribution of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana to the northwest of Delhi adds to the local emission sources leading to toxic air in Delhi. “The composition of the selection committee reflects a myopic approach to air pollution. It does not have representation of key ministries such as agriculture, health and urban development. The composition also throws up deeper issues of federalism and democratic decision-making. It has no representation from state governments that the law is seeking to regulate, nor does it have scope of independent expertise that can weigh in on the selection,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-still-very-poor-watchdog-will-take-shape-next-week/story-40Ff2r8TqRtoZDaowSa4dM.html

The victim’s family lodged a complaint against five people, of which three have been arrested. Kori (45) was married to Bhadoiya village head Chhotka Devi. His son Surendra Kumar told reporters that Kori had gone to a market to purchase vegetables on Thursday evening but did not return home. Later, he was found with serious burns at a property belonging to one Krishna Kumar Tiwari. Surendra said his father had a strong base in the area, which had perturbed his opponents. He has been killed over electoral rivalry, news agency PTI quoted Kumar as saying. The victim’s son claimed that his father had taken names of four people, who stuffed a piece of cloth into his mouth and set him on fire after beating him up.On the complaint of the family against five people, an FIR was registered.

In western Uttar Pradesh’s Deoband town, protesters pasted photos of the French president on the road between Jama Masjid and Bada Jiya-ul-Haq locality. Condemning his comments, the protesters also took out a march and handed over a memorandum -- addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind -- to the Deoband sub divisional magistrate of Deoband urging the central government to lodge a protest with the French government. In a similar demonstration in Maharashtra’s capital city, Mumbai, posters were found pasted on a busy road in Bhendi Bazaar late on Thursday. The posters were later removed. Posters calling for boycott of France and the French president also surfaced in a locality in Gujarat’s old Vadodara city and were later removed by police on Friday, an official said. According to Gujarat police, the posters, carrying Macron’s photograph and the words “Boycott Macron” and “Boycott France”, were pasted by some unidentified persons on a small stretch of a road at Nawab Wada. In a suspected act of terrorism, a woman was beheaded and two other people were killed in Nice on Thursday. In a separate incident, a gun-wielding man was shot dead by police in French city Avignon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attacks and offered support to France. “I strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks in France... India stands with France in the fight against terrorism,” PM had tweeted on Thursday. On October 16, Samuel Paty, a French teacher, was beheaded for allegedly showing a cartoon of Prophet Mohammad in his class. At the mourning ceremony, Macron said France would not “renounce the caricatures”, inviting sharp responses from Muslim-majority nations, including Pakistan and Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-break-out-against-macron-in-up-maha-guj/story-eb1k1YHgG3yTBGiHEPTlBI.html

In case of J&K a unilateral decision was taken by the Centre which is not acceptable to people of J&K and Ladakh.”Omar said that the delegation travelled to Drass and Kargil on the advice of Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, president Farooq Abdullah and vice president Mehbooba Mufti to seek opinion from the people. Later, in a tweet, Omar said that people of Drass and Kargil have endorsed the agenda. “Warmly received by the people of Drass, who in one voice endorsed the agenda of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration.” The delegation also held a closed-door meeting with the leaders of the Kargil Democratic Alliance in Kargil.“Delegation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration met leaders of the Kargil Democratic Alliance in Kargil this afternoon. All of us united that the pre August 5th, 2019 position must be restored,” Omar Abdullah tweeted.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti welcomed the visit of delegation to Kargil. “Glad to see all of you at Kargil to engage with the people. High time someone reached out to them since they too have grave apprehensions about the future,” she tweeted.PDP youth president Waheed ur Rehman Parra, who was part of the delegation, said that multitude of narratives and political fractures in Ladakh reflects unacceptability of August 5. “There is an increased uncertainty and insecurity among people which haunts them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-of-us-have-united-to-restore-special-status-of-jammu-and-kashmir-omar-abdullah-in-ladakh/story-g60c1QEuwbvfRVMU12aHUP.html
31-10-2020||India||Jammu and Kashmir admin prevents Farooq Abdullah from attending prayers: National Conference||Former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah was allegedly prevented from leaving his house on Friday to offer prayers at a holy shrine in Srinagar to mark the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, the National Conference (NC) said, terming the incident a violation of his fundamental rights. The party alleged that the Jammu & Kashmir administration has deployed scores of police personnel, blocking the exit to Abdullah’s residence to prevent him from leaving for Hazratbal. “J-K administration has blocked the residence of party president Dr Farooq Abdullah and stopped him from offering prayers at Dargah Hazratbal. JKNC condemns this infringement of the fundamental right to pray, especially on the auspicious occasion of Milad Un Nabi SAW,” the NC said in a tweet on its official Twitter handle.Farooq Abdullah, who represents Srinagar in the Lok Sabha, was supposed to visit the Hazratbal shrine, on the banks of the Dal Lake, to pray there on the occasion of Milad-un-Nabi, which marks the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad and it is observed in the month of Rabi’ al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar.An office-bearer of the NC familiar with the matter said the administration informed the 83-year-old parliamentarian that he would not be allowed to go due to security reasons. No official from the administration responded to the requests for comments on the matter.Political leaders in Jammu & Kashmir condemned the action. Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said the move exposed the administration’s “deep paranoia”. “Preventing Farooq sahab from offering prayers on Milad Un Nabi SAW at Hazratbal exposes GOI’s deep paranoia and their iron fist approach towards JK. It’s a gross violation of our rights and is highly condemnable,” she tweeted. Farooq Abdullah is also the head of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration’s (PAGD) -- a new multi-party political grouping in the Valley that seeks the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, which until last August gave special status and privileges to the region, and for the restoration of the state of Jammu & Kashmir, which has been divided into the Union territories of J&K and Ladakh -- and Mufti is the vice-president.In a statement, PAGD spokesperson Sajad Lone criticized the UT administration, saying its actions infringed upon Abdullah’s religious rights. “We strongly condemn the actions of the state administration, which is tantamount to interference in the religious rights of Dr. Farooq Abdullah. This marks a new low in the curtailment of the fundamental rights of the people of J&K. We demand that the blockade be removed so that Dr. Farooq Sahib is able to perform his religious duties.”There was a controversy surrounding remarks by Abdullah earlier this month, when he suggested that “China’s might” may help with the restoration of J&K’s laws and status to what they were before August 5, 2019..He was recently questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the alleged misappropriation of funds of the Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association. Abdullah, who was the president of the association when the alleged irregularities took place, has denied any wrongdoings, and his party ahs described this as “political vendetta”. State spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party, Altaf Thakur, said that Farooq Abdullah has been giving statements which are threat to security. “At Hazratbal there are large number of people assembled for prayers and due to security issues he (Farooq Abdullah) must have been prevented from going there which is a good step.”Javeed Ahmad, a political analyst, said: “There are large number of gatherings at Hazratbal on Friday and Farooq Abdullahs speech could have been problem for government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-admin-prevents-farooq-abdullah-from-attending-prayers-national-conference/story-wofa8FdzWsVM1AoFqKWajP.html

Justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi passed the order on a petition seeking directions to the police and the woman’s father not to interfere in their peaceful married life filed by Priyanshi alias Samreen and her partner.The petition mentioned that the couple married in July this year but that the family members of the woman were interfering in the married life of the couple.Justice Tripathi observed, “The court has perused the record in question and found that the petitioner has converted from her religion on 29.6.2020 and just after one month they have solemnized their marriage, which clearly reveals to this court that the said conversion has taken place only for the purpose of marriage.” In this case, the woman was a Muslim and converted to Hinduism. The court referred to Noor Jahan Begum case, a 2014 judgment of the Allahabad high court which ruled that conversion just for the purpose of marriage is unacceptable.The court dismissed the writ petition. In the Noor Jahan Begum case, the high court dismissed a batch of writ petitions praying for protection of a married couple where the woman converted from Hinduism to Islam. The issue considered in the said case was “whether conversion of religion of a Hindu girl at the instance of a Muslim boy, without any knowledge of Islam or faith and belief in Islam and merely for the purpose of marriage (Nikah) is valid”. The court at that time answered the question in negative while relying on teachings of the Quran.The court also referred to a Supreme Court case that said conversion to Islam can be valid only when done of a person’s “free will” and “belief in the oneness of God” and not for “creating a ground for some claim of right”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/religious-conversion-only-for-sake-of-marriage-not-valid-allahabad-hc/story-mxyCxzYU4RP0gzHPpbwODI.html
31-10-2020||India||EC revokes ‘star campaigner’ status of Kamal Nath over violations||The Election Commission of India (EC) on Friday revoked the “star campaigner” status of Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath for repeatedly violating the model code of conduct ahead of the bypolls to 28 assembly constituencies in the state, even as he will be allowed to conduct political rallies with conditions.The costs of star campaigners’ rallies are borne by the party, and are not added to the election spends of the candidates for whom they campaign. The Congress has said it will appeal the decision in the Supreme Court. The elections are scheduled for November 3 and the campaigning ends on November 1.“The Commission has carefully considered the matter and has observed with displeasure that Kamal Nath, despite being a leader of a political party, is repeatedly violating the model code of conduct and breaching the ethical and dignified behaviour,” the EC order said. “For repeated violation of the model code of conduct and for completely disregarding the advisory issued to him, the Commission revokes the status of leader of political party (star campaigner) of Kamal Nath,” it added. While Nath will still be allowed to conduct political rallies, the cost will have to be borne by the candidate of that particular assembly segment. The poll body has taken note of the Congress leader’s speech on October 13 in which he said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan treated the “mafia” and “milawatkhor” (adulterators) like gods. They have also taken note of another statement in which Nath referred to Chouhan as a “performer, who should go act in Mumbai”. On Monday, the commission warned Nath against using derogatory terms, shortly after he referred to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Imarti Devi as an “item” during an election rally.Addressing a campaign meeting for the November 3 by-election in Gwalior’s Dabra town, where the BJP has fielded Devi, Nath had said the Congress candidate was a “simple person” unlike his opponent who was an “item”. The remark triggered an outrage with BJP leaders, led by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, staging protests against Kamal Nath. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also disapproved of Nath’s remark, saying it was “unfortunate”.The state Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja termed EC’s Monday’s move “prejudiced”. “This is a one-sided and prejudiced action taken by the election commission at someone else’s behest. If action has been taken against our state president Kamal Nath ji then similar action should have been taken against chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya too given their objectionable remarks.,” he said.Rajya Sabha MP and Congress leader Vivek Tankha said the EC did not give a notice to Kamal Nath nor the Congress party. “We are approaching Supreme Court to intervene & save democracy,” he tweeted.State BJP chief spokesperson Deepak Vijayvargiya welcomed the decision, saying: “We welcome Election Commission’s decision which has vindicated the stand of the Bharatiya Janata Party as to how the Congress leaders attacked the ruling party leaders and candidates with use of unparliamentary language during the campaigning. The word used by Kamal Nath ji against the BJP candidate Imrati Devi was highly objectionable and condemnable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-revokes-star-campaigner-status-of-kamal-nath-over-violations/story-sq3zvL1UVRUZR2BfApyMqI.html
31-10-2020||India||De-radicalised twice, Pune woman went back to IS: NIA||A 20-year-old woman from Pune, who wanted to be a suicide bomber, was de-radicalised twice in three years by Indian intelligence agencies, but she kept going back to embracing jihadi ideology, according to a charge sheet by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Sadiya Anwar Shaikh, a resident of Yerwada in Pune, was de-redicalised once in 2015 and then again in 2018, when she was a minor, the agency said in its charge sheet, filed in the first week of September. She was arrested in July in a conspiracy case linked to the Islamic State (IS) after the second de-radicalisation effort failed.According to the charge sheet, she has been in touch with terrorists of various groups such as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), Islamic State in Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK), al Qaeda, Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, among other countries, on social media since 2015.She was also in touch with a key IS “online motivator” from the Philippines, Karen Aisha Hamidon, who radicalised several Indian youngsters. NIA officials even travelled to Manila in April 2018 and questioned Hamidon. Sadiya came under the radar of intelligence agencies in 2015, when she was just 15, for radical content on her Facebook account. One of her inspirations was wanted Islamic preacher Dr Zakir Naik, who is hiding in Malaysia,according to the charge sheet.It said the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Pune tried to de-radicalise her and let her go. However, she again created multiple fake accounts on Facebook and other social media platforms. Later, in January 2018, she went to Kashmir and was examined by Jammu and Kashmir police. “After de-radicalisation, she was handed over to her mother,” the charge sheet said. It said she once asked Jahanzaib Sami (named in the charge sheet along with her) if she can procure a suicide vest in Pune. She also learnt how to prepare an IED (improvised explosive device) using picric acid. “She was not only inclined towards ISIS (Islamic State) but was even ready to offer her support in the form of becoming a suicide bomber,” the charge sheet said. On one occasion, the NIA charge sheet said, she even asked one of her IS contacts if they can explore the possibility of using the coronavirus to wreak havoc on India. “She desired that corona pandemic should be used to destroy the country, which shows her anti-national mentality,” the NIA said. A senior counter-terrorism official, who did not wish to be named, said: “There was intent from her side to know if they can spread the virus by sending infected persons in crowded places or through other means. There was no implementation of the plan.” Professor David Stadelmann from University of Bayreuth (Germany), who is an expert on terrorism, told HT that terrorist groups have discussed biological attacks in the past. “While deliberate attempts to infect people with corona may induce fear, it is rather unclear how such a systematic transmission of the virus would work because people get infected with the virus anyhow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/de-radicalised-twice-pune-woman-went-back-to-is-nia/story-soyni1wx8kNrbEyDEhFrOK.html

Therefore it is important to create a strong advisory and coordination mechanism at the state and district level to guide the process of Covid-19 vaccine introduction while ensuring minimal disruption of other routine healthcare services including immunisation,” according to the terms of references shared with the states.The committees will also coordinate cold chain augmentation, capacity building activities of vaccinators and field staff, wherever needed, it said.The states have been asked to constitute at least three committees at different levels — a state steering committee under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, a state task force chaired by either the additional chief secretary, commissioner, or principal health secretary; and a district task force functional under the district magistrate.The function of the steering committee will be to ensure active engagement of other line departments, oversight on creation of database of health care workers on priority of phase 1 vaccination, review of state’s preparatory activities, mobilising human and other resources, and coordinate planning, among others. The state task force’s role will be to identify vaccinators across government and private sectors so as to minimise disruption of routine immunisation services while introducing the Covid-19 vaccine, and planning and mapping of vaccination sessions where health care workers will be vaccinated, etc. At the district level, the task force will monitor progress of database of beneficiaries, ensure training of all human resource to be involved in the process, and monitor cold chain and vaccine logistics planning, etc. “The vaccine will take some time but logistical arrangements will have to be made early to avoid any last minute glitches,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-panels-for-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-govt-tells-states/story-A2eepcRBujhuRDZovKfn1H.html

The victim’s father lodged a complaint on Tuesday alleging that his daughter was raped by a member of the hospital staff while she was in a semi-conscious state on a ventilator in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU).A case has been registered at Sushant Lok police station under section 376 (2) (E) of the Indian Penal Code.“A three-member team of doctors was formed on Wednesday to conduct a medical examination of the victim. A sexual assault cannot be ruled out. More tests, including psychological assessment, will be conducted once she regains consciousness and her statement is recorded,” the CMO, Virender Yadav, wrote in a report submitted to the police. The Haryana State Commission for Women (HSCW) took suo motu cognisance of media reports of the incident, and on Thursday constituted an inquiry committee. Its team will visit the hospital to talk to the administration and the victim’s family on Saturday.The commission has sought a detailed report from the CMO and police, and asked the hospital management to submit an “action taken” report. “It was shocking to learn about such an incident inside hospital premises that too with a patient who is in ventilator support,” said Preeti Bhardwaj, vice-chairperson of HSCW.Police said that two members of the hospital staff were under the scanner, but no arrests were made yet. Officers familiar with the probe, however, said they have recovered crucial evidence from the CCTV footage from two floors of the hospital.“The victim is still on ventilator and has breathing issues. Her counselling sessions will also be scheduled once she starts communicating with family and doctors,” said commissioner of police KK Rao. He added that the investigators were waiting for the victim to be declared fit by the doctors before recording her statement, and making arrests.Officers said the family suspected the crime took place between October 21, when she was admitted, and October 27, when she gained consciousness. The victim told her father about her ordeal through a handwritten note on Tuesday, they added.The victim is undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, and was in isolation in a private room of the ICU.The victim was removed from the ventilator on Friday evening but is not in a condition to record her statement.Preeti Bhardwaj, vice chairperson of women commission visited the victim on Friday and met the family members. She said the victim was not in a condition to talk.“The condition of the patient is steadily improving, and she was taken off ventilator support this afternoon. The family and police were immediately informed. Fortis is proud to have 58% of women employees and our ethos is to respect and ensure the dignity and safety of all women. As a responsible healthcare provider, we are committed to working with the authorities to establish the truth,” Fortis Memorial, Gurgaon, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ggm-icu-rape-cmo-says-patient-may-have-been-sexually-assaulted/story-TKt0PhA72E9fhsvKroRl8J.html
31-10-2020||India||AIIMS to submit proposal for phase 3 trials of Covaxin next week||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences is likely to submit a proposal to start phase 3 clinical trials in the hospital to the Institute of ethics committee for Bharat Biotech’s anti Coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine candidate by early next week. Bharat Biotech last week got an approval from drugs controller general of India to conduct phase 3 clinical trials of its anti Covid-19 vaccine candidate, Covaxin, in India, and AIIMS Delhi is one of the sites selected for trials that will be conducted across India. “The proposal is being prepared for the phase 3 trials, and within a couple of days we will be submitting it to the institute ethics committee for approval,” confirmed Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, department of community medicine, AIIMS Delhi. Dr Rai is also the principal investigator for the Covaxin trials at the hospital. For a trial to start at any of the approved sites, it is mandatory to secure clearance of the institute ethics committee.Also Read: Prioritisation has to be done on criteria for Covid-19 vaccination, says Dr VK Paul As per the rules laid down by country’s biomedical research regulator— the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it is required for an ethics committee to oversee clinical research and thoroughly review the proposal at any site before allowing the trial to start. AIIMS ethics committee consists 15 members, and is expected to take about 10-14 days to grant the necessary approvals. “The proposal will be at least 200-300 pages and it takes time to go through it properly. The idea is to review and look for gaps, if any, that would address all concerns. The concerns that are usually raised almost always are valid, which you might miss otherwise. It helps,” said Dr Rai. For the phase 1 and 2 trials, Dr Rai’s team had submitted the proposal to the committee on June 30, and the clearance came through on July 18. AIIMS plans to recruit anywhere between 2,000-5,000 participants for the upcoming phase 3 trial once they get the approval. Bharat Biotech had submitted the phase 3 trial application for India to the national drugs controller on October 2, and received its approval on October 22, suggesting minor procedural changes to the trial plan. Also Read: Set up panels for Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, govt tells statesThe company plans to enroll at least 26,000 participants for the phase 3 trials at 25 to 30 hospital sites across 13-14 states. For phase 1 clinical trials, it had recruited 375 subjects, and as part of the phase 2 trials the vaccine candidate was administered to 400 participants. Bharat Biotech has completed phase 1 trial, and the results were submitted to DCGI that showed no major safety concern. For phase 2, the safety test has been completed, and the immunogenicity test to know body’s immune response to the vaccine, is currently underway. Covaxin is India’s first vaccine candidate against Covid-19. Bharat Biotech has developed the vaccine candidate in collaboration with ICMR- National Institute of Virology (NIV) using an inactivated Sars-Cov-2 virus, the virus that causes Covid-19. “Phase 3 trial results will eventually decide which vaccine would work and which wouldn’t,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, AIIMS, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-to-submit-proposal-for-phase-3-trials-of-covaxin-next-week/story-5ys9xnOfO8olyk9YPTcwqJ.html
31-10-2020||India||After organisational change in Bengal BJP, central team to monitor progress||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) central leaders want the West Bengal unit to hit the road with full steam in the second week of November and subsequently intensify campaign for the crucial assembly polls due in about five months. The entire movement will be monitored from Delhi, state leaders told HT on condition of anonymity. Strong supervision by the BJP central leadership is being viewed by state office-bearers as a measure to stop internal rumblings and iron out differences between leaders who earlier worked for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and those who joined in recent years, leaving the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The most prominent among the former TMC leaders is Mukul Roy, who was recently made a national vice-president. On October 28, BJP president J P Nadda appointed Amitava Chakraborty as the new general secretary (organization) of the Bengal unit, replacing Subrata Chatterjee, a former RSS leader known to be close to state president Dilip Ghosh. Chakraborty is the joint general secretary (organization) of the state BJP since 2019. He too was earlier in the RSS. Differences between Ghosh and Roy and his followers (who switched over from the TMC) made news over the last two months. BJP leaders said the party’s central leaders want this to end so that a strong fight can be put up against the TMC in 2021. “Many leaders from the state have complained to the central leadership that they are not being able to work freely. We will not be surprised if more organisational changes are made,” a state leader said on condition of anonymity. Nadda will be on a two-day tour of the state in the first week of November. He is scheduled to address party leaders from 15 districts in south Bengal. The organisational meetings to be held on November 6 and 7. “The strategy of the coming movements will be decided at these meetings. The party president will brief district and state leaders. Union home minister Amit Shah will also visit Bengal but the dates have not been finalised yet,” a state vice-president told HT on Friday. Although the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, party leaders said the assembly polls will not be a cakewalk, especially in the 15 south Bengal districts where most of the assembly segments are located. Under instructions from Shah, the party is now strengthening the organisation right down to the polling booth level. In the north Bengal district of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur and Malda, the BJP won seven seats last year. In sharp contrast, the saffron camp could capture only 11 seats in the south Bengal districts of Bankura, West Burdwan, East Burdwan, Birbhum, Purulia, Murshidabad, Nadia, West Midnapore, Jhargram, East Midnapore, Hooghly, Howrah, Kolkata, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas. The organisational changes are directly related to the party’s election strategy, BJP leaders said. On September 26, the central leadership dropped former Bengal unit president Rahul Sinha from the national committee and inducted two former TMC leaders, Roy and Anupam Hazra. Hazra was made a national secretary in place of Sinha. The announcement was made by Nadda in Delhi. As the reshuffle led to rumblings over elevation of former TMC leaders in the hierarchy, Ghosh and Roy were summoned to Delhi in early October to meet Shah. The former BJP national president, who has set the target to oust the TMC government in 2021, charted out some strategies. The leaders were reportedly told to work as a team. Ghosh, however, recently got into a dispute with former TMC leader and Lok Sabha MP from Bishnupur (Bankura district) Saumitra Khan who was made president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth front, about two months ago. A week ago, Ghosh dissolved all BJYM district committees formed by Khan. “This did not go down well with central leaders,” said a senior state BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-organisational-change-in-bengal-bjp-central-team-to-monitor-progress/story-8QAMn85nuWQBFOIsQ805JP.html

31-10-2020||India||Uddhav Thackeray to decide whether Urmila Matondkar will be nominated for Legislative Council seat, says Sanjay Raut||The Maharashtra government may recommend actor Urmila Matondkar’s name for nomination to the state Legislative Council. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a final decision on it, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Friday as speculations of the Bollywood actor’s nomination were rife. On Thursday, the Maharashtra cabinet discussed the proposal of recommending to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari the names of 12 candidates for their nomination to the Upper House of the state legislature from his quota.Apart from Urmila Matondkar, the names of Marathi actor and Shiv Sena leader Aadesh Bandekar, singer Anand Shinde, BJP-turned-NCP leader Eknath Khadse, farmer leader Raju Shetti are also doing rounds.“I have also heard about the speculation that Matondkar will be nominated by the government to the Council. It is the prerogative of the state cabinet, which has authorised CM Uddhav Thackeray to take a decision,” Sanjay Raut said.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab has said leaders of the three allies of the Maha Vikas Aghadi will finalise the names and then forward it to the governor. These 12 council seats had fallen vacant in June this year.Under Article 171 of the Constitution, the governor can nominate 12 members with special knowledge or practical experience in the field of literature, art, science, cooperative movement and social service to the state Legislative Council.The actor had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Mumbai North constituency on a Congress ticket. Five months after she joined the party, she quit the Congress citing petty in-house politics. “My political and social sensibilities refuse to allow vested interests in the party to use me as a mean to fight petty in-house politics instead of working on a bigger goal in Mumbai Congress,” she had said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-decide-whether-urmila-matondkar-will-be-nominated-for-legislative-council-seat-says-sanjay-raut/story-7cqdCI6L41zgB7kNk4XkIJ.html
31-10-2020||India||2 arrested from Punjab in Bengal BJP leader’s murder||The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the West Bengal police on Thursday arrested two alleged contract killers, Sujit Kumar Rai and Roshan Yadav, during a raid at Ludhiana in Punjab in connection with the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manish Shukla on October 4.Rai and Yadav hail from Bihar, CID officials said. They were brought to Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, where Shukla was gunned down, and produced before Barrackpore court on Friday afternoon. CID officers said on condition of anonymity that Rai and Yadav were deployed by Bihar-based gangster Subodh Singh. Singh was lodged at Beur jail in Bihar during the murder. The alleged hitmen returned to Bihar after the murder and later went to Punjab to evade arrest.CID officers claimed to have found during investigation that Singh contacted Rai and Yadav and even supplied the firearms. The information was given to the probe team by another accused Muhammad Nasir Khan, a resident of North 24 Parganas district, who allegedly approached Singh. Manish Shukla, 39, an outgoing councillor of the Titagarh municipality in North 24 Parganas district was gunned down by motorcycle-borne hitmen on the night of October 4. Five people were arrested earlier but the CID and state government have so far made no official statement on the investigation. Police have seized some firearms and three motorcycles allegedly used in the crime which took place within 100 metres of Titagarh police station. Shukla, a former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader, joined the BJP after the opposition party won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. One of these seats is Barrackpore, of which Titagarh is a part.In Shukla’s murder, nine people have been named in the First Information Report (FIR) on the basis of the complaint lodged by his father Chandra Mani Shukla. The outgoing chairman of Barrackpore municipality, Uttam Das and his counterpart in Titagarh municipality, Prashanta Choudhury, have been named in the FIR.Barrackpore’s BJP MP Arjun Singh, who also switched camp in 2018, has accused the chairpersons of two civic bodies and TMC lawmaker from Panihati, Nirmal Das, of masterminding the murder with the help of some police officers. On October 11, Bengal BJP leaders alleged before governor Jagdeep Dhankhar that the state CID is trying to implicate leaders from the party in the murder case. A BJP team, led by national vice-president Mukul Roy, met Dhankhar at the Raj Bhawan and said the CID probe was not moving in the right direction. Dhankhar raised the issue before the media in Delhi on Thursday after meeting Union home minister Amit Shah.The BJP and the state’s ruling TMC are locked in a pitched political fight in the run up to next year’s state elections.The BJP claims that more than 140 of its workers and leaders have been killed since 2011. Though the TMC didn’t give any number, but some of its leaders have also been killed in recent months, though mostly in intra-party clashes.   BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “The CID may have arrested two people from Punjab but we firmly believe that TMC got Shukla killed.” TMC’s North 24 Parganas district unit chief and minister Jyotipriyo Mullick rejected Basu’s charge and said the CID will unearth the truth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-arrested-from-punjab-in-bengal-bjp-leader-s-murder/story-Zf6abm5esBJElWKkDu4ENI.html
