Yet, in the middle of pandemic and elections to presidencies and assemblies, our attention is glued to audience measurement.Audience measurement is not a page-turner. How, then, did it suddenly become a topic of ill-informed fulmination? In a word — scandal. Who doesn’t love a scandal? What’s more, if the story offers a wide cast of characters, from petty scammers to media moguls to India’s biggest advertisers, it is time for drama.Full disclosure: I have been neck-deep in the field for a long time. I welcome the attention it is getting right now, but I also feel compelled to set the record straight. No, the measurement system isn’t fragile, nor is it falling apart. An audience measurement system has three tiers. The lowest, least volatile, is furnished by the Census of India. The 2021 Census will get underway in a few months. Audience measurement, indeed all quantitative market research, is currently using projections from previous Census rounds. The second tier, usually called the establishment study, is a pan-India exercise to map critical characteristics of media consumers. Household structure, languages of media consumption, media devices, consumption patterns, age, gender, and so on, are put under a microscope. Studies of readership, ambient media, even radio, stop at this tier, as it produces detailed estimates of reach, frequency and product linkages, to meet most planning requirements.Television habits are considered more volatile as the medium offers more choice. Thus, the insistence for a third tier to continuously monitor television viewing. This tier uses the third type of research methodology: the continuously monitored panel. Diaries, which were the tracking device until the 1980s were replaced, in the 90s by a TV adjunct device, generically called peoplemeter. Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC)’s nationwide meter panel, gives media professionals a richly-detailed view of “What India Watches”, BARC’s tagline.Managing an audience measurement system is a mammoth enterprise. BARC took the best part of a decade to come together, and its weekly television audience report has an enviable reputation for fidelity and precision. But there will always be those who use unsavoury means to get ahead.What should matter to us is whether systems exist to intercept and checkmate bad actors. There is plenty of good news. Participants in the smaller genres are more likely to attempt malpractices, particularly those dependent entirely on advertising revenues. In many countries, such genres are almost exclusively in “pay TV”, not FTA (Free To Air), tier. A flawed regulatory environment has obliterated the pay opportunity for many small-footprint or niche genres, making them solely advertising revenue dependent. Reach and frequency translates into ad sales, and absent either or both, into decimation. This is unlike consumption of entertainment and sports, genres characterised by near-universal popularity, long and frequent viewing sessions and dual revenue sources — lucrative subscription and bulge-bracket ad sales.Small stations reach a few viewers. Correspondingly, they are seen by only a few people in the peoplemeter panel. If, by fair or foul means, the number of viewers for a particular niche channel were to increase even by modest numbers, the outcomes in reach and frequency would bring a discernible uptick in revenue. This sets up a perverse incentive for malpractice. But while it might be relatively easy to attempt, it is altogether different to get away with it. An example from far outside the communication domain should help elucidate this. A few years ago, LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory at Caltech, announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves. The mathematical methodologies, which enabled this observation, were literally in search for a darning needle in a mega-warehouse of hay, and yet, were able to pinpoint it. The statistical forensics used by BARC are distant cousins to those used by LIGO. Holmes’s trusty magnifying glass now looks like 50 lines of Python code.With BARC pausing channel-level reporting for 12 weeks in the news genre on Thursday, this might be a good time to reassess whether all channels need to be reported at the same, weekly frequency. Systems in other jurisdictions often stipulate a minimum share-of-audience for half-year blocks to stay in the weeklies. Fall below, and their reporting frequency drops to monthly, or even quarterly.But, at the same time, fulminating about ratings is a great example of shooting the messenger. We, the consumers of television in India, have legitimate reasons to be miffed with what is served up to us; whether as entertainment, information or news. However, the answers have more to do with the structure of economic incentives and disincentives, which the legal-regulatory environment has set up, and less with how India measures TV audiences. If your solitary reaction to the brouhaha is to damn the measurement system, you are looking in the wrong place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/blame-the-regulatory-system-not-barc-analysis/story-zdSao1zlRKGR9iCgzgoSrK.html
15-10-2020||News||Leverage Covid-19 to reform justice delivery||The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the justice delivery processes in Indian courts almost to a halt. After being in a limbo, the courts have now responded to the situation by resorting to hearings in urgent cases through video- conferences, and, very rarely, physical proceedings.While litigants are in a quandary over the suspension of court proceedings, lawyers are equally unsettled as their livelihoods are dependent on the regular functioning of the courts. The pandemic has further accentuated the fault lines in our justice system--growing backlogs, extensive delays and lack of consistency in judicial decision-making. While some courts are currently hearing critical matters online, teething troubles in technology and user-interface have emerged as major challenges. There are no clear rules on how online proceedings ought to be conducted. As a result, there is a clamour to resume physical hearings. The pandemic is not going away for a while but justice delivery cannot be put on hold. However, the unprecedented adversity presents us with an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine justice delivery by making it more transparent, time-bound and efficient. Until now, judicial reform has largely been based on incremental improvements to infrastructure and expanding the strength of the judiciary. This approach has not had the desired impact.There is one aspect which might contribute to the overall solution, i.e. how the experience of holding court hearings through video-conferencing could expand into a sustainable mechanism to improve justice delivery and its quality.The only feasible option is to explore the possibility of moving justice delivery to technology platforms. India must invest in building, strengthening and evolving online and technology platforms and re-energise justice delivery. Initially, this would mean moving to complete online filings and holding regular hearings over video-conferencing. In phase one, this could be implemented in all the high courts and the Supreme Court and then in the next phase move this down to the district and lower courts. As things go along, holographic technologies could be adopted.The benefits of such an evolution would be multi-faceted. Some of the noteworthy benefits will include: One, efficient and time-bound hearings; two, a a shift in focus from the personality of lawyers to content; three, clients, judges and lawyers would be spared the travel to the courts/tribunals; four, lawyers, based in different cities, will be able to appear for clients in courts/tribunals across India. This would effect a change in the astronomical legal fees which are often charged; five, the need for physical courts in each district will be reduced. Using the experience of virtual hearings, courts/judicial business process outsourcing (BPO) can be set up across the country, ideally in townships/complexes where judges can live and work. Much like a BPO, such a set-up would be scalable without being expensive. This will lead to efficient use of judicial resources as judicial workload could be shared between judges across states, based on capacity and expertise; five, a time-limit could be enforced for arguments. Six, written submissions that parties file with courts could be replaced with standard online forms. Seven, court proceedings could be live-streamed. There is a great deal that one can learn from listening to eminent counsel arguing cases. There is no reason to deprive a young lawyer or law student of this important avenue of learning. Such transparency will also enhance the value and prestige of our justice system. Eight, in time, courts could shift to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to automate first-level decision-making. The majority of cases that come up before a judge are straightforward and can be resolved using AI-based systems. Such systems, which are being tested with promising outcomes, could dramatically reduce the time taken for arriving at a court decision. This will also help create a level playing field for litigants where the outcome is not necessarily dependent on the quality of the lawyer that one can afford.

15-10-2020||News||In his 89th year, Abdul Kalam’s legend lives on||Presidents come and go. But the institution persists. However, certain presidents earn an image larger than the institution.If there was a checklist of attributes for what it takes to be a president, APJ Abdul Kalam would not have ticked all the boxes. He was certainly not a traditional president. With his long hair and easy manner, he seemed to feel that he was a one of the masses. He was a man of science, in a country steeped in superstition. In 2012, almost five years after he ceased being President, Reliance along with Outlook, CNN-IBN and The History Channel, conducted a poll to identify the greatest Indian after Gandhi. Kalam ranked first in the market survey result and second in the online polls. Why was he so popular?Was it because he rose to the highest office of the country by sheer dint of hard work? Joining a government department as senior scientific adviser on a monthly salary of Rs 250, he changed the shape of the country’s missile and space programme by the end of a 43-year long career. In his book, Who is Kalam?, R Ramanathan, who worked with him in Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), recounts how Kalam would take late-night meetings and work till the early hours of the morning. He recollects an incident when a major-general sought an appointment and Kalam asked him to come at 10:30 am. When the major general said it would be difficult to reach so early, Kalam said he meant 10:30 pm. Or was it because of his extraordinary vision? From the beginning, Kalam could look over the horizon. He came up with a Vision 2020 development plan in 1998. Even at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he had no time for small talk. When then president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, visited in 2005, instead of raising Kashimir, Kalam engaged him with a presentation on urban facilities in rural areas. Similarly, when George Bush visited Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2006, Kalam asked for an LCD screen and made a presentation on his vision for global energy self-sufficiency. Then again, perhaps the secret of Kalam’s popularity lies in his humaneness. The one label that stuck to him was the “people’s president”. He was a nightmare for his security team, constantly breaking protocol and reaching out to interact with people. It is a tradition for the president to host an Iftar party and Kalam was expected to continue this tradition. However, as his then secretary P M Nair reveals in his book, The Kalam effect, when Kalam came to know that the Iftar would cost Rs 2.5 lakh to host, he cancelled the party and instead contributed the amount saved to 28 different orphanages adding Rs 1 lakh from himself. Or was Kalam popular because of his simplicity? Customarily, when a president visits a state for the first time, he is honoured with a banquet. On such a visit to Kerala, Kalam invited a cobbler who used to mend his shoes and the owner of a hotel where he would eat regularly in his earlier days to a state banquet. His incredible connection with children may also be one reason for his popularity. As he often said, he considered children to be the first scientists since they keep asking the question “why?” with a curious mind. Even as president, he answered their questions with patience hoping to inspire and ignite their young minds. The reason for Kalam’s popularity may also be because of his unique syncretism. A devout Muslim, and follower of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, he often quoted verses from the Bhagavad Gita. His favourite character was Vidura from the Mahabharata whom he liked for his simplicity and steadfastness to principles. At the same time, he lived by the ideal of Caliph Omar that all men are equal before the eyes of God. He was comfortable reciting the Koran as well as playing the Rudra veena. In his 89th year, Abdul Kalam’s legend lives on. New stories about him continue to emerge and fresh anecdotes are revealed. At times, the lines between reality and lore; man, and myth begin to blur. The secret to this enduring popularity, I believe lies somewhere else.It is a practise for every president to have an official photograph taken. This is hung in all government offices. Look closely at the official photo of Kalam and you see that he has his coat unbuttoned at his neck and in his pocket, he has a pilot pen. Here was a man who did not care for the appearances and niceties of the world. He was unashamed of his roots and had the courage to live his life uncomplicated by fears of how people would perceive him. He remains popular even now as we see a reflection of who we want to be in him. A man who even after becoming president, still remained the boy who delivered newspapers and dreamed of a better world for everyone.Praveen Siddharth is Private Secretary to the President of India at Rashtrapati BhavanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-his-89th-year-abdul-kalam-s-legend-lives-on/story-BPefMgVNVJizudEnfODHHL.html
15-10-2020||News||Indian-Americans are with Democrats | Analysis||A surprising development in an already unprecedented American election season is the amount of attention being devoted to the Indian-American electorate, which collectively accounts for less than 1% of all registered voters.Yet, thanks to the growing importance of Indian-Americans in closely contested swing states, their emerging status as key campaign contributors, and Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate, both major parties are furiously courting their votes. But significant attention is also being paid to Indian-Americans because a popular narrative is emerging that the supposed camaraderie between United States President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — compounded by concerns over how a Biden administration might manage US-India ties — is pushing Indian-Americans to flee the Democratic Party. The Trump campaign, smelling blood, has issued targeted ads featuring Trump and Modi on the stage at last year’s “Howdy, Modi!” rally in Houston. A cursory scan of recent headlines demonstrates how widely this narrative has taken root. “Democrats Have a Loyal Base in Indian Americans, but Trump Is Fast Pulling Them to His Side,” asserts a piece in The Print. “Kamala, Kashmir and Modi’s Friend All on Ballot in US Election,” reads a BBC headline. An analysis in Quartz boldly proclaims: “The Modi-Trump Friendship Could Change the Way Indian-Americans Vote in November 2020.” While this narrative is seductive, it has one central flaw. There is little empirical evidence to support it. A new study based on a nationally representative survey of nearly 1,000 Indian-American citizens — the Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) — finds that 72% of registered Indian-American voters intend to support Biden in the 2020 presidential election, while just 22% plan to back Trump. This positions Indian-Americans between African-Americans and Hispanics in terms of the intensity of their support for the Democrats. Furthermore, it appears that the speculation about the role US-India ties might play in shaping the Indian-American vote is overblown. Indian-Americans view US-India relations as a low-priority election issue compared to nationally salient “kitchen table” issues such as the economy and health care. While many Indian-Americans report that US-India relations are important to them, foreign policy ultimately gets crowded out by pressing daily concerns — especially in an election year marked by a pandemic, economic crisis, and a national uproar over race and social justice. On issues ranging from immigration to press freedom, the policy preferences of Indian-Americans line up remarkably well with those of the political Left. Indeed, the leading reason Democrats and independents cite for their aversion to the Republican Party is the latter’s intolerance of minorities (followed by their apprehensions regarding the pervasive influence of Christian evangelicalism on the party).The conjecture that the addition of Harris to the Democratic ticket could turn off more Indian-American voters than it attracts — presumably based on her past statements on India’s domestic policies or the perceived prioritising of her Black identity over her Indian heritage — finds little support. Forty-five per cent of respondents indicated that the Harris pick made them more likely to vote in November, compared to 10% who said it made them less likely (40% said her nomination made no difference). This enthusiasm has largely worked in favour of the Democratic ticket: 49% of respondents stated that Harris makes them more excited about Biden’s candidacy, compared to 15% who felt less enthusiastic. Why so? A plurality of respondents enthused by her historic nomination cite the fact of her Indian heritage. Many in India seem convinced that an inexorable migration of Indian-Americans toward the Republican Party is taking place. The reality is starkly different. Not only is this migration not transpiring but, given the growing number of second-generation Indian-Americans who are even more pro-Democratic Party than their parents (see figure), the median Indian-American voter will likely become even more aligned with the Democrats. Ironically, if Trump gets re-elected and issues additional curbs on legal immigration, this trend will only intensify since US-born Indian-Americans tend to be more liberal than their naturalised counterparts.Consequently, it would be perilous for the Indian political establishment to ignore the reality of the Indian diaspora’s political orientation toward the Democratic Party. While Indian-American voters believe that a Biden presidency would be good for US-India relations, the degree to which a Biden administration will revisit US policies on India will depend on the extent to which progressive groups manage to secure a seat in his administration.In the past year, Indian officials and members of the ruling party have routinely rejected the concerns myriad Democratic leaders have expressed over India’s current trajectory, especially with regard to democratic freedoms and civil liberties. Notwithstanding the powerful forces operating in favour of a deepening partnership — driven substantially by the spectre of an aggressive, expansionist China — with India facing intensifying health, economic, and security challenges, New Delhi would be tempting fate if it were to be dismissive of these concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indian-americans-are-with-democrats/story-l9KWSRPRud2gu7t7znFvOP.html
15-10-2020||News||Decoding the roots of the JD(U)-LJP battle in Bihar’s political theatre | Analysis||Of the last Mohicans of the social justice movement, three are now alive with the passing of Ram Vilas Paswan. In the Bihar elections, only Nitish Kumar will be an active campaigner. Lalu Prasad is incarcerated; and Sharad Yadav is under treatment in a Delhi hospital. Until the state’s competitive caste politics did them apart, they were the undivided Janata Dal’s shining stars. Youthful and raring to go, three of them entered Parliament in the 1970s on the Janata Party ticket. Sharad Yadav won from Jabalpur in 1974, and was re-elected in 1977, when the Lalu-Paswan duo, too, made their maiden entry to the Lok Sabha.This piece of history is essential to understand the late Paswan’s feeble personal chemistry with Kumar. While Paswan first entered the assembly in 1969, Kumar, who lost the 1977 and 1980 elections, became a legislator only in the mid-1980s. Paswan’s claim to prominence over Kumar rested on his early electoral successes. His self-image was reinforced by his hold on the Paswan community, accounting for nearly 6% of the state electorate.In the 2000 polls, Paswan was the NDA’s chief ministerial face. But the then Prime Minister AB Vajpayee had Kumar installed as chief minister (CM) to marshal numbers in the hung assembly. The effort backfired. Kumar’s term lasted seven days, Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) retained power, and Paswan formed his Lok Janashakti Party (LJP). In fact, Nitish Kumar’s elevation as CM after the repeat 2005 elections rankled Paswan, who had also seen the railways portfolio he coveted going to Kumar under Vajpayee in the Union Cabinet.Paswan was also less deferential to Nitish Kumar because of the latter’s relatively smaller Kurmi social base, than he was to Lalu Prasad, whose Muslim-Yadav constituency was formidable. The social engineering that became Kumar’s USP was as much a cutting-down-to-size of Paswan as of Lalu Prasad. Within Dalits, Paswans are relatively dominant, just as Yadavs are among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Nitish Kumar created class divides in the omnibus social justice landscape. The constituencies he carved of Pasmanda Muslims, Mahadalits and Aati-Pichadas earned him political heft at the expense of the LJP and RJD. The objective was identical when he made space for Jitan Ram Manjhi, a Mahadalit, as CM when he briefly demitted office in 2014.Chirag Paswan’s so-called “ideological differences” with Nitish Kumar is facetious reasoning for putting up candidates against the JD(U). There was a time when Chirag’s father would tell anyone who cared to hear that he quit the Vajpayee regime in protest against the 2002 Gujarat riots. That also was the phase when he mocked the BJP’s cow-protection plank in the Lok Sabha: “You call gai your mata but you have us (Dalits) carry her carcass”. Having been a minister in successive coalitions since 1989, bar the Chandrashekhar regime, Paswan abandoned demagogic secularism at the first opportunity to join Narendra Modi. Nitish Kumar was no different when he dumped the RJD to ally with the BJP in 2017. Yet, when it came to choosing between adversaries, Lalu Prasad’s son, Tejashwi Yadav, recently suggested that he preferred Paswan’s plain-speak to the inscrutable Kumar. To that extent, he should trust Chirag’s challenge to the CM who’s facing anti-incumbency. But that’ll be an oversimplification. Making matters tricky is the suspicion of the BJP having encouraged the LJP.It is noteworthy that the LJP’s best ever tally of 29 was in the February 2005 polls. It was a high accompanied by a low, with Paswan deploying an Osama Bin Laden look-alike in the campaign to woo Muslims. His quid pro quo for support to the RJD-Congress in the hung assembly entailed making a Muslim the CM. Neither party rose to the bait. The result: Nitish Kumar romped home in the repeat election. With just two seats now in the outgoing assembly, the basis of the LJP gambit is that it has little to lose and everything to gain. In contrast, Nitish Kumar’s stakes are higher. A dip in his tally will reduce him as CM. Officious to a fault, that’s one role he will find hard to play.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/decoding-the-roots-of-the-jd-u-ljp-battle-in-bihar-s-political-theatre/story-HRsE15xFm6hlXLhuekthgK.html
15-10-2020||News||Analysis| Will the migrant crisis impact the Bihar polls?||While the arithmetic in the Bihar assembly elections seems tilted in favour of the Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), there is unease about the final verdict among key political players. This anxiety is not driven as much by the fragmentation of the political space, but by uncertainty about how voters will react to Covid-related difficulties, and how will this shape their behaviour, both in terms of turnout rates among different communities and their voting choices.There seems to be a consensus that Nitish Kumar’s governance record in this term did not match up to his past record. This was compounded by the failure of his administration to provide adequate relief to the migrants who came back home after the unprecedented lockdown that started in March. Reports from the ground highlighted the hurt and rejection felt by them; and the fact that Bihar has the highest net migration rate in the country makes this salient.While Nitish Kumar is leaving no chance to remind everyone that his government has made several efforts to compensate the migrant workers, the opposition has alleged that it was too little, too late. Ironically, the opposition’s effort in turning these grievances into campaign platforms has also remained feeble at best. Does the political class not fear any electoral fallout over the issue? The possibility of the migrant crisis having electoral consequences hinges on three inter-related factors. First, while India has the world’s largest migrant population, work-related migration is relatively small. The Census figures are not reliable in accurately capturing the size of seasonal and temporary migrants (who form the bulk of work-related migration), though estimates suggest that the share of migrants within the eligible voting population is relatively low. Thus, as a voting bloc, the migrant population does not have much bargaining power. Field studies have shown that long-term migrants are more likely to be from the upper segments of society while short-term migrants are from the bottom rungs. These two sub-classes among the migrants have vastly different engagements in the electoral arena. The lockdown has been hard mostly on the short-term or seasonal migrants and it is this segment which is likely to have more grievances against the political class for abandoning them. However, given their size and scattered nature, even if migrants collectively organise on the issues concerning them, they are unlikely to have a significant electoral impact.This is related to a second factor. It is not easy for temporary migrants to enrol as voters at destination districts (where they work) as they often return home or migrate to a new location, either in the same city or another city. This electoral disenfranchisement of migrants has resulted in local politicians in the cities not taking enough interest in their problems. These politicians face almost zero electoral cost for ignoring the concerns of the migrants.Though there is enough evidence to suggest that electoral participation of these temporary migrants is higher in panchayat elections at home, it is expensive for them to travel home to vote during assembly and parliamentary elections. For example, during our research in the district administration in Banda, Uttar Pradesh, during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, we found that more than one in every five registered voters in many polling stations was a migrant. Our analysis suggests that turnout in polling stations with high migration (25% and above) was three percentage points lower. They, however, participate more enthusiastically in the panchayat elections as this has a direct impact on their family’s well-being for a number of reasons, including access to welfare benefits.Third, can migrants make themselves count politically despite this electoral exclusion? Existing research has shown that the political socialisation of migrants differs among members of their family, and in many cases, as the sole-earning members, their guidance is sought even in matters related to voting. Therefore, they seem to have some influence in voting decisions, and their motivations may well be different from that of the local population. For example, survey data from Lokniti-CSDS suggests that households with at least one member living outside the state are more likely to consider the performance of the central government over the state government even during assembly elections. They are also more likely to own a mobile handset, a television, and have higher media exposure. Thus, if the families of migrants turn out in this assembly election with the grievances they suffered during the pandemic and in its aftermath, they could change electoral equations in a substantial number of constituencies with high out-migration.Our knowledge about how the migrant population in India engages with electoral democracy is limited. The scale of their electoral exclusion is staggering, yet no systematic effort has been made to enfranchise these invisible citizens. We must reduce the information gap on migration corridors by making district-to-district mobility data publicly available (not released since 2001) to get a better grip on the changing nature of democratic politics in an increasingly urbanising India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/will-the-migrant-crisis-impact-the-bihar-polls/story-xwLFXj5vPdcVUA0QZz4ZaK.html
15-10-2020||City||Brinda Karat says one extra death in Delhi riots not counted, police say not related||New DelhiCPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat on Thursday wrote to Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava about a man who she claimed had died in the Delhi riots but whose death was not put on record as a riot victim by police, the party said in a statement. The police, however, say the man’s death was not related to the riots.In her letter to the police chief, Karat said there was an inaccuracy in the police’s account of the total deaths. Police have said 53 persons died while 400 others were injured during riots between Hindus and Muslims in north-east Delhi in February.Karat said a man named Sikander, was killed on February 27. His body, according to Karat, was found below a flyover at Khajuri Chowk and that the post-mortem report showed he had sustained “serious head injuries”. The body was identified by his brother Mohammed Ishfaque on March 19, she said. Karat in her letter said while Ishfaque has not been given a copy of the FIR by police, a police personnel allegedly told him that “the compensation would be managed” and his (Sikander) name would be “adjusted” in the list later.“The family has been through terrible trauma. Ishfaque’s shop in Bhajanpura was burnt and looted. His sister’s home in Ghonda was attacked and looted. And the youngest sibling of Sikander was killed. Instead of treating the family with sympathy, the Delhi Police by not registering Sikander as a victim has worsened their plight,” Karat wrote, adding the police should immediately add Sikander’s name to the list and submit a new list of 54 names to the Delhi high court.In response to the letter, Delhi police spokesperson Eish Singhal said the man’s death was not related to the riots. The officer said, “On February 27, an unidentified body was found in a public toilet in Khajuri Khas. The body was taken to GTB hospital in a CATS ambulance. There were no fresh injuries on the body. Inquest proceedings were carried out. We are still awaiting the final autopsy report but there is so far no connection of that death to the riots.” At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured in the Delhi riots. The clashes started when two groups -- one supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act and another opposing it -- clashed near the Jafrabad metro station on the evening of February 23. It snowballed into large-scale Hindu-Muslims clashes in parts of north-east Delhi between February 23 and 27. Delhi police have arrested at least 21 persons for conspiring to orchestrate the riots. The arrested persons include prominent faces of the anti-CAA protests such as former JNU student Umar Khalid, student activists Sharjeel Imam, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Safoora Zargar. Police have alleged that the arrested persons planned the riots, mobilised the rioters under the garb of the sit-in anti-CAA protests. The arrested persons have denied the allegations and accused police of launching a witch-hunt against anti-government voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brinda-karat-says-one-extra-death-in-delhi-riots-not-counted-police-say-not-related/story-MBu3S9jiERMLupgrjTtFIP.html

The incident took place on Wednesday between 1:30pm and 5pm. According to the police, the accused and the survivor stay in the same residential area and know each other. On Wednesday, the man took the girl with him without informing her family. When she did not return for long, the family approached Oshiwara police and filed a kidnapping case against an unknown person. “Around 9pm, the girl returned home and revealed the incident to her parents. The family then approached the police, where the man was booked for rape and under the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act,” said an officer. Senior inspector Dayanand Bangar from Oshiwara police station said,” We have arrested the accused and are investigating the case further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-businessman-arrested-for-kidnapping-and-raping-16-year-old/story-i8CVoUwVZmPK0lEpvDhrjP.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Concerned about unauthorised, dilapidated structures: Maharashtra government’s affidavit in Bombay high court||The Maharashtra government, while responding to the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) initiated by Bombay high court (HC) in light of the Bhiwandi building collapse that left around 41 dead, informed the court that it was concerned about unauthorised structures that were collapsing and causing loss of lives. The state government informed the court that it was in the process of identifying and highlighting such issues for the consideration of the HC, so that steps may be taken to obviate such dangerous situations, as well as to come out with an appropriate scheme for effectively dealing with the issue. The court directed the state urban development department (UDD) to examine what each municipal corporation, which is party to the case, has submitted with respect to the measures initiated by them against unauthorised structures in their jurisdiction, and file a comprehensive reply in affidavit by October 26. The court also directed the amicus curiae (a neutral lawyer appointed by the court to assist it in cases which require specific expertise) to file a report on submissions made by the respondent authorities. When the suo moto PIL came up for hearing before the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that as per the directions of the court the state, through the UDD, had prepared an affidavit in which it was stated that all the local governing bodies were sufficiently empowered under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act and the Mumbai Regional Town Planning (MRTP) Act to deal with the issue of dilapidated structures. The affidavit further stated that as every year, during monsoons, old and dilapidated buildings were collapsing, it had issued a circular to all urban local bodies (ULBs) prescribing guidelines to classify the old and/or dilapidated buildings into various categories specified in it. Kumbhakoni further submitted that the state had noticed that in many cases of unauthorised constructions, it was the innocent buyers who are cheated and suffer when the structures are demolished. “Therefore, the state issued a circular on May 2018, prescribing a procedure to be followed while taking action against such unauthorised structures in terms of MRTP Act to ensure that such incidents (Bhiwandi building collapse) are not repeated,” submitted Kumbhakoni. Stressing on the fact that the state was concerned about the issue, the affidavit said, “Most of these issues and/or factors are interlined and are found, most of the times, to be interdependent. The state is in process of listing them out for their appropriate appreciation by HC.” Kumbhakoni the concluded saying, “I request HC to grant adequate further time to the state government to have a fresh look at the ground realities as also to consider the effect of all such steps that have so far been taken in this regard and thereafter to come out with an appropriate scheme for effectively dealing with the same.” The court while acceding to the request of the state, directed it to study the affidavits it had asked all party corporations to file and come up with a comprehensive reply on the measures initiated by them respectively to address the issue of dilapidated and unauthorised buildings. The court also observed that out of the eight corporations, only four had filed their affidavits, in which the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation had failed to mention about the dilapidated unauthorised structures. The court posted the next hearing to October 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/concerned-about-unauthorised-dilapidated-structures-maharashtra-government-s-affidavit-in-bombay-high-court/story-y2jxYeu2Leb3b9CMGBH8mM.html
15-10-2020||City||Gupkar Declaration: 6 Kashmir parties join hands to forge People’s Alliance||Mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday held a meeting and formed an alliance for restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state as it existed before August 5 last year. The meeting was held at the residence of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and attended by PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, Peoples Movement leader Javaid Mir, CPIM leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami and Awami National Conference vice-president Muzaffar Shah. “We have decided that the Gupkar Declaration will be renamed as People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. Ours is a constitutional battle. We shall struggle for restoration of what was snatched from J&K and Ladakh,” Farooq told reporters after the two-hour meeting. He said the alliance also seeks a dialogue between all stakeholders for resolution of the issue pertaining to J&K. “We are going to meet again. We will also meet people from the other regions of the state for a broader discussion on the issues to be put before the people of the state as well as the Centre,” Farooq said. “All the signatories to the Gupkar Declaration have given a formal name to the grouping: People’s Alliance. The alliance will constitutionally fight for the restoration of the August 4 position of J&K,” said a PDP spokesperson in a tweet that was retweeted by Mehbooba. The meeting was called by Farooq two days after Mehbooba was released. She was the last of the prominent mainstream politicians to have been released, 14 months after the special status of the J&K was revoked. No other prominent politician of J&K is now in jail except separatists. J&K Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir could not attend the meeting “due to health reasons”. A spokesperson of the party said Mir had conveyed his inability to attend the meeting to Farooq as the Congress leader was advised by doctors to get himself medically examined.. On August 4 last year, all major political parties in Kashmir, except BJP, had met at the residence of Farooq amidst uncertainty and tension in the erstwhile state as the Centre had rushed additional paramilitary forces there while asking all tourists, including Amarnath pilgrims, to leave the Valley as soon as possible. The joint statement issued by the political parties, expressing concern over the situation, came to be known as the Gupkar Declaration. The Centre revoked the special constitutional status of the state and also bifurcated it into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. In a follow up, the political parties had met again in August this year and vowed to fight for restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gupkar-declaration-6-kashmir-parties-join-hands-to-forge-people-s-alliance/story-GuEIftbL3BAn0WCaVL6HZJ.html

Wadhwani’s film was re-released on Friday as the first film to be released post-Covid-19 lockdown period.According to the FIR (of which HT has a copy), Wadhwani on October 10 had posted on Facebook informing people about the re-release of his film. After that, he received objectionable comments from a Facebook user named Optimystix Optimystix.“The accused posted nine highly objectionable, threatening and obscene comments. The accused person used abusive language for his family members and threatened to get female members of his family gang-raped. Wadhwani submitted screenshots of these comments to the police,” states the FIR.Wadhwani first visited the cyber cell on October 12 and was further directed to Chembur police station for lodging the FIR. He told the police that he has nothing to do with Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.Wadhwani said, “As co-producer of the film PM Narendra Modi, I have received threat comments on social media warning me of dire consequences. While trollers are common and insignificant, the nature of the threat and bringing in my family into this is disturbing for a law-abiding citizen like me. I wasn’t sure whether there is a wider nexus or pattern to it, given the recent developments in the film industry. I have filed an official complaint with the cyber cell who have assured me to look into this.”The police have registered a case under sections 500 (defamation), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory) of the Indian Penal Code and 67A (publishing or transmitting sexually explicit material in electronic form) of Information Technology Act.

15-10-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: P Varavara Rao’s wife moves Supreme Court for his immediate release on medical grounds||The wife of 82-year-old activist and poet Dr Varavara Rao, P Hemlatha, moved a writ petition in the Supreme Court (SC) for Rao’s immediate release on medical grounds. The petition says his custody amounts to cruel and inhuman treatment, violating Article 21 of the Constitution of India and is violative of his dignity in custody.Rao was arrested by Pune police on August 28, 2018, for his alleged involvement in the violence that took place at Bhima-Koregaon on January 1, 2018, in which one person died and 30 policemen were injured. In July this year, Rao tested positive for Covid-19. Between July 16 and August 28, Rao received treatment for the infection at various hospitals. During this time, Rao’s family alleged mistreatment, saying Rao was being kept in pathetic and unhygienic conditions at St George Hospital, where he had initially been admitted. While at this hospital, Rao suffered a fall and after an intervention by the National Human Rights Commission, he was shifted to Nanavati Hospital. On August 28, Rao was discharged and sent back to Taloja Jail.According to the petition filed by Hemlatha through advocate Sunil Fernandes, Rao has been kept in inhumane conditions in jail and his health has worsened since he was discharged. A medical report dated July 30, from Nanavati Hospital, says he requires close monitoring due to comorbidities and mentions neurological problems. “It is highly likely that Covid-19 and the fall that he had in St. George Hospital has led to neurological problems,” states the petition, adding that when Rao was arrested, he had no neurological issues.Hemlatha, 71, has included a letter dated August 31, from Rao, in which he wrote that Hemlatha was dead and her body was in a morgue. “This itself shows the mental status of the Petitioner’s husband,” states the petition. It also cites a letter from academic Vernon Gonsalves, another accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case and a fellow inmate of Rao’s, which says Rao is “basically bed-ridden” and has no bowel or urine control. Rao has a catheter urine bag, which has not been changed in 40 days, according to Gonsalves, and has caused a urinary infection. Gonsalves has been caring for Rao in Taloja Jail. “The treatment meted out to Dr Varavara impairs the Right to Health recognized under Article 12 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which are read with Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” says the petition, which also questions whether Taloja Jail has the necessary facilities to take care of Rao. The petition states that Rao now weighs only 50kg, which is 18kg less than his weight in November 2018, and cannot stand trial in this condition. Furthermore, with the National Investigation Agency having made fresh arrests in October this year, there is little possibility of a speedy trial. ”Thus, there is no purpose in detaining him [Rao] in prison any further,” says the petition, urging SC to release Rao temporarily on medical grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-p-varavara-rao-s-wife-moves-supreme-court-for-his-immediate-release-on-medical-grounds/story-aUcD8YsLLz8bsabx9r9qAM.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Schools in Maharashtra to train students in traffic rules and road safety||Students studying in state schools will now learn about basic traffic rules and road safety measures as part of their everyday classes in schools. The directorate of primary education issued a circular on Wednesday asking its officials to ensure that students in schools across the state learn about the basic traffic rules and road safety. As per the circular, a group of resource persons, consisting of teachers and government officials will be trained by the state education department and the officials from the regional transport offices (RTOs) this month. The resource persons would then train teachers in their respective districts who will go on to train students. Instead of limiting the awareness about road safety to a few days, the department has asked teachers to make it a part of their ‘everyday teaching’. “Teachers should include concepts while conducting their regular classes. In the current situation, since education is happening online, the training should also be done in the digital mode,” states the circular. The Pune RTO had earlier written to the education department suggesting the inclusion of traffic rules in their regular syllabus. Taking note of the suggestion, the department has now decided to implement the move across the state. Teachers said that the move would help students in the long run. “If students are aware, they will also create awareness among their parents. We see a lot of mishaps happening on roads only because traffic and road safety rules are not followed. We hope the training helps address these issues,” said Ameena Shaikh, a teacher from a civic body school in Malad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-in-maharashtra-to-train-students-in-traffic-rules-and-road-safety/story-s5siDEHp9igCdp1csfB1HI.html
15-10-2020||City||Farmer who died at pro-farm rally cremated, politics escalates||A septuagenarian farmer, Bharat Singh, who lost his life during a BJP tractor rally in support of farm bills on Wednesday here was cremated at his village in Naraingarh in the presence of BJP state president Om Prakash Dhankar, Kurukshetra MP Naib Singh Saini, senior party leaders and villagers.Singh, a party worker, was aboard a tractor that was allegedly attacked by the protesting farmers affiliated to Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), who had blocked the tractor rally near Milan Palace on NH 344, also known as Ambala-Roorkee national highway. An FIR (murder) was lodged against seven farmers including Ambala BKU chief Malkit Singh. MP Naib Singh Saini had alleged that the farmer was “murdered” by the goons of Congress, state BKU president Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Nirmal Singh.Dhankar said, “The death of Bharat Singh is a great sacrifice for the economic independence of farmers. How a peaceful demonstration was stopped for two hours, where farmers were thrashed and tractors were attacked, was highly undemocratic.”DSP Naraingarh, Anil Kumar said that the autopsy was conducted on Wednesday evening and they are awaiting the report.Family members of the deceased and villagers, (some were also part of the rally) said that no arrangements were made by the administration during the rally.“When we were heading for the rally from our village to the originating spot, BKU’s goons had tried to block our way. One of them, who was later booked for attacking Bharat, had landed in an argument with him. This incident was just a political fight between MP Naib Saini and former Congress MLA Ramkishan Gujjar,” Sarpanch Anil Kumar told HT, whose words were seconded by another villager, who claimed that Bharat was fit and was attacked by the “goons” who they can easily identify.SP Ambala Rajesh Kalia remained incommunicado despite several attempts. Meanwhile, the associates of farmers who were booked, gathered in huge numbers at the SP office in Ambala city demanding quashing of the FIRs lodged against the farmers.In a political seasoning, several leaders from various political parties joined the aggrieved farmers at the SP office, backing them. Former Union minister Vinod Sharma, INLD state spokesperson Omkar Singh, Congress state treasurer Rohit Jain, HDF leader Chitra Sarwara were among those who supported the demands of farmers.Later in the evening, BKU state president Gurnam Singh Chaduni and the BKU’s senior leaders met IG (Ambala Range) Y Puran Kumar and SP Rajesh Kalia at the SP office. However, after the meeting, Chaduni said that there was no solid assurance from the police.“We will decide what to do next. But, one thing is for sure that the family is just playing in the hands of MP Naib Saini and he (Bharat) died of a heart attack. The villagers have told us that he had suffered three attacks earlier and why such an elderly was part of a rally,” said Chaduni.IG Kumar said that the investigation is underway and appropriate action will be taken by the district police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-who-died-at-pro-farm-rally-cremated-politics-escalates/story-VHLwiLpB1qWfwj3WnQ7u2L.html

15-10-2020||City||Present Delhi Medical Council president re-elected for second term||New Delhi: The incumbent president of the Delhi Medical Council, Dr Arun Gupta, has been re-elected for a second five-year term. The Delhi Medical Council is a statutory body that oversees the practice of modern medicine in the state and takes action against erring doctors in cases of medical negligence. Over 72,000 doctors are registered with the council. The president is elected by a 25-member general council – eight members elected by doctors, 10 members are nominated by 10 the medical colleges, four members are nominated by the Delhi government and one by the Delhi Medical Association. Apart from that two persons – the director general of health services and the dean of the faculty of medical sciences in DU – are ex-officio members of the council. The elections for the general assembly was held in March this year and among those elected were nephrologist and BC Roy awardee Dr Anil Kumar Bhalla, renowned cardiologist Dr Prem Agarwal, and former president of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) Dr Pankaj Solanki. Dr Gupta was elected by a majority of 16 of the 25 votes. During his previous term as the president, he digitised the entire functioning of the council. “Delhi medical council is extremely credible, with most of our judgments being upheld by the courts. There is a three-tier fool-proof system in place to ensure fair rulings. For my next term, I will work towards making Delhi quack-free. This was a plan we were working on with the Delhi government, but got delayed because of the delays in the mohalla clinic projects and other incidents like the riots and now the pandemic. But we plan to work on this aspect and make Delhi quack-free in a year,” said Dr Gupta. Congratulating him, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted, “Congratulations @dr_arunkgupta for getting Re-elected as the President Delhi Medical Council for another term of 5 years. We are proud of good work done by you and your team. Best wishes!” CM Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted, “Keep doing good work. My best wishes for new term.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/present-delhi-medical-council-president-re-elected-for-second-term/story-sDxEmZvswKtY2PBFqFLKnN.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||First round of DU admissions over, colleges wary of glitches in online system||The first round online admissions to Delhi University colleges may have concluded, but the experience of a completely virtual admissions process has left colleges cautious of subsequent cutoff lists and wary of technical glitches. Unlike previous years, when students had to visit colleges to secure admissions, this year, the entire process is online. While applications under first cutoff ended on Wednesday, students can pay the fee up to Friday. Till Thursday evening, 29,746 applicants had paid their fee. Of the 59,730 applicants under the first cutoff, 10,978 applicants have secured admissions. Several students, however, were alarmed by the “server error” message that popped up, due to which they were unable to pay the fee on Thursday evening.Chitransh Srivastava, 18, a resident of Sewapuri village near Varanasi, had applied for BA Programme in Shivaji College on Monday. The option to pay the fee appeared on the dashboard on Thursday evening, but an error message popped up when he attempted payment. “I stay in a remote area and my parents do not have a debit card. We will have take the help of a neighbour or someone with a debit card to make the payment. But for that, we need to know the exact amount,” he said.Even Delhi residents have complained of server errors. Prateek Chandera, a resident of east Delhi’s Mandawali, said he had applied to Deshbandhu College on Monday afternoon. “The payment link came on Wednesday afternoon. But I still haven’t been able to pay the fee due to server error. Friday is the last day to submit the fee and I am afraid of losing my seat due to the glitch,” he said.Dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said the university has formed a team to look into the problem. “Applicants can flag any error to the payment grievance helpline mentioned on DU website and their issues will be immediately resolved. We have a help desk manned by 10 persons for this. There was a minor payment server issue yesterday (Wednesday) due to heavy rain in Hyderabad but alternative arrangements were made,” she said.While principals have welcomed the lack of rush on campuses, the three-tier admission process-- document verification by the teacher in-charge, then the college admission committee, followed by the principal’s approval -- has created a backlog of applications, leading to a delay in approving admissions.Executive council member Rajesh Jha, who teaches at Rajdhani College, said, “Carrying out admissions under the first cutoff list is relatively less complex. In the subsequent lists, students would want to cancel their admission in one college and take admission in another and doing all that within a three-day window is usually more of a challenge.”Former academic council member Pankaj Garg said, “The application forms should be processed within 24 hours by colleges. They should not be held on to for days because if applications are rejected at the last minute, the student loses out on the chance to apply to another college.” According to the rules formed by DU’s admissions branch, while students can apply to multiple colleges, they cannot do so simultaneously and will have to wait until their application is processed by the first college.”Principals said while quick processing of applications is ideal, the reality is different. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “It was only while processing the applications of many students that we learnt that they had already taken admission in another college. This points to a technical fault somewhere.” Despite the lag, his college has approved over 1,000 admissions under first cutoff, which is about 300 more than what the college did (under first cutoff) in 2019.“Cancellations under the next cutoff won’t take much time. But the technical challenges will remain and they need to be addressed. Often, students from southern boards do not have their maximum and minimum marks printed on the front of the mark sheet which they upload on the portal. We have to call such students and ask them for the mark sheet and then calculate accordingly. All these take time,” he said.Colleges are also required to fill the reason for rejecting a form, which further causes a delay. Bagai explained, “The volume of applications is far more this year as students can apply from their homes. Students with aggregates far below the required cutoffs are also applying and since colleges have to process all applicants, the whole process takes time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/first-round-of-du-admissions-over-colleges-wary-of-glitches-in-online-system/story-eI3inYpQtfhRolwloMjT2I.html

Dressed immaculately in a uniform – white shirt and blue trousers – 15-year-old Panchal was one among the many students who had come for regular classed that recommenced at government schools from Thursday. Panchal had hismother Krishna Devi, who recently lost her husband as well as her job during the lockdown phase, in tow. “It was getting difficult to pay private school fees. As we have limited sources of livelihood now, I had to shift my son to a government school so that he did not miss a year,” said Devi.Likewise, at the government senior secondary school for boys near old Civil Hospital, Lalita Sharma had come with her son Priyanshu, a newly enrolled Class 9 student, on Thursday, the first day of the classroom sessions. “Priyanshu had to be shifted from a private school in Jharsa to a government school nearby as we couldn’t afford the fees and his father is not getting his full salary these days. There are other expenditures of the family which cannot be handled if we kept paying private school fees,” said Sharma. Thursday was the first time students, who had switched over from private schools to government ones mostly due to financial constraints in their family , visited their new schools.Gurugram, like neighbouring Delhi, has been witnessing an uptick in students migrating from private to government schools. Suman Sharma, principal of Model Government Senior Secondary School in sector 4/7 said that 425 students from private schools had recently enrolled with them. Of the these, 412 have already submitted their School Leaving Certificates (SLCs). Likewise, in a government school near old Civil Hospital, 196 students had switched from private schools. “School fee payment has been the key issue that triggered the switch. The numbers are significantly high this time, compared to previous years,” said Sharma.Data released by the education department in July end showed that 43,000 students across the state had already taken admissions in government schools and over 82,000 were awaiting their School Leaving Certificates (SLCs). In Gurugram, at least 2453 students had migrated to government schools. When HT approached the district education officer Indu Boken for the revised data, she was unavailable for the comment. Teachers, however, worried that managing increased student load in a batch would be challenging as they were not allowed to call students of a class together to school. According to them, many existing and new students were not even active during virtual classes, which was a cause of concern. According to them, nearly 25% students are have not been active during online classes. “These kids either lack phones/computers. Some are in the process of submitting their SLCs. Therefore, for regular classes, our focus has been on those who are not active online and those who have recently switched from private schools,” said Geeta Arya of senior secondary school near old Civil Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/financial-strain-a-trigger-as-many-hop-from-private-schools-to-government-ones-in-gurugram/story-ALu1rRF473TDYwJx9II2aN.html
15-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Govt schools open partially for all, virus scare remains||Government schools in Gurugram reopened for regular sessions of all class 9 to 12 students on Thursday, more than seven months after being shut owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and close to a month after the government allowed partial reopening of schools for students of Class 9 and Class 12 on a voluntary basis to seek guidance from teachers. On Thursday, a few big government schools witnessed an uptick in the number of students coming to attend classes. The footfall at the smaller schools, however, remained negligible.Government Model Senior Secondary School in sector 4/7 saw more than 250 students turning up for their classes on Thursday, of the at least 1,600 who are enrolled in classes 9 to 12. “From September 21,after the guidance classes had commenced, over 150 students were visiting the school every day anyway. Today (on Thursday) from 9am, many students arrived. Some of them came had come along with their parents to just see the arrangements in the classroom,” said Suman Sharma, school principal.Before entering their respective classes, students were made to stand in a queue within circles drawn at the entrance to ensure physical distancing. Their name, section and body temperature were noted. Also, they were asked to apply sanitiser. Even inside the classrooms, the students were made to sit on alternate benches, told to maintain physical distance of two feet from each other always and wear masks. Kavita Sapra, English teacher at the sector 4/7 school said that subject-wise classes have been scheduled. “Students were informed about the classes on Whatsapp group. Some were asked to visit the school compulsorily, while many others came on their own,” said Sapra, adding that a proper roster will be prepared once regular classes start for all students. Presently, teachers are asking students to come in slots as per their roll numbers. A teacher will teach the same topic daily, for a week, till all the students have caught up, Sharma said. “These classes are not webcast, neither will they be videographed. We will first cover topics which have been specifically highlighted by students on Whatsapp groups ,” said Sharma.As reported by HT on October 13, the state education minister Kanwar Pal and senior officials had said that schools will be reopening for regular classes for students of 9 to 12 from October 15. Classes were to be held for three hours, from 9 am till noon. Pal had also said that not more than 20 students will be accommodated in a single classroom. Also, no consent letter from parents for students attending such classes will be required. Sapra, however, said that they are still taking consent letters.Likewise, government senior secondary school for boys, near old Civil Hospital, also witnessed an increased footfall of students. Geeta Arya, principal of the school said that every day nearly 50 students from class 9 to 12 used to turn up for guidance classes till now. On Thursday, the number shot up to 163.“Parents are calling teachers to enquire about the reopening of schools. Since there has been no official notification till now, we are continuing with the guidance class schedule. Our aim is to ensure that a student attends school at least twice a week,” said Arya. According to her, a student is to attend at least three guidance classes, 45 minutes each, where they come with their queries related to the subject. In Arya’s school, the student strength from class 9 to 12 is at least 1076, out of which 183 students are in class 10 and 243 in class 12. She said that since admission in government schools has increased this year, chalking out a plan for conducting classes for all subjects while ensuring physical distancing norm would be a task. “Everyone cannot be called in one go. Admissions for class 9 to 12 has spiked this year. So, to ensure every student attends school while accommodating only 20 student per classroom will be difficult,” said Arya. At least 196 students from private schools have taken admission in the all-boys school this year so far in classes 9 to 12. Others schools in Jacobpura and Islampur saw a more tepid response. In Jacobpura, government school for girls received a footfall of only 30 students, out of the 1456 students in class 9 to 12. “We did not ask students to visit as there has been no official instructions by the state government on the same. The parents are even reluctant to send their girls,” said Sunil Kumar, principal of Jacobpura school. Likewise, in Islampur school only 27 students turned up, according to the school principal Raj Kumar. District education officer Indu Boken, she was unavailable for the comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-govt-schools-open-partially-for-all-virus-scare-remains/story-6ulJy4RBeb70l5xATXaT7M.html
15-10-2020||Chandigarh||MLA, councillors ask Ludhiana mayor to expedite development works||: With councillors and residents raising hue and cry over pending developments works, MLA Surinder Dawar along with councillors of the central constituency conducted a meeting with mayor Balkar Sandhu at his camp office on Thursday. The leaders said that the MC should take up development works at the earliest, otherwise it will have a negative impact on the Congress party at the 2022 legislative assembly elections. The councillors raised concern over development projects including construction of roads, non-functional street lights, installation of interlocking tiles and tubewells among others. Some of the development works are hanging fire for around a year.Senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said, “Some development works have not been started as the work orders have not been issued by the MC. We have asked the Mayor to conduct a meeting of the finance and contracts committee (F and CC) of MC so that the work orders are issued at the earliest. If the MC fails to start the development projects, it will put a blot on the image of Congress party in the next legislative assembly elections.” MLA Surinder Dawar said that the meeting was conducted to expedite the development works and strict action will be taken against officials and contractors who will delay them. “I have told officials to get themselves transferred if they are not willing to work efficiently. Strict action would be taken against the officials for delay in development works. Mayor has assured that the issues raised by the councillors will be resolved at the earliest,” said Dawar. ”Directions have already been issued to officials and contractors to expedite development works. If some contractor deliberately delays any work, action will be taken against him. We will also be conducting the meeting of F and CC soon for approving different developments projects,” Sandhu said.MC staff accused of charging money for manhole coversDuring the meeting, Navneet Singh Ghayal , councillor of ward number 20, accused the MC staff of charging money for installation of manhole covers outside a factory in Industrial area A.Ghayal alleged that he had approached the MC staff to install three manholes outside a factory in the industrial area. The staff replied that manholes are not available at present and will be made available soon. Also, they said that the site is private and MC cannot install the covers. “However, a few days back, I came to know that one of the staff members installed the covers and took Rs 1,500 from the factory owner. This has not only put a blot on my image in the area, but it has also blown the lid of corrupt practices of MC staff. I have demanded strict action against the staff concerned and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal has marked an inquiry into the matter,” said Ghayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mla-councillors-ask-ludhiana-mayor-to-expedite-development-works/story-qy5QkSUu5GMMMb0gemhzyM.html

We shall be able to share the data in a day or two,” he said.Meanwhile, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday deployed 40 water sprinklers on stretches with high dust accumulation — Udyog Vihar, Sohna Road, Vatika Chowk, Huda City Centre, Vikas Sadan, the entirety of the Dwarka Expressway, Leisure Valley Ground in Sector 29, Rajeev Chowk, Basai Chowk and sector roads.MCG on Saturday also set up an ‘air lab’ in Sector 29, where officials involved in the Grap implementation will compile and analyse data related to the enforcement measures. MCG officials also said that the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Sameer app, which accumulates social media complaints on waste dumping, garbage burning and other offences, will be monitored from the lab.“MCG is committed to ensuring compliance of Grap measures. Under this, officers have been assigned the responsibility area-wise. To prevent dust from blowing on the roads, 40 water sprinklers have been installed, which will continuously spray treated water from the sewerage treatment plants on roads and trees every day. An air lab has also been established to monitor and resolve complaints received through various channels in a timely manner,” said Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG.The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) constituted five teams and appointed a nodal officer to implement the Grap measures. The DTCP, under the directions issued by deputy commissioner of Gurugram, will ensure the National Green Tribunal (NGT) norms are implemented at construction sites, as part of the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority’s (Epca) action plan to curb pollution.It will also check the use of diesel gensets in commercial and residential projects having an area of more than 2,000 square metres.

15-10-2020||Gurugram||HSVP plans mega auction of plots, aims to rake in Rs 2,000 crore||Buoyed by the success of four auctions in the past three months in which it managed to rake in more than Rs 250 crore, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has planned a mega auction of plots on October 23, targeting more than Rs 2,000 crore. Prime properties, including sites for malls, office towers and nursing homes located in prime areas such as sector 29, sector 52, 47, have been listed for sale, officials said. The rates of some of the plots has been listed above Rs 300 crore and officials expect that buyers, who have depth and ability to develop such properties, will bid for these sites spread across the city. According to details shared by HSVP, two large commercial sites, one site for a mall and two sites for office towers in sector 29, will be put on the block in this auction. The reserved price of these properties alone is around Rs 1,200 crore as sector 29 adjoining the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway is a prime commercial area where top corporates and government institutions have set up their headquarters. A South Korean auto major had bought a plot here for over Rs 200 crore two years ago to set up its headquarters, officials said. Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP Gurugram, said the authority has planned the mega auction as it had got a strong response in earlier auctions. “We have listed premium sites for auction after identifying them and the authority is expecting that these would be sold at a higher than the reserved price as the locations are very good and will generate good business and presence for businesses that invest in these properties,” said Kalia. The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran has been driven to monetise its properties across the state, particularly in Gurugram, because it is facing a severe financial crunch. HSVP has a loan burden of around Rs 12,000 crore, an RTI filed by city based activist Aseem Takyar revealed recently. Officials said that assets are being monetised to reduce this debt and finance other projects as well. Among those listed by the authority include two commercial complex sites in sector 41; a site for a clinic in sector 9; plots for clinics and nursing homes in sector 9A, a clinic site in sector 10 A; two clinic sites and a nursing home site in sector 38; two nursing home sites in sector 46; two sites for nursing home in sector 47; two nursing home sites and a clinic site in Rewari; a nursing school in sector 5; two school sites in sector 9; two school sites sector 9A; a school site in sector 10A; and three nursery school sites in Rewari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-plans-mega-auction-of-plots-aims-to-rake-in-rs-2-000-crore/story-qYweg6SZ3QBchrkxfZuL4H.html

15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh grain market traders go on indefinite strike||The market welfare association of the Sector 26 Grain Market will go on an indefinite strike on Friday against high parking fees being levied on traders.Speaking on the issue, president of the association Ram Karan Gupta said, “The two-hour window for a single entry of vehicles is unjust. For parking commercial vehicles, contractors charge up to ₹250 per day. Moreover, as a part of their contract they can increase the parking fee yearly for the next four years.”The association had earlier organised a strike in September but the authorities took no action against the parking contractor due to which the traders called for an indefinite strike. On Saturday, members of the Fruits and Vegetables Market Association of Sector 26 will join the strike.

15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Organising ‘Ravana Dehan’ an uphill task for committees in Ludhiana||: With the district administration allowing Ramleela and Ravana Dehan to be held on the occasion of Dussehra (October 25), organising the events will be an uphill task this year. Ensuring social distancing at the Ravana Dehan sites and broadcasting the event are among the major challenges being faced by the organisers this year. They will also have to arrange masks, hand sanitisers and hand wash facilities for attendees. While some Dussehra committee in the city have announced they will organise Ravana Dehan on October 25, others have decided to abstain from organising any event citing the risk involved. Shri Ram Lila Committee (Daresi) and president of Upkar Nagar Dussehra Committee have already announced that they will not organise Ramleela, but Ravana Dehan will be held with limited gathering. Covid monitors (guards) will be deployed at the spot to ensure adherence to safety norms. Dinesh Marwaha, a member of Shri Ram Lila Committee, said, “Daresi fair and the Ravana Dehan is famous across North India and we do not want to break the tradition of celebrations which is ongoing for decades. We will not establish a 90-feet Ravana this year and the height will be reduced to around 30 feet, but Ravana Dehan will be held. The effigy artists from Agra will reach the city in a day or so to ensure it is set-up in time. The event will be held with limited gathering and security would be deployed to restrict movement of residents. It is a major challenge for us, but we will seek help from police department for the same. No Ramleela will be staged but Ramayana Paath will be held at Sita Mata Mandir starting from October 17.”“As the gathering will be restricted, we will broadcast Ravana Dehan live through social media platforms and with the help of local cable operators. We are making arrangements for the same”, said Marwaha. Similarly, president of Upkar Nagar Dussehra committee, Channi Gill, said they will be organising Ravana Dehan in with limited gathering. He said it will be a low-key event and no public gathering will be allowed. The height of the effigy will also be reduced. Gill added they are also in touch with Shri Ram Lila Committee for making arrangements to broadcast Ravana Dehan live. Meanwhile, a section of Dussehra committees have also decided to stay away from organising Ravan Dehan this year citing the risk involved.KP Gosain, general secretary of Krishna Mandir Trust, Model Town Extension, said that the administration has allowed committees to organise the event with limited gatherings and on their own responsibility. If anything goes wrong the administration will take action against the organisers only. “It is very difficult to handle the gathering, especially when an event is being organised in the open. We have made up our mind that we will not organise Ravana Dehan in Model Town Extension market this year as it is unsafe for residents,” Gosain said. President of Rajguru Nagar Dussehra Committee, BM Kalia, said,”We would not be organising an event this year. we had decided it even before the government took up the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/organising-ravana-dehan-an-uphill-task-for-committees/story-IpLRpI8JhSNyDjImpHcEiM.html

There were people trapped on the floor above and there was only one staircase. But we managed to help them get down eventually,” said Sanjeev Kumar Singh, fire station officer, Phase 1. The trapped people were rescued via the terrace and it took more than an hour to completely control the fire. Officials of the fire departments said that a short circuit may have caused the fire and because the storage space was cluttered, it spread quickly but was contained to only one floor.In a separate incident, the house of a Ghaziabad based man in sector 37 caught fire on Wednesday night.“The incident was reported around 8 pm. The owner, Vibhore, has a house in Ghaziabad also where his wife lives. The fire was contained in less than an hour and the only damage was to his flat,” said Azad Singh Tomar, station house officer, sector 39 police station.He said that prima facie it seems that the man himself lit the fire under the influence of alcohol.“When we reached the spot, the stench of kerosene oil and alcohol was strong suggesting that he himself lit the fire.

15-10-2020||Noida||Man flees with ₹70 lakh from Mumbai, arrested in Greater Noida||The GB Nagar police on Wednesday evening arrested from Greater Noida a man who had allegedly fled with ₹70 lakh belonging to a businessman in Mumbai. Police identified the suspect as Gulnawaz, 30, alias Arif and said he and his brother were involved in the alleged theft. Gulnawaz had then booked a taxi with two drivers, from Mumbai to his home town in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. But when the Bisrakh police stopped the car for checking in Greater Noida West, they found the stolen cash and arrested him, a senior officer said. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said Gulnawaz had taken a flight from Delhi to Mumbai on October 11, on his brother Shahnawaz’s directions. For a few days, he stayed with 34-year-old Shahnawaz, who works with an exports company in Mumbai. Shahnawaz allegedly stole a cash bag from his employer Hasan, and handed it over to Gulnawaz, who fled with it from Mumbai on Monday, police said. Chander said Bisrakh police was conducting a routine checking near Char Murti roundabout on Wednesday 4pm when they spotted a Tata Zest car, with a Maharashtra registration number. “The police stopped the car for checking and found a bag full of cash inside,” he said. The police brought all three occupants of the car -- Gulnawaz and drivers Giriraj Sharma, a resident of Hathras, and Ravi Nair, a resident of Mumbai – to Bisrakh police station for further interrogation. The police also procured a currency counting machine from a nearby bank and ascertained that the bag contained ₹69,18,900 in denominations of ₹2,000, 500, 200 and 100.Bisrakh police registered a case against the suspects Gulnawaz and Shahnawaz under Section 414 (assisting in concealment of stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code and also under Section 41 (notice of appearance before police officer) and Section 102 (power of police officer to seize certain property) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Complainant Munish Chauhan, SHO, Bisrakh police station, in the FIR stated that during interrogation, Gulnawaz revealed that his brother had given him the cash bag. “Shahnawaz works in an exports company and he is close to the firm owner, Hasan. Hasan had recently changed the lock of his house and had allegedly given a key to Shahnawaz. Shahnawaz later came to know that Hasan kept huge amounts of cash in his flat. When Hasan went out of city on business, Shahnawaz allegedly stole the cash and called his brother Gulnawaz to Mumbai to collect it,” he said. Chander said the two drivers were not involved in the crime. “We have seized the money and the car used in the crime. Shahnawaz has gone incommunicado and his mobile number is not reachable. We are also trying to contact Hasan to know why he kept huge amounts of cash in his flat. We will contact the Mumbai police to investigate the matter further,” Chander said. Gulnawaz was produced in court and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-flees-with-70-lakh-from-mumbai-arrested-in-greater-noida/story-0LhP0li3zQVKLGSzlwsFaL.html
15-10-2020||Noida||Proposed 111km Upper Ganga Canal road project gets finance committee approval||In a major development which will pave the way for development of an additional canal road from Ghaziabad to Haridwar over a distance of about 111km, the Uttar Pradesh government’s expenditure and finance committee has given approval to the project, which is pegged at ₹628 crore. The officials of the public works department (PWD) said the proposal will be taken to the Uttar Pradesh cabinet for final approval.The two-lane canal road is proposed from Haridwar to Ghaziabad on the right-side bank of the Upper Ganga Canal which originates from Haridwar. At present, the left flank is developed over two-lanes. The project was announced two years ago by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who wanted a bypass road for commuters as well as for Kanwariyas, who pass through during the annual Kanwar Yatra pilgrimage and use the main Delhi-Meerut-Road for movement. “The project is now approved by the expenditure and finance committee and will be taken up by the UP cabinet. Once approved, the project will get developed in two years as we already have the land available. This will be a major boost for commuters as it will act as a bypass for those travelling up to Haridwar and will also serve those travelling to Meerut, Muzaffarnagar etc,” said Sandeep Kumar, chief engineer (Meerut), UP PWD. The existing canal road on the right side, upstream of the UGC, starts from Muradnagar and is two-laned at present. It caters to light traffic but is not used by Kanwariyas. “Once the other side of the 111km project is developed, it can be conveniently used for movement of Kanwariyas who take up the foot journey from Haridwar during the Kanwar Yatra. During times other than the Kanwar Yatra, the road will be used by light vehicles,” Kumar, added.In December last year, the UP PWD had initiated a proposal for the 111km road project which will be taken up between Muradnagar in Ghaziabad and up to Purkaji near the UP-Uttarakhand border. The project also includes the cost of compensatory afforestation and utility shifting, besides construction of flyovers, rail over bridges and bridges midway. During the months of July/August when the Kanwar Yatra takes place, lakhs of devotees use the main Delhi-Meerut Road from Haridwar and the situation every year leads to closure of the road which largely affects commuters, commercial vehicles and even schools and colleges which are forced to close down. The Ghaziabad officials of the UP PWD said that the newly proposed road involves a 12km stretch in Ghaziabad, besides about 42km in Meerut district and the rest in Muzaffarnagar district. Right now, a commuter has to travel about 180km from Ghaziabad to reach Haridwar through the Delhi Meerut Road. PWD officials said that the proposed project will also become viable and within reach of a greater number of commuters as two major projects of Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) and regional rapid transit system (RRTS) are also getting developed nearby. “So, more commuters from Delhi, etc., will have easy access to the canal road in order to reach Haridwar and further to tourist places in Uttarakhand. The road will also lessen the burden on the Delhi Meerut Road which is shut for at least 10-15 days during Kanwar season,” said Akash Vashishtha, a resident of Raj Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/proposed-111km-upper-ganga-canal-road-project-gets-finance-committee-approval/story-3kdITdp6C2RdUt7hIZJx3N.html

Police said they recovered 107 ATM cards.According to officers, they were arrested from near Sector 62 following a tip-off from an informant.“It is an inter-state gang that has been active in Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Mumbai, etc. They would defraud people on the pretext of helping them with their transactions and then swap the victim’s card with one of their own after taking a note of the PIN number. Once the victim would leave, they would withdraw money and flee,” said joint commissioner of police Luv Kumar.He said the gang would specifically target elderly persons or those who were not tech savvy, in order to dupe them.“Their modus operandi also involved targeting ATM kiosks where no security guard was posted or booths that are not frequently used by the public. Sometimes they would also target ‘out of order’ ATMs. They knew that transactions at such a place won’t happen. So they would simply remove the warning board and then wait for users before swapping the cards,” said Kumar.Police said one of the suspects, Manish, would allegedly steal cards from wallets and then sell those to two other members of the gang, Saurabh and Harendra. These cards would then be used as duplicates while swapping at ATM kiosks. All the suspects are in their late twenties and early thirties, said the police, adding that the gang has been active for the past six to seven years and that all suspects have an extensive criminal history.Police also recovered ₹4.02 lakh from the suspects, four stolen wallets and a Swift car. Other cases in which they may be involved are being looked into.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/seven-men-arrested-for-switching-atm-cards-107-stolen-cards-recovered/story-HCUEwmskB6MjCSnxIHHyeL.html
15-10-2020||Noida||Surface parking scrapped in Noida’s Sector 18 market, Noida authority to operate multilevel parking facility||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Thursday said it has scrapped surface parking,or on-the-road parking, in Sector 18 – the city’s biggest commercial hub. The authority has also decided to make this commercial area a ‘no vehicle zone’ by the end of next month.The area was to become a vehicle-free zone from March 23 this year, in order to contain pollution caused due to traffic caused by haphazard parking on the internal roads of the market, which narrows space for vehicular and pedestrian movement. The authority had taken this decision on March 19, 2020 after the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) chairman Bhure Lal, in December last year, had suggested that the commercial hub be made a vehicle free zone to check pollution.However, the plan could not be implemented due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. In July, the authority announced it will be done from October 2, when air pollution starts increasing in the region.The plan was again delayed though, with parking continuing on the roads unabated. Officials said the authority has also realised that the multi-level parking (MLP) facility, which was built for this commercial hub, has failed to make any revenue as commuters prefer parking on the roads rather than using the six-floor facility. Facing severe revenue losses, real estate firm DLF, which was operating both surface and MLP facilities, surrendered the work order.Officials said the authority hopes that scrapping road parking will help direct motorists to the MLP and hence bring in revenue. The DLF had on February 1, 2018, started managing the MLP in Sector 18, which has a capacity of 4,000 vehicles. It was also looking after parking operations at surface (roadside) with a capacity of 1,000 vehicles. DLF, as per agreement, was to pay a minimum Rs75 lakh per month for parking to the authority.When contacted, spokespersons of the DLF group refused to comment on the issue.“We have started operating the multi-level car parking on our own after DLF surrendered the same. We have decided to ban parking on the surface area (roadside) of this market. We will also make this market a ‘no vehicle zone’ to make it pedestrian friendly,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority. The deadline for the implementation of this initiative has been set for November-end.Roadside parking on the internal roads in this area aids congestion. During peak hours, pedestrian movement in the market becomes a nightmare with vehicles occupying every available space, with some trying to wade their way through to the entries or exits of the commercial hub. In order to make this initiative a success, the authority has decided to discuss the issue with all stakeholders, including traders. Back in 1996, when Sector 18 was rolled out as a commercial hub, it was touted as Noida’s most upcoming destination for shopping and other commerce. Today, it houses a five star hotel, two shopping malls, offices and commercial towers as well as several eateries and restaurants, and retail outlets.Two years before this, the authority had come up with a ‘first-come-first-serve’ plot scheme to lure investors who can set-up shops and dwellings in this 80 acres commercial area carved out of agricultural patch, located along the Dadri road, which was the only connect between East Delhi and Dadri town.Traders, however, said they are not happy with the authority’s move.“The authority started making the Sector 18 market a no-vehicle-zone from October 2 forcefully. But nobody would agree to this plan as it is impractical. No shop owner would park his vehicle in the MLP and walk a kilometre to his shop. The same goes with visitors. This plan of a no-vehicle-zone would kill business in the area. We will protest against this plan as it is not feasible. The authority said that it is being implemented in light of the graded response action plan (Grap) to reduce air pollution by reducing the number of vehicles in the market. Why is this plan not being implemented in markets of the entire city then,” said SK Jain, president of the Sector 18 market welfare association.Shoppers, though, welcomed the move.“Traffic in this market is a complete mess. At times we prefer not to visit this market due to the congestion on all internal roads. A no-vehicle-zone idea is good as it will free up space for pedestrian movement in the market,” said Deepak Mittal, a resident of Sector 30.Since parking is located at quite a distance from the market, visitors said they want carts to ferry them.“The authority should run carts to ferry visitors from the MLP to the market as walking such a long distance will not be easy for everyone, especially during the summer season. Also, the management of the parking should be experienced and professional, so that visitors do not face any inconvenience,” said Bhumika Singh, a resident of Sector 61. According to the authority’s rules, visitors will have to pay R30 for the first two hours for a four wheeler and for each additional hour, one needs to pay R10. For a two wheeler one will have to pay R5 per hour. The parking will remain open from 9am to 11pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/surface-parking-scrapped-in-noida-s-sector-18-market-noida-authority-to-operate-multilevel-parking-facility/story-W6qu7Hy4K8Yal2nrWqXQPN.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||10 lakh construction workers will soon be registered by Labour Welfare Board: Manish Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday took charge of the Labour department of Delhi government and set an ambitious target of registration of 10 lakh construction workers with the Labour Welfare Board in the coming months.He asserted that every single construction worker in Delhi will be registered with the Board and the government will ease the registration process. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal effected change in his cabinet, relieving Sisodia’s predecessor Gopal Rai of the charge of the Labour department to enable him to focus on the Environment department amid rising air pollution levels in Delhi.After taking over the additional charge, Sisodia held his first meeting with the Labour Board and officials of the department and directed them to remove bottlenecks that prevented construction workers from getting registered and verified.“Construction workers are the city builders of our nation and it is our responsibility to serve them. In Delhi, not a single worker should be left unregistered,” he said.Sisodia thanked the Chief Minister for entrusting him with responsibility of the important portfolio, and took stock of the ongoing works.The Delhi Government will run a large-scale campaign to ensure 10 lakh construction workers are registered in the coming months. This will ensure that they can avail benefits in an orderly and timely fashion, he said.He also said his priority was to ensure immediate verification of the pending 66,000 workers and put an efficient system in place for new registrations and verifications in the coming months.Delhi Government provides various schemes and benefits under the Building and Other Constructions Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act. To avail these benefits, the workers have to get registered with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board.  Currently, there are 52,000 members of the Board who are registered and verified. Another 66,000 are registered but their verification is pending, said an official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/10-lakh-construction-workers-will-soon-be-registered-by-labour-welfare-board-manish-sisodia/story-zyHZ71FKSnh0bq4RUIuKlO.html
15-10-2020||Noida||Noida schools to open from Monday, attendance not compulsory as online classes to continue||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration on Thursday asked the schools in the city, to continue with the online classes for students whose parents were not willing to send them to schools. They were also asked to hold physical classes for the rest, irrespective of the strength.The Uttar Pradesh government, following the central government guidelines, had allowed schools to open for classes 9 to 12, albeit following certain rules, from October 19.District magistrate Suhas LY said, “Students will not be compelled to attend classes physically. The online classes for them will continue. Students need their parents’ written consent to attend school.” The DM further said that the physical classes will be held in two shifts. “In the first shift, classes of 9 and 10 will be held while in the second shift, the schools will take classes of 11 and 12. Only 50% of the total students will be called in a single shift, the rest will be called the next day,” Suhas said. He also said that it was mandatory for the schools to have thermal scanner and other essential medical facilities. “The schools must ensure sanitization of the campus, classes, washrooms and playgrounds daily and after each shift as well. Proper social distancing must be maintained even while doing all these arrangements,” the DM added. Kamini Bhasin, the principal of DPS Noida said that the administration is taking all precautionary measures to ensure proper safety of children and teachers. “We are ready to follow all safety protocols. Even if less than 5% parents have given consent to send their children to our school, we’ll organise proper classes for them,” she said. Renu Singh, the principal of Amity school (Noida), who also attended this meeting, said that schools have been asked to arrange classes for the students, irrespective of their numbers. “Apart from classroom classes, we’ll continue with the online classes. We have been asked to follow all standard protocols in the campus,” she said. Gaurav Kumar Seth, a parent and resident of Sector 137, said that there is no reason to take risk, if the online classes are continuing. “I am waiting for the cases to come down. If my children are enjoying their online classes, why should me or the school compel them to attend offline classes.” Another parent Dinesh Kumar, who lives in sector 77, said that sending children to classes in this pandemic time is like playing with their lives. “I’ll not my send my children to their schools for at least another six months. They are very comfortable with their online classes, so I don’t find any reason to disturb them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-schools-to-open-from-monday-attendance-not-compulsory-as-online-classes-to-continue/story-IZJusaHvsxJERza7D6AcgO.html
15-10-2020||Noida||Noida to buy land to develop a new Sector 145||Noida authority on Thursday decided to buy farm land to develop sector 145, located along Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, as a residential sector. The land was marked to be developed as a residential sector in 2013-’14. Farmers who gave their land for development would be compensated with residential plots. The authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari had, in November 2019, directed the land department and other staff to develop this sector. However, the development did not go forward as around 40% farmers had filed cases in the Allahabad high court. They sought higher compensation for their land. As a result the authority delayed the development of basic civic amenities such as roads, drains, parks, markets and green belt etc. The cases are still pending in the court.Moreover, while the authority did allot plots to the farmers who sold their land to it, it failed to provide possession.These plots are of size 80 square metres to 500 square metres and those, who got allotted plots in sector 145, are worried lot because their investment is stuck.“The authority should not have allotted plots to farmers and others, who invested in buying the plots, if it had not land for the same. We are not sure if the authority will develop it now,” said Amit Chaudhary, a plot owner.“We have directed the land department to buy the land directly from farmers and carry out the work,” said Maheshwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-to-buy-land-to-develop-a-new-sector-145/story-G43LpUk7tnfSbumC3gXpXO.html
15-10-2020||Noida||Winter setting in, Ghaziabad yet to repair potholed roads||Although the Ghaziabad district administration, with a hope to reduce pollution before winter, ordered agencies to take adequate measures in September, potholed roads remain unfixed. According to the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB), there are 78 stretches -- of which 41 are in the trans-Hindon area --in the city that are in a state of disrepair. Such roads can often result in increased particulate matter and spike pollution. The list of 41 potholed stretches in trans-Hindon include the ones at Atal Chowk, Budh Chowk in Vasundhara while others are spotted near Pinnacle Tower, Shipra Sun City, DPS Indirapuram, CISF Road, Ahimsa Khand I and II and Shakti Khand III among others in Indirapuram. The locality of Vausndhara has further list of spots in sector-6, sector-5, sector-2b and sector-9 among others. In Vaishali, the spots affected are in sector-5, near Design Arch highrise among others while in Kaushambi the spots are located near Yashoda Hospital, near Pacific Mall among others. The residents said that the condition of roads have gone bad to worse after the monsoon season. “We have been writing to the authority to get the repairs done but no one acted. Even the pipeline laying work on the CISF road has been prolonged and giving nightmares to daily commuters. The other side of the CISF road which is is use is also in bas shape,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners. “Due to bad roads, commuters face issues besides there is pollution on account of fuel during traffic snarls and such roads also contribute to dust emission which finally affects air quality,” he added. VN Singh, the chief engineer of Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) said that tenders for Indirapuram and Swarnjayantipuram localities under GDA jurisdiction have been floated. “We expect that the road repair works will be taken up in another one week. For the CISF Road we plan to get it repaired only when the work for the pipeline laying gets complete. Otherwise, the repairs will further get deteriorated due to ongoing work,” he added. In a their recently concluded study, ‘Monitoring of total road dust and dust particles up to 75 microns (aerodynamic particle) on selected main roads of Ghaziabad City,’ the UPPCB found dust concentrations in the range between 14.43 to 579.54 grams per square metres (g/m²) at 18 different road stretches in Ghaziabad. The study also found that dust particles up to 75 microns in size were found to be concentrated between 2.22 to 154.37 g/m² at the 18 stretches. The study gave officials an insight into the dust emission issues which need to be taken up for different roads. Meanwhile, the other areas suffering potholes and bad road patches were identified in cis-Hindon areas like Raj Nagar Extension, Shastri Nagar, Hindon Vihar, Pratap Vihar, Meerut Road industrial area, Bulandhshar Road industrial area, South Side GT Road industrial area among others. “There will be many more areas which might be having potholes and need to be identified. Since the corporation is a maintenance agency it should have a separate head for annual maintenance contract for road repairs and it will be better if they have road repair machines available with them for immediate repairs,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation. “The road repair works if taken during the winter season will take time for the bitumen to settle down. And, it will be difficult to restrict commuters to pass through it. Ideally, all the repair works should have been completed well before the graded response action plan comes into effect,” he added. Municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said that the corporation has already floated tenders for about 30-35 roads under phase 1. “The works are likely to get complete by end of October. Meanwhile, tenders for other roads will be taken up in phase 2 and these can be taken up in November. We are ensuring that the works are taken up at the earliest and repairs taken up,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/winter-setting-in-ghaziabad-yet-to-repair-potholed-roads/story-ywiS2r70foErxwg8puj9EJ.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi-NCR pollution report absolves Punjab of the blame: Amarinder Singh||With the Centre saying stubble burning contributed only four per cent to pollution in Delhi, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday stressed the latest data has vindicated his government’s stance. Flaying his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal, the Punjab chief minister asked him to “stop lying” to divert attention from his “failure” to protect the national capital’s environment. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi said stubble burning contributed only four per cent to the Delhi-NCR pollution with the rest caused by local factors. The Punjab CM slammed Kejriwal for refusing to accept results of comprehensive studies on the issue. In fact, it is Kejriwal who was in denial, said Amarinder Singh in a statement. If Kejriwal is serious about addressing Delhi’s crisis, he should stop being in denial immediately and get down to the task of finding solutions, the chief minister said. Kejriwal, said the CM, had been spreading “misinformation” on the issue with the sole agenda of keeping people of Delhi in the dark about the actual situation, which his government had “failed miserably” to handle over the years. The fact is that there is absolutely no data to support the claims of the Delhi chief minister, he said, adding that in contrast, studies showed that stubble burning was only a minuscule part of the national capital’s problem. The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in a research paper based on data for 2018 and 2019 has found that Delhi’s pollution is localised and not attributable to farm fires in Punjab or the NCR. It pointed out that the air quality index of Punjab is much better than Delhi. Amarinder Singh said this is something Punjab has been maintaining for the past several years. The chief minister said Kejriwal had been taking refuge in “brazen falsehoods” to divert public attention from the AAP government’s “total failure”. “Even today, the skies in Punjab are clear and the AQI levels much better than those in Delhi,” Amarinder Singh said. The Punjab CM said the main cause of Delhi’s pollution was construction and demolition activities. The Punjab CM claimed that his government is doing its best to reduce stubble burning to cleanse the air. Unfortunately, farmers are facing a massive problem in managing paddy straw in the absence of fiscal aid from the Centre despite repeated pleas, he stressed. He reiterated his demand for Rs 100 a quintal as financial support from the Centre to eliminate the problem in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-ncr-pollution-report-absolves-punjab-of-the-blame-amarinder-singh/story-2O8C1ai5hDifBUfZ89Bw4I.html

Earlier, ordinary mails, registered post, speed post and parcels had the same delivery system and took up to two to three days to deliver.With an increase in volume of parcels, it was required to separate the systems so that customers can get their deliveries timely.To ensure this, postmen will go to customers’ doorsteps on two-wheelers and for heavy parcels, special pick-up vans will be deputed. The postal department has sufficient employees and will ensure the parcel is delivered the same day it is received at the NDC. “There was a need to provide quick service to customers, so, we decided to open a nodal centre to centralise the delivery of parcels. This was also necessary to boost e-commerce,” said Hari Mohan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-started-to-speed-up-delivery-of-parcels-in-ludhiana/story-wr4AzoEWxb7yOTbROKtlAK.html
15-10-2020||City||Ludhiana man, wife and relative booked for duping nephew of Rs 5 crore||A Gurdev Nagar resident, along with his wife and relative, has been booked for a fraud of Rs 5 crore on the complaint of his nephew. The FIR has been lodged after a 10-month long investigation by the police. The accused have been identified as Kailash Agarwal and Rajni Agarwal of Gurdev Nagar, and Manmohan Agarwal. Complainant Rohit Gupta, 42, of Khanna alleged that Kailash, who is his maternal uncle, owns a realty firm, in which he was offered partnership in 2013. Gupta said he bought 58% shares in the firm following which the accused made him the director. Two years later, the accused offered him more powers on the condition that he buys 23 more shares.

15-10-2020||Noida||Noida’s latest attraction: It’s a plane, it’s a restaurant... It’s a planestaurant!||Bored of regular cafes and restaurants? Come December, the Great India Place (GIP) Mall will soon have another attraction -- aeroplane turned into a restaurant. And yes, they will issue tickets too. The mall now has the fuselage of the aeroplane on its premises and is refitting its interiors to turn it into a restaurant.Bhaskar Joshi, general manager (operations) of Entertainment City Pvt Ltd that owns the mall, said that many people have not taken to flights since the lockdown. “There are a number of people who crave for in-flight lunch and dinner. We explored this option and made a contract with an aeronautical company – Dixit Aeronautics – to run an in-flight restaurant at the GIP mall,” he said. Dixit Aeronautics placed an Boeing 737-200 between the mall and the Garden’s Galleria. Rakesh Dixit, director of Dixit Aeronautics, said, “Five years ago we had started a similar restaurant in Ludhiana, and one near Rohini metro station in Delhi. We got good a response and hence we planned this project in Noida.” Dixit said that the in-flight restaurant will offer an experience similar to the one in an aeroplane. “This is a complete aeroplane with engine and cockpit and the aisle. We will redesign the seating arrangements. We will also place some music system inside. Around 60 to 70 people can sit and dine at a time,” he said. Waiters will sport air hostess and flight steward uniforms to complete the in-flight environment. Dixit said that the project-- Aerorestro Entertainment-- is also modelled as edutainment (education + entertainment). “There are a significant number of people, and children, who have never travelled in an aeroplane. They would want to feel the experience. We have planned to issue tickets at nominal prices and offer them to have a look,” he said. If people want to have food onboard, additional charges will be applied. The officials are designing the project considering the social distancing norms after the Coronavirus outbreak. Dixit said that he bought the aeroplane from the Airport Authority of India one year ago. It was brought in parts and again reassembled in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-latest-attraction-it-s-a-plane-it-s-a-restaurant-it-s-a-planestaurant/story-4RZSM1pMAnUIiWdkcr74EL.html

The meeting was attended by former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, People’s Conference chairman Sajad Gani Lone and others.Raina said, “Article 370 will not be implemented till doomsday. It doesn’t matter how much the Abdullahs and Mehbooba yell at the top of their voice.”He continued, “It is history. Under the garb of Article 370, they looted the people and grossly violated their human rights. We will not allow its implementation again”.Raina said Article 370 had given birth to separatism and terrorism. “It was due to this obnoxious Article that several ills continue to plague J&K,” he added.On Wednesday, he had reacted sharply to the meeting between NC chief Farooq, his son Omar and PDP president Mehbooba.Raina had warned the trio of “serious ramifications if they tried to push their anti-India Gupkar agenda to bleed Kashmir again”.He had recalled how Article 370 murdered the human rights of communities like Gujjar-Bakarwals, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Paharis, women, Valmikis, and the west Pakistan refugees.On August 22, six regional and national parties unanimously resolved to fight for the restoration of the special status of J&K as it existed before August 5, 2019, saying the measures taken were “spitefully short-sighted” and “grossly unconstitutional”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/article-370-will-not-be-restored-till-doomsday-j-k-bjp/story-pLWbUlyZtjYdaZSPHZ73CL.html

15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University postpones senate elections again||Almost two months after the senate polls of Panjab University were postponed for the first time, the varsity on Thursday decided to defer the elections further.The polls were scheduled to start on August 24. However, the university postponed the elections for all constituencies of the senate on August 15 for two months in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. A communication in this regard was sent to syndicate members on Wednesday by PU’s officiating registrar Vikram Nayyar. It stated that the vice-chancellor in exercise of powers conferred under regulation 12.2, Chapter II-B, PU calendar volume-1, 2007, has postponed for the time-being the dates of election of all constituencies of senate till further orders.The announcement comes days after over 20 senate and syndicate members had written to vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar, urging him to conduct the senate elections at the earliest. The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the Panjab University. Out of the total members, 36 are nominated by the Vice-President of India, who is also the chancellor of the university.UT’S ADVICE SOUGHTIn an official communique issued by the University on Thursday, it was announced that after taking cognizance of the Unlock 5 guidelines, the V-C has decided to seek advice from the UT administration regarding the conduct of senate elections. “Further course of action will be decided after the receipt of advice from the UT administration,” the varsity said.UNNECESSARY DELAY: SENATORSMeanwhile, several senators have expressed displeasure over the university’s decision.Senator Ashok Goyal said, “The vice-chancellor is delaying the senate polls when there is no provision for seeking opinion of the Chandigarh administration to hold the elections. When various other elections are being conducted throughout the country, what is the justification to postpone the senate elections?”“The delay is not justified. The democratic structure of the senate and university should be upheld at any cost,” said senator Rabinder Nath Sharma.On the other hand, Subhash Sharma, who is from the BJP group, said, “Conducting the polls is an administrative decision. We are ready to follow whatever the UT administration will advise,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-postpones-senate-elections-again/story-CIMDET3UUtCDpZ7zLG0AKN.html

Every day it appears that the protest will subside but it’s still lingering.”“Trains can’t be run in this situation. We are waiting to see if the trains can be moved on Friday,” he added.The official said that a passenger train usually transports 1,000 people. “However, it depends upon ticketing and how many people want to visit the cave shrine,” he added.“The J&K administration in tandem with the railways has made all arrangements for the Navratri festival. The first Vande Bharat train had to depart from New Delhi on Thursday. Now, we will see if we can run it on Friday,” he said.The UT administration has made Covid-19 testing arrangements in Katra, Udhampur and Jammu. Security is also in place in Katra and at the cave shrine.Reasi district police chief SSP Rashmi Wazir said, “We have deployed five quick reaction teams in Katra and three in the Bhawan (sanctum sanctorum). There are eight police checkposts along the tracks leading up to the shrine besides round-the-clock patrolling during the festival.”She added that armed security personnel, policemen and the CRPF will guard the pilgrimage site 24x7. “We are confident of an incident-free Navratri festival,” she said. Wazir said Udhampur-Reasi range deputy inspector general of police, Sujit Kumar, reviewed the arrangements for the festival in Katra on Tuesday.“The cap on per day pilgrims to the shrine has been increased to 7,000 from 5,000. During the festival, two special trains, apart from Vande Bharat, will also run from Varanasi and Delhi,” she added.The health department has also augmented its infrastructure by setting up more testing kiosks and staff in Katra, including the railway station. Every pilgrim arriving in Katra will have to undergo a rapid antigen test before being allowed to proceed on the pilgrimage. If anyone tests positive, they will be quarantined in Katra for 10 days. A few hotels have also been identified for paid quarantine.However, if the persons who test positive don’t want to be quarantined for 10 days, they can avail cabs to return home by road.Reasi district commissioner Indu Kanwal Chib said, “There are 10 testing kiosks at the Katra railway station for the visiting pilgrims and five more will be added depending upon the bookings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navratri-special-trains-to-katra-cancelled-due-to-farmers-stir-in-punjab/story-RFZzkpHOJ4KYonovDevEeI.html

The district and sessions court also convicted three others in the case, including a driver of the women and child development minister, and awarded them three months rigorous imprisonment. They were also fined ₹15,500 each by the court of district and sessions judge Urmila Joshi.The minister, a Congress leader, and the trio will have to undergo additional one-month jail if they fail to pay the fine, the court said.Judge Joshi held Thakur, her driver and two workers guilty of beating up an on-duty policeman who stopped her vehicle on a one-way lane.According to the prosecution, the incident took place around 4.15pm on March 24, 2012, in the Chunabhatti area under Rajapeth police station in Amravati.Thakur, who is also guardian minister of Amravati district, said she will move the Bombay High Court against the lower court’s verdict.According to the charge sheet, Thakur, her driver Sagar Suresh Khandekar, workers Sharad Kashirav Jawanjal and Raju Kisan Ingle, allegedly beat up traffic policeman Ulhas Raurale when he stopped her vehicle from entering a one-way lane. The incident took place when Thakur, then an MLA, was moving in her vehicle along with her aides. When the traffic cop noticed her vehicle entering a lane from Chunabhatti to Gandhi Chowk here, he stopped it.Raurale told the legislator her vehicle cannot use the road stretch as it was for one-way traffic and the car was entering from the wrong side, the charge sheet said. Angered by this, Thakur and her aides alighted from the car and started arguing with Raurale. They allegedly held him by the collar and beat him up, the prosecution said.Raurale lodged a complaint with the Rajapeth police station against Thakur, her driver and two others.A case was registered under IPC sections 353 (assault on or use of criminal force against a public servant in order to deter him from discharging his duty), 332 (causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 186 (obstructing any public servant in discharge of his public functions and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against the four.A charge sheet was filed in the court after investigation.Judge Joshi examined five witnesses in the case and one of them, a cop, turned hostile during trial.Accepting the deposition of the witnesses and arguments of the prosecution, the judge found all the four accused guilty.The court also directed the city police commissioner to take action against the cop who turned hostile.Reacting to the verdict, Thakur said, “I have always respected the judiciary as I am myself a lawyer. As such, it will not be proper for me to comment upon the judgement.“But we are going to move to the High Court for justice. I can only say at this moment that truth shall prevail.” On the possible demand for her resignation, Thakur said she was aware the opposition BJP would seek her ouster from the cabinet.“They only have this much work. My fight with the BJP is a battle of ideas. It (BJP) is out to end my political career, but I shall continue my fight against the BJP,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-awards-3-month-jail-to-maharashtra-minister-yashomati-thakur-in-2012-cop-assault-case/story-svrCy0pRAi7z4uqlptHP4I.html

On June 15, India lost 20 soldiers in a bloody clash at the Galwan valley.Kargil district commissioner (DC) Baseer-ul-Haq Choudhary said the tunnel will add more teeth to the army’s defence operations in the strategic region.“It was a long pending demand of the people of Ladakh. It will be a strategic tunnel that will keep the region connected with the rest of India all year, not just physically, but emotionally too,” the DC said.The district head said that with this many employment opportunities will open up for the people of Ladakh and supply of essential commodities to the region will also be maintained round the clock.“Ladakh being a tourist destination, the tunnel will give impetus to tourism, winter sports like ice hockey, skiing and other activities,” he said.Choudhary also informed that from the defence point of view, the road link will strengthen national security. “It will be of great importance to the defence forces. This project shall bring to fruition 70 years of overwhelming public demand of Ladakh region,” he added.After IL&FS went into financial problems, the project work allotted to it in May 2018 was stopped in July 2018, and the contract was terminated in January 2019 by NHIDCL.In February 2020, Gadkari reviewed the whole project in detail and approved the project afresh on May 23. The construction period is now six years.The total integrated cost of the project including Zojila tunnel and approaches up to Z-Morh tunnel works out to ₹10,643 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/zojila-tunnel-to-add-more-teeth-to-defence-ops-in-ladakh-kargil-dc/story-Rl576CC6ANcnuo8fQTbZTM.html

Removing this foundation stone from its place is against democratic values and totally immoral,” he said.Rathore said the kind of politics BJP was doing over the construction of Rohtang Tunnel was condemnable.“Such politics on the foundation stone shows BJP’s character and their narrow thinking,” he alleged adding that even BJP veteran and former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal has spoken against the removal of the plaque.Rathore also slammed the state government for its “anti-people” decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Instead of giving relief to the people during the Corona outbreak, the government put more burden on them,” he said.He also criticized the government for hiking the rates of various tests in government hospitals and demanded withdrawal of the decision.Rathore expressed surprise at the arbitrariness of the cement companies in the state and said it seems that the government has buckled before these firms.“The cement that is made using the state’s resources is cheaper elsewhere, but costly in Himachal. This is an injustice to the people of Himachal and shall not be tolerated,” he said condemning the cement companies for hiking the prices per bag by ₹10.Expressing concern over the growing Covid cases in the state, Rathore said the government failed to follow the protocol properly which led to a surge in the infections, leaving people to their fate. “There is no proper system to curb the infections,” he said asking the government to enforce strict rules to prevent the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-congress-demands-reinstallation-of-sonia-s-plaque-at-atal-tunnel/story-59HJC0Q9vInoldcMMad7RI.html

Asserting that her government was not in favour of scrapping festivities, the chief minister said unlike most religious occasions, Durga puja cannot be held within the confines of four walls, as “the goddess has a large family”, and arrangements for the rituals and the gala are usually made by clubs and housing societies, involving many individuals.Banerjee, who is also the TMC supremo, rued that three of her party MLAs, several police personnel and doctors and health officials have died of the viral disease, but insisted that “we have to overcome our sorrows and move forward”.“It is not possible to stop Durga Puja festivities in West Bengal entirely, like some other states. We don’t want to stop Durga Puja, it is not right; we have not stopped anything,” she said at the secretariat, after virtually inaugurating 110 pandals in 12 districts.Certain sections of the society, including a few doctors’ associations, have requested the government to call off this year’s revelries, amid the spike on coronavirus cases. Epidemiologists have warned of a surge in Covid-19 numbers, following the Durga Puja festival, which is usually marked by mass gathering at pandals.The CM, however, reasoned that adequate safety measures were being taken, and asked all puja organisers to ensure that open spaces were available for the visitors to maintain appropriate physical distance.“Ramzaan, Eid, Ganapati Puja were held within the four walls of our homes. However, it is not possible to hold Durga Puja in a small space, as Ma Durga has a large family. Also, pujas are mostly organised by clubs, associations and housing societies,” she stated.Banerjee, on the occasion, sought blessings of the goddess, and prayed for forgiveness of those who may have committed any mistake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cancelling-durga-puja-revelry-not-an-option-people-should-follow-covid-protocols-mamata/story-zcWq74FIVMYOOwGgUhuTpL.html

Unlike in Ambala, the farmers here were standing away from the road and were barricaded by the police, to avoid any clash or blockade.BKU’s Yamunanagar unit president said, “BJP is taking out tractor rallies to push that the Centre’s agrarian laws are in favour of the farmers. But there are only a few tractors of farmers in the rally and mostly are from the mining zone. We won’t bow to them and won’t allow them to enter our villages like they didn’t allow the farmers to conduct a rally in Pipli.”Meanwhile, minister Kanwar Pal, MP Kataria and several other senior party leaders addressed a huge crowd at Military Ground in Jagadhri, thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the three farm laws, after culminating the rally.“These laws will double the farmers’ income by 2022. There are rumours that the land will be sold to corporate, there will be no MSP, no mandi – all these are lies and everything will remain as it is. CM Manohar Lal has taken daring steps to improve the facilities in mandis,” minister Pal said in his address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-s-tractor-rally-shown-black-flags-again-this-time-in-yamunanagar/story-J3YH91zTeWFII41fay9YeP.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Dussehra later, Diwali card party has come early for Delhi-NCR folks||Diwali isn’t complete without card parties, but this year the urge to meet friends and relatives amid social distancing during pandemic has compelled denizens to have card parties quite early. Those hosting these, are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that safety measures are in place including sanitisation of Poker chips, mandatory masks, minimal gathering etc. And some quirky themes are also being chosen. While Covid-19 pandemic should have denizens wary of attending these, many say that they just can’t keep away from indulging in some light-hearted fun albeit with safety measures in place. Playing cards is just an excuse to meet everyoneShekhar Sharma, who has his business across Delhi-NCR, hosted a card party in the first week of October. He says, “Card party toh bahana hai sabse milne ka (Card party is only an excuse to meet everyone). In the past years, I never hosted one before Dussehra, but this time I wanted to invite my close buddies, whom I haven’t been able to meet for long, thanks to the lockdown and the paranoia. But, we ensured that we were following safety norms. There were nine of us at our home. I asked everyone to check their temperatures before coming; and we served home-cooked food only. I had kept sanitisers as well for anyone who needs to use them, and we played cards on a roundtable to ensure we sit at a distance, and even played games such as Monopoly.”Cards/chips to be sanitised Gurugram resident Gagandeep Singh Bhalla says he is all set to host one such party at his home next weekend, October 24, as Navratri will be over by that time. “We’ll sanitise cards and chips. And we’ll be playing on a table instead of a floor sitting arrangement because then we can sit in a socially-distanced manner. This time we’ll have more tables and a maximum of six people will be on one table. It’ll definitely be nice to host it early as it would be a refreshing evening after Navratri, and the whole lockdown situation. Food would be made at home to prevent the risk of Covid-19; although all the delivery apps are taking all precautions but home-cooked is always safer.” Halloween-themed Card PartySumit Anand, who runs a sports shop in Delhi, is hosting a Halloween-themed card party. “We’re giving away Halloween themes masks for this Saturday party, which will be a way ahead of Diwali. Everybody will play cards with the mask on, and maintain social distancing. There won’t be too many people on a single table, and every table will have a sanitiser. We’ll have Diwali and Halloween themed placards. But food we’ll order from outside!”Great way to connect after the lullDelhi-based businessman Sumit Dhingra, who hosted a card party recently, says, “These past few months have isolated everyone socially, and this was a great way to connect, laugh and enjoy in a safe space. We ensured everyone left their slippers at the door, and sanitised their hands at the entrance. The gathering was limited, and we all sat on a table with quite a distance from each other. It went on till late night, and what great fun.. truly the festive season is here!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dussehra-later-diwali-card-party-has-come-early-for-delhi-ncr-folks/story-0tuZG6iquMTfNXfUkHjXeP.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray warns against attempts to ‘finish off’ Bollywood||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said attempts to malign and “finish off” the Hindi film industry or “to shift it” will not be tolerated.Thackeray’s statement came against the backdrop of probe by multiple agencies into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and its media coverage which was seen by some as a deliberate campaign to target Bollywood. “Moves to finish off the film industry or shift it elsewhere will never be tolerated,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office quoted Thackeray as saying at a meeting with multiplex and theatre owners.Mumbai was not only the country’s financial capital but also its entertainment capital, he said.“Bollywood enjoys a following across the globe. The film industry generates huge employment. In the last few days, attempts have been made to malign the image of the film industry by certain quarters which is painful,” he said. The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh recently announced a plan to create a film city in that state to woo film-makers.Thackeray informed cinema and multiplex owners at the meeting that the state culture department has prepared a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) regarding reopening of cinema halls which have been closed for over six months due to coronavirus pandemic.The decision about reopening cinema halls will be taken at the earliest after the SOP is finalized, he said. “The government is positive about it. Entertainment industry is a means to boost the state’s economy and the government is keen to restart it,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-warns-against-attempts-to-finish-off-bollywood/story-U5q4874nf55NNzP095SizH.html

15-10-2020||City||Awake citizens, fire brigade and WFH schedule avert flood casualties as rains battered Pune||Pune: The alertness shown by residents and administration, learning from last year’s flash floods, helped avert flooding incidents when incessant rains hit the city on Wednesday. Many remained awake throughout the night. While several roads and areas in the city’s low-lying parts reported waterlogging and power outages with incidents of wall collapse, there were no casualties and large-scale damage to property. The 2019 flash floods in the city had claimed 266 lives of which seven residents of Tangewala colony in Sahakarnagar were washed away in the strong currents of water as they were asleep. As most people were at residence due to work from home guidelines in the light of Covid, incidents of vehicles washing away in waters were prevented, civic officials said. During the 2019 flash floods, over 700 vehicles were washed away as people were out. While the showers began at 2pm, their intensity increased post 6 pm, leading to overflowing nullahs and drainages. According to IMD, the city received 76 mm rainfall just within three hours starting 8:30pm. Waterlogging was reported from southern and eastern parts of Pune where Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) staff and fire brigade shifted people to safer places. “With memories of last year’s flash flood still fresh in our mind, residents in our society remained awake throughout the night. As rainfall intensity increased after 6 pm, we asked people residing in buildings adjacent to Ambil Odha to shift to other buildings,” said Deepak Ghadge, resident of Gururaj Housing Society, which was worst hit by last year’s floods. According to residents, three-four foot deep rainwater entered houses as citizens ran helter-skelter seeking assistance from police, social workers and administration for relief and rescue operations. The areas near Ambil Odha were put in a state of high alert and residents were shifted to nearby areas to prevent the 2019-like situation. According to fire brigade department head Prashant Ranpise, his office received 35 calls from residents of various areas with complaints of wall collapse, tree falling and water entering houses. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “Several areas of the city were flooded and the PMC disaster management and fire brigade teams worked round the clock in Ambil Odha areas and localities which witnessed heavy flooding. Due to the high flow, water entered the parking lots of several housing societies adjacent to the nullah and nearby houses. The rescue work is underway and no case of loss of lives has been reported yet.” Sinhgad road was closed for vehicular traffic from Vitthalwadi due to waterlogging with waters overflowing at Vishrantinagar chowk, Santosh Hall chowk and Wadgaon bridge. In the eastern suburbs of Wanowrie and Kondhwa, residents placed barricades at the important junctions of Bhairoba nullah and urged commuters to avoid taking the nullah road. Dhankavdi-Sahakarnagar ward corporator Ashwini Kadam said, “Roughly over 3 lakh people were affected due to heavy rains and flash floods in the area. The PMC administration had failed to remove encroachments as recommended by the private assessment agency to the civic body. The civic body did not construct the retaining wall, box culverts, clean drainage lines and demolish illegal encroachments. We need financial package and immediate relief for affected residents.” Shafi Shaikh, a Camp resident said, “It was a scary situation as East Street and MG road too witnessed flooding. We thought it was a repeat of last year, but this time residents were prepared for heavy rains.” Pune Cantonment Board CEO Amit Kumar said, “The fire brigade officials carried out relief operations in low lying areas. There were no casualties and disaster management team has been deployed to help residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/awake-citizens-fire-brigade-and-wfh-schedule-avert-flood-casualties-as-rains-battered-pune/story-H8zJgZOrP3bNNhAcw1eHII.html

She was handed over to her cousin who lives in a village in the district. On Thursday, a team led by protection officer Rajni Gupta reached out to the family to record their statements but they have refused to file a police complaint against her husband Naresh Kumar. The family says they do not want to harass the woman’s three children.“Nobody has come forward to file a police complaint against her husband after we rescued her from the toilet. We will take up the matter with senior officers,” Gupta said. Gupta said her husband and family claimed that she was having some mental illness but they were unable to produce any paper or medical reports. On a complaint filed by Gupta on Wednesday, the police had arrested and booked Naresh under Sections 498 A and 342 of the Indian Penal Code. Police officials said Naresh was released on bail a few hours after the arrest. Haryana State Commission for Women member Preeti Bhardwaj said, “There is a need to invoke more stricter sections against her husband as she was being forced to live in inhuman conditions and this is a violation of her Right to Live.” Bhardwaj said her husband has got bail as no strict sections were invoked in the FIR. “However, a 10-member committee will be formed to look into the matter. Ramrati’s cousin Anil Kumar said, “The behavior of her husband and children towards her was not appropriate for the past few years after she developed mental illness. When I went to see her on Rakshabandhan she was living in the toilet and told me she wants to go with me. I took up the matter with her husband and son. They had assured me they will take care of her.” He said Naresh had not visited them since two years after they refused to sell a buffalo to him.Anil and his mother Vidya Devi said, “We are ready to keep her at our house but we do not want any police action against her husband as this may also affect their children.”Ramrati is unable to walk due to weakness and could not stretch her legs since she was locked in the 3X3ft toilet. Her cousins said they will take her to a hospital. Her relatives said Ramrati’s father had passed away before she was married and her elder brother was allegedly found dead in the fields eight years ago. Her mother Kela Devi left the village and is now living at her brother’s house in Katesra village of Rohtak district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kin-of-haryana-woman-locked-inside-toilet-for-1-5-years-don-t-want-police-action-against-husband/story-zEoPGo5mq9kmQ9Gu7ycZWL.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi calls it quits on Ramlila celebrations amid delayed guidelines and Covid scare||Ramlila festivities in Old Delhi have always been an elaborate, syncretic effort, but this year owing to the pandemic, no celebrations will take place. The grounds at Red Fort, which would host three Ramlilas, wear a deserted look. The streets that would come alive with processions including Ramji ki Baraat, are devoid of all cheer. Even as guidelines to hold the event have been issued, committee members rue that they have come a little too late in the day. “Preparations begin one month in advance. How is this possible in 4-5 days’ time? Not only the stage and seating area, there are hundreds of minute details that go into making a successful Ramlila. We could have even done it symbolically, without inviting the public, but there isn’t time. Even if the SOPs were given to us by September 30, we would have been able to do it,” says Prakash Barathi, secretary, Nav Shri Dharmik Lila Committee. Ashok Aggarwal, president, Lav Kush Ramlila Committee expected the authorities to give a clear decision well in time. “I understand there is a pandemic, but agar aap baat karte ho toh raasta nikalta hai. We suggested holding it without opening it for the public and stream it live. We had even spoken to some hospitals to provide medical assistance. A team of 20 doctors and nurses were to be present at the venue. Even we are worried about our health, so why would we have not taken all possible measures to ensure safety,” he says. Read: Ramlila tradition to pause due to Covid-19? Actors, organisers in despairWith the updated guidelines have come new processes to get permits. Shiv Kumar Gupta, senior joint secretary and bhandari, Ramlila Committee, says, “We were caught up in a rigmarole and no one gave us any definite answer. These guidelines have many terms and conditions. Only a few days are left to Navratri, how will we undertake all the preparations and permits in such a short span of time?” he rues. Barathi explains, “Earlier, we would only submit one application, but now we have to go to various authorities and licensing offices. A nodal officer would be appointed, who will then inspect our grounds and arrangements, submit the report to the officers concerned and then we will get the permission. No officer is willing to meet anyone due to the pandemic, and ask us to submit our applications in a box outside their office.The ground hasn’t been alloted yet; I don’t think celebrations will be possible this year.”Taking into account the losses this has brought, Aggarwal, shares, “We had got 500 new dresses made, 20 new songs were recorded, a new screenplay was written and new scenes were added. Rehearsals were on for the last three months. We had booked dance groups, and make-up artistes from Mumbai. We had to cancel their tickets. We work all year round to make Ramlila possible.” Read: DDMA allows Durga Puja, Ramlila with Covid ridersDhiraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary, Shri Dharmic Ram Lila Committee, says that all celebrations are a collaborative effort and the losses will be borne collectively by the members. Finding alternatives, he says that they will broadcast it on television for the nine days of Navratri. “The only time that we didn’t have Ramlila celebrations was during the 1965 Indo-Pak war. The then Prime Minister Shastri ji (Lal Bahadur Shastri) had made an appeal to donate money and ration to families of martyred soldiers. There is inspiration in his message which can be implemented even today by helping those in need,” he says.

Why was the strength of security guards not increased. It is a very serious matter since 61 out of 97 inmates were booked for heinous crimes and eight were facing serious offences. Still, the security was not tightened. As many as 15 inmates were booked for petty offences and it is surprising that they were not given bail. Such inmates should not be kept here for long,” Bainda said.She said the management has failed to inculcate good values among inmates and there is a dire need to create a good environment if one wants them to reform. “Proper counseling of inmates was not done. The authorities failed to introduce new activities and did not inquire about their background and circumstances under which they were sent to the juvenile home. Such homes are meant to change the mindset of these juveniles, who had committed a crime at a young age, and transform them into good humans. We will start the counseling of the inmates soon,” Bainda added.While nine of the 17 inmates who ran away face murder charges, three are facing attempt to murder cases, two were booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and two others face theft and a rioting case. Eight of them belong to Jhajjar district, two each are from Rohtak, Hisar and Delhi and one each from Bhiwani, Dadri and Karnal.Hisar superintendent of police Balwan Rana had said they have arrested three out of the 17 juveniles who had fled the home and efforts are on to round up the remaining 14 inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/serious-lapses-by-hisar-observation-home-management-haryana-child-rights-panel/story-rG9WtArHul6zCDO5zY01AP.html

15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Dissatisfied with CBI, Kotkhai rape victim’s parents move Himachal high court for fresh probe||Dissatisfied with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the rape and murder of a teenaged schoolgirl in Kotkhai on July 4, 2017, her parents have moved the Himachal Pradesh high court, seeking the reopening of the case and a fresh investigation. The then Congress government led by Virbhadra Singh had drawn flak over the handling of the case that triggered protests across the state. An infuriated mob had resorted to road blockades and torched a police station in Kotkhai after the body of the victim, a student of Government Senior Secondary School, Mahasu, was found in the woods of Bankufar near Hilaila village two days after she went missing. The victim’s family has now appealed to the court to reopen the investigation. The father expressed dissatisfaction with the CBI, which had been handed over the case a few days after the crime. The CBI probe had led to the arrest of only a woodcutter, while the forensic report pointed towards gangrape and murder. MANY LOOPHOLES, ALLEGES FATHER “I was never satisfied with the CBI probe. There are many loopholes,” the father said outside the court. “I don’t believe the crime was committed by one person. The forensic report from Gandhinagar corroborates this. But the CBI held only one person guilty of the crime,” he said. The girl’s mother said she hoped to get justice from the high court. “It’s been three years since my daughter was brutalised. I can only hope for justice and pray in silence,” she said. The parents of the victim said that they had even approached the Supreme Court but were asked to file the appeal in the high court. “Many facts have been overlooked. We have prayed that a high court judge looks into the investigation,” their counsel Deven Bhatt said. The 40-member CBI team has recorded statements of 400 people in the case so far. Shimla-based NGO Madad Sewa Trust wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), seeking a reinvestigation. The trust has been protesting for justice since the case came to light. “We have written twice to the PMO, but nothing has moved,” said Tanuja Thapta, who heads the trust. POLICE ACTION BECOMES MATTER OF PROBE The initial police investigation into the case itself became a matter for probe after the CBI found that the special investigation team (SIT) had used torture to extract confessions. After the SIT, headed by inspector general of police ZH Zaidi, arrested six persons on the basis of suspicion, one of them, Suraj Singh, died in police custody. The department claimed it was the result of a scuffle with another suspect in the lock-up. When the CBI took over the case, Zaidi and the then Shimla superintendent of police, DW Negi, were arrested. Members of the SIT were charged with murder, wrongful confinement to extort a confession and destruction of evidence. THE CASE SO FAR 2017 July 4: Kotkhai school girl goes missing. July 6: Her body is found in a forest. July 7: Protests in Shimla and Kotkhai over rape and murder. July 9: Police constitute SIT under IG (south), ZH Zaidi.

15-10-2020||Kolkata||Calcutta HC seeks justification from state for doling out Rs 50,000 to puja committees||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday sought to know from the West Bengal government its justification for doling out Rs 50,000 to community Durga pujas, amid the austerity measures being pursued by the state in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Hearing a petition challenging the government’s decision to disburse the money to community Durga pujas, a division bench comprising justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee also enquired if financial aid was being given for other festivals, such as Eid.It further asked the state whether any guideline has been laid down for such expenditure as it is public money that is being doled out as grant to the puja organisers.The state government, on its part, told the court that grant was meant for raising public awareness on Covid-19 control, purchase of sanitisers and masks.Asserting that accounts of expenditure have to be well maintained, the bench suggested that Advocate General Kishore Dutta, who represents the state, and senior counsel Bikash Bhattacharya, appearing for the petitioner, hold a conference on all such matters, and inform the court of its outcome on Friday, when the case would be taken up for hearing again.The court also asked whether any blueprint for crowd control during Durga Puja -- which is barely a week away -- have been prepared by the government to prevent the spread of the viral disease.The petition, challenging the grant of Rs 50,000 and other benefits -- such as discounts on application fees for permissions from Fire Brigade and electric supply boards -- to thousands of community Durga Pujas, was filed by Sourav Dutta, a Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader. Dutta claimed that the government’s decision was not in tune with the concept of secularism in India, and hurts the fundamental rights provided in the Constitution.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on September 24 announced the Rs 50000 grant, among other doles, for each of the state’s puja committees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/calcutta-hc-seeks-justification-from-state-for-doling-out-rs-50-000-to-puja-committees/story-CAY9hdXOCLX1SqmxFSlx0I.html
15-10-2020||Pune||Teachers, students miss physical connect during online classes, state problems of connectivity, exhaustion||From facing technical glitches and learning advanced multimedia teaching aids to not being able to give extra attention to students who require more care and suffering from physical exhaustion, teachers are tackling the new normal of imparting education with a cautious approach. Students too believe that they need more physical attention and the online way of teaching is just not enough for them. Covid-19 pandemic has changed the course of education, forcing everyone to go online. Three months of online schooling has transformed the teacher-student relationship. For this transformation, having a glitch-free internet connection and electricity at home have become important aspects to continuing online schooling. In June, the government decided not to reopen schools as more institutions joined the online teaching platform.“Nothing can beat experience of learning at physical classrooms where children come to school and interact with the teachers,” says secondary section coordinator Swapna Nair, Vikhe Patil Memorial School, Lohegaon. While another teacher, Amrapali Khunte from Angel Mickey Minie School, Manjri, said that managing less attentive students becomes quite a challenge when everything is online.For school teachers, students and parents adjusting to the new set up is turning out to be a completely a new challenge. “Challenges of online teaching double up if you are a parent cum teacher. Handling your child and conducting online classes has become difficult. One needs to make sure that the kid is occupied with work while I take a class,” explains Sayali Shinde, teacher at City International School, Aundh.“Although we are manage to share lot of information but yes there are set of specific students who needs attention physically and those things are missing in online education,” said Nair“Although all teachers in my school are tech-savvy, all of them are not used to assist students online. Getting the right platform, solving connectivity issues and ensuring that all methods used for teaching online are working, were few of the hurdles we faced in the beginning, but now we are getting used to it,” said Arti Sharma, teacher at the Army Public School, Kirkee.Online teaching has increased the workload for teachers and they are more busy than during pre-Covid times. From preparing powerpoint presentations and videos to making e-notes for students, teachers are now having to work 24x7 to get the job done better.Long breaks/extra curricular activitiesWhile schools are providing long breaks between two online sessions to break the monotony, they have also introduced various extracurricular activities to help students relax. “We conduct quiz and debate competitions online. Our students took part in the Fit India Freedom Run on August 15 as they uploaded virtual run videos,” said Sharma.Upgrade systems/ data plans“Normal mobile data connections used to work for the school sessions for the first few weeks, but now stronger bandwidth connections are required. Recently during a unit test my child started his exam via his school web portal but she was not able to submit it as the system crashed due to overload,” said a parent on the condition of anonymity.Ajay Mehta, whose son Ayan studies at DAV Public School, said, “Earlier, we had just one laptop, but now we have three- one each for two of my children, who study in Class 6 and 8.”Tiring lecturesOnline lectures not only miss the environment of a classroom, but are also physically exhausting for teachers and students.Manas Arora, a Class 8 student of St Vincent’s School, said, “Attending lectures online is not that interactive as we used to have when we went to school.”On how online schooling affects students and parents, Booshan Shukla, a child psychiatrist, said, “Some students are happy with online schooling while some who like to be with friends or need physical attention are facing some challenges. There are also cases where schools kept telling parents regarding the problems of their children, but parents denied it. Now, they are realising it when they have to spend five hours with their kids during online classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/teachers-students-miss-physical-connect-during-online-classes-state-problems-of-connectivity-exhaustion/story-R2SnDK4ZlyTpMEDzhRpb0N.html

The baby boy was born on October 2, killed and buried, police officials added.Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Purnima Gaikwad, who is supervising the investigation, said that the police received the information of the crime that a new a newborn baby was killed and buried at a secluded spot in Taljai area by his parents.“Our team went to the spot and exhumed the body in the presence of a magistrate today and sent it for autopsy and details are awaited,” she said.“According to the couple, the baby was diagnosed with Down’s syndrome and they were asked by doctors to conduct several tests. They could not affford it,” she said.The husband had recently lost his job while the wife works in a garment shop in Katraj area, the DCP said.Sinhgad road police station investigators said that the couple attempted to give away the baby to a social organisation, but could not find any organisation that would accept him and committed the crime as the last resort. The police strongly suspect that the parents killed the baby before burying it inside the a ditch in the area. The husband and wife have been detained and are being interrogated at the police station. A case is likely to be filed later, added the police officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/newborn-s-body-exhumed-from-taljai-hills-parents-detained/story-ZMjdKbfmEEp84i98Nsp0fO.html

According to the handicrafts department, over 500,000 artisans and weavers are associated with the sector. As many as 230,000 of them are registered with the department. Women form a major chunk of this workforce involved in the weaving of shawls, carpets, etc.Jammu & Kashmir’s economy has faced a double whammy since August 2019 when a lockdown and communications blockade were imposed to check protests against the Centre’s move to divest the region of its special status. As the restrictions were eased, the Covid-19 pandemic hit the economy. Restrictions on mobile internet services have also impacted e-commerce in the region.Also Read: Jammu-Srinagar Highway shut for maintenance till November, J&K Traffic Police prohibits vehicular movementLieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said the partnership with Flipkart will enable local artisans, craftsmen, and weavers to reach the global market. “It will also provide an appropriate opportunity for the momentous growth and development of the respective sectors. Benefits to the artisans will percolate directly to them by payments into their accounts.”Flipkart has created a special web page Samarth for the marketing of the handloom and handicraft products.Jammu & Kashmir Handloom and Handicrafts Corporation managing director Hashmat Yatoo said the pandemic has hit the traditional system of marketing and sales. “Because of Covid-19, everything related to the traditional system has come to a standstill. To counter that, e-platforms are considered a viable option. That is why the government decided to collaborate with an e-platform to benefit the artisan community,” he said. “With this, their products can be displayed online and can reach millions and millions of customers.”Also Read: J&K political leaders meeting todayYatoo, who signed the MOU with Flipkart’s chief corporate affairs officer Rajneesh Kumar, said for the first six months, the e-commerce services will be free of charge for the artisans. “Flipkart will be sending their team. We will be photographing the products and then those will be uploaded on the website.”Yatoo said the corporation will use its network of showrooms to supply the products. “The main beneficiary of this is the artisan. He or she will get linked with this platform and there will be no middleman. We will be directly picking up products from the artisan and their reach will be huge.”The products will include rugs, shawls, and carpets.Kumar said they are excited to join hands with the corporation to bring the local heritage of Jammu & Kashmir on their platform. “This MoU will enable thousands of artisans to reap the benefits of e-commerce and scale up their business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/flipkart-signs-mou-wit-jammu-kashmir-administration-to-for-sale-of-handicraft-products/story-1F8NsEhx0F9oy4dT9WrtNP.html

15-10-2020||Pune||Ajit Pawar asks admin to explore another site for proposed int’l airport in Pune||A lack of progress in land acquistion for the proposed international airport in Purandar has forced deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to ask officials to explore the option of another site, which according to him, will be easier for land acquisition.During the meeting held in Mumbai on Tuesday, Pawar, also a guardian minister for Pune, took a review of the progress on proposed airport at Purandar and asked officials to look for another site adjoining the current one in Purandar tehsil of Pune district. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “Pawar had called the meeting at Mumbai to discuss about the Purandar international airport. While selecting an existing site for the Purandar airport, the administration identified five more sites. Before starting the land acquisition process, the guardian minister has asked to check whether any other site is better for land acquisition. Once the land acquisition process started then there would be no chance to think over other options.” The existing site was chosen in 2015 as the previously selected site in Khed tehsil of Pune district received opposition from locals. After shifting the site to Purandar, the then Devendra Fadnavis government expedited the process for all necessary approvals with the state government, the Centre, defence and environment ministry issued permissions. However, the local farmers are protesting against the land acquisition for existing sites, which covers seven villages in Purandar tehsil. Around 2, 832-hectared will be acquired for the airport which will be named after Chhatrapati Sambhaji.When asked whether Pawar’s instructions to officials means the administration is thinking to change existing sites, Rao said, “There are no chances to change the existing site but we are verifying about other options. The administration will finish this process in the next three weeks and submit the proposal in front of the guardian minister.” As there has been no progress in the land acquisition for proposed airport, the government is being criticized as the project could not pick up pace. Rao said, “For initial projects, there is an opposition for land acquisition but later projects move on. We are planning to give the best compensation options for farmers.” The proposed Purandar international airport for which land has been earmarked in seven villages of Pargaon, Ekhatpur, Munjwadi, Kumbharvalan, Udachiwadi, Vanpuri and Khanavadi is a landmark project as it will not only increase connectivity in the area but also reduce the current load on the Pune airport which shares its runway with the Indian Air Force (IAF) and has limited flights being operated. According to previous estimates by administration, land acquisition process would require a little over Rs 3,000 crores. In May 2018, the Maharashtra government gave a nod to release Rs 3,513 crore for the project, part of which will be used for land acquisition. Despite the notification related to the development plan and Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC) forming a special purpose vehicle, things have not moved ahead. To develop the project, MADC was appointed as the nodal agency for implementing the project, while the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra (Cidco) will be a major stakeholder in the SPV. Cidco will hold 51 per cent stake in the SPV, while MADC’s stake will be 19 per cent. The remaining 30 per cent will be divided between the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ajit-pawar-asks-admin-to-explore-another-site-for-proposed-int-l-airport-in-pune/story-DdQPwylihqF1NnVt5Q7NII.html
15-10-2020||Pune||Six killed as wall collapses due to rains in Pandharpur||Six people were killed on Wednesday after a wall at an under construction ghat on Bhima river collapsed in Pandharpur due to heavy rains, officials said. The 20-feet high wall came down when the temple town in Solapur district received heavy rains throughout the day. Among those died have been identified as Mangesh Abhangrao (35), Radha Abhangrao (50), Gopal Abhangrao (70) and Pillu Jagtap (13). The authorities were trying to ascertain identifies of the other two deceased, officials said. Solapur district received over 138mm rainfall in 36 hours starting Tuesday morning, leading to waterlogging and flood-like situation as several small and medium streams began overflowing. As heavy rains lashed the region, irrigation department officials started releasing water from Ujani dam, located on the Pune-Solapur border, at 1,00,000 cusecs by around 4pm into Bhima river that passes through Pandharpur. “Due to the heavy rains since the past 18 hours, the wall next to the ghat, currently being developed, collapsed. The administration has so far recovered six bodies while the search is on for one more person. There may be a possibility of pilgrims taking shelter near the wall due to heavy rain. So, we have continued our search operation,” said Sachin Dhole, sub-divisional officer, Pandharpur. Following the incident, Solapur district guardian minister Dattatray Bharane announced inquiry into the incident and possible action against those responsible for the wall collapse. Solapur superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute said that an inquiry has been launched into the incident and once the report is submitted, further action will be taken. “We have asked the engineer to carry out a preliminary inquiry to ascertain if the construction of the ghat carried out by contractor was at fault. Once the inquiry is complete, we will decide the next course of action,” said Satpute. The ghat was essentially being used by the local people for cremation while those died in the incident were staying there in shanties, according to Satpute. Recently former corporator from Pandharpur Ramesh Kamble had sought inquiry into inferior construction material being used to build the ghat and had demanded action against the contractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/six-killed-as-wall-collapses-due-to-rains-in-pandharpur/story-BGwaka50oP0umkcgy7qNhP.html
15-10-2020||Pune||Astronomers from Pune use upgraded GMRT to measure mass of hydrogen in distant galaxies||A team of astronomers from the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR) in Pune, and the Raman Research Institute (RRI), in Bangalore, used the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to measure the atomic hydrogen content of galaxies seen as they were 8 billion years ago, when the universe was young. This is the earliest epoch in the universe for which there is a measurement of the atomic gas content of galaxies. This research was published in the October 15, 2020 issue of the journal ‘Nature’. “Galaxies in the universe are made up mostly of gas and stars, with gas being converted into stars during the life of a galaxy. Understanding galaxies thus requires us to determine how the amounts of both gas and stars change with time. Astronomers have long known that galaxies formed stars at a higher rate when the universe was young than they do today. The star formation activity in galaxies peaked about 8-10 billion years ago and has been declining steadily till today. The cause of this decline is unknown, mostly because we have had no information about the amount of atomic hydrogen gas, the primary fuel for star formation, in galaxies in these early times,” said Aditya Chowdhury, a Ph.D. student at NCRA-TIFR and the lead author of the study. “We have, for the first time, measured the atomic hydrogen gas content of star forming galaxies about 8 billion years ago, using the upgraded GMRT. Given the intense star formation in these early galaxies, their atomic gas would be consumed by star formation in just one or two billion years. And, if the galaxies could not acquire more gas, their star formation activity would decline, and finally cease the observed decline in star formation activity can thus be explained by the exhaustion of the atomic hydrogen.” he added. The measurement of the atomic hydrogen mass of distant galaxies was done by using the upgraded GMRT to search for a spectral line in atomic hydrogen. Unlike stars which emit light strongly at optical wavelengths, the atomic hydrogen signal lies in the radio wavelengths, at a wavelength of 21 cm, and can only be detected with radio telescopes. Unfortunately, this 21 cm signal is very weak, and difficult to detect from distant individual galaxies even with powerful telescopes like the upgraded GMRT. To overcome this limitation, the team used a technique called ‘stacking’ to combine the 21 cm signals of nearly 8,000 galaxies that had earlier been identified with optical telescopes. K S Dwarakanath of RRI and co-author of the study said, “We had used the GMRT in 2016, before its upgrade, to carry out a similar study. However, the narrow bandwidth before the GMRT upgrade meant that we could cover only around 850 galaxies in our analysis, and hence were not sensitive enough to detect the signal.” “The big jump in our sensitivity is due to the upgrade of the GMRT in 2017. The new wide band receivers and electronics allowed us to use 10 times more galaxies in the stacking analysis, giving sufficient sensitivity to detect the weak average 21 cm signal.” said Jayaram Chengalur, of NCRA-TIFR, a co-author of the paper. Detecting the 21 cm signal from the most distant galaxies in the universe was the main science goal of the GMRT, when it was designed and built by a team led by renowned scientist and radio astronomer Govind Swarup in the 1980s and 1990s. “Govind Swarup was very interested in this work, and was following it keenly. Sadly, he passed away shortly before it was published. This work would not have been possible without him and the wonderful team that he put together to first build and then upgraded the GMRT,” said Nissim Kanekar of NCRA-TIFR, a co-author of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/astronomers-from-pune-use-upgraded-gmrt-to-measure-mass-of-hydrogen-in-distant-galaxies/story-xKYXqIRvFbSqeeQYvY7dSL.html

15-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: In one month, active cases come down in Mumbai, western suburbs continue to record high numbers||While the number of Mumbai’s active Covid-19 cases has come down in the last one month, the western suburb of Borivali continues to record the highest number of fresh cases everyday—2,448 on average. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, Borivali has recorded the highest number of active cases since September 13, 2020. Other western suburbs such as Malad, Kandivali and Andheri too have been recording a higher number of cases and are among the top five areas with the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai.Civic officials attribute the high number of cases to a significant portion of the population that lives in high-rises. A BMC official said, “Eighty per cent of the cases are coming from high-rises and the trend shows that whichever area has a high ratio of high-rise buildings, the number of active cases is on the higher side.”The official added, “Several people who live in slums may have developed antibodies, due to which there are no cases there anymore.”Also Read: Oxford scientists develop 5-minute Covid-19 antigen testThe sero-surveillance conducted by the BMC in two phases had revealed that the ratio of antibodies in those residing in slums increased significantly whereas that of people residing in non-slum areas increased marginally. This, the BMC has stated, could be one of the reason behind why non-slum areas are recording more cases.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant said, “There are chances that in the coming days too the trend of cases being reported from non-slum areas or high-rises will remain high, as the ratio of those developing antibodies in slum areas is increasing, which is evident from the results of BMC’s second sero-survey. Eventually, when the level of antibodies increaes in high-rises, the number of cases may reduce. But it depends on how helpful or effective antibodies are in the fight against Covid-19.”Further, according to the civic body’s data, 10 administrative wards in the city encompassing areas in the western suburbs like Borivali, Kandivali, Malad, Andheri, followed by Mulund, Ghatkopar in the eastern suburbs and Chowpatty, Ghatkopar and Malabar Hill have more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases.In terms of deaths, wards encompassing areas like Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Malad, Andheri and Borivali have recorded more than 400. Mumbai has 24 administrative wards. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, however, said the situation in the city has improved in the last month despite there being daily case load of between 2,000 to 2,500.Chahal on Monday said, “Exactly one month ago on September 11, BMC had 26,632 active Covid-19 cases whereas on October 11, the number of active Covid-19 cases fell to 22,369. The average death rate over the last one month has been 2.1%, resulting in a decrease in the overall death rate from 4.9% (as on September 11, 2020) to 4.14% (as on October 11, 2020).”Chahal added, “The number of vacant Covid-19 beds under BMC which was 4,165 on September 11 (including 85 ICU beds only) has increased to 4,922 on October 11 (including 257 ICU beds).”Meanwhile, as of Wednesday, Mumbai had 234,602 Covid-19 cases followed by 9,555 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-one-month-active-cases-come-down-in-mumbai-western-suburbs-continue-to-record-high-numbers/story-70s8LXeYaXkeuv4g4KTvEO.html

This is the longest shutdown for KNPTR in its 112-year history. KNPTR authorities said that the park famous for its one-horned rhinoceroses and tigers would be formally reopened at 11 am on October 21 by Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal at a function. All five national parks and 18 wildlife sanctuaries in Assam, including KNPTR, which usually remains shut for around five months annually due to floods, were closed in March following the Covid-19 outbreak. Also read: Two Assam men cover 400km of flooded Brahmaputra on bamboo raft“This is the longest period of closure for KNPTR. Usually, the park remains closed from the end of May because of annual floods. However, this year, it was shut for an additional two and half months due to Covid-19,” said P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR. “The usual precautionary measures such as wearing of masks, using hand sanitisers and maintaining social distancing will be put to practise while allowing tourists to enter the park. We will also ensure that a limited number of jeep safaris are allowed at a time. The vehicles’ tyres will be sanitised after each trip,” he added. All tourists will have to go through a screening process and anyone detected with Covid-19-related symptoms such as high fever, cough and could will be segregated and handed over to local health authorities. The elephant safaris won’t be allowed to operate during the first few days of the park’s reopening and may resume from November. Initially, only the Kohora and Bagori ranges of the park, which is spread over 914 square (sq) kilometres (km), would be reopened for tourists, the authorities added.

15-10-2020||Admission||DU admissions: First round complete, but confusion prevails||Admissions to Delhi University (DU) have taken the digital route this year. However, the first round of cut offs and online admissions was a miss, with DU aspirants from various parts of the country claiming the process to be riddled with problems. With the introduction of new features on DU’s website, students are in a fix, as they look ahead to the second cut-off. “I wanted to apply for BA (Prog) and wanted to check out the options and combinations for it while filing for admission online, but the options were not available. This has confused me, and I’m unable to gather information on what combination of subjects can be offered to be in the course,” says Brajesh Bharadwaj, a DU aspirant from Delhi.Students are facing problems because of technical difficulties. “Due to technical glitch, it’s showing that the application is rejected! There’s a problem in suggestive percentages also on the portal. We are trying to contact the nodal officers but they aren’t helping. No one picks the phone when we keep calling,” says Pratibha Sinha, a Ghaziabad-based DU aspirant.There is confusion among students on how to take an undertaking from colleges to be able to submit complete documents after some time.“Some colleges aren’t accepting undertaking that they use to give until last year to students to give a window to submit incomplete documents. This is very unfortunate because in pandemic times, it’s even more difficult to procure complete documents if something goes missing. Those colleges that are accepting undertaking, haven’t specified how one goes about submitting the incomplete documents. We aren’t even given an option to upload anything other than mark sheets on the portal,” says Arti Kumar, a Delhi-based DU aspirant.There is little information about online admissions for students applying for sports quota, which is usually quite a sizeable number of students in the varsity. “No clarity on admissions from sports or EWS quota regarding the cut offs and forms is there. It’s a bit unnerving,” says Ashima Sharma, a Gurugram-based DU aspirant. There have been various helps desks and student initiatives to help those facing problems in online admissions. One such help desk by the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU). “All DU aspirants facing problems must reach out to DUSU help desk with their problems. We will try to assist them in whatever scope we can, as we have been doing so far,” says Shubham Chaudhary, executive councillor, DUSU.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/college-admissions/du-admissions-first-round-complete-but-confusion-prevails/story-h0pt5vuLLSNH4szxDsGg4I.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||‘Partial’ Centre acting as ‘mouthpiece’ for polluting states, says Delhi minister Gopal Rai||Delhi’s environment minister, Gopal Rai, on Thursday hit out at the central government saying that while Delhi has been undertaking strict measures to control pollution levels in the city, the Centre was going easy on neighbouring states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh by overlooking polluting activities there. He said that the Centre was acting as a “mouthpiece” for other states, which had done little to control pollution because of which Delhi was suffering.Responding to a statement by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar early Thursday, Rai said that a fortnight ago Delhi had the same local sources of pollution, but the levels spiked only after stubble burning activities started in Punjab and Haryana.Javadekar said that only 4% of pollution in Delhi is due to stubble burning, while 96% of it is due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, and construction and demolition activities.“The Delhi government is doing everything in our power to control pollution levels in the city, but instead of encouraging our efforts, the Centre is pulling us down and rewarding those states where their governments are in power,” he said.Calling the Centre’s attitude towards Delhi “partial”, Rai said that while Delhi was prompt in abiding by the winter segment of the Supreme Court approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) by implementing a complete ban on diesel generator sets, Haryana was asking for exemptions from the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA).“The Centre is also considering an extension of deadlines for thermal power plants to install air pollution control equipment. Why should they be given any extensions?” Rai asked.“The fire map of Nasa [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shows the intensity of fires in the states of Punjab and Haryana. Fortunately, or unfortunately, air cannot be divided into states, and Delhi is affected by any polluting activity within a radius of 300kms.”Rai also announced a campaign ‘red light on, gadi off [as red lights turn on, turn off the ignition]’ on Thursday to control the contribution of vehicular pollution in the city.He said that while the government was working towards keeping a check on other sources such as construction sites and waste burning, vehicular pollution can be controlled by a mass movement, where every citizen of Delhi can contribute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/partial-centre-acting-as-mouthpiece-for-polluting-states-says-delhi-minister-gopal-rai/story-VN4ZCWdu3TebkoHkxvQoEN.html

He added a Special Investigation Team constituted to probe the case found she was not at the location where her father claimed she was gang-raped.“All I can tell you at this point in time is that the woman was never abducted by the seven men. Secondly, her son was not strangled to death,” he said.Singh added the woman was accompanying a man she was in a relationship with when he got into an argument with his associates. It was then that the six-year-old fell into a canal, he added. “There are still certain facts which we need to verify. But one thing is clear she has not been gang-raped or raped by named and unknown persons at all...,” said Singh.The police have arrested two of the seven accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-man-accused-7-men-of-gang-raping-his-daughter-killing-her-son-to-settle-a-score/story-UtUQggfKYrfAxnDEvo86tN.html

Ninety-six per cent of it is due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities etc,” he said, adding that “Punjab government should ensure there is not much stubble burning this time,” the minister said.Responding to this, Delhi government environment minister Gopal Rai said the contribution from stubble burning is, in fact, 44% based on CPCB’s data.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted, “Staying in denial will not help. If stubble burning causes only 4% pollution, then why has pollution suddenly increased last fortnite? Air was clean before that. Same story every yr. There’s no massive jump in any local source of pollution in last few days to cause this spike?”Later, an MoEFCC spokesperson clarified that Javadekar was referring to the contribution of stubble burning only for this year, which is 4% till now. Last year, it was much higher. The ministry also tweeted, “Share of Stubble burning changes every day. Last year, between 08 Oct-09 Dec, the share of Stubble burning in #AirPollution in Delhi (as per SAFAR data), was greater than15% on six days, while on a single day it was greater than 40%.”Share of Stubble burning changes every day.

15-10-2020||City||Five years after disappearing, Andhra man found in Goa, reunited with his family||A little over five years ago, 21-year-old M Sudheer Kumar wandered out of his home at Siripuram village in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh and remained untraceable though his family continued to look for him in all the major cities of of the state and even neighbouring Telangana. Little did the family know that Kumar had walked all the way to Goa. While it is not clear what he did for the first two years, he had been in the care of Home for the Homeless in Margao, south Goa, which is run by an NGO, Street Providence. It is here that Kumar’s father, M Nageshwar Rao, came to take him home.Sudheer was found loitering around the Holy Spirit Church by Maria Ana, a volunteer of the NGO. “Sudheer never ever spoke from the time we picked him. He only shook his head when spoken to. But he understands English, Hindi and Telugu. The only time we heard him speak was in early 2018 when he answered a few questions when spoken to in Telugu,” Donald Fernandes who runs Street Providence told HT. Also read: Once forgotten, 1918 Spanish flu memorial gains following amid Covid-19 scare in GoaWith Sudheer refusing to speak or communicate, no one knew where he hailed from or if he had a family back home. However, something changed earlier this and he began to react to those around him. “When we picked him up, he was unkempt. All he did was eat, sleep and gaze into the oblivion,” Fernandes said. “During the last seven days, he started talking, reacting and began mumbling responses. But since even the Telugu translator couldn’t understand his mumblings, he asked Sudheer to write down what he wanted to say. At that, Sudheer wrote down the name of his village and district,” Fernandes said. “Sudheer Kumar, Medikonduru Mandal, Siripuram village, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh,” he wrote. The NGO then posted about him on social media and reached out to Telugu associations.Sudheer’s father said, “We first got a call from an election official via the panchayat that a young man had been found and we were put in touch. They also sent us a video of him to confirm whether it is the same boy... His mother back home can’t wait to get to see him.” The family says that Sudheer had a normal childhood and studied in school until his Standard XII besides also helping his father who runs a milk collection centre in his hometown. “He was just like any other child growing up but after his class 12, something went wrong,” Rao said, trying to explain his son’s illness. Meanwhile, the NGO is happy they could find Sudheer’s family for him. “It’s all the grace of God. We are just tools and we don’t claim any credit for the results. These services are tough yet achievable,” Fernandes said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-years-after-disappearing-andhra-man-found-in-goa-reunited-with-his-family/story-6Odv7odwVUKBjOuRfN34kK.html

15-10-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal launches ‘Red Light On Gaadi Off’ campaign to cut down on air pollution||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched a new anti-pollution campaign under which people will be encouraged to switch engines of their vehicles off while waiting at traffic signals.On Thursday, the pollution levels in the city remained in the “very poor” category. “It has been seen that we often do not switch off our vehicle engines while waiting at traffic signals. That is called idling. The ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign will aim to bring a behavioural change in that regard. It will help reduce air pollution,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing.He added, “Around 10 million vehicles are registered in Delhi. Even if one million of them actively follow the campaign, experts suggest that it can reduce PM10 emissions by 1.5 tonnes a year and PM2.5 emissions by 0.4 tonnes a year.”“Idling (waiting at a traffic signal with engine on) consumes more fuel than a normal drive. On average, a car is left idling for around 15 to 20 minutes a day, and that ends up exhausting at least 200ml of fuel. Experts have suggested that one can save ₹7,000 a year by avoiding idling,” the chief minister said.While appealing to all motorists to join the drive, Kejriwal said, “Covid-19 has led to distress among people, let’s ensure that pollution doesn’t make things worse for us.”“Crop stubble burning in neighbouring states leads to pollution in Delhi. That has been the case for years now. We cannot do much about other states, but we are taking all possible measures to control local sources of pollution by implementing an anti-dust strategy, a tree transplantation policy, an electric vehicle policy and decomposing crop stubble using new technology. This campaign will be another step towards reducing pollution,” he said.How the campaign will be implemented is being chalked out, environment minister Gopal Rai said later in the day. “This campaign has the potential to bring down vehicular pollution by 15-20%. We will start working on the road map of the campaign from Friday, after a meeting with all senior officials,” he said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, “For this campaign to work in terms of behavioural change, it is very important to make sure traffic signals have timers and that the timers are functional. Several survey estimates have shown that reduced idling can lead to energy saving and less toxic exposure to particulate matters, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxide.”Mukti Advani, principal scientist at the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said, “Switching off engines will reduce fuel consumption as the wait at any traffic signal may go beyond 20 seconds. In 2018, the CRRI had conducted an awareness campaign on idling along with Petroleum Conservation and Research Association and surveyed 100 intersections in the city for a period of six months.”“It is recommended that such awareness campaigns be conducted on a regular basis. An adequate number of countdown timers should be positioned correctly for better results,” said Advani, citing the survey findings. “However, Delhi needs to find alternative ways to decongest its roads; primarily, by reducing the number of private vehicles and by providing better public transport. Road capacity has to be improved by removing encroachments such as parked vehicles, and vehicles that break down on the road, etc,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-kejriwal-launches-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign-to-cut-down-on-air-pollution/story-rgAxxqxxOCM99FtarUVZuO.html

A day after their seven representatives boycotted a meeting called by the Union agriculture ministry in Delhi, members of all 30 farmer outfits are meeting in Chandigarh on Thursday to discuss the course of action. They are expected to scale up protests against the three farm laws passed in Parliament last month. NO EMERGENCY DUE TO RAIL BLOCKADES: FARMERS Patiala denied any “emergency-like situation” arising due to the rail blockades in the state since September 24. “The state government’s fears that the shortage of coal due to the disruption of supply in view of the rail blockades will impact power generation, and may lead to cuts, is unfounded. There is lots of power tied up from central sector plants,” Patiala said, adding that the state already has 70% of the total stocks of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and urea needed for rabi sowing. The farmers have also gheraoed business establishments in the state owned by corporate houses to protest the farm laws, which they believe will benefit big business houses. On Wednesday, the farmer representatives walked out of a meeting with the Union agriculture secretary, saying a minister who could decide on their demands should have been present. “We requested for a minister-level functionary having decision-making powers to hold talks but the central government acted on the contrary, due to which we took the drastic step (of walking out),” Patiala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-to-continue-with-rail-blockades-till-october-19-when-special-assembly-session-called/story-tvvNlANJIShJsLAynkhJPJ.html

The Maharashtra unit of the Congress has been protesting against the “anti-farmer” laws over the past three weeks after they were passed by Parliament. Party leaders will address the virtual farmers’ rally from six districts in the state on Thursday evening. Congress’s Maharashtra in-charge HK Patil, Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, state public works department (PWD) minister, former chief minister Ashok Chavan, and Member of Parliament (MP) Rajiv Satav will participate from Sangamner in Ahmednagar district.Former CM Prithviraj Chavan will address the rally from Kolhapur district. State medical education minister Amit Deshmukh , women and child development (WCD) minister Yashomati Thakur and energy minister Nitin Raut will take part from Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur districts, respectively. Party leader Muzaffar Hussain will join the protest from Palghar district.Also read: Congress-ruled states to intensify farm law stir“We have put up LED (light-emitting diode) screens, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projector screens and TVs at central places in 10,000 villages to enable farmers to participate. Community, marriage halls, grounds etc have been identified for meetings by the local members of the Maharashtra legislative assembly (MLAs), leaders and district presidents. In some of the districts such as Gadchiroli and Chandrapur, where the internet connectivity is poor, we will not be able to reach out to local farmers. We are expecting an impressive response in those districts, where the party has a strong leadership. Thursday evening’s event will be an unprecedented experience for both our leaders and workers,” said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity. Thorat said the party would continue to oppose the anti-farmer black laws. “The laws, which were passed without any discussion or debate, do not assure minimum support price (MSP) and will do away with the Agricultural Produce Market Committees’ (APMCs) protection that farmers have been enjoying for all these years. All three ruling parties in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government are on the same page as far as the opposition to these laws is concerned. We will not allow their implementation in Maharashtra,” he added.Earlier, the party had launched a digital drive #SpeakUpForFarmers across various social media platforms on September 26 following which they met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari two days later and demanded the scrapping of the laws. On the occasion of the Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, the party had held protest rallies across the state. It has also begun a campaign, which is aimed at collecting the signature of one crore farmers by October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-bills-maharashtra-congress-to-hold-virtual-rally-5-million-farmers-from-10-000-villages-set-to-join/story-f456bsWVA8Hrn6aFk2vyTI.html
15-10-2020||City||Saamana pulls up Governor, says he showed how someone in his position should not behave||Saamana, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, on Thursday launched an attack on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over his letter to the state chief minister and party chief Uddhav Thackeray and alleged that it was an example of how a person occupying the gubernatorial post should not behave. The editorial pointed out that the CM responded to the letter in his signature “Thackeray style”. “Bhagat Singh Koshyari has shown how a person occupying the post of a Governor should not behave. Koshyari may have been a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) pracharak or a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)leader, but now he is the governor of a progressive state such as Maharashtra. He seems to have forgotten the post he occupies for his convenience. The BJP leaders of Maharashtra indulges in a slander campaign against the state government every morning. It is understandable. But why is the governor a part of the campaign?” the editorial alleged.Also read: Row between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and CM Uddhav Thackeray may not end soonThere has been a bitter exchange of letters between Governor Koshyari and CM Thackeray. The Governor had demanded that places of worship be reopened, despite the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and also asked CM Thackeray if he had suddenly “turned secular”. In a strong rebuttal, the CM questioned the Governor whether he did not believe in secularism, a key tenet of the Constitution. Thackeray also slammed Koshyari for his statement that his brand of Hindutva did not need any certificate from the latter.“The Governor’s letter to the CM reeks of foolishness. The CM has hit out against it only once and that was enough... This resonance of the tolling bells (referring to BJP’ Ghantanaad agitation to reopen the places of worship) must have reached Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah’s ears. They must recall the Governor to save the prestige of the Raj Bhavan,” it said.The party mouthpiece lauded the CM’s response to the Governor’s letter.“The CM caught the loincloth (dhoti) of the Governor and shook the Raj Bhavan. Using this language will be unconstitutional. But it is true that the CM responded in his signature Thackeray style,” it added.The editorial slammed Governor Koshyari, who is also holding the additional charge of Goa , and asked why he had not written a letter to Goa CM Pramod Sawant demanding reopening of places of worship. It alleged that famous temples in Goa such as Mangeshi, Mahalaxmi, Mahalsa are still shut. “Why has Governor Koshyari not asked Goa CM Sawant to reopen the places of worship? Such questions are only asked in Maharashtra because the state doesn’t have a BJP CM,” the editorial further alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/saamana-pulls-up-governor-says-he-showed-how-someone-in-his-position-should-not-behave/story-l92kRK8L5R6QZHIkFJ0qpO.html
15-10-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: In a first, BSP, SP, BJP, Congress field Brahmins for Deoria bypoll||For the first time in over four decades, all four candidates fielded by major political parties—the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)—in Uttar Pradesh for the Deoria assembly bypoll scheduled on November 3 are Brahmins.The BJP and the SP were the latest to finalise and announce their nominees on Wednesday.The BJP has settled for a political science lecturer in Satya Prakash Mani, a trusted party hand. The SP has fielded Brahma Shankar Tripathi, an influential former minister and lawmaker, replacing former MLC JP Jaiswal.The Congress, which was the first to declare Mukund Bhaskar Mani Tripathi, a local, as its candidate, had last fielded a Brahmin candidate in 1974 when it had given a ticket to Deep Narayan Mani Tripathi. The BSP has fielded Abhay Nath Tripathi this time. The constituency has about 55,000-60,000 Brahmin voters, who constitute approximately 18-19% of the vote bank.According to political leaders and poll observers, an all-Brahmin cast of major political players would make it a ‘must watch’ election.Also Read: UP considering Centre like festival bonanza for its employees before Diwali“I never heard of all major political parties settling for Brahmins here and, yes, it would make it very interesting,” said JP Shukla, a veteran journalist. The ‘Ram vs Parshuram’ controversy that played out recently in the state could stage a comeback here, some observers said. The issue had come up in August when a foundation led by SP leader Abhishek Mishra announced plans to install a 108-foot statue of Parshuram in Lucknow and the BSP responded by vowing to install an even bigger statue. The move was seen as a way to woo Brahmins, who constitute 10% of the state’s electorate, as Parshuram, considered the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon, was also a Brahmin. He is also said to have cleansed the world of Kshatriyas on several occasions. Ram, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon, was a Kshatriya.In a veiled message during a state assembly session in August, Adityanath said going against Ram or his values has proven to be self-destructive. “But these people don’t like the concept of Ram Rajya… they could not suppress their feelings when the construction of Ram temple began… I am surprised to hear their statements… They are the same people who ordered firing on the ‘Ram Bhakts’.”Also Read: Global Handwashing Day : UP CM Yogi Adityanath to start #HaathDhonaRokeyCoronaOnce known as the sugar bowl of eastern UP, Deoria is barely three hours’ drive from Ayodhya.“Our opponents had, in the past, attempted to sully the political environment by pitting Lord Ram against Lord Parshuram. Deoria is the perfect place to expose such people who try to divide the gods. We worked for Ram (temple) in Ayodhya and now we will also come up with a befitting abode for Lord Parshuram too,” said Sunil Bharala, the chairman of the state welfare board and a minister in the UP government. SP leader Abhishek Mishra, who will be in Deoria on Thursday for his party candidate’s nomination, said, “We will definitely raise issues related to Brahmins.”The Congress, however, has claimed it has fielded a party worker whose caste was ‘coincidental’. “We were the first to name a candidate and hence can’t be accused of playing caste politics. We will surprise the opponents,” said UP Congress committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu. “Our opponents were hoping that since the seat was represented by Janmejay Singh, a Sainthawar (OBC), for the last couple of elections, the ticket would go to someone from his caste. Yet by fielding a local person, a teacher who happens to be a Brahmin, we have poured cold water on the opposition’s plans,” a BJP leader from eastern UP said.SP’s IP Singh said his party’s announcement forced the BJP to name a Brahmin. “They are copycats. We are trailblazers,” said Singh.BJP’s political opponents are also expected to use the campaign to highlight the alleged ‘excesses’ on Brahmins under the party rule. The SP and BSP workers have reportedly been asked to ready a list of so-called ‘atrocities’ on Brahmins which could be played up in the election campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-in-a-first-bsp-sp-bjp-congress-field-brahmins-for-deoria-bypoll/story-JnEnuIpRKRiUtAiPe5ZOUP.html

We have received the confirmation. The rally is being organised on the sidelines of a Durga Puja that is being organised (not by the party) in Salt Lake,” said Sayantan Basu, general secretary of the BJP’s Bengal unit. A Durga Puja is being organised at EZCC in Salt Lake, in which BJP karyakartas will only participate. The party is not organising any puja on its own. Also Read: Mamata Banerjee to inaugurate Durga Pujas in Kolkata todayA senior BJP leader said that Modi’s address on Durga Sasthi would virtually kickstart the party’s battle for the crucial assembly polls in 2021. The BJP has decided not to project anyone as its chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming polls. Instead the party would highlight the achievements of the Modi government to counter the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state. “With elections coming, our poll battle will pick up once the festive season is over. Protests would continue meanwhile. We are waiting for the Prime Minister’s address as this might also give us some directions,” said a senior leader of the party. Early next week, just ahead of the Durga Puja, BJP president JP Nadda is expected to visit North Bengal where the party grew exponentially and had won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019. After the Durga Puja, Union home minster Amit Shah is likely to visit south Bengal where the ruling TMC still holds its ground. “While Nadda is expected to visit north Bengal on October 19, Shah is yet to confirm the dates,” said a party leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/prime-minister-narendra-modi-to-address-bengal-bjp-on-durga-sasthi/story-Z5rSh5cmzL3k5K1RYwLniP.html

Police officials, who recovered three bodies till Thursday morning, said, the victims were trying to cross a small bridge erected on a stream at Khanote village in Daund tehsil when they were swept away in swollen waters. Officials said a search is on for the fourth person.By midnight, rains relented completely in most parts of the district but the weather department has predicted more rainfall till Friday due to moisture incursion from depression over the interiors of Karnataka and the system moving into Maharashtra.Savitribai Phule Pune university has cancelled its final year exam scheduled on Thursday in view of the rains. The airport authorities said the heavy rains last night forced a Chennai-Pune flight to be diverted while a Pune-Bengaluru flight was sent back to the originating airport apart from several other incidents of flight delays. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune Shivajinagar received 96 mm rainfall on Wednesday, leaving several roads, housing societies and parking areas inundated while 10 vehicles were washed away in separate incidents in rural parts of the district. As the rainfall intensified post 6 pm, water gushed into Chandan Nagar police station, flooding documents, files and furniture. In the southern parts of Pune, two incidents of wall collapse were reported from Sahakar Nagar. Last year on September 25, flash floods had killed 26 people and washed away over 1000 vehicles, with Sahakar Nagar being the worst hit. Several low-lying areas reported water logging apart from power outage seen in most parts of the city though electricity was restored by Thursday morning. The central fire brigade said that water entered houses in Hadapsar, Kondhwa, Aundh, Bhavani Peth and Nana Peth areas resulting in fire brigade being pressed into service.Also Read: Maharashtra rains: Savitribai Phule Pune University postpones online, offline exams“We received frantic call from residents around 9 pm that water entered the houses following which rescue vans and fire brigade personnel with necessary equipment were sent for the assistance of citizens.

15-10-2020||City||Trains to Katra for Navratri cancelled due to farmers’ agitation in Punjab||Even as the Jammu and Kashmir administration mobilised its resources to ensure strict adherence to the Covid-19 guidelines ahead of nine-day long Navratri festival in Katra, two trains—Vande Bharat and Shri Shakti Express, scheduled to run from Delhi on Thursday—were cancelled at the last minute in view of the farmers’ agitation in Punjab over the controversial agrarian laws. Director of Jammu Railway station and senior divisional traffic manager Railways Sudhir Singh, said, “Vande Bharat and Shri Shakti Express trains from Delhi to Katra have been cancelled due to the farmers’ agitation in Punjab. Every day it appears that the farmers’ agitation will subside but it’s still lingering.” “Till it ends, trains can’t be run. Now we will see on Friday if we can run them,” he added. The official said that a passenger train usually transports1,000 passengers. Also Read: Delhi-Katra Vande Bharat, Chandigarh-Delhi Shatabdi: List of new trains available from October 15“However, it depends upon ticketing and how many people want to visit the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine,” he added. “The Jammu and Kashmir administration, in tandem with the railways, has made all arrangements for the Navratri festival. The first Vande Bharat train had to run on Thursday. Now, we will see if we can run it on Friday,” he said. The administration has made Covid-19 testing arrangements in Katra, Udhampur and Jammu. Security is also in place at Katra and the Vaishno Devi shrine. Reasi district police chief, SSP Rashmi Wazir, said, “We have deployed five quick reaction teams in Katra and three in the Bhawan (the sanctum sanctorum). There are eight police checkposts along the tracks leading up to the cave shrine and there will be round-the-clock patrolling during the festival.” She added that armed security personnel, policemen and CRPF personnel will guard the pilgrimage site 24x7. “We are confident of an incident-free Navratri festival,” she said. Wazir said Udhampur-Reasi range deputy inspector general of police, Sujit Kumar, reviewed the arrangements for the festival in Katra on Tuesday. “The cap on per day pilgrims to the shrine has been increased to 7,000 from 5,000. During the festival, two special trains, apart from Vande Bharat, will also run from Varanasi and Delhi,” she added. The health department has also augmented its infrastructure, setting up more testing kiosks and staff in Katra, including the railway station. Every pilgrim arriving in Katra will have to undergo a rapid antigen test (RAT) before being allowed to proceed on the pilgrimage. In case anyone tests positive, they will have to be quarantined in Katra for 10 days. A few hotels have also been identified for paid quarantine. However, if persons who test positive don’t want to be quarantined for 10 days, they can avail cabs to return home by road. Reasi district commissioner Indu Kanwal Chib said, “There are 10 testing kiosks at the Katra railway station for the visiting pilgrims and five more will be added depending upon the bookings.” “Covid-19 testing arrangements are in place. Our health staff has also been augmented. We are prepared for the yatra to begin this Saturday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trains-to-katra-for-navratri-cancelled-due-to-farmers-agitation-in-punjab/story-pTOVGMNNOP3E3deMxpCa4L.html
15-10-2020||City||NGT slams district bodies for failing to restore 490-year-old wetland in Maharashtra||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the restoration of a 490-year-old wetland in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district and directed the bank account of the state public works department (PWD) be seized since its previous orders were not adhered to.The NGT principal bench of Justice Sheo Kumar Singh and expert member Dr Satyawan Singh Gabryal on October 9 directed the Sindhudurg district collector to ensure that an amount of Rs 1.5 crore is seized in the bank account of the PWD till the time it does not transfer the amount to State Biodiversity Board to restore the heritage Dhamapur Lake, a notified wetland.The district administration has also been directed to take necessary steps to remove all obstructions and illegalities (in terms of construction) undertaken in violation of the Wetland 2017 rules.Also read: Nothing more damaging than feeling helpless, says NGT in warning to Goa agency against violationsThe bench was hearing a 2017 application by Sindhudurg residents Dr Harishchandra Purshottam Natu and Omkar Keni before NGT, Pune, saying encroachments and the construction of skywalks around the Dhamapur Lake by the PWD with permissions issued by the district administration was shrinking the size of the lake and causing environmental degradation.The Dhamapur Lake, an inland wetland and a permanent freshwater lake, spread over about 44.8 hectares was constructed in 1530 between villages Are and Katta. The lake is surrounded by hills and dense plantation of mango, coconut and areca palm. It is both a source of drinking water and agricultural water source. It is one of the top 100 wetlands in India identified by the Union environment ministry for rapid restoration and improvement, and also a projected Ramsar site by the Maharashtra government. There are 193 floral and 247 faunal species in this wetland.The latest order by NGT clarified that on July 2, 2018, the Pune bench had ordered that the skywalk construction was in violation of wetland rules and had encroached the water body causing water pollution and destruction of natural biodiversity. PWD was directed to pay Rs. 1.5 crore back then for restoring the wetland and submit environment compensation costs to the State Biodiversity Board. However, the order was never followed.“Since order has been passed against the PWD who was the project proponent thus responsibility to pay the amount is with the PWD department. Since the amount has not been deposited thus we direct that the account of the PWD be seized to the extent of Rs 1.5 crore till the amount is deposited to the biodiversity board,” the order said.A statement to HT by advocates representing the applicant Rahul Choudhary and Kanika Sood said, “Despite the construction being illegal and within the notice of all statutory authorities, it took the order of the NGT and the subsequent declaration of the lake as a wetland for a direction to the authorities to remove the structure. Further the fine of Rs. 1.5 crores had been imposed in 2018 but no action was ever taken to comply with the order. We hope the statutory authorities comply with the latest order and preserve the wetland.”The NGT noted the district collector. as the public representative of the state, is responsible for any activity within the district. “Accordingly, a show-cause notice be issued to the Sindhudurg collector why action should not be initiated against him/her for not taking any action with regard to the illegality committed by the officers concerned,” the order said. In 2019, the NGT has also issued a bailable warrant against the Sindhudurg collector who had failed to appear in person despite specific directions to do so.Shubhangi Anil Sathe, resident deputy collector, Sindhudurg, said, “We have already begun working on this issue and soon enough the bank account would be seized as directed by the NGT. Simultaneous work is underway to restore the wetland through the skywalk demolition, and all directions will be complied with.”Applicant Omkar Keni, also a member of the Sindhudurg Wetland Brief Documentation Committee, said applicants would be submitting suggestions for the process to demolish the skywalk. “The collector should form a civil society committee for monitoring and for expert advice during demolition and restoration measures. Demolition should be done in the period of March-May following the Pollution Control Board norms under the supervision of civil society members,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngt-slams-district-bodies-for-failing-to-restore-490-year-old-wetland-in-maharashtra/story-36ssEh3X3lCkyTdUFEDPCK.html

Zeliang said his party hoped that CM Rio would display a positive attitude towards civil society organisations and stakeholders, and the state government would come up with a concrete decision.The Nagaland Pradesh Congress Committee (NPCC) issued a statement and condemned the consultative meeting as superfluous. It cited that the negotiating parties had made it clear that the Naga talks had successfully concluded on October 31, 2019, following which the interlocutor and Governor of Nagaland RN Ravi had held a series of consultations with various stakeholders.“Since we are at the threshold of inking a final agreement, we anticipate that the state government under CM Rio will step down in favour of solution, which has been his commitment for the past 17 years. He has never failed to remind the people of Nagaland about this while addressing every political or social gathering in the state,” the NPCC’s statement read. It urged CM Rio to uphold his commitment and avoid being an obstacle. The Nagaland unit of the JD (U), which has also announced to skip the meeting, blamed the Rio administration for its failure to handle the issue. It ,too, urged the CM to demit office following an interim arrangement between the Naga nationalist groups and the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/several-parties-to-stay-away-from-meet-on-naga-political-issue-congress-asks-nagaland-cm-to-step-down/story-9xM5FjgvdpasC1Z3520BpK.html

15-10-2020||Kolkata||PM Modi likely to deliver message for Bengal on Durga Puja||For the first time, the women’s wing of West Bengal BJP will be organising Durga puja, the biggest festival of the state, in an apparent bid to gain political mileage ahead of next year’s Assembly election, a party leader said on Wednesday.The puja will be held at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Salt Lake which is close to Kolkata. The EZCC is under the overall supervision of the Union Ministry of Culture and the West Bengal governor is its chairman.“The Mahila Morcha and the cultural cell of the party have been given the responsibility to organise Durga Puja at EZCC this year. This is the first time that we are organising a puja,” BJP women wing state president Agnimitra Paul said.Cultural programmes will also be held during the festival.Asked why the party is organising the puja, a senior state BJP leader alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress had stopped various community puja committees from allowing BJP leaders to get associated with them.“What would you do when you are not allowed to be part of puja committees? You will organise a Durga puja on your own. That’s what we are doing,” the BJP leader said.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, however, said the party is not directly involved in organising the puja.“It is being organised by our cultural and women’s wings. The party is not directly involved in it,” he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to deliver a message on October 22 for the people of West Bengal on the occasion of Durga puja, state party vice-president Pratap Banerjee said.TMC supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee has announced that Durga puja this year will be held in the state adhering strictly to Covid-19 safety protocol.After decades of its limited presence in the politically polarised state, the BJP has emerged as the main rival to the ruling Trinamool Congress winning 18 of its 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections.With the BJP’s strength increasing manifold in the last few years in the state, where it has never been in power, party leaders have expressed confidence that it will end Banerjee’s 10-year rule in the Assembly polls likely to be held in April-May next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/pm-modi-likely-to-deliver-message-on-oct-22-for-bengal-on-durga-puja/story-sFopDugbY98kCEymAIYs8O.html

The weather bureau has said the entire Konkan coast, including Mumbai, is expected to receive heavy to very heavy rain with the possibility of extremely heavy rain on Thursday. Due to intermittent spells of heavy rain, Mumbai recorded its second highest monthly rainfall (144.8mm) in a decade. The highest was in 2012 when 197.7mm of rainfall was recorded in October.The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 86.5mm of rain between 8.30am Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday, with a majority of the rainfall recorded overnight (8.30pm to 8.30am).

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) did not have past rain data for Colaba for October but said this was one of the highest 24-hour rainfall ever recorded during the month. “The city and suburbs both witnessed intense thunderstorm activity through the night with a dense cloud cover over Mumbai, located 10km from the ground, leading to widespread rain activity. Early morning commuters are likely to face severe difficulties due to waterlogging in low-lying areas,” KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD, said. The maximum rainfall was recorded at Worli (110.8mm) followed by Navi Mumbai (101mm), and Mazgaon (97.2mm). The rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region recorded rainfall between 50mm and 85mm over the past 24 hours.Hosalikar added that intense cloud cover was observed off the coast of Mumbai on Thursday morning. “The well-marked low pressure area is now located over south central Maharashtra and around south Konkan. It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and emerge into the Arabian Sea off the Maharashtra coast, and intensify into a depression over Arabian Sea over the next 48 hours,” said Hosalikar. “Intense rain is expected during the evening and late at night, similar to Wednesday,” said Hosalikar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-decade-s-highest-24-hour-october-rain-2nd-highest-monthly-rain-in-10-years/story-5DGtX98zNszUW9jkdXMEWK.html

But while the Thak-Thak gangs would follow up the currency trick by using guile to steal their victims’ belongings, mostly from their car, in the latest case, the snatchers used force to take away the victim’s bag.Also read: Parliament committee to discuss crime in Delhi-NCRHowever, the victim chased and caught both the suspects and recovered his bag from them, said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north).The crime took place on Monday evening while 57-year-old Padam Prakash Gautam was riding his motorcycle from his home in Harsh Vihar to Kamla Market. “When he reached the Geeta Colony Flyover, he saw five Rs 500 notes lying on the road. He stopped his motorcycle to pick them up,” said the DCP.Gautam had barely kept the notes in his bag that the two suspects, riding a motorcycle, swooped on him and snatched his bag. In addition to the currency he had just picked up, Gautam’s bag had Rs1,500 in cash, said the DCP.“He chased the snatchers and recovered his bag from them. The police were called and the two suspects, Nizamuddin and Adil, were arrested,” said the DCP, adding that a probe is on to know how many more people the duo targeted using the same modus operandi.Another investigator said that the gang resorted to this method as they anticipated no resistance, no chase and no risk in this trick. “They thought that they could even recover the cash they invested in the crime,” said the investigator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-snatchers-throw-cash-on-road-to-trap-their-victims-both-caught-handed-over-to-police/story-JXqcvHKQPnxTq3ItjGlHYJ.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Birders, fishers told to stay away from Panje as tidal water flow stopped to site||Fresh trouble is brewing at the Panje area in Navi Mumbai’s Uran, where birders and fisherfolk who have identified several environmental violations in the past, have been told to remain clear of the site and were also taken to a local police station allegedly by landowners.At the same time, an excavator machine was spotted on Wednesday with plans to commence debris dumping on the parched wetland where only a handful of birds were spotted as high tide water ingress had been blocked, said environmentalists.Apart from being a source of survival for the local fishing community, Panje is a destination for thousands of migratory birds and an ecologically sensitive area where countless ornithologists and bird enthusiasts have been gathering over the years. However, the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco) and Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) plan to build an integrated township at Panje.Local resident and birder Parag Gharat said he was told by NMSEZ representatives and security guards placed by Cidco to stay away from the site. “I was taken to the local police station at Nhava Sheva where I had to promise not to visit the wetland again or face action since construction is commencing and the area is not a wetland,” he said.Also read: NMSEZ damaged Uran mangroves, wetlands, reveals RTIPramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco said he was not aware of any such action. “We will look into the matter and speak to NMSEZ officials on any developments at the site,” he said.“We have no information on any police complaint but a large portion of Panje belongs to NMSEZ and the site is an agricultural area, not a wetland,” said an NMSEZ spokesperson.An official from the Nhava Sheva police said they had summoned three persons for taking photographs and fishing at Panje. “We have received complaints. It is private property and these acts are not allowed,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Environmentalist Aishwarya Sridhar was accosted by unidentified persons on Tuesday for taking photographs at Panje. “I feel very sad to see Panje dried up and the sight of birds sitting on the dried wetland was heartbreaking. There is absolutely no value for ecosystems like wetlands and big corporations are trading our ecology for the economy. The development has to be sustainable. If we lose Panje we lose an important flood control mechanism for Mumbai city,” she said.Environment groups have been petitioning environment minister Aaditya Thackeray to declare Panje a bird sanctuary. “It is illegal to treat the wetland as private property, and even more illegal to stop tidal water flow to dry out the land for construction,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation.HT reported last week that information obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) showed that NMSEZ had illegally started landfill at Panje wetland through a local contractor while damaging the Pagote and Bhendkhal wetlands in the Uran region in Raigad district across Mumbai harbour. “Neither the NMSEZ security nor police has any business to stop any free movement of people at Panje,” said environmentalist Nandkumar Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/birders-fishers-told-to-stay-away-from-panje-as-tidal-water-flow-stopped-to-site/story-rkYWWqLDhMP00uyUwrJFNJ.html

Also read: Multiplexes, cinemas prep to reopen in Bengal, 12 films due for release next weekMeanwhile, a PIL has been filed in the Calcutta high court to stall the festivities around the Durga Puja which starts from next week. The PIL says that the festivities could lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases as was seen in Kerala after Onam. The matter is likely to be heard on Friday. “This is for the first time that I am inaugurating and seeing some of the pujas in the districts as everything is being done virtually because of the pandemic,” Banerjee said, while inaugurating some of the pujas on Wednesday. Earlier this week, Banerjee had announced that she would virtually inaugurate dozens of pujas this time. Some of the major pujas in Kolkata, patronised by senior Trinamool Congress leaders and ministers would be inaugurated from Thursday. “She is expected to inaugurate pujas in north Kolkata while on October 15 and those in south Kolkata the next day,” said a government official. Durga Puja would be celebrated for four days starting October 23. This year, more than 37,000 pujas would be organised across the state, including more than 2,500 in Kolkata and around 1,700 pujas which are organised by women. The list doesn’t include those organised inside housing societies and homes. While the festive season has started and puja shopping is going on in full swing, puja committees are hiving final touches to the pandals. Several restrictions, such as a ban on cultural programs near pandals and no entry in pandals without masks, have been imposed. The immersion carnival, a pet project of Banerjee’s which had become a major crowd puller, has also been cancelled this year because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-to-inaugurate-durga-pujas-in-kolkata-today/story-b2JcMWa2yFNdzPmAbO1QUP.html

15-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Beyond Humayun’s Tomb||The big one, Pilkhan, is 104 years old, and the small one, frangipani, is just 15. You too might have noticed the juxtaposed beauty of these two trees— or not. After all, it is difficult to look away from Humayun’s Tomb when one is in Humayun’s Tomb.The iconic monument complex sprawls over several acres, and every bit of it is as beautiful as the signature building. With the hot weather gone, you must spend an entire day here, from morning to evening, as this is the only way to experience the place in all its subtleties.The Mughal-era complex is studded with scores of smaller monuments. One of these—Isa Khan’s mausoleum, with its accompanying mosque—is a world of its own. It has already been celebrated in these pages. After having surveyed both the big tombs, this must be your plan of action for the rest of the day:Aimlessly stroll about the gardensCircle around the rarely frequented buildings on the peripheriesObserve the fellow visitors, and eavesdrop on their talks (as fun as any rom-com)Gaze upon the trees and flowersLounge on one of the garden benchesThen there’s another dimension to Humayun’s Tomb—heard, not seen. The air hums intermittently with the chuk-chuk sound of trains—the railway track runs behind the monument, and the engines’ horn hauntingly evokes all the far-off lands the trains are headed to. While the bird chatter is so loud that you fear the trees from which it is coming might explode any moment. Indeed, there is arguably no other place in Delhi where you can hear so many diverse avian sounds all at the same time, and without a break (Lodhi Garden’s bird orchestra performs only in the evening).Occasionally, the laughter of visitors inside the monument echoes out, briefly disrupting the aural harmony of the place.Another absorbing sight is to observe the people with a day job in the monument—the guards strolling about their assigned areas (what can be going on in their mind during these long, lonesome shifts?), the grass cutters cutting the grass with their back towards the Humayun’s Tomb, and the sweating gardeners gathering the fallen leaves into bundles.By the time the evening sets in and it is time to leave, the monument and its surroundings have been viewed through many moods and many shades of daylight. One feels one has made a long journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-beyond-humayun-s-tomb/story-6U83gMve9pqXgokhKEN1OK.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi Pollution: Gensets banned, Grap rules kick in||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Wednesday announced a ban on the use of fuel-powered generators from October 15 under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels.On Wednesday, the overall air quality index (AQI) was 276 in the “poor” category, an improvement from the previous day’s 300. However, a layer of haze hung over the Capital, leading to concerns of an impending bad air crisis like previous years. The AQI hit “very poor” on Tuesday morning, and touched 318, the worst level since February this year.“DPCC hereby bans the operation of generator sets of all capacities, run on diesel, petrol or kerosene in Delhi with effect from October 15 till further orders, excluding those used for essential or emergency services,” an order read.Bhure Lal, chairperson of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), a Supreme Court-appointed body tasked with overseeing the implementation of the pollution control action plan in the National Capital Region (NCR), said that Grap will be enforced “with no concessions” to any state.Also Read: Smoggy Delhi struggles to shrug off toxic pollutantsThis means that from Thursday, generator sets will not be allowed in Delhi and the neighbouring towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Greater Noida and Faridabad. The only exception to this will be emergency services such as hospitals, elevators, airports, railway and Delhi Metro services.Grap lays down sets of curbs that are enforced when AQI crosses certain thresholds — the most serious of these include a ban on trucks, odd-even road restrictions, curbs on construction work, and an advisory to shut schools.Reminding the states to strictly enforce the genset ban, Lal on Wednesday wrote to the chief secretaries of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, asking them to issue directions to their respective state electricity boards to ensure 24x7 electricity supply to avoid the need for generator sets.“...As you are aware that any deterioration in ambient air quality in the region during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic would have considerable ramifications in terms of health of the residents of Delhi-NCR, sincere efforts must be made to ensure that the ban is effective and monitored rigorously in your area,” Lal wrote.While Delhi has been enforcing a ban on diesel gensets before the winter season since 2017, last year, the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asked for an extension till October 2020 from Epca to ensure that all power grids are installed in areas that are completely dependent on gensets.On Tuesday, Haryana’s additional chief secretary (power department), Trilok C Gupta wrote to the Epca chief, stating that as many as 14,000 residents in Gurugram and Faridabad will be affected by this ban as their residential societies are dependent on generator sets to meet power demands.“They (Haryana) have not asked for an exemption. I responded to their letter asking what they expected from Epca and I have not received any response,” Lal said on Wednesday. Lal told ANI: “Epca is not happy with the situation. We waited for one year… “Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers during Diwali result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 ultra-fine particles in the air, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs.Responding to Epca directions, DPCC issued its order stating that the ban will be implemented strictly across the Capital. The regional pollution control body directed all concerned agencies to comply with the order and submit a daily action-taken report. Violators will be prosecuted under the Air (Pollution and Control of Pollution) Act, with fines depending on the size of the gensets being used. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that the “abject inaction” of the government in neighbouring Haryana was the prime cause for Delhi’s increasing pollution. “As Grap will come into force from October 15, the use of diesel gensets will be banned in the regions of Delhi-NCR. While Delhi government has dutifully followed the rules set forth by Epca, our neighbours in Haryana don’t seem to want to take any action,” he said.Also Read: Shut down thermal plants in NCR, Delhi tells CentreAnumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said there could be challenges in implementing the anti-pollution curbs this year because of restrictions brought on by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “We will be working with certain limitations this year. This means, we will have to put into use what we have learnt from the (Covid-19) lockdown and ensure that the winter emergency action plan does not get affected by it,” Roychowdhury said.“For instance, the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme might not be very easy to implement this time because we need have to ensure social distancing inside public transport systems and because of that buses and the Metro are operating with limited passengers. Unless we provide a viable public transport option for people, we cannot push private vehicles off the road.” According to Grap, which was first implemented in 2017 through Epca, if the air quality continues to be in the “severe” category for 48 hours, measures such as traffic rationing and a ban on the entry of trucks are brought into force. Industries running on coal are also asked to cease operations. In previous years, schools in NCR have been forced to be close due to dramatic rise in air pollution, with people, especially the elderly and young children, being asked not to go out.The Epca chairperson conceded that there will be challenges this year. “This does not mean we sit back and let pollution levels rise. This only means that we will have to increase monitoring and action on the ground so that the pollution levels do not rise to the levels where we have the need to take these measures,” Lal said.A senior Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official said on condition of anonymity: “Last year, the CPCB in its list of suggestions had proposed that private firms should introduce measures such as allowing employees to work from home and introduce staggered timings; then it seemed like an unattainable task, but now we are all used to this set-up. Schools are also getting used to the online classes, so if need be, they can be asked to continue with it,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-gensets-banned-grap-rules-kick-in/story-dgIN3jMCPtPRGR6mbAwiGP.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||IMD’s new improved air quality models capture air pollution spike in Delhi||Air quality forecast models for Delhi -- and the rest of India -- have been enhanced, enabling more granular predictions this year with the identification of pollution hotspots in Delhi, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).October 15 forecasts for the country show PM 2.5 concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 micrograms per cubic metre, much above the level deemed to be safe, in many parts of northwest India and the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The 24-hour safe standard for PM 2.5, one of the main air pollutants, is 60 micrograms per cubic metres.When it comes to PM 2.5 in Delhi, the entire city seems to be enveloped by concentrations of over 250 micrograms per cubic metres, according to IMD’s ENFUSER air quality forecast model launched on Wednesday. But sulphur dioxide hotspots can be easily identified in the model as the concentrations are variable in different parts of the city.Also Read: Delhi’s AQI improves marginally but remains in ‘poor’ zone“Forecasting is a very important part of emergency action. It helps in doing proactive planning. If there is good science, it certainly helps you refine your strategy. The graded response action plan (GRAP) which is currently in force will greatly benefit from it. If there is hotspot-based data, even vulnerable populations whose health could be impacted by high air pollution can be identified,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.GRAP, is a set of curbs triggered in phases as the air quality deteriorates, which is typical of the October-November period. Farm fires in neighbouring states and cooling weather typically combine at this time of the year to blanket the region in smoke.The air quality forecast model, System for Integrated Modelling of Atmospheric Composition (SILAM), meant for the entire country, has been improved by implementing global emission inventories for coarse and fine particulate matter at 10 km resolution. “Earlier we had 50 km resolution. Plus, we have also added land cover and land use data to obtain a better forecast,” explained Vijay Soni, a scientist at the air pollution division of IMD.A very high-resolution city scale model has been operationalised for Delhi to identify the air pollution hotspots and pollution up to the street level. The model uses air quality observations, the road network, buildings, land use information, high resolution satellite maps and population data to generate forecasts. The results are being evaluated to capture pollution hotspots in Delhi, Soni said.Now the air quality warning system will also provide forecasts for Lucknow, Kanpur and Varanasi at 2 km resolution. “For the Delhi model, we are using real time air quality data from ground monitors, traffic congestion data, road network data etc to identify hotspots. We will be able to share this information in our bulletins also,” he added.Also Read: Choking NCR districts: Haryana gets into action after EPCA highlights violations leading to pollutionThe spike in Delhi’s current air pollution levels is being attributed to calm conditions in the morning and evening hours and variable winds during the day. Widespread stubble fires are seen on satellite images from both Punjab and Haryana. “Whenever the wind direction is changing to north-westerly, the impact of stubble fires can be felt in Delhi. Plus, there is no dispersion of pollutants due to calm conditions,” explained Soni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/imd-s-new-improved-air-quality-models-capture-air-pollution-spike-in-delhi/story-buh82rNNB0z9yJ3GvMy4kM.html

The victim’s son, Bhupinder Singh, has lodged an FIR against Bhartiya Kisan Union’s (BKU’s) Ambala unit chief Malkit Singh, and other BKU members - Fakeer Chand, Amarjeet, Jai Singh, Sukhvinder Singh, Jasvinder Singh and Janti - who were among the hundreds of activists who staged a protest against the farm laws during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘Janjagran Tractor Yatra’.A case has been registered against them under Sections 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 148 (rioting), 149, (unlawful assembly guilty of offence) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code. The victim, Bharat Singh of Badagarh village, was aboard a tractor that was part of the rally and was allegedly stopped by farmers and activists associated with the BKU. His son said, “When the rally reached Milan Palace, workers affiliated with the Congress and Gurnam Singh Chaduni group blocked the Ambala Road. The workers attacked our rally with sticks and stones after they were provoked by Malkit Singh .” “During the scuffle, my father fainted and fell. When we tried to take him to the hospital, the BKU activists obstructed our path. We were only able to reach a private hospital, which was five minutes away from the site, 30 minutes later. The doctors declared him brought dead and said we had been too late in bringing him to the hospital,” Bhupinder said. While BJP leaders have condemned the ‘murder’, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders have refuted the allegations. Malkit said, “The tractor, on which Bharat Singh was sitting, was far away from the area where the farmers had obstructed the rally. He died of a heart attack. There are several photos and videos that can prove that he died a natural death and there was no protester around him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-laws-70-year-old-dies-during-bjp-tractor-rally-bku-s-ambala-chief-among-7-booked/story-tPrFJKWn7AXsGngOz4htMM.html
15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Gang war: Chandigarh police get the rap from Guv, told to file status of all firings in past 3 years||Coming down heavily on the Chandigarh Police for the deteriorating law and order in the city in the wake of two back-to-back firing incidents over the weekend, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has sought an action-taken report in all shooting incidents over the past three years.Expressing concern over the looming threat of a gang war that had instilled fear among city residents, Badnore also ordered UT director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal to expeditiously investigate the two firing incidents – the murder of Gurlal Brar, a student leader and close associate of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, at Industrial Area; and the shot fired at TikTok star Saurav Gujjar at a Sector-9 bar, within 24 hours since Saturday midnight. Since January, the city has already witnessed five firing incidents, including the murder of bouncer-turned-financier Surjit Singh, who was shot dead by motorcycle-borne assailants in Sector 38 (West) on March 16.This is not the first time that the administrator had to intervene to check the rising crime in the city. Earlier this year, Badnore had pulled up senior UT police officials after gun shots were fired at the Sector-33 bungalow of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla to target his younger brother, liquor baron Arvind Singla on May 31, and the firing outside a liquor vend in Sector 9 on June 2.The police had back then claimed that the firings took place at the behest of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. CENSURE NUDGES TRICITY POLICE INTO ACTIONMeanwhile, a tricity co-ordination meeting was called by DGP Sanjay Baniwal at the UT Police Headquarters in Sector 9.After discussions on the need to improve coordination among the tricity police, the top police officials from the three cities decided to meet every month at one level or another.“The DGP has assured that the tricity co-ordination meeting will be held every month to share intelligence inputs on crime, movement of gangsters and ways to plug escape routes. Apart from this stress was laid on immediate sharing of information to help early detection of crime in the three cities,” said a senior police official. Besides Baniwal, Ropar Range inspector general of police (IGP) Amit Parsad, Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh, UT SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal, UT SP City Vineet Kumar and Panchkula deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa were among the senior officials who attended the meeting. FIRs AGAINST DISCOS VIOLATING MIDNIGHT DEADLINECracking the whip on discotheques, clubs and bars remaining open beyond midnight, the Chandigarh Police have decided to take strict action against the deadline violators.“The owners of such premises found violating the operation timing will face an FIR and we will also recommend cancellation of their liquor licences,” said Chahal.He said special nakas will be set up on days that witnessed heavy footfall at clubs, and every vehicle will be thoroughly checked.Instructions have been passed to all station house officers about zero tolerance towards crime, especially where gangsters or weapons are involved. “If even after checking, any crime is reported, especially using firearms, no police official will be spared,” the SSP added.“SHOs will be held accountable and action will be taken against those who are found lax in maintaining law and order,” warned Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gang-war-chandigarh-police-get-the-rap-from-guv-told-to-file-status-of-all-firings-in-past-3-years/story-rXOgxVROwumt5STMCAVDnM.html

Youth Akali Dal’s Mohali urban president Parvinder Singh Sohana and Derri village resident Baljit Singh said Amarjit and Mahajan had exchanged around 43 kanals (5 acres) of ‘valuable shamlat land’ adjoining Airport Road. “The land near Airport Road, which is worth crores, now has boards and flags of their firm, Land Chester Infrastructure Associates. However, the land given in exchange is adjacent to a choe (seasonal stream) in the village, which has low market value,” alleged Sohana.SAD leaders have urged Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and senior officials of the panchayat department and Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to handover the probe into the exchange of shamlat land to the CBI. Calling the allegations ‘baseless’, Amarjit said the matter was politically motivated. “Other builders have also exchanged land on the same road,” he said. Mahajan said, “The land was exchanged after receiving permission from the government and all procedures were followed. We are prepared to face any inquiry as everything is in black and white.” The high court had stayed the permission on October 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/order-cbi-probe-into-exchange-of-shamlat-land-in-mohali-village-sad/story-9QzNBqMDdkerVheLj77hLP.html
15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Cut outlay for smart city plan: UT asks Centre again||Unable to meet targets, the UT administration has approached the Union ministry of urban affairs yet again asking it to revise the smart city plan.Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has written to housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri asking him to revise the outlay from around ₹6,724 crore to ₹2,914 crore.With the UT featuring on the list of worst performing smart cities, Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) had approached the Smart City Mission (SCM) in February this year asking it to revise the smart city plan. The SCM works under the aegis of Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Neither the SCM nor the ministry have responded to the request.Earlier, Badnore had written a demi-official (DO) letter to the ministry of urban affairs secretary. However, with no change effected in the city’s smart city plan, the Union minister’s intervention has been sought.CSCL has failed to achieve the ₹6,724-crore investment target committed to the ministry in 2016.Why the revision? CSCL has requested that the revised smart city plan not exceed ₹2,900 crore since land required for developing the commercial hub is unavailable.Initially, the smart-city firm had planned to develop Sector 43 as a commercial hub with a ₹4,000-crore investment under its public-private partnership model. “The project was scrapped since the land identified for the project was a deemed forest and there is no provision to de-notify it,” said a UT official, requesting anonymity.Subsequently, CSCL made several attempts to procure land in other areas, including Sector 34, to initiate the project, but to no avail.With UT not inclined to give CSCL land for any smart city project, the administration decided to revise its smart-city plan so that the ministry’s assessment for Chandigarh was not based on projects it cannot achieve.“The city was put in the list of 20 worst smart cities in the ministry’s assessment mainly because it was not able to start a major commercial project,” said the official.‘Revision will not affect other projects’On being asked whether other projects will be affected, CSCL chief executive officer KK Yadav said, “The revision will not affect other projects. Our current project outlay of ₹2,900 crore crore will be sufficient for the carrying out all planned projects. The ₹4,000 crore project in Sector 43 was to developed on a public-private partnership model and the spending was an estimation. We have extended spending on other projects, which include expanding water storage capacity, and e-governance projects to ₹2,900 crore.”Under the smart city mission, the Centre and the UT will contribute ₹500 each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cut-outlay-for-smart-city-plan-ut-asks-centre-again/story-b1y9o4otKaJg19AyZcgoOL.html

Commending the initiative, professor Jagat Ram said, “The pandemic posed a big challenge to north India as during the initial phase very few labs were trained in molecular virology testing. It was a big challenge but, PGIMER accepted this as an opportunity to upgrade the labs of surrounding and far-flung areas.”“The department of virology established around 50 Covid-19 testing real-time PCR labs. The developed infrastructure will be instrumental in the near future for providing molecular diagnostic facilities for routine patient care,” he added.Professor Mini P Singh said that hands-on-training was given to around 170 faculty members and technical staff from various states and union territories.Earlier seeking to expeditiously expand Covid-19 testing facilities, the Indian Council of Medical Research, government of India, had identified PGIMER, Chandigarh as one of the 14 centres of excellence to mentor all government and private medical colleges in its catchment areas to create state-of-art molecular virology setups.

15-10-2020||City||On Behbal Kalan firing anniversary, Sikh hardliners, others raise concern over sacrilege incidents||On the fifth anniversary of the Behbal Kalan police firing episode, Sikh hardliners and other leaders on Wednesday expressed concern over “continued” incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab in the last five years. They also asked the state government to push for the arrest of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, who was recently named as an accused in the police firing cases and bring Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, an accused in the Bargari sacrilege case, on production warrants for interrogation. A ‘shaheedi samagam’ was held at Tibbi Sahib Gurdwara at Behbal Kalan village to mark the anniversary in response to a call made by families of the victims of the police firing on October 14, 2015 that left two Sikh protesters dead during a protest against the Bargari sacrilege incident. Sikh hardliners such as president of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) Baljit Singh Daduwal and Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh, besides Punjab Ekta Party president Sukhpal Singh Khaira, were among those who participated in the event. They asked that state government to expedite the probe into both the sacrilege and police firing incidents so that the accused could be punished. The differences among the Bargari Insaaf Morcha leaders surfaced again as parallel Akal Takht jathedar Dhian Singh Mand paid obeisance at gurdwara early morning and left before the event started. All the leaders at the event criticised Mand’s decision to lift the Bargari morcha in 2018, claiming it could have achieved a lot more had it continued. Daduwal said, “Due to the Bargari morcha, the unidentified policemen were identified. Saini should be arrested and the police should ask him who ordered him to open fire on the protesters.” “While the Dera Sacha Sauda committee members are absconding, the sect head is lodged at the Sunaria jail in Haryana. He should be brought on production warrant for interrogation to make him confess to his crime,” he added. Khaira said all the Sikh organizations should come together as the fight is not over yet. “It has been five years but as the Badals as well as Amarinder Singh failed to provide justice to the police firing victims,” he added. Kanwar Pal Singh said had the conspirators and culprits of 2015 sacrilege been punished there would have been a full stop on all such incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-behbal-kalan-5th-anniversary-sikh-hardliners-others-express-concern-over-continued-sacrilege-incidents/story-RyuE0pZzNv7uWDY6WOpOjL.html

15-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC ward committee elections: Mumbai mayor joins protest after rift with civic chief; Chahal apologises||City mayor and Shiv Sena corporator Kishori Pednekar along with other party corporators took part in a protest at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) headquarters on Wednesday, after a war of words broke out between Pednekar and the civic administration, including municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. The argument took place ahead of the commencement of the elections for ward committees owing to concerned officials not being present during the start of the elections. However, Chahal later apologised.According to Pednekar and Shiv Sena corporators, only one BMC staff was present at 10am, when elections were scheduled to begin. While the remaining officials, including the assistant municipal commissioner and deputy municipal commissioner, were not present at that time.Owing to this, Sena corporators tried calling the concerned officials but did not receive an answer. Later, when Sena corporator Vishakha Raut called Chahal, an argument took place between the two.Pednekar and other Sena corporators sat on dharna at the BMC headquarters in Fort, alleging rude behaviour by Chahal and the BMC administration. Sena is the ruling party in the BMC and is also the single largest party.“Every year ward officers are present during the ward committee elections, but this time it didn’t happen. Hence, we protested. Later, the BMC commissioner and our group leader Vishakha Raut argued. However, the matter is closed now after the commissioner apologised to our group leader,” said Pednekar.Chahal said he would not like to comment on the same. Further, along with 17 types of committees in the BMC, there are ward committees where micro-decisions regarding 24 administrative wards are undertaken. The chairman of the ward committee is elected from among the corporators of the 24 wards.After Wednesday’s incident, both, the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that the BMC ruling party holding a protest reflects badly and shows Sena in poor light.Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of opposition, said, “Someone like the mayor, who has to sit on dharna against the administration, shows that there is no control of the administration by the ruling party. It definitely does not give out a good message.”Prabhakar Shinde, BJP corporator and group leader of the BJP in BMC, said, “Any type of insult to the mayor is an insult of citizens, and we condemn it. But what picture we got to see today is that the Shiv Sena, which is ruling in the BMC, has become weak and does not have any control over the administration. We have got information that the municipal secretary department did not inform the concerned officials to be present for the elections, and this should be investigated.”Despite repeated attempts by HT, municipal secretary Sangeeta Sharma, whose department looks after the ward committee elections, was unavailable for comment.The Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) voted for the Sena’s candidates for electing ward committee chairman in A, B and E wards, which cover areas like Colaba, Churchgate, Byculla and Mazagaon. The two parties said they voted for the Sena candidate to keep the BJP at bay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-ward-committee-elections-mumbai-mayor-joins-protest-after-rift-with-civic-chief-chahal-apologises/story-zci2FQExmpaWv6FQmMs6rJ.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Central Electricity Authority starts probe into Mumbai power outage incident||A committee appointed by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to probe the Mumbai power outage incident on October 12 started its investigation on Tuesday afternoon. The committee is investigating if there were lapses in the response to technical faults. It will also investigate why the islanding system that separates Mumbai in case of a state grid failure did not work owing to the sudden load. While state energy minister Nitin Raut had said that the state would form a panel to probe the lapse, committee members were not named until Wednesday evening. Dinesh Waghmare, managing director of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), said, “The CEA committee is probing if the response to the technical fault was prompt or if there was any laxity observed.” Sources said that the committee is looking at suggesting measures to augment Mumbai’s transmission system. Raut on Wednesday reiterated that the state cannot rule out the possibility of sabotage that resulted in the massive outage in Mumbai and neighbouring areas.“Mumbai being in the dark is not a simple matter. We will have a high-level inquiry on this and all the officials who are responsible will be taken to task,” Raut said on Wednesday. The state government had appointed an expert committee headed by Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) professor SA Khaparde to study a similar outage in Mumbai in November 2010 and offer solutions. The committee submitted its report in June 2011.Raut said that he has also asked officials to submit a report on how many of the recommendations mentioned in the study were implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-electricity-authority-starts-probe-into-mumbai-power-outage-incident/story-782Xu9qEpLAtTTy7TX3LxO.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Will Governor Koshyari’s 12 Maharashtra legislative Council seat nominations trigger next tussle with CM Uddhav Thackeray?||Governor BS Koshyari’s nomination of 12 members of legislative council (MLC) could become the next topic of friction between him and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. To avoid any fresh confrontation, MVA has sought opinion from the state’s advocate general to avoid any legal hiccups after recommending the names. MVA is treading cautiously after an open letter-war erupted between CM Thackeray and Koshyari on Tuesday. While demanding that places of worship be reopened, Koshyari, in his letter, asked Thackeray if he had suddenly “turned secular”. In an equally strong reply, the CM questioned the governor if he does not believe in secularism – an important tenet of the Constitution. Thackeray, in his reply, also slammed him, stating that his Hindutva does not any certificate from the governor. The term of 12 legislators nominated to the Upper house from the governor’s quota has expired in June. As per Article 171 (5) of the Constitution, those nominated to the Upper house “shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely — literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service.” However, over the years, it has been used to accommodate political nominees, which can be challenged by Raj Bhavan, if the nominated person does not fit the Constitutional requirement. MVA leaders think Koshyari may raise objection to some names and put the process on hold. The list of 12 names has been finalised by the three parties and was expected to be put before the state Cabinet on Wednesday, a Sena minister said. However, it was decided not to do so in light of the exchange of letters between Thackeray and Koshyari. “The government is seeking legal opinion on it before the Cabinet approves it and sends the names to the governor. We do not want any legality to delay the filling of 12 vacant seats,” said a Sena minister, on condition of anonymity. State revenue minister and Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat told TV channels: “The proposal will come [before the Cabinet] at the right time. There is no dispute on seats between the three parties. We have got four seats each.”Among the likely names from the Nationalist Congress Party quota are Eknath Khadse, farmer leader Raju Shetti, singer Anand Shinde and Uttamrao Jankar. While from the Shiv Sena’s quota former MP Chandrakant Khaire could be nominated. The Congress, meanwhile, could nominate party spokesperson Sachin Sawant, former MLA Arif Nasim Khan and its Pune leader Mohan Joshi. An option being considered is not sending all 12 names together. According to insiders, the three parties have received around 500 names to be considered for the 12 seats. Besides the recent letter war, the tussle between Raj Bhavan and the Thackeray government has been going on for past seven months. The friction started after Koshyari did not accept the state Cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to the state legislative Council. Later, Koshyari took a contrarian stand on the state government’s decision to not hold final-year exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-governor-koshyari-s-12-maharashtra-legislative-council-seat-nominations-trigger-next-tussle-with-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-FJSXYVWdieZrGL7eUVz2wI.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Grandmother’s murder: Mumbai man in cop custody for three days||The metropolitan magistrate court, Bandra, on Wednesday remanded 24-year-old Christopher Pereira, who has been arrested for beheading his grandmother, Rosy Ganesh Rao, 80, at her home in Cosma Colony on Monday night, in police custody for three days. Bandra police arrested Pereira after his cousin sister found him sitting next to the body and alerted the police. According to the police, the accused killed his grandmother, then beheaded her using a kitchen knife, and mutilated the body. According to Abigail Dias, accused’s cousin, Pereira started consuming drugs and liquor when he was 14. Dias said, “He had recovered. The manager of the rehabilitation centre told us that his behaviour had changed. I brought him home with me and he seemed happy. He told us he wanted to have chicken and Chinese cuisine as he missed those while living in the rehab for more than one-and-a-half years.”“On Monday evening, he had a video call with his mother, who is in Israel, in the presence of all the family members. Her mother asked him to sell his old bike and buy a new one, but he said he wanted to save money to buy a car, which made us all laugh. Later his mother told him that his father would visit him the next day,” Dias added.“On that night, his grandmother arranged a bed for him so that he could sleep properly. I asked him not to lock the door from inside as water comes in the night at around 12. However, when I knocked the door they didn’t open. In the morning when his father arrived from Goa, I went there to wake them up. I found him sitting in the dark and when I turned on the lights I saw there was blood everywhere. He smiled at me and said he killed her. I immediately locked the door from outside and called the police,” she said.Celine D’sa, 68, a neighbour, said, “We still can’t believe that he did this. He crossed my house and smiled that day. Since the incident, we have been upset.”An officer said, “We are checking all his medical records before questioning him. We will also question his doctors who were treating him at the rehabilitation centre to figure out his mental status.” Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone-9, said, “The court has remanded him in police custody till October 17. We are investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/grandmother-s-murder-mumbai-man-in-cop-custody-for-three-days/story-HtOYaVTlnWW3TSLqcZvbIN.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro to start ops from Monday; Monorail on Sunday||While the Maharashtra government has allowed Metro rail operations in the state from Thursday in a graded manner, the Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the Metro between Ghatkopar and Versova, said it will begin operations from 8.30am on Monday. The Mumbai monorail services will start from Sunday, in a graded manner, officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) confirmed. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, MMOPL said, “Mumbai Metro is thankful to the Government of Maharashtra for allowing Metro operations. We have already initiated safety inspections and trial runs and are set to restart passenger operations from Monday, 19th October 2020, 8:30am.” Alternate seats in both Metro and monorail that have to be left unoccupied will be marked so as to maintain social distancing. Thermal scanners and sanitisers will also be placed at the entry to the stations. An official from MMRDA said, “We are working on the schedules, but we will start operations on the entire route from Sunday.” Mumbai Monorail tweeted on Wednesday: “No Mask No Travel policy by Monorail. Passengers will be permitted to travel only while wearing proper masks...Passengers are requested to co-operate with the Monorail staff by maintaining social distancing and following necessary safety instructions.“The services on Mumbai Metro and monorail have been shut since March when the nationwide lockdown was imposed owing to the pandemic. While Delhi Metro resumed services in September, the Maharashtra government was still sceptical about opening up services in the state. Sources from MMOPL had said the Reliance-infra led consortium was facing losses to the tune of ₹80 lakh to a crore a day owing to the complete shutdown. Metro-1 has done away with the plastic token system that can be used multiple times. Instead, commuters will be encouraged to use the mobile application to book tickets. The Mumbai monorail will be providing paper tickets to commuters and do away with its plastic token.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-to-start-ops-from-monday-monorail-on-sunday/story-raZ3yn1049B8JFUH6VsuYJ.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Congress begins deliberations over selecting new unit chief||With barely 15 months remaining for the crucial Mumbai civic polls, deliberations have begun within the Mumbai Congress to select a new leader for party’s city unit. HK Patil, the party’s newly-appointed Maharashtra in-charge in the All India Congress Committee met senior leaders from the city to take stock of the current situation and get a sense of the names in the ring. Mumbai leaders have pressed for an immediate change in leadership and the need to go solo in the civic polls. The party’s current Mumbai president is Eknath Gaikwad, a veteran leader and former Member of Parliament (MP). Patil, who was recently appointed as the state in-charge, replacing Mallikarjun Kharge, met sitting and former legislators, former ministers, incumbent and former city unit chiefs personally at the party’s Dadar office on Wednesday. Party leaders who met Patil included former MPs Priya Dutt, Hussain Dalwai, Bhalchandra Mungekar, city unit chief Eknath Gaikwad, former state ministers Suresh Shetty and Arif Naseem Khan, among others. Former MPs and Mumbai unit chief Milind Deora and Sanjay Nirupam could not attend the session as they were in Delhi. “He tried to understand the party’s political standing in the city, where it was formed 135 years ago, and the measures to be taken for better performance in the 2022 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections. Most of the leaders he met have expressed the immediate need to change the leadership. The Mumbai unit has always been affected by factionalism or weak leadership. It now needs dynamic leadership and should be given at the earliest,” said a leader, on condition of anonymity.Aspirants for the Mumbai Congress chief post are Bhai Jagtap, Arif Naseem Khan, Amarjeet Singh Manhas and Suresh Shetty. According to a former office-bearer of the Mumbai Congress, the aspirants and their supporters met Patil, who is now expected to submit his report to the party leadership in Delhi.Another leader said that almost all the leaders pressed for the need to go solo in the BMC election, despite the Congress being part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance along with the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). “We demanded to go solo for two reasons – firstly, we would not get the expected number of seats to contest if we fought the elections with two other parties. Joining hands with Sena in the local polls will also result in hurting our vote bank of minorities and Dalits and to some extent north Indians. It will also help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if the three parties fought together,” he said. Congress was reduced to 32 seats in the 2017 elections from the 52 seats it won in 2012. The civic polls in Mumbai are expected to be held in February 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-congress-begins-deliberations-over-selecting-new-unit-chief/story-729i5TNe3rwsTOVxOUmqGJ.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants protection from arrest to veteran actor Vikram Gokhale||In an interim relief to veteran actor Vikram Gokhale who was booked for allegedly duping investors who had invested in a 25-year-old land development project at Mulshi in Pune, the Bombay high court restrained the Pune Police from taking any coercive action for two weeks until it hears Gokhale’s anticipatory bail plea on October 28. Gokhale approached the HC after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a sessions court in Pune on September 25.A single bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the plea of the actor was informed by senior counsel Sirish Gupte and Karansingh Rajput that a criminal offence was registered against the 79-year-old actor and two others in March. The two others were Jayant Mhalgi, the son of former Member of Parliament Rambhau Mhalgi and Jayant’s wife Sujata. The case was related to a project by a company floated by Jayant and Sujata. The complaint had alleged that the company had duped and cheated them by giving them possession of land parcels that were much smaller and different from what they had purchased previously through sale deeds. The complaint had also claimed that they had invested around ₹96 lakhs 25 years ago and the estimated cost of the land would now run into crores. Gupte who represented Gokhale submitted that the actor had no concern with the company which had allegedly cheated the investors, and his client was only a brand ambassador of the project. Hence, the charges against him were unfounded and arbitrary. Gupte further submitted that while Gokhale was shown as chairman of the accused company there was nothing on record to prove the same. In light of these submissions, Gupte sought protection from arrest till the hearing of his plea was completed. However, additional public prosecutor SV Gavand opposed the plea and referred to a resignation letter of Gokhale from the group of industries of which the accused company was a part and another charitable trust. Gavand submitted that Gokhale was the chairman of the company, but had resigned in January 2020.As there was a dispute on the nature and role of the actor in the company both the counsels sought time to ascertain the same, which the bench allowed. The court noted that ‘no coercive action be taken against applicant till next hearing’ and posted the matter for hearing on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-protection-from-arrest-to-veteran-actor-vikram-gokhale/story-ts7Unwnpehy6zdvEnbvBZI.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park opens for morning walkers amid strict guidelines||The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) will reopen for morning walkers on Thursday after it was closed since March 18 in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.Morning walkers will be able to visit the park between 5.30am and 7.30am, daily. The park will remain closed on Mondays.SGNP officials have put in place a mechanism wherein morning walkers have been divided into three groups – A, B and C – based on the first letter of their names mentioned on the morning pass. “This means, names starting from A to L will be part of group A and will be allowed to enter the park on Thursday. On Friday, names starting from J to Q under group B will be allowed to walk, and finally, names starting from R to Z under group C will be allowed entry on Saturday. This pattern will be repeated over three days for the first one week,” said G Mallikarjuna, director and conservator of forest, SGNP, adding that the schedule for each group would be displayed on the park notice board and SGNP website.Mallikarjuna said there were around 9,000 registered morning walkers across four locations in SGNP – Borivli, Yeoor, Manpada and Mulund (Tara Singh Park). At Borivli, there are two main walking paths. The first is from the main gate to Trimurti Road Tumnipada gate and back, covering 5km. The second is from the main gate to the police chowki, forest division office, rest house 3, to the animal hospital, then the boating ticket counter, next to the path along Dahisar river (over the bridge), and finally exiting from the main gate (covering 4km).“We will be monitoring the number of people entering the park across all these areas, with dedicated staff at all four locations. We will be using the alphabetical technique at Borivli to experiment with its efficiency and then replicate it at other sites. However, if it is becoming too crowded, we will take the necessary steps within a week,” said Mallikarjuna.Meanwhile, among other 17 listed guidelines, entry to pregnant women, children below 10 years of age and senior citizens over 65 have been prohibited from entering the park. Walkers have to bring their face masks and sanitisers. Social distancing needs to be maintained. Spitting is prohibited. Gathering of groups for yoga, laughing exercise, meditation etc, is prohibited, the guidelines said.“Those without masks will not be allowed to enter. Any person having symptoms associated with Covid-19 is requested to avoid entering the park and if they do, their details will be shared with the nearest Covid-19 centre,” said Mallikarjuna, adding, “At the end of the day, it is up to citizens to take care of their health. We are only facilitating a safe environment during this pandemic.” Those with old walkers’ passes will be allowed till November 15 but would need to renew their passes.A newly-developed parking area (with free parking at the moment) will house visitor’s vehicles. “We aim to see how feasible this plan is. If it is positive, we will steadily open the park for tourists but at the same time, stop the entry of any private vehicles within SGNP when the final decision is taken,” said Mallikarjuna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sanjay-gandhi-national-park-opens-for-morning-walkers-amid-strict-guidelines/story-ZJNhBNrORfwzuJoRRoqDHM.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Six arrested for murder in Mumbai||Mulund police arrested six accused, including two brothers, in a murder case on Tuesday. The brothers, Deepak More, 38 and Vinod More, 30, had allegedly given contract to four accused to kill three people from their community to ensure their father’s ‘peaceful journey to afterlife’. The four other arrester accused killed a senior citizen following the contract.The incident took place after there was a low turnout at the funeral prayer of More’s father last month. “Both the brothers were superstitious and believed that only after killing three persons from their community, their father’s soul will get peace. They had planned to kill two more people but quick detection saved their lives,” said deputy commissioner of police Prashant Kadam of zone 7. The other accused have been identified as Asif Nasir Shaikh, 28; Moinuddin Allauddin Ansari alias Sahil, 27; Arif Abdul Sattar Khan, 30; and Shahanawaj alias Sonu Akhtar Shaikh, 30 — all residents of Deonar in Govandi. Deepak, who has four assault cases registered against him in Mulund police station, met Asif while lodged in Arthur road jail. After his father’s death, he gave Asif a contract of ₹70,000 to kill three people from their vicinity.The case came to light when Maruti Gawali, 70, who lived in a chawl near Mulund railway station, was found dead. Gawali was sleeping outside a shop when the four accused stabbed him in the abdomen and crushed his face with a stone in the intervening night of October 1 and 2. Following this, a murder case was registered against unidentified people and police formed teams to probe the case. During investigation, they checked CCTV footage from nearby areas and found a lead. The accused were traced to Ajmer Dargah in Rajasthan. However, the accused returned to the city soon after and were nabbed by the police. During inquiry, they confessed to the crime and named the More brothers. Police are investigating further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/six-arrested-for-murder-in-mumbai/story-RaOM95z2oH31WtMIzceZyN.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Teacher gets 5 years in jail for molesting minor students in Mumbai||A special court under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on Tuesday sentenced a Madrasa teacher to rigorous imprisonment for five years for sexually abusing minor students. The court has also imposed a fine of ₹8,000 on the accused. The 30-year-old teacher, a resident of Kurla, was accused of molesting the minor and two other girls who attended his classes at the Madrasa to learn Arabic and spiritual training. The incident came to light after the mother of one of the students lodged a complaint with Chunabhatti police. As the girl made excuses to not attend classes, the mother confronted her and learnt that the teacher allegedly touched her inappropriately. The mother then enquired with her neighbour about this and found out that the minor of that family, too, faced the same things. Following this, she approached the police and the accused was subsequently arrested on April 2. The minor, in her deposition, had claimed that the accused molested her on several occasions. The court noted, “It has further come in the evidence that, the accused used to commit same thing with prosecutrix no. 2 (the neighbour’s daughter) and one another girl who used to visit Madrasa with her. She further deposed that, she personally noticed the accused making inappropriate touch to them.” After recording the deposition of the two girls, the court found the teacher guilty for sexually abusing minor girls and observed, “The accused was entrusted with the noble work of teaching Quran. Therefore, the people had faith in the accused. The accused took the disadvantage of the same and committed heinous offence against the victim girls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teacher-gets-5-years-in-jail-for-molesting-minor-students-in-mumbai/story-bFPtmFfC29DVqsQkadv8AL.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government constitutes sub-committee for OBC community||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday announced the constitution of a cabinet sub-committee to look into the demands of the OBC community. This comes as prominent leaders of Other Backward Classes (OBC) held a meeting with state ministers to safeguard the interests of their community, in the backdrop of protests by the Maratha community following the Supreme Court’s stay on Maratha reservation. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is part of the committee, said it was created to fast-track the benefits to be given to OBC community. “There are a lot of pending issues concerning the community. The sub-committee will decide on various issues to give justice to the community,” Bhujbal said.Other members of the sub-committee include Vijay Wadettiwar, Jitendra Awhad, Dhananjay Munde, Sanjay Rathod and Gulabrao Patil.The issue of the community came to the fore after the state government was unable to implement the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act that provides reservation to Maratha community, following a stay by the Supreme Court. The OBC community is worried that if Marathas are made part of their community, it will reduce their quota. Though the state government has been assuring the community that their quota will not be disturbed, this has done little to reduce their fears.OBC leaders have been critical, saying Marathas were being favoured while the OBCs were given step-motherly treatment. The OBC community currently gets 27% reservation in government jobs and education.OBC leader Prakash Shendge said the Maharshtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government should clarify whether they are serious about giving benefits to the OBC community. “The Maratha community is being favoured while we are saddled with sub-committees. If the government does not want to give us benefits, then they should clarify,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-constitutes-sub-committee-for-obc-community/story-fv9e47K1GxMh82ITKx1hqI.html

Environmentalist and photographer Aishwarya Sridhar and wildlife photographer Nayan Khanolkar won awards at the Wildlife Photographer Year Awards. Sridhar is the first woman from India and the youngest adult to have won this prestigious award in her category.Held since 1964, UK’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year is the British Natural History Museum’s annual competition and exhibition organised with the British Broadcasting Company (BBC). It highlights the unique and beautiful relationship between photography, science and art. The awards are considered the most prestigious wildlife photography awards. This year, there were over 50,000 entries came from more than 80 countries. Of these, 100 images won.Sridhar, who has been fighting to save Panje from environmental destruction, won the ‘Highly Commended Award’ in the behaviour-invertebrate category. Sridhar’s photograph of fireflies against star trails, taken at Bhandara in Maharashtra, will also be part of an exhibition at the Natural History Museum and be part of a touring exhibition. “Fireflies get active during a short pre-monsoon period and that was the time I clicked this image. After trekking for an hour, I came across this tree which was lit with fireflies under the starlit sky; it felt like a magical world,” she said.Khanolkar also won the ‘Highly Commended Award’ in the urban category for his photo of a leopard walking through a Warli tribal settlement inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). This is the second time he’s won an award at the Wildlife Photographer of the Year in the past four years. “I am thankful to the jury for this prestigious award,” Khanolkar said adding that he had been documenting leopards in and around SGNP over the past eight years. “I have attempted to capture the uniqueness of this landscape where the density of big cats in an urban environment is the highest in the world. What is peculiar about SGNP is that while leopards were always there, gazette records from the British era also documented the presence of tigers in Mumbai. But, while leopards adapted well, the tiger population could not.”City-based naturalist and conservationist Sunjoy Monga, who received the main award in 1991 and special category awards in other years, said, “This is a well-deserved award, encouraging and inspiring for budding photographers and environmentalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/photographers-from-mumbai-navi-mumbai-win-prestigious-uk-awards/story-RasDRxHAqH5f7RWbbFcYeK.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Sufficient regulations exist for media, no need for more, Centre tells Bombay HC||The Union government on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that while it did not justify media trials, there were sufficient statutory and regulatory framework in place to ensure that electronic media does not overstep, and hence it did not see any reason to put in place any additional guidelines as prayed for by petitioners in various public interest litigations (PIL). A number of PILs were filed against the media trial conducted by various news channels in the ongoing investigations on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The petitioners stated that as the electronic media was resorting to bashing the police, disclosure of confidential data pertaining to investigations, exposing important witnesses and parties who are part of the investigations, and taking judgemental stands aimed at influencing the opinion of the public, the HC should direct the media to refrain from such reporting. The PILs also sought directions to the Central government to frame guidelines for controlling the way in which in media, especially the electronic media, functioned. The petitioners submitted that while the Press Council of India regulated the operations of print media, there was no such authority for the electronic media. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni continued hearing the petitioners on Wednesday wherein it was informed by advocates Neela Gokhale, Asim Sarode and Sunny Punamiya, for various petitioners, that various channels had overstepped their limits and compromised the investigation and also asked family members of parties involved to express their opinions on the investigation and name suspects. The advocates submitted that this was against various Supreme Court judgements that had restrained people from divulging details of ongoing investigations and directed the media to show restraint while reporting sensitive criminal cases. One of the advocates also submitted that the reporting by some news channels, while reporting on the investigations, had violated consumer rights and infringed the provisions of the Mental Health Act. In light of these submissions, the petitioners sought directions to frame additional guidelines for news channels. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing the Union of India, while responding to a query made by the bench on Monday on whether there was any mechanism to regulate news channels on the lines of Press Council of India, submitted that the Cable TV Regulation Act has guidelines under the Programme Code which sufficed to regulate the electronic media. He further submitted that time and again the Apex court had observed that there was already reasonable restraint on the media, and hence there was no need for any additional mechanism to control the media. “We do not justify media trials, however there exists statutory and regulatory framework which covers the electronic media,” said Singh. Due to paucity of time, the bench asked Singh and the respondent associations and channels to make their submissions on Friday and adjourned the hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-sufficient-regulations-exist-for-media-no-need-for-more-centre-tells-bombay-hc/story-5C0II14b3FTnAMMISjXfIK.html

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials maintained that none of the medical equipment, which ran on electricity, were interrupted and added only the air-conditioning system of the centre had to be compromised as part of safety measures.The oxygen leak was reported around 3.30am on Wednesday at the 1,600-bed dedicated Covid hospital at Richardson and Cruddas campus on LBS Marg which was inaugurated in July. Fire brigade was called in. The centre was treating around 700 patients at the time. Dr Abhay Naik, dean of the jumbo Covid facility, said, “The oxygen leakage took place near electric cables and could have led to fire or short-circuit. As a precautionary measure, we had to disrupt the power supply. However, we made sure all medical equipment such as ventilators and oxygen beds continued to work. Only the air-conditioning was affected for some time, but we made sure that portable oxygen cylinders are arranged immediately.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have slammed BMC and criticised it for mismanagement in jumbo Covid centres where hundreds of Covid patients are being treated. Mulund MLA and BJP leader Mihir Kotecha said, “This Covid centre is just about 90 days old. It is ridiculous that such defects are being reported within such a short time. Electricity was shut for nearly 12 hours. Also, only 10% of the required staff was available throughout the day. Such mismanagement led to inconvenience to hundreds of patients. I will demand an inquiry into the construction of the plant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/glitch-leaves-mulund-jumbo-covid-facility-in-mumbai-without-power-for-12-hours/story-Hx0MzTcZlYdACUshXN8wiL.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government panel rejected moving Metro car depot from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg, says BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis||Leader of Bharatiya Janata Party and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday that a report submitted by a committee appointed by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had rejected proposals to shift the Metro-3 (Colaba-Seepz) car depot from Aarey Milk Colony to Kanjurmarg because it would result in delays and a huge escalation in cost. On October 11, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that the Metro-3 car shed would be shifted from Aarey Milk Colony to Kanjurmarg. He said the land for the car shed would be made available at zero rate. The plan is to integrate the line for Metro-3 with line for Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) before the proposed Saki Vihar station, after which it will be a common elevated corridor till the Kanjurmarg depot. On Wednesday, Fadnavis criticised this decision on social media. “Our earlier Government in 2015 considered the Kanjurmarg option but due to delays & multiple litigations, it was finally decided to give up,” he tweeted, adding, “CM Hon Uddhav Thackeray ji says this is a ‘NO-COST’ proposition, but I would say this is a NO-METRO proposition.” He also shared a series of snapshots from a report submitted by a committee appointed in December 2019, which was tasked with suggesting alternate sites for the Metro-3 car shed. In the report submitted in January, the committee concluded that integrating the lines for Metro-3 and Metro-6 would result in a huge escalation in cost; delay Metro works, and require substantial changes in design and system of both lines. The committee had also pointed out that shifting the depot to Kanjurmarg could lead to “operational complexities” on Metro-6 and “hamper the frequency of operations of both line 3 and line 6”. The report also stated that work on line 6 will have to be suspended immediately to revise the design. State minister for tourism and environment Aaditya Thackeray had said at the time that the committee’s recommendations are not binding on the state. Senior officials from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), said only the platform size of six stations would need to be tweaked as the common line will also have to cater to Metro-3’s eight-coach trains as opposed to six-coach trains designed for line 6. Metro authorities estimate the construction of the proposed car depot would require a minimum of two years.RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “We have studied the plans and system integration is possible.” The per day cost of delay in executing Metro-3 is calculated at around Rs 5.87 crore. Delay in operation by 2.5 years would work out to Rs 5,356 crore, while a delay of four years would mean another Rs 8,570 crore. As per the agreement between the government of India, state government and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), cost escalation in Metro-3 works must be borne by the Maharashtra government.State officials said the land allotted in Kanjurmarg to MMRDA is litigation-free and has been inspected by the environment minister and officials from MMRDA and the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-government-panel-rejected-moving-metro-car-depot-from-aarey-colony-to-kanjurmarg-says-bjp-leader-devendra-fadnavis/story-FoPiX2hIxLyvhb6swfh1dK.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||FIR registered against man for not wearing mask in Mumbai||Govandi police on Wednesday booked a 28-year-old man for not wearing a mask. This is the first time that officials of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) lodged a first information report (FIR) against a citizen for not wearing a mask. According to the police, at around 1.30pm the team of civic officials from M West ward caught a man at Savli Naka in Khardev Nagar, Chembur without a mask. “We spotted Rahul Madhukar Wankhede roaming without wearing a mask. On asking he did not give satisfactory answers and argued with the officials. He was then taken to the Govandi police station,” said a police officer.On the complaint of BMC employee Prathmesh Jadhav, the police have booked Wankhede under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 186 (voluntarily obstructing public servant in the discharge of his public functions) of Indian Penal Code. Both the sections are bailable.Balasaheb Kedare, senior inspector of Govandi police station confirmed the development and said that the police would soon file a charge sheet against the offender. “We have been booking those citizens who are not obeying government orders related to the lockdown,” Kedare said. Fine of ₹200 is being imposed on those who are caught without a mask. Recently the civic body, to intensify the drive and to make it more effective, roped in police personnel and have now started registering FIRs against the offenders. The BMC’s latest drive aims to penalise at least 20,000 such citizens daily. As part of this drive, on Tuesday, over 4,369 citizens were penalised and a fine of ₹8.73 lakh was collected, according to BMC data. BMC has so far collected over ₹1.05 crore from 38,866 violators since April.(With inputs from Mehul Thakkar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fir-registered-against-man-for-not-wearing-mask-in-mumbai/story-9U1fI9uF1dTSv9mXBv9GOK.html

15-10-2020||Chandigarh||Juveniles chalked out an ingenious plan to escape Hisar observation home||It was around 6.30pm on Monday inside the dimly lit dining area of Hisar observation home and the 97 juvenile inmates were unusually quiet during the evening meal. The dinner deadline was over and the sentry was about to unlock the mini iron gate for inmates to go back to the barracks in a single file. Everything was business as usual, except the missing giggles and clamour of the inmates, who are in their teens. Much before the gate was to be opened, over two dozen inmates armed with blunt weapons such as sticks and sharp edged utensils had taken positions near the gate, according to officials, who spoke to the injured guards and inmates after the daring Monday night escape. In an audacious act, 17 juvenile undertrials had escaped from the Hisar observation home after overpowering three guards on duty. While nine of the 17 inmates who ran away face murder charges, three are facing attempt to murder cases, two were booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and two others face theft and a rioting case. Eight of them belong to Jhajjar district, two each are from Rohtak, Hisar and Delhi and one each from Bhiwani, Dadri and Karnal. Sources say when the unsuspecting sentry opened the mini gate and stepped inside the dining area, the inmates were already hiding themselves along the imposing walls and hit the guard in the head with a blunt weapon. The sentry fell unconscious and suffered head injuries.“The first guard has got nine stitches in the head,” the sources say. The inmates knew the first guard on duty carried the key to the main gate. The juveniles took out the key from the pocket of this guard, who was lying on the ground and bleeding.Noticing the melee, the second sentry rushed towards the spot. However, the emboldened inmates silenced him with sticks and some other blunt weapons. The second guard too suffered head injuries and is recovering in a hospital with eight stitches in the head.By the time last and the third guard realised what was happening, the inmates on the run had already opened the lock on the front gate of the observation home, officials say.The superintendent of the observation home, who stays in the adjoining area, was entering his house when the inmates were fleeing. “The superintendent has said that he drove his car back in high speed and chased the inmates. Some of the juveniles went back fearing being run over by the speeding car. To stop the others, he blocked the main gate by parking his car in front of it,” the sources say. They say that the number of escapees could have been more if the head of observation home failed to come back. Sources say as per the initial investigation, it was a well planned escape by the inmates, who had collected blunt objects like wipers, wooden planks from windows and utensils. The plot was hatched by inmates facing murder charges and who are in the age bracket of 17-18 years. “During inspection on Tuesday, some juveniles above 18 years were shifted to other places. How can three guards deal with 97 inmates?,” the official said, adding “We need good psychologists to counsel and reform these juveniles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/juveniles-chalked-out-an-ingenious-plan-to-escape-hisar-observation-home/story-NMvkKp1tubNHq3Cci2FKzK.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government announces probe into Fadnavis pet project Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Wednesday announced an open inquiry into the Devendra Fadnavis-led government’s flagship water conservation programme Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan (JSA), a project on which ₹9,634 crore was spent in the past five years. The move came days after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) issued strictures on JSA in its report and the state has received complaints of corruption and faulty work in the scheme. While the decision to initiate an open inquiry was taken in the state cabinet, the modalities and terms of reference are yet to be finalised. Water conservation minister Shankarrao Gadakh said the probe will also look into irregularities in other irrigation projects and cost escalations in their budget. “We have received more than 700 complaints related to corruption, irregularities in JSA and other irrigation projects. Besides the stricture in the CAG report, the probe will be into 6.37 lakh works allotted under JSA, their implementation and the budget allotted to it. It was a contractor-driven scheme and irregularities by the contractors have cropped in many districts. We will also inquire into the revised administrative approvals given to the irrigation projects in the past five years, as these approvals, too, are suspicious,” said Gadakh. “It is yet to be decided whether it would be probe by a special investigation team (SIT) or anti-corruption bureau (ACB) or by a separate committee,” said Gadakh.However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said they were ready to face the probe, but it should not be politically motivated.Water supply and sanitation minister Gulabrao Patil said irregularities in the scheme began right from the tendering process. He said the inquriy will be conducted into the water tankers deployed after the implementation of the scheme, ground-water level and other flaws involved. The decision to probe JSA was taken after a few cabinet ministers raised the issue during the discussion on centrally sponsored Atal Bhujal Yojana in the drought-prone 14 districts. “It was not on cabinet agenda, but came up for discussion abruptly when rural development minister pointed at the CAG strictures. We then unanimously decided to probe the irregularities,” said a minister, who did not wish to be named. The CAG report tabled in the state legislature on September 8 slammed the Fadnavis government for its failure in implementation of JSA envisaged to make villages in Maharashtra drought-free. Besides the deficiencies in planning and lack of provision of adequate funds for maintenance of works, JSA failed to achieve water neutrality in drought-prone villages and increase the ground-water level as intended, the report stated. The report stated that even after spending ₹9,634 crore, the Abhiyan had little impact in drought-prone districts, which ended deploying more tankers than in the past. While in opposition, Congress, which is now one of the three allies in MVA along with Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had alleged irregularities in the scheme. Welcoming the probe, Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The Fadnavis government had boasted to make 25,000 villages drought-free under JSA. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in one of his speeches, had said the scheme helped making 16,000 villages drought-free, but in the very next summer more number of tankers was deployed in the same villages. The ground-water level in these villages dipped after the implementation of the scheme. The scheme benefited the contractors and we had been bringing out the flaws in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-announces-probe-into-fadnavis-pet-project-jalyukt-shivar-abhiyan/story-Lt7F3aTC7Xzrm7lwWWS5dL.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro back on track, shop curbs lifted, libraries open||Maharashtra on Wednesday allowed Metro rail services to resume, among other relaxations from Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, as it kept to its declining trend of cases at 10,552 new infections, which pushed the tally to 1,554,389. The Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the city’s lone Metro line, between Ghatkopar and Versova, said it would begin operations in a graded manner from Monday, October 19, at 8.30am. The state as part of Mission Begin Again — a staggered plan to lift curbs — has allowed restarting of Metro, reopening of all libraries, extending operational hours of shops from October 15. The government, however, has left out the reopening of places of worship in the new order, despite pressure from various quarters and an acrimonious exchange of letters between the chief minister and Maharashtra governor on Tuesday over the issue. Meanwhile, Mumbai monorail services will start from Sunday, in a graded manner, officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) said. The services on Mumbai Metro and monorail have been shut since March when the nationwide lockdown was imposed owing to the pandemic. According to the order issued by state chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, Metro operations can resume in the state from October 15 in a graded manner. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for the operations to start will be issued by the urban development department, the order added. With the resumption of Metro services in Mumbai, traffic jams could reduce on the arterial roads. The MMOPL said it has already initiated safety inspections and trial runs. Its spokesperson said, “We are restarting Metro operation from 19th October in a graded manner with all Covid related precautions to ensure safe travel for our commuters. We urge Mumbaikars to support us by fulfilling all guidelines and precautions.” School, colleges, educational and coaching institutions, meanwhile, will continue to remain shut till October 31, the order stated. In an attempt to push economic activities the state has allowed Business to Business (B2B) exhibitions, locals markets are allowed to operate, and allowed shops and markets to remain open for two additional hours, all outside the containment zone. Opening up of cinema halls, gymnasiums, and swimming pools did not feature in the fresh list of relaxations as the state government fears that these places could become hotspots of transmission and give a push to Covid-19 figures. A senior bureaucrat said, “Cinema halls are crowd pullers in urban centres and could lead to an increase in Covid-19 cases. Therefore the government is of the view to not open them as yet. In the matter of places of worship, it is being considered and some SOPs or guidelines can be formulated to allow its reopening by early next month. Similarly, SOPs are being worked out for gymnasiums.” The order added that shops and markets are allowed to given two additional hours of operation with an aim to reduce crowding. In Mumbai, for instance, shops are now open between 9am to 7 pm. Local weekly bazaars, including that of animals, will be allowed to operate outside the containment zones from October 15. The state has also allowed reopening all government and private libraries from October 15 with all necessary Covid-19 precautions. Several delegations met political parties, including Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, to get the state to reopen libraries. The state government has done away with stamping of passengers arriving at domestic airports and at railway stations of Maharashtra. However, they will be checked for Covid-19 symptoms and will have to adhere to all Covid-19 norms. Health check-ups of the passengers travelling to Maharashtra by outstation trains will not be done, the order stated. Meanwhile, after two straight days of clocking below 10,000 fresh cases, the state crossed the mark. However, it continued to record fatalities under 200 for the third straight day with 158 deaths on Wednesday. The death toll in the state rose to 40,859. The case fatality rate (CFR) improved to 2.63% after being constant at 2.64% for seven days. Maharashtra’s active caseload went below 200,000 on Wednesday and stood at 196,288. The state also saw 19,517 patients discharged, taking the tally of the recovered patients to 1,316,769. The recovery rate in the state improved to 84.71%. Mumbai on Wednesday saw 2,211 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the city’s tally of confirmed cases to 234,602. Mumbai reported 48 fatalities pushing its death toll to 9,555. Mumbai’s active caseload stood at 23,828. Pune city reported 540 new cases and nine deaths, while its rural areas reported 523 fresh infections and three deaths. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 282 fresh cases. Nagpur city reported 404 new cases and five deaths, while the rural areas saw 261 new cases and seven deaths. So far, the state has tested 7,838,318 samples, and in the last 24 hours, 76,313 samples were tested. The state’s overall positivity rate (percentage of tests converting to positive) stood at 19.83%. Currently, 2,380,957 people are in home quarantine and 23,176 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-back-on-track-shop-curbs-lifted-libraries-open/story-zZAo5uskURD5OJBZU3rPkL.html
15-10-2020||Mumbai||Aarey saved! We owe a debt to the planet we live on, writes Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray||Mumbaikars received their news of joy amid the pandemic on Sunday afternoon, as they heard chief minister Uddhav Thackeray speak to them, through his video address to Maharashtra. As everyone expected him to brief them about the state’s fight against Covid-19, the background seemed different. The usual sober tones were replaced by an illustration of wildlife and Mumbai, coexisting, as one.That was the three-point message he gave the people, and it was about Aarey:1) All cases filed against satyagrahis of Aarey to be withdrawn with immediate effect.2) Almost 808 acres of Aarey land to be declared a reserve forest.3) The car depot of Mumbai Metro-3 to be moved out of Aarey to Kanjurmarg.All three decisions are historic in their own way and hopefully will set a golden precedent in environment decisions of our country, especially while going through a pandemic, supposedly caused by a zoonotic disease that has threatened humanity like never before.The first decision, to withdraw the cases, must be held as a highest example of environmental justice. Not justice for us, Homo sapiens, but for nature at large.A criminal charge on peaceful protestors, mostly students, can’t be justified when they stand up for a cause like protecting a forest from mindless destruction in the middle of the night.The second decision, to declare almost 808 acres of Aarey as a reserve forest, was long overdue. The reason for the protests in Aarey against the car depot of Metro-3 is simply not just about trees. Everyone realises that on a daily basis, multiple trees are trimmed/transplanted/cut to make way for infrastructure projects in urban sprawls. Aarey is much more than just trees. It is an ecosystem in itself. From leopards to spiders, birds to scorpions, and the rusty spotted cat and geckos, it is home to a lot more flora and fauna than what meets the human eye. We also tend to forget the adivasis, who have made Aarey their home for more than a century and live in co-existence with nature.According the reserve forest status to prime piece of land in a city like Mumbai is not easy, and calling the decision a bold one is not exaggeration.However, the decision by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has redefined “development”, making it a word that is truly prefixed by “sustainable”, making it a global example for decision-makers.The third and most crucial decision was to move the Metro-3 car depot from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. While declaring the rest of Aarey as forest, it is crucial to note that sensitivities were tinkered with, primarily, owing to the allocation of the car depot in the Aarey forest.All along, every voice that shouted against the car depot, including mine, was only because of the fact that Aarey car depot plot was much more than just 2,700 trees. This is also the flood plains of the Mithi River, which would flood certain areas when it overflows during the monsoon.All along, the Metro-6 was coming up without land being given by the government for a car depot in either Kanjurmarg or Pahadi, Goregaon. Typically, had things carried on as they did earlier, it may have been a finished line, but delayed for the lack of a car depot, which was possibly denied, to avoid the shift and merge request for Metro-3 and Metro-6.The Urban Development Department and the MMRDA made their case to the CM. A couple of points made the merger feasible – same technical (electrical and civil work) specifications.Once this was seen as possible, a 102-acre plot in Kanjurmarg was handed over to the MMRDA by the district collectorate.The work on the new depot has begun and it does not add to the financial burden, as it is free of cost and free of encroachments. It was anyway needed for Metro-6 and is now given without any charge. It further adds to the footfall of Metro-3 as it connects the eastern suburbs of Mumbai to central and south Mumbai. More so, the proposed Metro-14, connecting the rest of MMR, ends at Kanjurmarg. This would make Kanjurmarg a nodal hub for three Metro lines and connect a population of around 22 lakhs.The headway of the metro trains, at peak volume projected much later, remains the same. Neither does it waste the tunnel ramp already made nor does it waste a single penny spent on Metro-3. It only adds further value to its planning and to the city.Over the past five years, I have met multiple activists fighting for Aarey, from experts of planning and transport to wildlife enthusiasts and researchers, kids and the elderly who stood in the rain forming a human chain to protect the forest. All of them were Mumbaikars, who grew up in the city and those who want a better city for the future. They want the Metro and they want the forest. They want sustainable development.People from all political parties, social and economic backgrounds had raised their voice.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s bold move led by the three decisions of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray are a historic step towards making climate change mitigation and adaptation a part of our daily decision-making process. No other city has probably done this yet, but I hope we will not hold this “no other city” position alone and soon many more will join us. We must realise that these three decisions weren’t to do with politics or ideology, they are to do with the need for a better planet, cleaner environment and the survival of the human race.We owe a debt to the planet we live on.(Aaditya Thackeray is the Maharashtra environment minister)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aarey-saved-we-owe-a-debt-to-the-planet-we-live-on-writes-maharashtra-minister-aaditya-thackeray/story-bBKmmpTTmqDJw769iN1EEN.html

Though the air quality index (AQI) value on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index slightly improved to 276 on Wednesday from 300 on Tuesday, the average PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) measurement in Delhi was 115ug/m3 and PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) levels were at 207ug/m3. The standard safety limit for the two are 60 ug/m3 and 100 ug/mg3, respectively. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed the slight improvement in the air quality to better wind speed in the evening which kept the air quality from deteriorating further.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said winds were calm during the day, which caused an accumulation of pollutants. By evening, wind speed picked up. Also Read: Diesel generators banned in Delhi from Thursday; essential services like hospitals, railways exempted“Till 11am (on Wednesday), we recorded calm winds but by 2pm wind speeds reached almost 8kmph,” he said. “Delhi also received easterly winds in the evening, which means the impact of stubble burning from Delhi’s north-western side, in Punjab and Haryana, remained minimal,” Srivastava said. Srivastava, however, said the wind speed will be negligible again through Wednesday night, which means that the air quality is likely to remain in the same range on Thursday. The ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) recordings showed that on Tuesday, 357 farm fires were seen over Punjab and Haryana. “Stubble burning fires observed yesterday (Tuesday) around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring border regions with Safar synergised fire count estimated as 357, but the transport wind direction is not favourable and hence only minimal stubble contribution in PM2.5 is expected in Delhi,” the Safar air quality summary read on Wednesday. AAP blames Haryana The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Haryana government of not complying with the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority’s (Epca) ban on the use of diesel generator sets in the national capital region (NCR) from October 15.The ban will be enforced under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), the winter phase of which will come into force from Wednesday. “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Haryana is hell-bent on polluting the air that residents of Delhi breathe. The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order regarding retrofitting gensets is being openly disregarded by the Haryana government. Year after year, the Haryana government is making excuses to disregard Epca’s directions and refuses to ban gensets,” AAP’s national spokesperson of Raghav Chadha said at a press meet.Also Read: Sisodia says Centre, EPCA doing very little to control pollution in north IndiaHe said, “The Haryana government’s contempt for the health of Delhi residents and the Epca should be dealt with an iron fist and strong action should be taken against them. Why should Delhi pay for the Haryana government’s negligence? This can’t be excused.”On October 8, Epca had told the Haryana government that the graded action response plan, which prohibits the use of diesel generator sets, will be applicable from October 15.  The Haryana government had on Monday written to Epca, saying Gurgaon and Faridabad would face a power crisis if diesel generator sets are banned. The Epca so far has refused to step back on the issue and asserted that the action plan – aimed at preventing winter pollution in Delhi-NCR – will come into force. Vipul Goel, former cabinet minister in the Haryana government, who held the environment portfolio from 2014 to 2019, responded, “Firstly, all heavy-duty gensets above 1000KvA are already fitted with emission-control equipment at the time of manufacture. If you want to blame smaller gensets, then Delhi should fix the issue within its boundaries instead of blaming us. Gurugram and Faridabad don’t use half the number of small generators that Delhi does in its markets and residential colonies.” The Delhi Pollution Control Committee banned the use of diesel gensets in the Capital on Wednesday. CPCB teams to maintain vigilThe Union ministry of environment on Wednesday said 50 teams of Central Pollution Control Board will be deployed from Thursday to maintain a strict vigil against pollution in Delhi-NCR. The ministry said the teams will focus on hot spots in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and other NCR districts in Haryana and Rajasthan. “Strict vigil will be maintained against polluting activities in the upcoming winter season. On-spot reporting of major air polluting sources such as major construction activities without proper control measures, dumping of garbage and construction waste alongside the roads and on open plots, unpaved roads, open burning of garbage/industrial waste, etc. will be done using SAMEER App,” the ministry said. Also Read: Delhi records worst air quality since February; wind direction shift may bring reliefIt said that a central control room at the CPCB headquarters has been made functional for keeping track of pollution levels on an hourly basis and ensuring coordination with state pollution control agencies.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said strict action is being taken against those flouting dust control norms, be it the Delhi government’s Public Works Department or municipal corporations. The minister said the issue of pollution is related to people’s health and all agencies are equally responsible for its prevention and control. “It doesn’t matter which agency it is ... be it PWD or MCDs, all have to take measures to prevent dust pollution. Strict action is being taken against those not following the government’s directions,” he told reporters during an inspection of the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Project site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/smoggy-delhi-struggles-to-shrug-off-toxic-pollutants/story-TRAC7kOwtWDgURkTUIml7L.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to frame guidelines for all private coaching centres||The Delhi government will soon come up with a policy to regularise private coaching centres functioning in the national capital and will formulate guidelines for them in terms of infrastructure, land area, fees, and safety measures to be adopted.According to officials at the Directorate of Education (DoE), private coaching centres are running as a parallel education system in Delhi, but they were out of the ambit of any regularisation and often operated without any statutory compliances leading to serious safety hazards. The DoE has asked all coaching institutes, having an enrolment of 20 and above students, to register themselves with the directorate by November 14 this year.Yogesh Pal Singh,assistant director of DoE’s private school branch, said that the fire incident at a coaching centre in Gujarat’s Surat last year had prompted the Delhi government to formulate guidelines for the coaching centres with respect to basic facilities, fees, and safety measures. “The incident was a lesson and wake up call for us all. In Delhi, we have thousands of coaching institutes and centres, imparting pre-admission coaching to medical, engineering and students from other professional courses. They are a parallel education system that is out of the ambit of any regulations.”“It had also come to the notice of the government about some incidents of cheating and fraud on the part of some coaching centres, which remain unresolved due to the lack of regulation. Therefore, an urgent need was felt to come up with a policy to regularise these coaching centres in Delhi,” he said.As the first step to frame policy for regularisation, the DoE has decided to collect data from the private coaching centres in Delhi. “Due to the absence of any regulating policy, there is no data available on the number of coaching centres operating in Delhi. The DoE will now collect the data of such institutes and details of their infrastructure, land area, basic facilities, fee structure, safety standards,” Singh said.Coaching centres, having an enrolment of more than 20 students, will have to register themselves with the DoE and fill up a performa that will be available on its official website from Thursday. “Once the data has been collected, we will formulate rules and regulations on how these coaching centres will be provided licences, what will their infrastructure be like, how much fees they can charge and how they can hire the teachers,” Singh said, adding that the centres providing coaching to the school students for board classes will also fall under the new rules that are to be framed..Several coaching centres expressed reservations over the Delhi government’s decision. Arjun Ravindran, director, Vajiram & Ravi, one of Delhi’s oldest and much sought-after IAS coaching institutes, said, “The government should draw general statutes and tell that hereby coaching centres can apply and register themselves rather than randomly asking us to register with the DoE.”Officials at some coaching centres disapproved of the idea of the government deciding fees for them. “Different coaching centres work differently and provide very different sets of facilities. We do not know how the government will formulate a policy on fees charged by the coaching centres,” said an official at a coaching centre in Lakshmi Nagar, who wished not to be named. A senior Delhi government official, requesting anonymity, said, “The plan for regularising private coaching centres in Delhi was in the pipeline for the last few years. It’s very important to have a policy for the functioning of these coaching centres for the safety and security of students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-frame-guidelines-for-all-private-coaching-centres/story-RGxXubzeBFJaDg72Wn8LFN.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Shut down thermal plants in NCR, Delhi tells Centre||Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday wrote to Union power minister RK Singh, requesting him to shut all the 11 thermal power plants located within a radius of 300 kilometres from the national Capital. Addressing a press conference, Jain said the thermal power plants around Delhi are one of the biggest contributors to pollution. He said despite orders from the Supreme Court, these stations have not been shut yet.“Instead, the Central government now intends to renew these power stations and allow them to operate for two more years. This is happening even as the Central government had told the Supreme Court in 2015 that they will lower pollution emission from these plants by 2019,” he said. The power ministry did not respond to HT’s requests for a comment. Rai stated that on May 8 this year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had sent penalty notices to 35 non-compliant electricity generators in 15 coal-fired thermal power stations.  “Surprisingly, these generating stations were found to be non-compliant even with the new emissions norms introduced by the Central government way back in 2015… The CPCB notices are proof that the plants are environmentally hazardous and Delhi pays a huge cost due to these pollution-heavy plants that are stealthily and adversely affecting the lives of Delhi citizens,” read the letter sent by Jain. He said the Delhi government had already shut down the IP power plant in 2009, the Rajghat power plant in 2015 and the Badarpur power plant in 2018 due to increased environmental concerns, adding Delhi is the only state where there is no thermal power station now. Also Read: ‘Poor’ air raises concerns of another construction ban, agencies say can’t afford more delaysThe Delhi minister said it is expected that the upcoming winters might further aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic if the pollution levels are not kept under control. “Accordingly, it is requested that necessary directions may be issued to shut down the power generation from the plants non-compliant with the guidelines of the ministry of environment and forest dated 7.12.2015 and issue necessary directions to NTPC for decommissioning of Dadri-1 thermal station for containing the expected raise of pollution in Delhi,” Jain stated in his letter. Asked about the issue of non-payment of salaries to the staff at Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals, he reiterated that North MCD should hand over these hospitals to the Delhi Government. “A formal written proposal has been sent to the Centre to transfer these hospitals to the Delhi Government. MCD had earlier tried transferring the hospitals, but the Centre did not take them. We give funds to the MCD, but we are unaware of the expenditure since they do not get an audit done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shut-down-thermal-plants-in-ncr-delhi-tells-centre/story-XpE68n8fcimlYVcYj0bpwM.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Cinemas to roll out the red carpet with hit reruns||Seven months after being completely shut down owing to the raging Covid-19 pandemic, cinema halls — both big screens and multiplexes — are ready to glow back to life in Delhi, starting Thursday.With safety of their patrons, while ensuring compliance of all SoPs , still remaining their prime concern, the management of various cinemas across the state have another, probably bigger, headache — what content to run on their big screens, as no fresh titles had been released ever since the pandemic started. Most filmmakers have been testing waters and gauging audience reaction by pushing their content exclusively online since.The quick fix solution that most halls have hence come up with — reruns of old hits.HT spoke to the management of some cinemas and figured that films that fared well last year and in the beginning of this year before the shutdown, like Ajay Devgn’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, Taapsee Pannu’s Thappad, Ayushmann Khurrana’s Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, will make a return to the big screens. In addition to this, Oscar-winning movie Parasite, and Bloodshot, too were a common choice among many. PVR cinemas will also be screening Malang, Section 375, Dream Girl, John Wick, Joker and 1917, while INOX has opted to go for Malang, Chhichhore, Dream Girl, Mission Mangal, Lion King and Ford v Ferrari.Also Read| Lights, Camera, Action: Safety is key as cinema screens flicker back to life in DelhiCarnival Cinemas, on the other hand, is doing a mix and match according to their target audience in the given area. Kunal Sawhney, senior vice president (operations) Carnival Cinemas, said, “We’ve picked some old blockbusters, like Simmba, Chhichhore, Malang, Section 375, and would run them depending upon which movie fits best in which pocket. So, cinemas in Delhi would be screening a different movie, when compared to a cinema in Gurugram or Kanpur. We just want customers to come and see that the cinema experience was safe again. We’re only want to win back their confidence this particular week.”Devang Sampat, India CEO, Cinepolis, said that for the opening week, they’d be playing regional titles and library content from Bollywood. “Besides, we’re also planning a 3D film festival.”Single screen theatre Delite will reopen with Akshay Kumar’s Housefull 4, Varun Dhawan’s Street Dancer and Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan. Raj Kumar Mehrotra, CEO, Delite Cinemas said, “We’re hoping at least 10% to 20% occupancy this week. Usually pre-Diwali weekends are dull, but on October 23 or October 30, we have a couple of English titles lined up —including The New Mutants, a Disney film. Also, two other English titles — Tenet and Mulan — that have already released overseas, are in the pipeline and will be released on or after Diwali. Other than these, several regional language films have been finalised but that’ll be concentrated area-wise.”As for new releases, theatres are counting on four titles for Diwali weekend, out of which Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari has already been announced. Then there’s Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Tuesdays And Fridays, Indoo Ki Jawani and YRF’s Bunty Aur Babli 2 that are likely to hit the big screens.Kamal Gianchandani, CEO, PVR Pictures said, “We are reopening and releasing Hollywood film My Spy, which is a brand new title.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cinemas-to-roll-out-the-red-carpet-with-hit-reruns/story-VkgDz0NFPh4evVqgXj1KfN.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Lights, Camera, Action: Safety is key as cinema screens flicker back to life in Delhi||As the big screens in the city flicker back to life from Thursday — after a hiatus of more than seven months because of the Covid-19 pandemic — cinema hall owners across the Capital say their patrons will be in for a completely new experience in which safety is the keyword.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday met representatives of cinema hall owners in Delhi. “We cannot stay in lockdown forever, but I hope cinema halls strictly adhere to guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the government. It is extremely necessary to follow social distancing norms and sanitisation protocols during these testing times,” he said.The representatives of cinema halls — which include PVR, M2K Cinemas and INOX — told the chief minister that in order to ensure adherence to guidelines, they will sanitise food counters, prohibit patrons from consuming food inside auditoriums, leave a gap of one between two viewers, even if they arrive as a group, and ask cinema-goers to download the Aarogya Setu mobile application. “Apart from this, the auditoriums will be sanitised after every screening, all halls will have sanitiser dispensers and wearing of masks will be mandatory,” said a senior official in the chief minister’s office.Also Read: It’s showtime, says Punjab government; theatre owners show reluctanceIn Delhi, cinema halls, multiplexes and theatres have been shut since March 12, much before the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25 to arrest the spread of Covid-19. On September 30, the Union home ministry released guidelines, allowing states cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes to open from October 15. The relaxations were finally notified by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on October 7.The standard operating procedure (SOP) for reopening of cinemas, issued by the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) ministry, make it mandatory for alternate seats to be left vacant for social distancing and marked with fluorescent markers. Gatherings in lobbies, common areas, and lifts are barred. The guidelines also suggest longer intermissions to allow audiences seated in different rows to move in or out in a staggered manner.“We have put into place the very best safety protocols for our patrons. These comply with the guidelines set by the ministry. We firmly believe that once patrons come and experience the ‘new normal’ in cinemas, they will be completely assured with respect to their safety and enjoy a world-class movie experience once again,” a spokesperson of Cinepolis India, a movie chain, said. Very few cinemas across the capital, however, will physically open up for patrons on Thursday, with most saying they will start screening films from Friday.Several hall owners say that even though safety protocols are the new priority, it is the longing for the theatre experience that will help them win the trust of their patrons.Raj Mehrotra, CEO of Delite Cinema, said: “At Delite Cinema, customer delight comes first and in these unprecedented times, their safety and hygiene will be of paramount importance for us. As North India’s first single-screen cinema, Delite has always been at the forefront of ensuring our customers receive the best cinematic experiences. We look forward to entertaining Delhi’s population once again.”Ambani Shanker, director of Amba Cinema, also a popular single-screen cinema hall in north Delhi, said: “Amba Cinema, with one of the largest single screens in the city, bears a unique book-shaped architecture and is a hub for all Delhi University students to catch up with their favourite titles… We will be adhering to all the SOPs and safety guidelines as prescribed by the MHA as well as recommendations and suggestions we have received from local authorities.”Also Read: Delhi CM Kejriwal hopes theatres will strictly follow Covid-19 guidelinesThe Multiplex Association of India in a statement on Wednesday said: “We have developed our SOPs after careful considerations to ensure the safety of all movie goers, without interfering with their movie-going experience. All guidelines laid down by the government will be followed in its entirety. Aspects such as chequered seating, staggered show timings, paperless ticketing, cashless payments, compulsory masks and many other such measures, will ensure a safe, secure and hygienic cinema going experience for the movie lovers.”“More than watching a movie, it’s curiosity,” said Abhiroop Sen, a 32-year-old corporate executive who plans to visit a multiplex this Saturday with two friends. He says, “As far as safety is concerned, it seems like the government guidelines are adequate if they are strictly adhered to. Most of us are anyway going to offices occasionally and resumed workout at gyms. So, why not cinemas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lights-camera-action-safety-is-key-as-cinema-screens-flicker-back-to-life-in-delhi-from-thursday/story-PXW7Lg2TKIq0cqyblRsEQP.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Parliament committee to discuss crime in Delhi-NCR||The Parliament’s standing committee on home affairs has accorded top priority to discuss “Atrocities and Crime Against Women” in this current year, days after the brutal rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras shook the conscience of the nation, The committee will also discuss the issue of “Rising Crime in Delhi and NCR” among the nine subjects it has shortlisted for detailed discussion in this year. Both issues assume significance as the Hathras rape saw major outrage against the UP government while a recent report showed high crime levels in the national capital. Crimes in Delhi increased by over 20% from 2018 to 2019, a period when the national crime figures saw a rise of just three percent in cases registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). As per data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), thefts accounted for most of these crimes in Delhi. Over 82% of the 290,000 crimes in Delhi were thefts which saw an increase of 25.7% from 2018 to 2019. Also Read| ‘Will ensure security of Hathras family, witnesses’: UP to Supreme CourtIn sharp contrast, thefts accounted for just a little over 20% of the 3.2 million crimes across India and the overall thefts increased by 8%. The 19-year-old woman from Hathras died in a Delhi hospital after the assault and her family members claimed she was cremated against their wish. They had earlier alleged that they couldn’t even see her face before the police “burnt the body with petrol.” The CBI has registered a case against the prime accused Sandip Singh. He along with three other accused, all from upper caste - are in jail. They were named by the victim before she died on September 29. The panel on home ministry, led by Congress leader Anand Sharma, will also take up, national security, intelligence coordination and counter terrorism, police- training, modernisation and reforms, prison- conditions and its infrastructure and reforms, development activities in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and management of Covid-19 pandemic and related issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parliament-committee-to-discuss-crime-in-delhi-ncr/story-hKxEGiyM5sMWtsJ5hM5WaK.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Minor on late-night drive in uncle’s car fatally ran over two sisters in Model Town||The unidentified car that fatally ran over two minor sisters and left two others injured in north Delhi’s Model Town in a hit-and-run on Monday night was allegedly driven by a 17-year-old boy, police said on Wednesday after picking up broken pieces of the vehicle’s registration number plate that helped them identify and nab the suspect -- an incident that highlights the problem of underage driving in India. The boy, a class 12 student at a private school in Model Town, was out on a casual late-night drive in his uncle’s Honda City when he allegedly hit the four people crossing the road, Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) said. “The boy’s father will also be held culpable under the new Motor Vehicles Act,” the DCP said. She said legal action under the Act would be pursued even against the owner of the car. According to the new Act, the guardian of an underage driver is liable to be jailed for up to three years and fined Rs 25,000 if convicted. The legal age to get a car driving licence in India is 18 years.The DCP said that for now, the most stringent Indian Penal Code sections that would be pressed in this case is 304A (causing death by negligence). Asked if it would be converted to IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), she said it would depend on the outcome of the probe. While a person convicted under section 304A can be jailed for up to three years, or even be let off with a fine, a conviction under section 304 could land a convict in jail for up to 10 years. In the present case, it will all depend on whether the boy is tried as a minor or as an adult, she said. In a similar accident in 2016, not very far from the latest spot, a boy four days short of turning 18, had fatally mowed down a marketing professional in north Delhi’s Civil Lines. The boy was apprehended and his father arrested. The Supreme Court, however, earlier this year, refused to allow the driver to be tried as an adult as it found that he had not committed a “heinous” crime. The two sisters killed in the accident were aged seven and four years. Along with their five-year-old brother and a family friend, they were crossing GT Road at about 11.45 pm on Monday night when the vehicle, which was unidentified at that time, hit them. The sisters died in hospital while the other two are undergoing treatment. The children’s parents were getting their car refuelled at a CNG station while they were crossing the road with their father’s friend, Milap Singh, to have fruit juice at a nearby stall when the car hit them. The DCP said while the car sped away, investigators found broken pieces of the registration plate at the spot. “We found it was a Honda City car registered in Haryana. We checked with the transport department to identify the owner. It turned out that the boy’s uncle was the third owner of this car,” the DCP said. The police visited their house in Model Town to learn that it was the boy who had allegedly driven out the car that night. “He was out alone on a casual late-night drive,” the DCP said. The officer said after the accident, the boy returned home and told his family about the incident. The boy’s father runs a hardware business in north Delhi. “They had given away the car to a mechanic for repair work. We seized the car,” the DCP said.The police are yet to receive the boy’s blood report to determine if or not he was drunk at the time of the accident. Underage driving is a common problem in Delhi. In 2018, Delhi Traffic Police had prosecuted 1,228 such minor driver. That was a 589% jump from just 178 prosecutions in 2013. No data was readily available after 2018.According to a 2018 report by Nissan India and road safety NGO SaveLIFE Foundation, 96.4% underage drivers who were prosecuted said their parents knew they were driving the vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/minor-on-late-night-drive-in-uncle-s-car-fatally-ran-over-two-sisters-in-model-town/story-teIex3uB6SsQcmzQhsqXsJ.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Need mass movement to popularise solar power in capital, says Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said solar energy should be transformed into a “mass movement” in the national capital for more households to embrace the green form of electricity. Kejriwal was speaking at the inauguration of a 218 kWp solar power plant at Lady Irwin College, the biggest such plant at any college under Delhi University. The chief minister said the Delhi government has formulated two major policies for solar energy usage in the city. These include the Mukhya Mantri Solar Power Yojana, under which installation of solar power plant in residential and commercial properties is incentivised; and the Mukya Mantri Kisan Aay Badhotri Solar Yojana, which involves increasing the income of farmers by three to four times by installing elevated solar plants on their farms.“Under our scheme, residents, resident associations, or any entity which is installing solar power panels, does not have to spend any capital cost; in fact, they will save money on power bills as well. They will be able to save lakhs by just giving their rooftops and completing/signing some documentation. But, this still needs a push and scaling up further would be possible only if we turn solar energy into a mass movement in Delhi,” Kejriwal said. Oakridge Energy, a leading rooftop developer in India, which has fully financed, developed and commissioned the solar project at Lady Irwin College, said the 218 kWp solar power plant will generate 3.05 lakh units of power each year resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions of approximately 274 tonnes a year -- equivalent to the effect of planting of 13,500 trees.According to the government, in the last four years, around 206 Delhi government schools have been solarised. Rooftop solar power plants have been set up on more than 15 DU colleges and at all major technical institutions, medical colleges, polytechnics, government engineering colleges and other educational institutions. Some prominent institutions that set up solar plants are Delhi Technological University, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, and Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. Even the jails of Tihar, Rohini, and Mandoli have been solarised, a senior power official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/need-mass-movement-to-popularise-solar-power-in-capital-says-kejriwal/story-3fvgpJPy8WlQU9w4eJvhbO.html

The driver, who had fled from the spot leaving the tanker behind, was arrested on Wednesday. He has been identified by his first name Kapil. Kapil,40, a resident of Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh, has been booked for rash and negligent driving causing death. A case has been registered under section 304A of Indian Penal Code at the Ambedkar Nagar police station, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said. “It is a private water tanker but is on contract with the Delhi Jal Board,” DCP Thakur said. The dead woman, identified as Nabila, had completed her Class 12 and was preparing for further studies. The family lives in Hauz Rani in south Delhi. Nabila’s father Abdul Sattar is a carpenter, her uncle Abdul Gaffar said. According to Gaffar, Nabila was returning home with her father after meeting someone in Okhla. “Around 5 pm, a speeding water tanker hit their scooter. Both of them fell on the road and suffered injuries. They were rushed to a private hospital in Saket, where Nabila died during treatment.

15-10-2020||Delhi||2,000 North civic body doctors threaten indefinite strike from Monday to protest non-payment of salaries||At least 2,000 senior doctors working in the five hospitals, dispensaries and clinics run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from Monday to protest over non-payment of salaries for over three months.Since many of these health centres conduct testing and contact tracing activities for Covid-19, the doctors in their letter have requested the north corporation commissioner to make alternative arrangements.“Our families have been continuously subjected to brutal financial hardship... doctors are feeling immensely demoralised, mentally stressed and depressed because of non-payment of salaries for months. The responsibility for this strike shall lie with the government which forced us to take this bitter avoidable step. We feel sorry for our public and apologise to them beforehand,” read the letter by the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association, which on Monday had urged Delhi lieutenant governor to file an FIR against “authorities”. The association said it has received no response from authorities on their letter.“My mother has suffered a stroke and is extremely unwell. My daughter is studying abroad. How am I supposed to pay for anything if I do not get my salary? With no salary for over three months, even getting groceries is difficult. I know lots of people who are borrowing money from their relatives to run their households,” said Dr RR Gautam, president of the association.Dr Soobrata Ray from Maharshi Valmiki Infectious Disease hospital said, “My son joined Delhi Technological University this year, we had to pay around Rs 2 lakh fees. My younger son goes to Delhi Public School, I had to pay the fees. Now, we are left with nothing even for groceries. We cannot plan anything.”North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said they will pay the pending salaries in the next 10-15 days. “The doctors and nursing union members from Rajan Babu hospital met me in the morning. I assured them that their salaries will be paid in the next ten to fifteen days. I explained that a strike just draws our energy away from the task of generating funds. The doctors are all well-educated and should take the responsibility of treating the patients while we work on getting the money. We need about R15 -20 crore for paying the salaries of all hospital employees. We need to pay the nurses, senior doctors, junior doctors, administrative staff and everyone otherwise the hospitals cannot run smoothly. We just need some time,” the mayor said. Around 250 doctors from Hindu Rao Hospital -- the biggest facility run by North DMC -- have been on strike for the last four days. All Covid-19 patients being managed by the hospital were moved to Delhi government-run centres and the hospital was removed from the list of designated Covid-19 treatment centre on Tuesday.The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain has been saying that the MCD should hand over the hospitals to the state government. “They are unable to run the hospitals properly; we have offered to take it over. For a few years now, the MCD has been trying to hand over the hospitals to the central government, which has refused to take over. So, we have offered,” said Jain.The doctors have also urged the MCD to hand over the hospitals to other authorities for a long-term solution. “On one hand, North MCD is unable to arrange funds to pay salaries to its employees, and on the other hand, they are not exploring options like handing over the entire health services except public health to any other government organisations like the central government,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-000-north-civic-body-doctors-threaten-indefinite-strike-from-monday-to-protest-non-payment-of-salaries/story-hktDne6QqqnVZpZiIz9MHO.html

The constable, Mahipal Singh Yadav, suffered injuries after he fell off the bonnet, the police said on Wednesday. The errant driver tried to flee, but was caught by public and other traffic police personnel who had to chase him for nearly a kilometre. He was identified by his first name, Shubham, a resident of Uttam Nagar. Shubham was in the car with his friend Rahul when the incident took place around 5pm on Monday on the carriageway going towards Tilak Nagar from Dhaula Kuan, the police said. Also read: Snatchers throw cash on road to trap their victims; both caught, handed over to police“The errant driver was arrested and booked for assault/criminal force to deter a public servant from performing duty and rash driving. A case under sections 186,353, 279, and 337 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against him at the Delhi Cantt police station,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Devender Arya, adding that the case was registered on the complaint given by Yadav. In his complaint, Yadav said he was on vehicle checking duty along with three other personnel on Station Road in Delhi Cantt on Monday evening. Around 5pm, Yadav saw a white car with a fancy number plate being driven rashly and he signalled the driver to stop. “The driver slowed down and then suddenly accelerated away. I fell on the car bonnet in a bid to escape being run over and grabbed on to the windshield wiper. Instead of stopping the vehicle, despite me repeatedly asking him to, he continued to drive rashly and dragged me for 300-400 metres. He sped away after I fell off the bonnet. However, the public and the other traffic police constables chased and caught him,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-constable-dragged-on-car-s-bonnet-for-400-metres-in-delhi-cantt/story-Rw2zQRgwbtuakd3HwvRRRI.html
15-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Poor air raises concerns of another construction ban, agencies say can’t afford more delays||Since November last year, when the Supreme Court had banned construction activities in the capital in view of the rising air pollution, work on most infrastructure projects in the national capital has been moving at a snail’s pace, what with the Covid-19 pandemic that followed and the nationwide lockdown it entailed.The exodus of migrant workers back to their villages and home towns too deeply impacted the construction activity as mobilising labourers, once the lockdown had lifted, had been a huge challenge.With air pollution levels hovering around the “poor” category -- the air quality index , as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had docked at 276 on Wednesday -- the Delhi government is stepping up measures to check dust pollution and the possibility of a ban on construction activity is looming large once again.Although construction activities have been banned during peak pollution season for the past three years, a ban this year, various government agencies say, will derail most infrastructure projects, including those aimed at decongesting the city. Most agencies HT spoke to said that work has picked up pace only by September.Also Read: Smoggy Delhi struggles to shrug off toxic pollutantsAs per the Supreme Court-approved graded response action plan (Grap), construction activities need to be stopped if the air quality index -- on a scale of 0 to 500 -- touches ‘‘severe plus (500+)’ or emergency category. This would mean that the PM 2.5 levels have crossed 300ug/m3 or PM10 levels have crossed 500ug/m3 continuously for 48 hours or more. The permissible limit for PM2.5 in India is 60ug/m3 and PM10 is 100ug/m3.The decision regarding Grap measures is taken by the Environment Pollution Control Authroity (Epca) on the recommendation of the CPCB.A CPCB official said in view of the pandemic, several factors will be considered while implementing Grap measures this year “as and when the need arises”. “We are taking suggestions from agencies to find the best way forward. This is a peculiar situation and none of us has dealt with such a situation before. A decision will be taken in the best interest of the city’s environment,” the official said, on the condition of anonymity.If pollution levels in the capital deteriorate further, government agencies say instead of a blanket ban, construction activity should be regulated based on the nature of work involved. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which started construction work last December, has requested the CPCB to allow its work to continue.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “A blanket ban leads to discontinuation of all kinds of activities, which delays the overall completion targets. The workforce remains idle, machinery is left unused and project incurs time and cost overruns. In any case, the pandemic has also caused a loss of working days.”He added, “We have requested the CPCB to allow us to continue with those works that do not cause pollution such as underground work, installation of shuttering etc. Moreover, we have stringently implemented a number of dust management measures at our sites.”Road infra projects will be worst affectedRoad infrastructure projects such as the widening of National Highway-1, Dwarka Expressway, Dhaula Kuan underpass etc, being undertaken by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and the Barapullah Phase-III and Ashram underpass work being done the public works department (PWD) are long-term measures aimed at decongesting Delhi.A 2018 study conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), a Delhi-based research institute, showed that vehicle emissions account for 24%-28% of the city’s pollution. Dust, on the other hand, contributed only 18%-38% to the city’s overall pollution.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “Under Grap, all big construction sites have to give an undertaking that they will adhere to norms. Currently, there is no ban on construction activities and a situation that would necessitate such a ban would not arise, if there is strict enforcement by agencies and the government. The state governments have to ensure that there is zero tolerance towards burning of waste etc.”According to officials of the NHAI, which is working on four main projects to decongest Delhi, a further ban on construction will delay these projects by several months.Also Read: Delhi’s AQI improves marginally but remains in ‘poor’ zone“Until July, the work was severely affected. It is only in August that work started getting back on track. So far, just 80% of the work has resumed. These projects are important to curb pollution in the long run. Further, a ban on construction activity will adversely impact these projects which are important for addressing the pollution problem in the long term,” said the official, requesting anonymity.The NHAI has given Extension of Time (EoT) of up to six months to its contractors due to the ban on construction activity earlier this year, said the official.PWD officials too said construction work is yet to pick up pace. “If construction activity is banned, then it will delay our projects further. We are yet to rework the deadlines,” said a senior official, on condition of anonymity.Pragati Maidan redevelopment can’t afford more delaysSome of the projects such as the Centre’s Pragati Maidan redevelopment project have to be finished by next year. LC Goyal, chairman and managing director of India Trade Promotion Organisation, said, “We are on a very strict deadline and have to deliver the entire project by October 2021, as the new complex is the venue for the G20 Summit, scheduled for 2022. Until now, 68% of the work is complete whereas our target was to finish 80-85% of the work by now.”He added, “The blanket construction ban and lockdown have severely impacted the redevelopment of Pragati Maidan. The key problem is labour -- most workers have moved back to their villages. The remobilisation of labour is a mammoth task which takes time and thereby having a domino effect on work.”Workers fearful of losing jobsThis year, the agencies had to mobilise the workforce twice—first in February after the construction ban was lifted and then after the lockdown was lifted.Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union, said while most workers have returned, there is uncertainty among them about losing their livelihood all over again.“The way action is being taken against construction sites, there is fear among workers that work might be stopped again like last year. The workers have been the worst affected, as they have been practically out of work since November last year. If there is a ban yet again, then the Delhi government must step in to safeguard the interests of these people and ensure that they are paid.”While urban development experts say these infra projects are essential to address the problem of pollution in the long run, they say there is a need to keep a strict check on contractors as there are several violations.Sarvagya Srivastava, former Delhi PWD chief engineer, said, “There is no doubt a further ban will be a setback for all the development projects, but it is a fact that dust control norms have to be strictly adhered to. The need for a ban won’t arise if norms are followed. But there shouldn’t be a blanket ban on construction activities. Only earth and concreting work, which results in dust pollution, should be banned, if need be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/poor-air-raises-concerns-of-another-construction-ban-agencies-say-can-t-afford-more-delays/story-168kkkcuWKjcBY699gvLAI.html
15-10-2020||City||Public libraries in Pune reopens on reading motivation day on Oct 15||Pune: After seven months, the public libraries and reading rooms will see the light of the day on October 15 2020. Incidentally, 15 October is also celebrated as “Vachan Prerna Divas” or Reading Day to pay homage to former President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam who loved reading and writing, and also to encourage children to understand the importance of reading and develop it as a hobby. There are 1,000 libraries in Pune district, of which 90 libraries and reading rooms in the city are registered with the Pune District library. Following a circular Mission Begin Again released on 14 October, 2020, by the department of revenue and forest, disaster management, relief and rehabilitation, the libraries are getting ready to welcome their members again. Pune Marathi Granthalaya, the public library with 6,000 members and eight centres across the city, held a meeting at their premises after the state’s circular was passed. “Though it is on short notice, we welcome the decision taken by the authorities. We have planned a small prayer meet at the morning to celebrate Vachan Prerna Divas and have invited a few of our life members. The library will open its doors to its members at 9 am, with the security staff equipped with hand sanitisers and oxymeters to check members. We will allow only one member at a time to exchange book at the counter,” said Sharad Ghanekar, vice-chairman of the 107-year-old library. Though Ghanekar said that he is unsure about opening the reading hall, seating arrangements to maintain social distancing will be made if there is a demand from readers. Arun Kamalapurkar, (66), resident of Ganesh Mala, and retired bank employee is member of the Pune Marathi Granthalaya, said, “I missed the library a lot. I have reread all the books in my house. I was eagerly waiting for the library to reopen for time killing is an important factor for a senior citizen. There are limitations to buy new books, with finance and space to keep books. I prefer public libraries as compared to private libraries because membership is cheaper.” Hemant Kulkarni, a life member of the library, was excited and hoped to be the first one to visit the library when it reopens. “There is a vast difference when you read a book at home and when you are in the library. There are several of my friends and book lovers alike who all like to discuss books and exchange ideas at the library,” said Kulkarni, who has read all the 500 books kept at his home during the months of lockdown. Some libraries are unsure if their members will risk a visit. “We have been getting calls ever since the unlock circular was announced and are preparing to reopen the library. Our only concern is that 60 per cent of our members are senior citizens, and hence worried, although, we will follow all the protocols of social distancing, sanitizers and mask compulsory for visitors. We also have a skeletal staff attending in two shifts of the library’s working hours,” said VD Pingale, director, Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad Granthalaya. Shreya Gokhale of the district granthalaya said, “We have intimated all the libraries with us and specifically larger libraries with reading halls to maintain social distancing and constantly sanitize the premises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/public-libraries-to-reopen-on-the-reading-motivation-day-on-oct-15-in-pune/story-fhg5PPtXu72mbkQmbrow6I.html

If we want to avoid the second surge predicted by central government team, we need to wear face masks and follow other guidelines, said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar. Addressing the media, Rao said, “The Central team recently visited Pune and warned of a possible second surge in the city during December and January. The surge is mainly because of unlocking, economic activity and winter-related reasons.” The senior official Rao said, “We can avoid the second surge. Our vaccine is our mask right now. The possibility of a second spike in Covid-19 cases mainly depends on how we are going to lead our lives in terms of hygiene in the next few weeks. With the upcoming festival season and the winter season, if residents use mask when they venture out, followed social distancing and hand sanitisation, then Pune would be in a better position to tackle the virus.” According to Rao, experts say that the second wave would not be as strong as the first spike. “However, the administration is prepared and has enough oxygen and ventilator beds available,” he said. Talking about the positivity rate, the divisional commissioner said that though the figure is coming down in the division, experts claim that the pandemic would be stated as in control only when the figure touches below 10 per cent. Naidu Hospital patients may be shifted Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “PMC plans to set up the new Atal Bihari Vajpayee medical college at the premises of Naidu Hospital. If that work gets started, the administration may require to shift Covid-19 patients from the civic-run Hospital. The civic body has got the go-ahead to start the medical college. Recently, PMC handed over Kamla Nehru hospital for the proposed medical college project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mask-is-a-vaccine-to-check-second-wave-in-covid-cases-in-pune-saurabh-rao/story-5OgxDFgbTJ2glkXm2mhQsL.html
15-10-2020||Pune||PMC plans Covid insurance cover for lower-income group||In a unique initiative by a civic body in the country, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to cover residents from lower income group under a Rs 2 lakh Covid insurance. PMC published the expression of interest and has sought premium offer from private and government insurance companies till October 22. PMC health chief Dr Ashish Bharti said, “The scheme is presently restricted to citizens who fall under the PMC’s Urban Poor Scheme for lower income group. Only income is the criterion for this scheme and it’s open for all.” Bharti said, “Around 1 lakh people are registered for the scheme. With the possibility of second surge of Covid-19 cases in the city, the civic administration has decided to provide insurance up to Rs 2 lakh. Residents can undergo Covid treatment at private hospitals and will need to only pay for bill excess of Rs2 lakh.” The health chief said that a meeting with interested insurance companies will be held on October 16 to answer their queries and understand the financial coverage plans. Congress party’s leader in PMC Aba Bagul said, “The insurance scheme for Covid-19 would be helpful for PMC and it would save money. Till today, PMC had spent Rs45 crore on 5,000 residents registered under the urban poor scheme. I am sure that if PMC procures the insurance plan, it would save money spent on medical bills paid to private hospitals under the scheme.” The PMC health office said that the scheme would be applicable for government and PMC-owned hospitals. Beneficiaries undergoing treatment at PMC hospitals would be charged as per government rates and civic administration will claim the bill from the insurance company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-plans-covid-insurance-cover-for-lower-income-group/story-1AyHmi76TjRrqFBPSfr5XM.html

15-10-2020||World||London and Paris clamp down as Europe hits Covid-19 records||Londoners will be banned from mixing with other households indoors and Paris is set for a curfew, as European leaders struggle to cope with record new coronavirus cases around the region.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government mandated tighter restrictions in the UK capital starting this weekend, while French President Emmanuel Macron will confine residents of nine of the country’s biggest cities to their homes between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. for four weeks from Saturday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel implored citizens to abide by distancing rules and avoid groups.French, Italian and Irish daily infections hit a record on Thursday, while Spain recorded the most new cases since April. The varied approaches around Europe to deal with the disease have caused confusion and stoked unrest amid the pandemic-weary public, especially amid low hospitalization and death rates -- which keep rising steadily.Also Read| Covid-19: IMF warns global economy could be permanently scarredLeaders have little recourse but to tell people to knuckle down. Johnson was adamant he did not want a second lockdown but now the prospect of a so-called “circuit-breaker” with schools closed for two weeks is in the air.From midnight on Friday, millions of residents in the UK capital won’t be able to socialize with other households behind closed doors, including in pubs and restaurants.“I know these restrictions are difficult for people, I hate that we have to bring them in, but it is essential that we do bring them in both to keep people safe and to prevent greater economic damage in the future,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Thursday.Whack-a-MoleOutside London, UK officials are also attempting to tame the virus with a regional “whack-a-mole” strategy that has created tensions with the poorer north where the number cases are rising rapidly.The government has earmarked Manchester for the toughest restrictions, but is stuck in talks with local leaders in the northern English city over financial support. There is also disparity within the UK itself on the best approach.This latest development comes as Germany, Italy, Austria and the Czech Republic all reported record increases in cases, and London approached an average of 100 infections per 100,000 people.European authorities are grappling with how to devise targeted strategies that slow the spread of the disease without resorting to the kind of broad national lockdowns which decimated economic activity in the second quarter.Merkel struggled to forge a consensus with regional German leaders in a meeting that dragged on into Wednesday night. The measures agreed for hard-hit areas -- including closing bars and restaurants at 11 p.m. and extending mandatory mask wearing -- appear insufficient but still state officials argued that they further curbs are unnecessary and ineffective.“The problem is that day by day with increasing numbers our local authorities are not able any more to trace,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday during a Bloomberg webinar. “And then you lose track” and the numbers are increasing exponentially.”France reported a record of 30,621 new infections on Thursday. Germany recorded 7,173 new cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, exceeding a high during the previous peak of the pandemic in late March.“Economically we can’t afford a second wave” Merkel said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEuropean infections began a resurgence in the late summer, fueled by returning travelers and young party-goers. Local family, work and social gatherings have since spurred further contagion. On Thursday, Germany declared that that all of continental France, the entire Netherlands and all of Slovenia will be considered a coronavirus risk area from Oct. 17 onwards.The region as a whole recorded almost 700,000 new cases last week, the most since the pandemic began, and taking the total to just below 7 million, according to the World Health Organization. Britain, France, Russia and Spain accounted for over half of all new cases.In France, daily cases have jumped to more than 17,000 from less than 12,000 a week ago, and more than 40% of intensive-care beds in the Paris region are taken by Covid-19 patients. Such is the worry, that there is now the suggestion regional elections in March will be delayed.Macron said Wednesday the situation in hospitals is “unsustainable” and the goal is to bring new cases down to 3,000 to 4,000 a day.“We are a united nation, and we will succeed,” he said.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that the nation will “be in trouble again” if the rising trend persists and for the first time declined to rule out a new nationwide lockdown. In the Naples area, authorities signed a decree ordering schools to close until Oct. 30, newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. The decree also bans parties, with guests from different households.In Spain, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya pushed back against reports that the spread of the virus and the political tussling over how to contain it are sparking concerns in Berlin. Spain detected 6,603 coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, the biggest daily increase since April.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, she insisted that the Spanish outbreak is “under control” and criticism of her government’s fight with the Madrid region over tighter restrictions is unfair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-and-paris-clamp-down-as-europe-hits-covid-19-records/story-LqHIuuxR9UDHn7WvyVFz6H.html
15-10-2020||World||Trump slams Facebook, Twitter as ‘third arm’ of the Democratic party||President Donald Trump has blasted Facebook and Twitter as the “third arm” of the Democratic party for blocking links to a news story that seeks to sully Joe Biden, his rival for presidential election, based on questionable information and allegations about his son’s business dealings.Allies of the president, who is trailing the Democrat ahead of close of polling on November 3, have sought to portray the story as potentially the “October Surprise” of the 2020 election, using a term for an unforeseen setback that leaves the targeted candidate with little or no time to recover.In a report headlined the “Smoking Gun Email”, the New York Post, a conservative-leaning publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported on Wednesday that Hunter Biden had sought to set up a meeting in 2015 between his father, then vice president, and an executive of a Ukrainian energy company that he was serving as a board member.The information about this meeting, which is not reported to have taken place at all, was obtained purportedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop at a Delaware repair store and was subsequently passed on to Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, who then provided it to the news publication.Facebook and Twitter blocked links to the article saying it needed to be cross-checked. Andy Stone of Facebook said in a tweet that “this story is eligible to be fact- checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking” and the social media platform was “reducing its distribution” until then.President Trump blew up. “So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of ‘Smoking Gun’ emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost. It is only the beginning for them. There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician,” he vented on Twitter.He also called for repealing a statutory provision — Section 230 — that grants social media platforms the freedom to self-regulate their content, which has been in his administration’s crosshairs, for previous instances of blocking or tagging of posts by him, his allies and other conservatives.“It’s like a third arm, maybe a first arm, of the DNC (the Democratic National Committee),” Trump said on Fox Business Network Thursday, referring to Twitter and Facebook. “It’s a massive campaign contribution.”The president’s spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, who is working remotely after testing positive for Covid-19, followed up on Thursday assailing Big Tech for “censoring political speech”, which, she added, “you’d expect in countries like China, North Korea, or Iran — NOT America.”She added: “This should scare every single American who values free and open discourse. Do NOT let Big Tech silence YOU”.Earlier, on Wednesday, President Trump had also retweeted a clip from Fox News in which its anchor suggested the possibility of the New York Post story being the “October Surprise” of this election cycle.The president brought up the allegations in the article at an election rally later in Iowa, a state he had won comfortably in 2016. He called for Biden to apologise and “immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings and influence peddling around the world—including in China, including Russia.”President Trump and his allies have attacked Biden over his younger son’s — elder son Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015 — business dealing in Ukraine and China, alleging he had made “millions” by using access to his father. The former vice-president has denied he ever discussed his son’s businesses with him while in office and no evidence has been found yet of any wrongdoing by him.Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, sought to debunk the NYP report. These allegations had been investigated before by the press, Republican-led congressional bodies and others, he said, and they “all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing. Trump Administration officials have attested to these facts under oath”.Bates said further that the New York Post never checked “critical elements of this story” with the Biden campaign, which, he went on to add, has already “reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-facebook-twitter-as-third-arm-of-the-democratic-party/story-lThkHp09abJCYO3R0EnMfN.html
15-10-2020||World||Israeli parliament rubber stamps Abraham Accords||Israel’s parliament on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of formally ratifying the country’s historic agreement normalizing diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates.Israel and the UAE announced the U.S.-brokered agreement in August, and signed a deal in a White House ceremony last month. Thursday’s approval by the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, which passed in a 80-13 vote, was largely a formality.The UAE has become just the third Arab country to establish official ties with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan, and the first to do so in a quarter century. Bahrain is also in the process of formalizing ties with Israel, and the White House has suggested that other Arab countries will follow suit.The deals reflect a shift in the Middle East as Arab countries’ shared concerns with Israel about Iran outweigh their traditional support for the Palestinians.“Many Arab and Muslim countries want to get close to us,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech. “They see our military and intelligence, technological and economic power. They are changing their attitude toward us.”The Palestinians, who have long relied on unified Arab support to boost them against Israel, have condemned the deal and accused the UAE of betrayal.The Joint List, the main Arab-dominated faction in parliament, cast the lone opposing votes Thursday in solidarity with their Palestinian brethren.Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List, said the only deal that would bring peace and prosperity to the region would be a peace agreement creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.“The deal being signed today is part of Trump’s dangerous vision that ... will perpetuate the military regime on millions of Palestinians, the settlements and the outposts,” he wrote in a tweet before the vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-parliament-rubber-stamps-abraham-accords/story-4bcDB9uNqzhKdswvJUHujL.html
15-10-2020||World||Tourists return to Hawaii amid ever-changing Covid-19 pandemic rules||Coronavirus weary residents and struggling business owners in Hawaii will be watching closely as tourists begin to return to the islands on Thursday without being required to self-quarantine upon arrival.A new pre-travel testing program will allow visitors who test negative for Covid-19 to come to Hawaii and avoid the two weeks of mandatory quarantine — a measure that’s been in place for all arriving passengers for most of the year.The state-run testing program is an effort to stem the devastating downturn the pandemic has had on Hawaii’s tourism-based economy.However, gaps in the pre-travel testing program coupled with increasing cases of Covid-19 across the U.S. and the world have raised questions about whether Hawaii is ready to safely welcome back vacationers.Officials touted the mandatory quarantine rule as an integral part of Hawaii’s early success in keeping the coronavirus at bay.But when local restrictions were eased before summertime holidays, community spread of the disease spiked to alarming levels, forcing a second round of stay-at-home orders for residents and closures for non-essential businesses.Opponents of the testing program have said a single test 72 hours before arrival — especially when coupled with the option to fly without a test and still quarantine — is not enough to keep island residents safe.But Hawaii has built an economy almost entirely around tourism and local families who rely on the sector to survive need to get back to work.More than 100 of Hawaii’s approximately 4,000 restaurants, bakeries and caterers have closed permanently and more than 50% predict they will not survive the coming months, officials have said.Monica Toguchi Ryan, whose family has owned and operated The Highway Inn restaurant on Oahu for over 70 years, said the lack of tourism has been crippling.“The restaurant and service industry has suffered so much during this pandemic,” Toguchi Ryan said. “Restaurants have not received any federal relief since the spring and are struggling to pay their expenses. Some restaurants have closed entirely, unable to pay for their rent, food supplies and staff wages.”Toguchi Ryan joined Democratic Gov. David Ige on Wednesday to talk about a new restaurant debit card that will give some unemployed Hawaii residents a $500 to spend at local restaurants over the next 60 days. The $75 million program is being funded by federal CARES Act money and is aimed at stimulating the local economy.“When restaurants like us have more customers, we buy more from our suppliers and we reinvest the money several times over in our local economy,” Toguchi Ryan said.Hawaii, which has about 1.4 million residents, reported 10 additional coronavirus deaths and more than 100 newly confirmed cases on Wednesday. On Oahu, home to the famed Waikiki Beach and the state’s most populated island, the positivity rate was nearly 4%.County mayors have criticized the state’s plan for a single test prior to flying and want a mandatory second test for all arriving passengers.Kauai island Mayor Derek Kawakami said last week that his initial proposal for secondary testing was rejected by the governor.Big Island Mayor Harry Kim said his county would opt out of the pre-travel testing program entirely and continue to require all arriving visitors to quarantine for two weeks. Both now have different plansThe governor said this week that mayors could implement certain secondary testing measures on their respective islands, but the cost and logistics of running such programs would be left to the counties.Maui and Kauai counties decided on voluntary secondary testing for visitors. The Big Island will require secondary rapid screening upon arrival for visitors to avoid quarantine. Oahu officials have said they want to put in place another layer of screening but do not yet have the testing capacity.The mixed bag of county and state rules could create chaos for vacationers who have not properly prepared for the various screening requirements, especially those traveling to the Big Island.“This second test upon arrival to Hawaii island will provide an extra layer of protection for our community,” said Big Island Mayor Harry Kim in a statement Monday. “Virtually, all medical and coronavirus experts agree for the necessity of more than one test.”Those arriving on the Big Island — home to Hawaii’s active volcanoes and the site of a 2018 eruption that wiped out entire neighborhoods — will take a mandatory rapid antigen test when they land.Results will be available in about 15 minutes and travelers who test negative will not be required to quarantine. People who test positive will be required to immediately get a more accurate PCR test and then quarantine until their results are available, usually within 36 hours.People who test positive in the state, whether on vacation or at home, are required to isolate and cannot fly until they no longer have the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tourists-return-to-hawaii-amid-ever-changing-covid-19-pandemic-rules/story-tv71O2udJtSVFC1u5FIGWP.html
15-10-2020||World||Herd immunity approaches to control Covid-19 ‘a dangerous fallacy’, say scientists||Managing Covid-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,” warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter. The letter, published in The Lancet journal, referred to by its authors as the John Snow Memorandum, noted that any pandemic management strategy relying upon the population to develop immunity from natural infections for Covid-19 is flawed. In the face of a second wave of infection in several parts of the world, the scientists including Devi Sridhar from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, said there is currently renewed interest in herd immunity approaches allowing a large uncontrolled outbreak in low-risk populations while protecting the vulnerable. While some have argued this approach could lead to the development of infection-acquired immunity in the low-risk population, which will eventually protect the vulnerable, the researchers explained such uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant ill-health and death. Based on evidence from many countries, the scientists said it is not possible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks to certain sections of society, adding that it is “practically impossible” and “highly unethical” to isolate large swathes of the population. While special efforts to protect the most vulnerable are essential, they said these must go hand-in-hand with multi-pronged population-level strategies. “Effective measures that suppress and control transmission need to be implemented widely, and they must be supported by financial and social programmes that encourage community responses and address the inequities that have been amplified by the pandemic,” they wrote in the letter. “Continuing restrictions will probably be required in the short term, to reduce transmission and fix ineffective pandemic response systems, in order to prevent future lockdowns,” the researchers said. According to the scientists, the restrictions can effectively suppress the number if infections to low levels that allow rapid detection of localised outbreaks. They said such measures can also compliment rapid response through efficient and comprehensive testing, contact tracing, isolation and support systems. “Protecting our economies is inextricably tied to controlling Covid-19. We must protect our workforce and avoid long-term uncertainty,” they said. The researchers cautioned that there is currently no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection. They said this waning immunity as a result of natural infection would not end the Covid-19 pandemic but instead result in repeated waves of transmission over several years. According to the scientists, vulnerable populations are at risk for the indefinite future, as natural infection-based herd immunity strategies would result in recurrent epidemics, as seen with many infectious diseases before mass vaccination. So they called for controlling the spread of the virus until the population can be vaccinated. Natural infection-based herd immunity approaches risk impacting the workforce as a whole and overwhelming the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care, the researchers warned. They said clinicians still do not understand who might suffer from ‘long Covid’ in which the symptoms linger for weeks. “The evidence is very clear: controlling community spread of Covid-19 is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months,” the scientists wrote. “We cannot afford distractions that undermine an effective response; it is essential that we act urgently based on the evidence,” they concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-approaches-to-control-covid-19-a-dangerous-fallacy-say-scientists/story-VXdNAEnKZWr6OJKIpWjnuM.html
15-10-2020||World||Director Roman Polanski pays respect to Polish couple who saved him from Holocaust||Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski returned to Poland, the country of his youth, and paid tribute on Thursday to a Polish couple who took him in and protected him when he was a child, saving him from the Holocaust.Stefania and Jan Buchala were posthumously declared as “Righteous Among the Nations,” an honour bestowed by Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, in a ceremony attended by their grandson.The 87-year-old Polanski, who now lives in France, travelled to Poland for the occasion. Poland is one of the very few countries Polanski can travel to safely given that he remains a fugitive from U.S. law after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 and fleeing the United States the following year.Polanski recalled Stefania Buchala as an “extremely noble and religious person” who had the courage to risk not only her own life in sheltering him, but also the lives of her children.The couple’s grandson, Stanislaw Buchala, received the distinction on behalf of his late grandparents from Israel’s deputy ambassador at a Jewish memorial center in Gliwice, a southern Polish city. City authorities also attended the ceremony.Polanski was nine years old when his parents made him escape from the Krakow Ghetto during the German occupation of Poland during World War II. Both of his parents were soon after deported to death camps.He was given shelter by the Buchalas from 1943-45, in the small southern village of Wysoka.They are among some 7,000 Poles now recognized by Yad Vashem for saving Jews from certain death at the hands of Nazi German forces. More people from Poland have been recognized for such heroism than from any other country.Polanski’s mother died in Auschwitz, but his father survived the Mauthausen camp and the two were reunited after the war.Among Polanski’s award-winning projects is a story of Holocaust survival, the 2003 film the “The Pianist.”Two years ago Polanski was expelled from the organization that bestows the Academy Awards for raping a minor. His request to have his membership reinstated was rejected this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/director-roman-polanski-pays-respect-to-polish-couple-who-saved-him-from-holocaust/story-UvVIciAJuCzseFowqO5vZI.html
15-10-2020||World||Twitter restricts Donald Trump’s campaign account from tweeting||Twitter Inc on Thursday temporarily restricted U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign account from tweeting, saying a video from the account about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son violated its rules.The video posted by the @TeamTrump account referred to a New York Post story from Wednesday that contained alleged details of Hunter Biden’s business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company and said the former vice president had met with an adviser of the company. “Joe Biden is a liar who has been ripping off our country for years,” the video was captioned.Twitter said the video violated its rules against posting private information, adding the account may need to delete the post in order to continue tweeting.“It’s going to all end up in a big lawsuit and there are things that can happen that are very severe that I’d rather not see happen, but it’s probably going to have to,” Trump said, when asked about the move by Twitter.Twitter said on Wednesday the Post story violated its “hacked materials” policy, which bars the distribution of content obtained through hacking that contains private information or trade secrets, or puts people at risk of physical harm. Facebook Inc and Twitter took proactive steps on Wednesday to restrict dissemination of the Post story in the hours after it was published.Twitter had placed similar restrictions on the account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday, after she shared the Post story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-restricts-donald-trump-s-campaign-account-from-tweeting/story-f2aNK9nqZWJGwExjF1oH3I.html
15-10-2020||World||EU sanctions 5 Russians officials and one institute over Navalny poisoning||The European Union and Britain imposed sanctions on six Russians on Thursday , some among the highest-ranked officials in the nation, and one organization over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a Soviet-era nerve agent.“The adopted restrictive measures consist of a travel ban to the EU and an asset freeze for individuals, and an asset freeze for the entity,” the EU said in a statement.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the move “a deliberate unfriendly step towards Russia” and said that the EU “inflicted damage” on the bloc’s relations with Russia.The move came a day after Russia’s foreign minister warned that Moscow might respond with similar measures. The decision was agreed upon among the 27 EU envoys to Brussels.The list includes Alexander Bortnikov, the chief of Russia’s Federal Security Service, the top KGB successor agency that is in charge of domestic security, and Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin’s deputy chief of staff. The EU is also targeting the State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology.EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to impose the sanctions, following a push by France and Germany to freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement and ban them from travelling in Europe under sanctions to combat the use and spread of chemical weapons. The legal procedures were completed on Thursday.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the EU had acted “with exceptional speed, in keeping with the seriousness of this act and the methods used.”“This demonstrates a European Union that acts in the face of the new, unacceptable and destabilizing use of a chemical weapon,” he said at a meeting in Paris.The U.K. said it would also apply the EU sanctions and will continue them once it leaves a post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year. “Any use of chemical weapons by the Russian state violates international law. We are determined to hold those responsible to account,” said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab .Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and major political opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on August 20 during a domestic flight in Russia. He was flown to Germany for treatment two days later and is still recovering there.Russian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning and Russian doctors who first examined Navalny have said they found no signs of a poisoning.Last week, tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that Navalny was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, suggested that Moscow might even sever ties claiming on Wednesday that “the Germans are not planning to provide any facts, despite all international and legal obligations. We respond in kind. This is diplomatic practice.”“We probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don’t understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue,” he said.Lavrov specifically pointed at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent statements ruling out a partnership with Russia, saying that scenario will play out if that’s what the EU wants.“Russia wants to understand whether it’s possible to do any business with the EU in the current conditions,” Lavrov said at a foreign policy conference attended by experts in Moscow.In a phone call on Tuesday with Lavrov, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell insisted that the EU “wishes to maintain open channels of communication with Russia and to enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest,” according to a statement from Borrell’s office.Borrell also underlined that Moscow “must do its utmost to investigate this crime thoroughly in full transparency and to fully cooperate” with the OPCW, and that the EU “will continue to defend its interests and values, including respect for international law and fundamental rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sanctions-5-russians-officials-and-one-institute-over-navalny-poisoning/story-ue0zgvnCzhsRwWc04AICqK.html
15-10-2020||World||Thailand declares emergency due to unprecedented student uprising||Thailand’s government declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after a student-led protest against the country’s traditional establishment saw an extraordinary moment in which demonstrators heckled a royal motorcade.After the pre-dawn declaration, riot police moved in to clear out demonstrators who after a day of rallies and confrontation had gathered outside Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s office to push their demands, which include the former general’s stepping down, constitutional changes and reform of the monarchy.Several top leaders of the protest movement were taken into custody, with one later declaring on his Facebook page that he had been denied access to a lawyer and was being forced onto a helicopter and taken to a city in the country’s north. Police said they had made 22 arrests.Despite a new ban against large public gatherings, several thousand people answered calls to rally again in another area of the city later Thursday.The text of the emergency declaration said it was needed because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”The protest on Wednesday in Bangkok’s historic district, not far from glittering temples and royal palaces, was the third major gathering by student-led activists who have been pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable — and legal — language by publicly questioning the role of Thailand’s monarchy in the nation’s power structure.Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key member of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.The protest — held on the anniversary of a 1973 student-led uprising against a military dictatorship — was complicated by the presence of royalist counter protesters who had gathered both to show support for the government and to greet the royal family as they travelled to and from a religious ceremony in the area.That led to a moment captured in photos and video that circulated widely on social media in which what appeared to be protesters gestured and shouted just meters (feet) from the royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.Some experts say a line may have been crossed.“What seemed to be a low-boil stalemate that the Prayuth government was managing with reasonable success has now, following the incident involving the procession of the queen’s motorcade down a street in which an active protest was under way and the arrests of protest leaders, become a full-blown crisis,” said Michael Montesano, coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Isak Institute in Singapore. “Unlike even 48 hours ago, the country is in dangerous territory now.”Government spokesman Anucha Buraphachaisri announced Thursday morning that the prime minister had ordered police to take strict action against those who obstruct a royal procession or otherwise insult the monarchy.One change is that police said they will install checkpoints around Bangkok for security purposes.Keeping order will be facilitated by the new emergency decree for Bangkok, which bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people and gives authorities other powers they deem needed to prevent unrest, including detaining people temporarily without charge. It also outlaws news that distorts information or could cause a “misunderstanding.”Thailand is already under a national state of emergency as part of its efforts to fight the coronavirus, and it was not immediately clear how the new decree was different.Protesters gathered again in a Bangkok shopping district Thursday afternoon and into the evening. The crowd grew big enough to block a major intersection flanked by upmarket malls and a famous shrine, where they were addressed by a series of speakers denouncing the government.Police stood by while the crowd chanted rude slogans calling for the prime minister to step down. They also chanted “Free our friends,” in reference to the arrested leaders.“I want to fight for my future. I want to fight for my friends. I want to fight for my democracy. My country must be democracy,” said 24-year-old NGO worker Aitarnik Chitwiset.Deputy police spokesman Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen warned earlier that calling for such a protest or attending one was against the law.Human rights group Amnesty International criticized the crackdown as “unjustified.”“These moves are clearly designed to stamp out dissent, and sow fear in anyone who sympathizes with the protesters’ views,” the group said in a statement.The protest movement was launched in March by university students, but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and has since grown in size.The movement’s original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The movement took another stunning turn in August, when students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and issued calls for its reform. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticized the king’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany, not Thailand.Conservative royalist Thais accuse the protest movement of seeking to end the monarchy, an allegation its leaders deny.Nevertheless, analysts say the incident with the royal motorcade may harden positions.It “is not just unprecedented but will be shocking for many,” said Kevin Hewison, professor emeritus from the University of North Carolina and veteran Thai studies scholar. “Yet it is reflective of how a new generation of protesters sees the monarchy and military-backed regime as intertwined and that political reform demands reform of the monarchy as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-declares-emergency-due-to-unprecedented-student-uprising/story-OwpjdwC0QYSZ9DLByImdkN.html
15-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination: Judiciary panel sets October 22 for vote||The Senate Judiciary Committee convened on Thursday set an October 22 vote on Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination as Republicans race to confirm President Donald Trump’s pick before the November 3 election.The session is without Barrett after two long days of public testimony in which she stressed that she would be her own judge and sought to create distance between herself and past positions critical of abortion, the Affordable Care Act and other issues.Her confirmation to take the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems inevitable, as even some Senate Democrats acknowledged.Senator Lindsey Graham pushed past Democratic objections to set the panel’s October 22 vote on recommending her confirmation even before final witnesses testify for and against her nomination. The committee set the vote for next week.“This is a sham,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.In the minority, Democrats acknowledge there is little they can do to stop them from locking a conservative majority on the court for years to come. The shift would cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court and would be the most pronounced ideological change in 30 years, from the liberal icon to the conservative appeals court judge.Facing almost 20 hours of questions from senators, the 48-year-old judge was careful not to take on the president who nominated her and sought to separate herself from writings on controversial subjects when she was an academic. She skipped past Democrats’ pressing questions about ensuring the date of next month’s election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power.She also refused to express her view on whether the president can pardon himself. “It’s not one that I can offer a view,” she said in response to a question Wednesday from Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont.Democrats raised those questions because President Donald Trump has done so himself.When it came to major issues that are likely to come before the court, including abortion and health care, Barrett repeatedly promised to keep an open mind and said neither Trump nor anyone else in the White House had tried to influence her views.“No one has elicited from me any commitment in a case,” she said.Nominees typically resist offering any more information than they have to, especially when the president’s party controls the Senate, as it does now. But Barrett wouldn’t engage on topics that seemed easy to swat away, including that only Congress can change the date that the election takes place.She said she is not on a “mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,” though she has been critical of the two Supreme Court decisions that preserved key parts of the Obama-era health care law. She could be on the court when it hears the latest Republican-led challenge on November 10.Barrett is the most open opponent of abortion nominated to the Supreme Court in decades, and Democrats fear that her ascension could be a tipping point that threatens abortion rights.There was no hiding her views in at least three letters and ads she signed over 15 years and her membership in Notre Dame’s Faculty for Life. So Republican senators embraced her stance, proudly stating that she was, in Graham’s words, an “unashamedly pro-life” conservative who is making history as a role model for other women.Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said “there is nothing wrong with confirming a devout pro-life Christian.” Barrett refused to say whether the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights was correctly decided, though she signed an open letter seven years ago that called the decision “infamous.” Democrats pressed repeatedly on the judge’s approach to health care, abortion, racial equity and voting rights, but conceded they were unlikely to stop her quick confirmation.“When you are on the court,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., began one question in which he asked her to keep an open mind on the high court bench. Barrett readily agreed to do so.In an exchange with Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Barrett resisted the invitation to explicitly endorse or reject the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s comments about perpetuating “racial entitlement” in a key voting rights case.“When I said that Justice Scalia’s philosophy is mine, too, I certainly didn’t mean to say that every sentence that came out of Justice Scalia’s mouth or every sentence that he wrote is one that I would agree with,” Barrett said.She called the Voting Rights Act a “triumph in the civil rights movement,” without discussing the specifics of the earlier challenge to it. The court will hear another challenge to the law early next year.One of the more dramatic moments came late Wednesday when Barrett told California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, that she wouldn’t say whether racial discrimination in voting still exists nor express a view on climate change.Harris asked if she agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote in a 2013 voting rights case that “voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.” Barrett said she would “not comment on what any justice said in an opinion.” Asked whether “climate change is happening,” Barrett said she wouldn’t engage because it is “a very contentious matter of public debate.” Barrett did, however, say she believes the novel coronavirus is infectious and that smoking causes cancer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-s-nomination-judiciary-panel-sets-october-22-for-vote/story-wviqUocTHD50REu8qcBOkI.html

15-10-2020||World||Crackdown: Arrest warrant against Pak ex-prez, 450 booked before massive anti-govt stir||Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog on Thursday issued an arrest warrant against former president Asif Ali Zardari, while authorities booked more than 450 activists ahead of a massive rally planned by a joint opposition front that seeks to oust the Imran Khan government.The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) issued the warrant against Zardari in a suspicious transactions case worth 8 billion Pakistani rupees, an offshoot of a fake bank accounts scam.NAB asked the Islamabad High Court to deny him a pre-arrest bail, saying the co-chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was not entitled to it.Earlier this week, Zardari was shifted to a private hospital in Karachi after he felt unwell. In September, he was indicted in a money laundering case pertaining to the fake bank accounts.The Imran Khan government has been cracking down on opposition parties after they formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) with the aim to remove him.PDM has an action plan of a three-phased anti-government movement, starting with countrywide public meetings, protest demonstrations and rallies before a “decisive long march” towards Islamabad in January 2021.More than 450 workers from various opposition parties were booked in Lahore and other areas of Punjab province ahead of PDM’s first rally on Friday in Gujranwala city, some 80 km from Lahore.That rally will be followed by another on October 18 in Karachi. Marches will also be held in Quetta on October 25, Peshawar on November 22, Multan on November 30 and in Lahore on December 13.The Opposition leaders announced they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek the resignation of Imran Khan, whom they dubbed “the selected” prime minister.The Opposition parties have accused the powerful army of rigging the 2018 elections that brought Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party to power. They are openly opposing the military’s interference in politics and elections for the first time in the recent history of the country.Those booked by the Punjab police on Thursday were mostly workers of PML-N and scores of PDM activists from different parts of the province. They were rounded up ostensibly under Covid-19 regulations.Police stations in Gujranwala, Mandi Bahuddin and Lahore registered cases against over 450 Opposition workers under sections 269 and 188 of Pakistan Penal Code, for holding a public gathering without observing Covid-19 standard operating procedures.Former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, who is London since November last year, tweeted that police should refrain from arresting the PDM leaders.“Police must NOT comply with Imran Niazi’s workers, raid their homes or hinder their travel to Gujranwala,” he said.Former premier and PDM leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the government’s panic over the first public meeting of Opposition has exposed its reality.“Blocking roads with containers, raiding corner meetings, arresting PDM workers across Punjab, won’t deter the spirits of the masses who have decided to rid the country of this selected and inept government.” He said, “People are starving and struggling to feed their families because of the unprecedented inflation and unemployment created by this government which is the most corrupt government in the history of Pakistan.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crackdown-arrest-warrant-against-pak-ex-prez-450-booked-before-massive-anti-govt-stir/story-5rk8SY2SvNZ9dNMpVxQcBN.html
15-10-2020||World||Herd immunity approach to Covid-19 is dangerous: Experts||A group of 80 researchers on Thursday warned that a so-called ‘herd immunity’ approach to managing Covid-19 by allowing immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence”.The warning is included in an open letter published by The Lancet and signed by international researchers with expertise spanning public health, epidemiology, medicine, paediatrics, sociology, virology, infectious disease, health systems, psychology, psychiatry, health policy, and mathematical modeling.The experts warn that natural infection-based herd immunity approaches risk impacting the workforce as a whole and overwhelming the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care. They note that it is still not understood who might suffer from ‘long Covid’. Herd immunity approaches place an unacceptable burden on healthcare workers, many of whom have died or experienced trauma as a result of having to practise disaster medicine, they added.“The evidence is very clear: controlling community spread of Covid-19 is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months,” the letter said.“We cannot afford distractions that undermine an effective response; it is essential that we act urgently based on the evidence.”“It is critical to act decisively and urgently. Effective measures that suppress and control transmission need to be implemented widely, and they must be supported by financial and social programmes that encourage community responses and address the inequities that have been amplified by the pandemic,” the open letter added.The experts acknowledged that ongoing restrictions have led to widespread demoralisation and diminishing trust among the public.In the face of a second wave of infection, there is renewed interest in herd immunity approaches, they noted, but added that any pandemic management strategy relying upon immunity from natural infections for Covid-19 is flawed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-approach-to-covid-19-is-dangerous-experts/story-PQnDUwNAWniHDQe5izEMxH.html
15-10-2020||World||Oxford experts develop five-minute Covid-19 test||Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed what is described as “an extremely rapid diagnostic test” for that detects and identifies viruses in less than five minutes, which could potentially aid testing at airports and help revive the airline, tourism and other sectors.The method, published on the preprint server MedRxiv, is able to differentiate with high accuracy SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Covid-19, from negative clinical samples, as well as from other common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and seasonal human coronaviruses.The university said on Thursday that working directly on throat swabs from Covid-19 patients, without the need for genome extraction, purification or amplification of the viruses, the method starts with the rapid labelling of virus particles in the sample with short fluorescent DNA strands. A microscope is then used to collect images of the sample, with each image containing hundreds of fluorescently-labelled viruses. Machine-learning software quickly and automatically identifies the virus present in the sample. The scientists hope to start product development in early 2021, and have an approved device available within six months of that time.This approach exploits the fact that distinct virus types have differences in their fluorescence labelling due to differences in their surface chemistry, size, and shape, the university saidThe test uses a convolutional neural network to classify microscopy images of single intact particles of different viruses.The scientists worked with clinical collaborators at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to validate the assay on Covid-19 patient samples, which were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR methods.Achilles Kapanidis of the Department of Physics said: “Unlike other technologies that detect a delayed antibody response or that require expensive, tedious and time-consuming sample preparation, our method quickly detects intact virus particles; meaning the assay is simple, extremely rapid, and cost-effective.”The researchers aim to develop an integrated device that will eventually be used for testing in sites such as businesses, music venues, airports to establish and safeguard Covid-19-free spaces, the university added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-experts-develop-five-minute-covid-19-test/story-Vd2kaGByYeJuyFUAhD9UqI.html
15-10-2020||World||China sees red after US appoints top official for Tibetan issues||China on Thursday accused the US of trying to destabilise Tibet hours after Washington appointed a senior official to oversee Tibetan affairs as it mounts pressure on Beijing on human rights issues. The US secretary of state Michael Pompeo on Wednesday named Robert Destro as the new special coordinator for Tibetan issues. The US remains concerned with China’s “repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” Pompeo said in statement. Reacting sharply, Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing will not allow foreign interference in its internal affairs. “Setting up of the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China’s internal affairs and destabilise Tibet,” said ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “China firmly opposes this (the interference) and has never recognised this,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing when asked to comment on the appointment. “People of ethnic groups in Tibet are part of the big family of Chinese nation. Since its peaceful liberation, Tibet enjoyed prosperous economic growth, harmonious civil society, and prosperous culture. People enjoyed solidarity and mutual assistance and improved livelihood. All people in Tibet enjoy their full religious freedoms and their rights are fully respected and guaranteed. We believe Tibet’s future will be better,” Zhao added.Zhao said the US should stop interfering in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibet or destabilising it. “China will take all necessary measures to uphold our interests,” he said.Meanwhile in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), top officials defended their labour practices in the remote region in the backdrop of growing concerns about rights abuses.According to a Bloomberg report from Lhasa, Tibet Governor Qi Zhala told a briefing on Thursday that forced labour transfer “does not exist,” maintaining that the local government was focused on “increasing the idle work force’s income through job-skills training.”Qi, who was speaking about poverty-alleviation efforts, maintained that the Tibetan government had provided travel subsidies for people to work in other regions, and that they were free to come and go at will.In September, a Reuters report had said that Beijing was pushing growing numbers of “Tibetan rural labourers off the land and into recently built military-style training centers where they are turned into factory workers, mirroring a program in the western Xinjiang region that rights groups have branded coercive labour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sees-red-after-us-appoints-top-official-for-tibetan-issues/story-BzaOK4YMtRjyAHTzF3946H.html
15-10-2020||World||Sanofi reports positive animal test results for potential Covid-19 vaccine||Clinical trials of an experimental vaccine against Covid-19 which is being developed by France’s Sanofi and U.S. biotech firm Translate Bio are on track to begin before the end of the year after positive results in tests on animals.Sanofi and Translate Bio said in a statement on Thursday that the results from pre-clinical trials showed two doses of the MRT5500 vaccine induced a “favourable” immune response in mice and monkeys.There is no internationally-approved vaccine to protect against Covid-19, which has killed more than 1 million people around the world and triggered economic chaos.More than 40 drugmakers and research groups are conducting human trials to develop vaccines, with seven which have progressed to the late stages of tests.The finding published on Thursday is similar to that released in August by Translate Bio, which at the time said it aimed to launch clinical trials in November.Sanofi and Translate Bio confirmed that a phase 1/2 trial on humans would begin in the fourth quarter to test for safety and to determine the dosage before a possible final Phase 3 trial.They did not provide a precise starting date.In mice, they said four dose levels had been assessed using a two-dose vaccination schedule, adding that the pre-clinical results were undergoing peer review for potential publication.“Two doses of MRT5500 induced neutralizing antibody levels significantly higher than those observed in Covid-19 patients,” the companies said.In non-human primates (NHPs), Sanofi said three dose levels had been evaluated with a similar two-dose approach.“The preclinical results we report in this paper demonstrate the ability of MRT5500 to elicit a favorable immune response in both mice and non-human primates,” Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive of Translate Bio, said.The vaccine candidate uses a technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) which instructs cells in the body to make specific coronavirus proteins that then produce an immune response.Several companies are also using this approach to develop a vaccine, including U.S. companies Moderna and Pfizer whose candidates have reached late-stage trials.Sanofi is also developing another Covid-19 vaccine candidate with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline and started a clinical trial in September, with the first results expected by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-reports-positive-animal-test-results-for-potential-covid-19-vaccine/story-jCPF8UGtONxRKvoVsvbTdP.html
15-10-2020||World||Covid-19: London on ‘high alert’ from Saturday after cases surge||London will move to ‘high alert’ from Saturday – the second of the three-tier system introduced by the Boris Johnson government earlier this week – as new Covid-19 cases surged across various boroughs of the British capital.“Things will get worse before they get better”, health secretary Matt Hancock said in the House of Commons, announcing new curbs in Essex, York and other areas.This means half of England’s population is now under local lockdowns.MPs and local leaders from Manchester were in intense talks with Downing Street over placing the Greater Manchester area in the highest Tier 3 level, which would mean closing pubs, restaurants and other venues, and other restrictions. Liverpool and some areas of Leicester are already under toughest curbs in Tier 3.Hancock said the pandemic has forced “some of the most difficult choices any government has to make in peacetime”.“We make these decisions with a heavy heart with the sole aim to steering our nation through troubled waters. Things will get worse before they get better but I know that there are brighter skies and calmer seas ahead.”Reiterating Labour’s call for another UK-wide lockdown, London mayor Sadiq Khan said it could save thousands of lives and drive the virus down to manageable levels: “We’re at a critical moment in our fight against Covid-19 in London. The virus is spreading rapidly in every corner of our city.”“We’ll soon reach an average of 100 cases per 100,000 people – with a significant number of boroughs already over that threshold. Hospital admissions are up. More patients are going into Intensive Care Units. And – sadly – the number of Londoners dying every day is increasing again.”As of Wednesday night, there were 19,724 new cases and 137 deaths across the UK in hospitals and care-homes. In London, there were 1722 new cases and 12 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-london-on-high-alert-from-saturday-after-cases-surge/story-NtKBmebjLN1rS4G6nsctuN.html
15-10-2020||World||Handwashing an effective tool to prevent Covid-19, other diseases: WHO||Ten months into the pandemic, handwashing with soap and other public health measures such as maintaining physical distance, practising cough etiquette and wearing a mask remain the best defense against coronavirus, the World Health Organisation said.Global Handwashing Day is observed on October 15 each year to raise awareness and highlight the importance of handwashing as an effective means of disease prevention. This year it marks a critical reminder for the world that this simple, cost-effective practice can save lives, WHO said.“Handwashing has always been one of the most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay. It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key cornerstones of Covid-19 prevention.“Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with Covid-19, hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives as we live through this pandemic and beyond to protect us from diseases,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the regional director of WHO South-East Asia Region.The world health body said with Covid-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect -- through contaminated objects or surfaces -- or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water is of critical importance.“To stop the spread of Covid-19, along with other Covid appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste. Handwashing after touching common surfaces such as doorknobs or handles, or after one comes back home from visiting a public place will keep ourselves and others around us safe,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/handwashing-an-effective-tool-to-prevent-covid-19-other-diseases-who/story-DICPZjlAGq103VM9g53ljN.html
15-10-2020||World||Will provide citizenship to 11 million people if voted to power, says Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to provide citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants if voted to power in the November 3 Presidential Elections.Biden identified this as one of his priorities in addition to beating the virus, rebuilding the economy, and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world.Responding to a question at a virtual fund raiser on Wednesday, Biden said there is a need to deal with what’s going on at the border. “We’re going to have to deal with the immigration crisis we have. I’m going to send the House and Senate an immigration bill that’s going to provide access to citizenship to 11 million people,” he said.According to the campaign, there were 37 attendees and the event was hosted by Jane Hartley, former US Ambassador to France and Monaco and current Chairman, Sesame Workshop; Blair Effron, Founder & Partner, Centerview Partners; Indian American Deven Parekh, Managing Director, Insight Partners; and Roger Altman, Founder & Senior Chairman, Evercore.When asked how he would envision his first 30 days in office in terms of both domestic and foreign policy, Biden said: “A lot more can go wrong between now and January 21, and I’m not being facetious. Four more years, we’re not going to have the country we have now”.“If the American people elect me, we’re going to have an enormous task in repairing the damage he’s done,” he added of Trump. “We have to be beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world,” Biden said.Biden said he would move quickly to implement his plan for dealing with the pandemic and reopening safely. The Democratic presidential candidate also made a note of the challenges facing “the so-called Z Generation, the very young.” “They’ve really gotten screwed since they got out of school,” Biden said. “The jobs aren’t there,” he added.“But guess what? They’re the most open, progressive and the brightest generation we’ve ever had,” he added. “And we have to embrace them. They know the change we need to make and how we need to be much more, much more integrated in everything we do,” he said. Biden was critical of the policies of President Donald Trump. “The rest of the world is wondering, what in the Lord’s name is happening? What we’re living through today is not normal,” he said.He reiterated his attacks on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting more than 215,000 Americans have died, and criticised the president for backing away from stimulus talks. “He didn’t walk away. He never was part of ‘em,” Biden said.“Three days later, after he said he was walking away, he said he’s coming back … One day, he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big … next day it’s too small. The longer he’s president, the more reckless he gets,” he added.While talking more broadly about the stakes of the election, Biden noted he just got off the phone with Warren Buffett.“We have to refuse to postpone what America has to do, the work we have to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity for God’s sake,” Biden said. “Just got off the phone with Warren Buffett and talking about how … we’re in a position, unlike we were 50, 70, 80 years ago, to lead the whole damn world in a way that no one else can. There’s no limit to America’s future. The only thing that’s going to tear America apart is America itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-provide-citizenship-to-11-million-people-if-voted-to-power-says-joe-biden/story-PKcry4zLzYoIZtqii8HFTK.html
15-10-2020||World||World facing new Bretton Woods moment: IMF MD||The world is experiencing a new Bretton Woods moment, facing the twin task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic today and building a better tomorrow, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday. “Today we face a new Bretton Woods moment. A pandemic that has already cost more than a million lives. An economic calamity that will make the world economy 4.4 per cent smaller this year and strip an estimated USD 11 trillion of output by next year. And untold human desperation in the face of huge disruption and rising poverty for the first time in decades,” she said, addressing the annual meeting of the IMF’s Board of Governors. “Once again, we face two massive tasks: to fight the crisis today and build a better tomorrow,” she said. She said what was true at Bretton Woods, where allies at the end of World War II gathered for a conference to create the institutions that would use economic cooperation to prevent future conflicts, remains true today. Prudent macroeconomic policies and strong institutions are critical for growth, jobs and improved living standards, she added. Strong medium-term frameworks for monetary, fiscal and financial policies, as well as reforms to boost trade, competitiveness and productivity can help create confidence for policy action now while building much-needed resilience for the future, remarked Georgieva. “We know what action must be taken right now. A durable economic recovery is only possible if we beat the pandemic. Health measures must remain a priority. I urge you to support production and distribution of effective therapies and vaccines to ensure that all countries have access,” Georgieva said. She also urged countries to continue support for workers and businesses until a durable exit from the health crisis. “We have seen global fiscal actions of USD 12 trillion. Major central banks have expanded balance sheets by USD 7.5 trillion. These synchronised measures have prevented the destructive macro financial feedback we saw in previous crises,” she said. “But almost all countries are still hurting, especially emerging market and developing economies. And while the global banking system entered the crisis with high capital and liquidity buffers, there is a weak tail of banks in many in emerging markets. We must take measures to prevent the build-up of financial risks over the medium term,” she said. The IMF expects 2021 debt levels to go up significantly – to around 125 per cent of GDP in advanced economies, 65 per cent of GDP in emerging markets; and 50 per cent of GDP in low-income countries, Georgieva further said. The fund is providing debt relief to its poorest members and, with the World Bank, they support extension by the G20 of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative. “Beyond this, where debt is unsustainable, it should be restructured without delay. We should move towards greater debt transparency and enhanced creditor coordination. I am encouraged by G-20 discussions on a Common framework for Sovereign Debt Resolution as well as on our call for improving the architecture for sovereign debt resolution, including private sector participation,” she said. Georgieva said that to reap the full benefits of sound economic policy, they must invest more in people. That means protecting the vulnerable. It also means boosting human and physical capital to underpin growth and resilience, she argued. “Just as the pandemic has shown that we can no longer ignore health precautions, we can no longer afford to ignore climate change...We focus on climate change because it is macrocritical, posing profound threats to growth and prosperity. It is also people critical and planet critical,” said the IMF MD. The IMF, she said, is working tirelessly to support a durable recovery, and a resilient future as countries adapt to structural transformations brought on by climate change, digital acceleration and the rise of the knowledge economy. Since the pandemic began, IMF has committed over USD 100 billion and still has substantial resources from its USD 1 trillion in lending capacity, she said. “We will continue to pay special attention to the urgent needs of emerging markets and low income countries especially small and fragile states, helping them to pay doctors and nurses and protect the most vulnerable people and parts of their economies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-facing-new-bretton-woods-moment-imf-md/story-kfxCJmQZqcn75GR2h7OvOP.html
15-10-2020||World||Russia says its third Covid-19 vaccine is ‘almost ready’||Russia announced its first vaccine Sputnik V in August becoming the first country to have come up with a Covid-19 vaccine. On October 14, the country approved a second Covid-19 vaccine. Reports said the country has claimed it has a third vaccine ready at Chumakov Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It is an inactivated vaccine, which once approved will take the country’s vaccine number to three, and this is likely to happen by December 2020, reports said. Russia at present is undergoing a second wave of Covid-19. On october 14, the country had 1,340,000 cases with an average daily increment rate of 1.1 per cent.Here is all you need to know about Russia’s vaccines:1. Russia is not doing large-scale trials of its vaccines and hence it has been able to announce two vaccines between August and September.2. The first vaccine is Sputnik V, an adenovirus vector-based vaccine. President Vladimir Putin’s daughter was inoculated with the vaccine.3. Post-registration clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine are going on involving 13,000 volunteers4. The second vaccine is EpiVacCorona, a synthetic vaccine based on peptides, which is being touted as safer than Sputnik V. It consists of short synthetic peptide fragments of virus proteins, which the immune system can use to identify and neutralise the virus. It should be pointed out that the peptide-based vaccine does not induce any reactogenic responses and is noted for its high level of safety.4. The clinical trials of the second vaccine involved 100 volunteers.5. The first batch of 60,000 vaccine doses of the second vaccine will be produced in the near future. Vektor Centre, which developed the second vaccine, will launch post-registration clinical trials in a number of Russian regions involving 40,000 volunteers. 6. The second vaccine will be tried on 150 people aged over 60 to check its efficacy among older population. 7. The third vaccine has received permission to conduct the first and second stages of clinical trials at medical facilities in Novosibirsk, St Petersburg and Kirov. During the first stage, 15 volunteers were inoculated with this vaccine on October 6. They have not reported any serious complications or side effects. 8. The second stage of the third vaccine will begin on October 19 on 285 volunteers. The clinical trials of this vaccine are expected to conclude by December.9. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova and Chief Sanitary Doctor Anna Popova have received the second vaccine to test its effectiveness. Both of them reported no side effects.10. India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories was denied permission to conduct clinical trial of Russia’s first vaccine Sputnik V in India as Russia tested the vaccine among a small group and Dr Reddy’s proposed a larger size for the trial. Dr Reddy’s has again submitted a proposal to the Drug Controller General of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-its-third-covid-19-vaccine-is-almost-ready/story-0XPH4M7MFtd4UOUFA7RmgP.html
15-10-2020||World||Amazon workers say Prime Day rush breaks virus safety vows||Amazon.com Inc. has recklessly reinstated dangerous warehouse productivity quotas despite telling a judge that it was suspending them during the pandemic, reported Bloomberg on Wednesday citing a court filing by its workers.“Amazon has not been honest and forthcoming,” employees at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, told the judge handling their lawsuit, which claims the company’s “oppressive and dangerous” policies violated public-nuisance laws and exacerbated Covid-19 hazards.While Amazon says worker safety is its top priority, employees at several facilities in different states claim their well-being takes a back seat to demands for fast shipping .In July, Amazon provided the court a message it had sent to employees and posted in bathrooms at the Staten Island facility, telling them they wouldn’t be disciplined for falling short of the company’s quota for how many tasks they complete each hour. Workers were also assured that time spent on safety measures like washing their hands wouldn’t be counted against them under Amazon’s “Time Off Task” policy, which restricts the number of unproductive minutes allowed in their day.The company also submitted a statement by a U.S. human resources director that the more permissive policy dated back to March, when due to Covid-19 the company “ceased providing productivity rate feedback to associates and imposing any discipline related to low productivity rates.” Workers said the July message was the first time they heard of any such change, and in response to it they withdrew their request for a preliminary injunction in their lawsuit.However, in their new filing, the plaintiffs allege that in the lead-up to “Prime Day,” Amazon’s self-created labour intensive annual promotional holiday that started Tuesday and ends Wednesday, the company has once again been hassling employees about productivity, and warning them that slowness could get them terminated.Prime Day has become the starting point of the holiday shopping season, which will look vastly different this year because pandemic wary shoppers will avoid big store sales typically used to lure crowds. About half of the shoppers plan to do most or all of their shopping on the web, according to a Harris Poll conducted with Bloomberg, a demand that will strain Amazon’s warehouses and delivery stations.Amazon has faced criticism as it has scrambled to remain open throughout the pandemic and hire enough people to meet surging demands. Its vast network of warehouses have become a lifeline for people looking to avoid stores, but workers risk getting infected and potentially bringing the disease home. Last week, the California Department of Industrial Relations fined Amazon $1,870 for failing to train workers at two southern California warehouses on how to reduce Covid-19 exposure.The company has said that it has updated more than 150 of its processes to protect its employees from labouring through the pandemic, by including measures such as: additional paid time off, cleaning, mask distribution, and social distancing, and is ramping up an in-house Covid-19 testing program.On October 1, Amazon disclosed that almost 20,000 of its U.S. employees have tested positive for Covid-19, but that their infection rate was lower than the general population’s. In legal filings, the company has denied wrongdoing, called the New York lawsuit an effort to “exploit the pandemic,” and said that under federal law the workers’ claims should be brought to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration rather than the court.Productivity quotas have been a long-running flashpoint at Amazon. Covid-19 concerns have inspired a wave of walkouts and demonstrations, beginning with one in March at the Staten Island warehouse.Plaintiff Derrick Palmer said that over the past month he and other Staten Island employees have repeatedly been notified by supervisors that production quotas were being reinstated as of October. “I said, ‘You know the pandemic is still going on?’” Palmer recalled in an interview.“It’s like business over safety” Palmer said. “I’m just kind of sad that they would resort to this, and throw all the safety measures out the window.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-workers-say-prime-day-rush-breaks-virus-safety-vows/story-M5KbOlXxDf6PWPBQSVy6bK.html

It was the first time China has offered debt to US-based investors who were most active in the longer-dated tranches of the transaction.US investors, primarily fund managers, were the largest buyers of the 30-year tranche, picking up 47% of the $500 million sold, according to the term-sheet.The rising tensions between Washington and Beijing did not deter US-based investors from participating in the deal, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.The person could not be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.“We did not see the geopolitical situation scaring people away,” he said.The deal was finalised on Wednesday as the stand-off between Washington and Beijing showed no signs of easing.The US State Department has submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add China’s Ant Group to a trade blacklist, according to two people familiar with the matter, before the financial technology firm is slated to go public in Shanghai and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-raises-6bn-as-us-investors-look-past-political-tensions/story-8HNR3FNYVOCxyZLnmBIRaI.html
15-10-2020||World||China defends controversial Tibet labour program, urges Tibetans against ‘overdoing religion’||Top officials in Chinese-administered Tibet on Thursday defended a vocational training program that some critics have called coercive, and urged Tibetans not to “overdo” religion, during a briefing with foreign journalists on a rare visit to the region.The transfer program, which involves government-set quotas for labourers and includes a focus on ideological training, has riled rights groups and Tibetan activists outside China, who say it is coercive - an assertion China rejects. The program, aimed at lifting skills and incomes, has involved about 15 percent of Tibet’s population of 3.51 million. China is embarked on a multi-year plan to eradicate deep poverty by the end of 2020.“There is no element of coercion,” Che Dhala, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in response to a question on whether nomads are forced to participate in the training programs, adding that people are trained in skills they want, such as driving or welding.Che also said that Tibetans should not “overdo” religious consumption, and should follow the country’s ruling Party for a “happy life”.Religion is a highly sensitive topic in Tibet, where the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, fled following a failed uprising against the Chinese administration in 1959.“As long as they work hard to get rich, listen to the party, follow the party, and get down to doing things, their future will be more beautiful,” Che said during the briefing, where officials outlined poverty alleviation efforts.“This kind of beautiful life needs to be achieved by correctly and rationally understanding religion. We hope that people will not overdo it, that is, religious consumption that exceeds the family’s capacity,” he said.By the end of 2019, all 628,000 registered poor living in Tibet had been lifted out of poverty and their average annual income had risen to 9,328 yuan ($1,388), local officials said on Thursday. That compares with an average monthly salary of 10,000 yuan in Beijing.Tibet is one of the most restricted and politically sensitive regions in the country, and foreign journalist visits are tightly controlled.    Asked about restrictions that bar foreigners from going to Tibet outside of government tours, Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said officials believed the region’s environment was too dangerous for foreigners to travel independently.($1 = 6.7206 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Yew Lun Tian; Writing by Cate Cadell; Editing by Tony Munroe and Ana Nicolaci da Costa)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-controversial-tibet-labour-program-urges-tibetans-against-overdoing-religion/story-hTeAEWHFnhNVWF1QfqqtkI.html
15-10-2020||World||Prez Xi Jinping pushes limits, not just with neighbours but at home too | Analysis||Chinese President Xi Jinping isn’t only flexing muscles with neighbours but has stepped up efforts to consolidate his leadership in the Communist Party that meets later this month. President Xi is expected to get the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) central committee to sign off on a new set of regulations that will let President Xi dictate the agenda for meetings of the party’s top panels.People familiar with the matter said this power appears to be a precursor to President Xi giving himself a huge promotion that would place him on par with communist China’s founding father Mao Zedong, the only leader in the party’s history to be designated as chairman. “President Xi Jinping’s actions to consolidate his power does suggest very clearly that he has decided to elevate himself,” a China watcher in New Delhi said.President Xi would be the first chairman of the party in 45 years if he goes through with it. Xi, like Mao Zedong, is already designated as the PLA commander-in-chief and the Middle Kingdom’s paramount leader. In October 2017, Xi was only the second Chinese leader after Mao to have had an eponymous ideology included in the party’s charter while in office. This year, he had the Xi Jinping Research Center for Diplomatic Thought opened.Also Read: From Mao to Xi, the changing Chinese positions on LadakhPresident Xi has been laying the groundwork to consolidate his control over China’s politics and the armed forces for years. As far back as 2016, according to one analysis, China’s commander-in-chief had ruthlessly purged 73 general-rank officers including 4-star generals and fast-tracked promotions to those loyal to him to ensure the PLA’s complete submission to him, not the party.Xi had also been able to induct 18 of the 25 Politburo members from his personal network by 2017, up from the 5 members he could count as his own in 2012 when the party’s 18th Congress was held. The 20th Congress is proposed to be held in June next year.That effort continues.Early this month, Xi Jinping continued to target Vice President Wang Qishan, placing the vice president’s close associate Dong Hong under investigation on suspicion of what was described as ‘disciplinary review and supervisory investigation’. Dong, according to articles in China’s state media, had worked closely with vice president Wang since the 1990s when their paths first crossed and was a senior disciplinary inspector under Wang when he was chief of China’s anti-corruption agency and powered Xi’s anti-corruption campaign during his first five-year term that often targeted rivals. A recent analysis in Asian Nikkei Review suggested that the equation between Xi and Wang could be up for a change.Dong Hong was the second close associate of vice president Wang to be implicated on October 2 after his high school friend and an ex-party member Ren Zhiqiang was handed an 18- year imprisonment. Ren Zhiqiang, the former chairman of state-owned real estate group Huayuan, was convicted for illegal gains totalling 112 million yuan ($16.5 million), a charge that was slapped on the 69-year-old after he called Xi Jinping “a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor” in March.Ren was promptly expelled from the communist party, investigated for a “serious disciplinary violation” and charged with offences such as using official funds on golf expenses and using office and residential spaces provided for free by businessmen. If Chairman Mao could purge his close associates such as Liu Shaoqi during cultural revolution, Comrade Xi is expected to follow his footsteps in pursuit of 2021 China Dream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-xi-jinping-aims-to-be-china-s-1st-party-chairman-in-45-yrs-steps-up-the-consolidation-analysis/story-AXITTmiBph5C4NwKCYSs1M.html
15-10-2020||World||French health minister among top leaders raided in Covid-19 probe||French police searched the homes of the former prime minister, the current and former health ministers and other top officials Thursday in an investigation into the government response to the global coronavirus pandemic.The Health Ministry confirmed the dawn searches, which included the offices of the current health minister Olivier Veran. They came a day after French President Emmanuel Macron announced curfews in the Paris region and eight other French metropolitan areas to deal with the rising toll of new infections.Covid-19 patients, doctors, prison personnel, police officers and others in France filed an unprecedented 90 complaints in recent months, notably over shortages of masks and other equipment.A special French court has ordered an investigation over the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.Among those whose homes were searched include former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Veran, his predecessor Agnes Buzyn, the head of the country’s national health service Jerome Salomon, and Sibeth Ndiaye, a former government spokeswoman. Veran’s office was searched as well.Salomon abruptly canceled an early-morning live interview on the national BFM-TV due to “personal reasons,” according to the network.Jean-Luc Reitzer, an opposition member of the French parliament who was hospitalized with a severe case of coronavirus, said he was shocked by the searches.“Do our citizens seriously believe that the shortages, which were real, were voluntary?” he told BFM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-health-minister-among-top-leaders-raided-in-covid-19-probe/story-ryBBpDuEN1HMdhbFeFqpcN.html

France has set a 9 p.m. curfew for many of its biggest cities as governments across the continent take increasingly tough action.New infections have surged across Europe over recent weeks as the fall kicks in, prompting authorities in many places to start reimposing restrictions that were relaxed over the summer. The Czech Republic, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, France and Britain are among the countries causing particular concern.While Germany, the European Union’s most populous nation, is still in comparatively good shape, alarm bells have started ringing there too. On Thursday, the country’s national disease control center reported 6,638 cases over 24 hours — exceeding the previous record of nearly 6,300 set in late March, although testing in the country of 83 million has expanded greatly since then.Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany’s 16 state governors agreed Wednesday night to tighten mask-wearing rules, make bars close early and limit the number of people who can gather in areas where coronavirus infection rates are high. Merkel, who stressed the importance of keeping contact-tracing efforts on track, said “We must stop this exponential rise, the quicker the better.”Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s national disease control center, said “we can still repress the spread, the exponential growth” of the virus. But officials made clear that more efforts may be necessary.“I think yesterday’s decisions are an important step, but they probably won’t be enough,” Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told ARD television. “So now it is up to the population that we don’t just look at ‘what am I allowed to do now,’ but basically we must do more and be more cautious than what the governors decided yesterday.”Merkel noted that neighbouring countries are having to take “very drastic measures.”This week has seen the Netherlands close bars and restaurants and the Czech Republic and Northern Ireland close down schools. The Czech Health Ministry said the country, with a population of over 10 million, confirmed 9,544 new cases on Wednesday — over 900 more than the previous record, set less than a week ago. The government says hospitals could reach full capacity by the end of October.On Wednesday night, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 18 million residents in nine regions, including Paris, will have a 9 p.m. curfew starting Saturday until December 1.“We won’t go to restaurants after 9 p.m. We won’t see friends. We won’t party, because that’s how to pass on the virus,” Macron said.Paris restaurant, cinema and theatre owners are fuming at the new curfew rules, which effectively shut down evening activities. Tighter local restrictions in northern England and Northern Ireland have prompted the same emotions from business owners there. But health authorities across Europe are expressing urging people to obey the new restrictions.One of Belgium’s main universities said it is moving to online education whenever possible. Ghent University said the measure will begin October 26 and the Dutch-speaking Free University of Brussels said it already prepared its staff and facilities to do likewise if necessary.Italy, which so far has been spared the worst of the second wave, on Wednesday also recorded its biggest single-day jump in infections since the start of the pandemic. It added another 7,332 cases amid a resurgence that is threatening to bring the country’s contact-tracing system to its knees — topping a record set in late March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/restrictions-back-in-europe-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-FRMEGFkYq7L1MAKndyqNvO.html
15-10-2020||World||Japan Coast Guard testing unmanned aircraft to contain Chinese aggression||Days after two Chinese patrol ships illegally entered into Japan’s territorial waters off Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, Japan Coast Guard began test flights of an unmanned aerial vehicle SeaGuardian to learn whether it can be utilised to carry out the coast guard’s key duties, including search and rescue and maritime surveillance.The flights, starting on Thursday, will be conducted off the coast of Sanriku in northeastern Japan, as well as along the coasts of the Sea of Japan. The tests will involve the use of the 12-meter-long, 24-meter-wide UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) developed by US defence firm General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, reported NHK World.The aircraft will be based at the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Hachinohe base in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan and will either engage in pre-programmed flights or be remotely piloted from a ground control station.The SeaGuardian is equipped with radars and high-definition cameras and is capable of flying for more than 24 hours nonstop. Hence, it will cover the outermost exclusive economic zone of Japan. It will test the real-time ending of data and images to the ground and the safety of the vehicle.The coast guard is eager to step up its capabilities by considering the introduction of the UAV. It currently conducts search and rescue as well as maritime surveillance with 33 aircraft and 52 helicopters. The validation flights are scheduled to take place till November 10 at a cost of over 8.5 million dollars, reported NHK World.Earlier, Japan on Wednesday had unveiled its newest submarine with the aim to boost the country’s maritime security amid China’s growing aggression in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-coast-guard-testing-unmanned-aircraft-to-contain-chinese-aggression/story-kLtToiArx1YwCJLb2inxaO.html

15-10-2020||World||Spain pushes back on German concerns over handling of coronavirus outbreak||The coronavirus is “under control” in Spain and German government concerns about the scale of Spain’s recession aren’t justified, Foreign Affairs Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said.The government is focused on slowing the rate of infections while protecting the economy and tensions between the national administration and Madrid region are a consequence of the country’s decentralized system, Laya said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday.Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has been locked in an increasingly bitter struggle with the center-right government of Madrid which has been resisting restrictions in the Spanish capital, the epicenter of a fresh wave of infections. German government officials have privately voiced concern that the economic hit from the virus in Spain -- the most severe in Europe -- could have a knock-on effect for other member states.Read More: Spain’s Toxic Politics, Health Woes Have Got Merkel Worried“I don’t think this is fair,” Laya said.“What’s happening in Spain is not unlike what happens in the laender in Germany,” she added. “When the central government tells the regions they need to take tough measures, some of them are not happy about that and want to pass the buck onto the federal government.”Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to persuade German state leaders to take more decisive action to stop the contagion and voiced her frustration after eight hours of talks on Wednesday produced only limited measures.Sanchez declared a state of emergency in Madrid last week to force the regional government to impose restrictions on movement. Spain has registered 300,000 new cases over the past month bringing the total number of infections to almost a million and more than 3,000 people have died during that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-pushes-back-on-german-concerns-over-handling-of-coronavirus-outbreak/story-bg47nfUtmdECFMYR72hDeM.html
15-10-2020||World||Thailand declares emergency after major student-led protest in Bangkok||Thai authorities declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after a student-led protest against the country’s traditional establishment saw an extraordinary moment in which demonstrators heckled a royal motorcade.After the pre-dawn declaration, riot police moved in to clear out demonstrators who after a day of rallies and confrontation had gathered outside Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s office to push their demands, which include the former general’s stepping down, constitutional changes and reform of the monarchy.Several top leaders of the protest movement were taken into custody, with one later declaring on his Facebook page that he had been denied access to a lawyer and was being forced onto a helicopter and taken to a city in the country’s north. Police said they had made 22 arrests.The text of the emergency declaration said it was needed because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”The protest Wednesday in Bangkok’s historic district, not far from glittering temples and royal palaces, was the third major gathering by student-led activists who have been pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable — and legal — language by publicly questioning the role of Thailand’s monarchy in the nation’s power structure.Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key member of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.The protest — held on the anniversary of a 1973 student-led uprising against a military dictatorship — was complicated by the presence of royalist counter protesters who had gathered both to show support for the government and to greet the royal family as they traveled to and from a religious ceremony in the area.That led to a moment captured in photos and video that circulated widely on social media in which what appeared to be protesters gestured and shouted just meters (feet) from the royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.Some experts say a line may have been crossed.“What seemed to be a low-boil stalemate that the Prayuth government was managing with reasonable success has now, following the incident involving the procession of the queen’s motorcade down a street in which an active protest was under way and the arrests of protest leaders, become a full-blown crisis,” said Michael Montesano, coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Isak Institute in Singapore. “Unlike even 48 hours ago, the country is in dangerous territory now.”Government spokesman Anucha Buraphachaisri announced Thursday morning that the prime minister had ordered police to take strict action against those who obstruct a royal procession or otherwise insult the monarchy.Keeping order will be facilitated by the new emergency decree for Bangkok, which bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people and gives authorities other powers they deem needed to prevent unrest, including detaining people at length without charge. It also outlaws the news that distorts information or could cause a “misunderstanding.”Thailand is already under a national state of emergency as part of its efforts to fight the coronavirus, and it was not immediately clear how the new decree was different.One change is that police said they will install checkpoints around Bangkok for security purposes.Protesters were undaunted and said they would gather again in a Bangkok shopping district Thursday afternoon.Deputy police spokesman Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen warned that calling for such a protest or attending one was against the law.“You cannot say that they are not aware of the order. We are making it clear,” Kissana said at a news conferenceHuman rights group Amnesty International criticized the crackdown. Its deputy regional director Ming Yu Hah urged Thai authorities to “engage in constructive dialogue with the protesters.”“The scale of today’s early morning arrests seems completely unjustified based on yesterday’s events. The assemblies were overwhelmingly peaceful. These moves are clearly designed to stamp out dissent, and sow fear in anyone who sympathizes with the protesters’ views,” the group said in a statement.The protest movement was launched in March by university students, but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and since grown in size.The movement’s original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The movement took another stunning turn in August, when students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and issued calls for its reform. Airing their grievances in direct language normally expressed in whispers, the speakers criticized the king’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany, not Thailand.Conservative royalist Thais accuse the protest movement of seeking to end the monarchy, an allegation its leaders deny.Nevertheless, analysts say the incident with the royal motorcade may harden positions.It “is not just unprecedented but will be shocking for many,” said Kevin Hewison, professor emeritus from the University of North Carolina and veteran Thai studies scholar. “Yet it is reflective of how a new generation of protesters sees the monarchy and military-backed regime as intertwined and that political reform demands reform of the monarchy as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-declares-emergency-after-major-student-led-protest-in-bangkok/story-9t6ddGJjpNHJY8nvoy19gL.html
15-10-2020||World||UN rights official calls for lifting North Korea sanctions citing Covid-19 pandemic||A UN human rights official has called on the international community to urgently consider lifting sanctions on North Korea that may be worsening problems from its coronavirus lockdown, according to a draft report released on Thursday.North Korea, which has not reported any confirmed infections, has been subjected to UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, with ever tighter measures imposed in recent years.It imposed strict border controls this year among tough measures against the virus, just when it was reeling from sanctions, as well as “systemic economic problems and unusually bad weather conditions,” Tomas Ojea Quintana wrote. While the North’s strictures aim to protect its people’s rights to life and health, the severe lockdowns have had a “devastating” effect on trade, added Quintana, who is the United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea.The fallout on trade, in turn, threatens food supplies and access to humanitarian aid, he said in the report, which is to be submitted next week to the UN General Assembly.“Under the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Special Rapporteur believes that the international responsibility for re-evaluating the sanctions regime is more urgent than ever,” he concluded.Greater implementation of sanctions has started to “seriously affect the entire economy of the country,” with adverse consequences for people’s economic and social rights, he added.North Korea’s dire human rights situation also stands to be exacerbated by the pandemic, through increased surveillance and control of its population and reduced contact with the rest of the world, Quintana said.The recent shooting of a South Korean fisheries official by North Korean border troops appeared to be an unlawful and arbitrary killing of a civilian, in violation of international human rights law, he said in the report.He called for Pyongyang to provide more details of the case, while holding to account those responsible, compensating the man’s family, and preventing similar incidents in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-official-calls-for-lifting-north-korea-sanctions-citing-covid-19-pandemic/story-AV9KX4iqMbBw8jaEVUsRTI.html
15-10-2020||World||President of Kyrgyzstan steps down amid election turmoil||Kyrgyzstan President Sooronbai Jeenbekov announced his resignation on Thursday in a bid to end the turmoil that has engulfed the Central Asian nation after a disputed parliamentary election.In a statement released by his office, Jeenbekov, who has faced calls to step down from protesters and political opponents, said holding on to power wasn’t “worth the integrity of our country and agreement in society.”“For me, peace in Kyrgyzstan, the country’s integrity, the unity of our people and calm in the society are above all else,” Jeenbekov said.Kyrgyzstan, a country of 6.5 million people located on the border with China, was plunged into chaos following an Oct. 4 vote that election officials say was swept by pro-government parties. The opposition said the election was tainted by vote-buying and other irregularities.Protesters then took over government buildings, looting some offices and the Central Election Commission nullified the election. Opposition then announced plans to oust Jeenbekov and form a new government.The announcement Thursday came just a day after Jeenbekov dismissed a demand to step down from the country’s new prime minister, saying he would stay on the job until the political situation in the Central Asian country stabilizes.The president had insisted earlier that stepping down could trigger “unpredictable developments to the detriment of the state,” his office said. It emphasized that he will only agree to resign after “he takes the country back into the legal field, after holding parliamentary and calling presidential elections.”Hundreds of people rallied in the capital Bishkek on Wednesday, demanding his resignation, and the protests continued Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-of-kyrgyzstan-steps-down-amid-election-turmoil/story-9J8BqMAZCYR3imect27SjI.html
15-10-2020||World||Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine trial remains on track, says CEO||Side effects that have emerged in a large late-stage trial of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE are in line with those seen in smaller early studies, a positive sign for one of the front-runners in the race for a shot.The partners haven’t had to stop their late-stage study over safety concerns, BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said in an interview. They’re sticking with their previously announced target of being able to provide preliminary data on whether the vaccine works as soon as this month, if a threshold for infections is reached; if so, any submissions for regulatory approval would come later.That would put Pfizer and BioNTech on track to potentially be the first to show the efficacy of a Covid-19 vaccine, in an environment of intense scrutiny over every possible complication. This week, Eli Lilly & Co. and Johnson & Johnson both said they had to pause research on potential therapies or shots because of safety concerns. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has touted unproven treatments and pushed for more rapid regulatory review.The pauses in other studies show “there is no room for ignoring facts,” Sahin said. “If there is a concern, the process stops. No one closes their eyes, and it should give people confidence that if a vaccine survives the development process and is approved, it should be regarded as safe.”Pfizer and BioNTech chose their candidate from a slate of four contenders, all of which relied on messenger RNA technology designed to teach the body’s cells to become vaccine factories in their own right.In what Sahin said is an unusual step, Pfizer and BioNTech published some of the data they used to narrow the field in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. The results show that people who took the experimental shot they chose had fewer so-called systemic side effects -- things like fever, chills and fatigue -- than those who got another jab in the partners’ portfolio.Because of the structure of the trial, BioNTech and Pfizer had first disclosed early results for another vaccine candidate, BNT162b1, in July. Investors were already optimistic about prospects for it, but after comparing data the companies decided instead to pursue another candidate, BNT162b2, Sahin said. That one performed as well in elderly people in the study as it did in young participants, he said, an important consideration for a coronavirus vaccine.Similar EffectsWith just 195 participants, the early study was too small to show the real safety implications of the experimental shot. Still, the side effects that have emerged so far in the 44,000-person late-stage trial are similar to those seen in these early studies, Sahin said.Safety is a key factor for any potential vaccine because the shots will be given widely to healthy people. The Food and Drug Administration has said it will require two months of safety data before reviewing any application for emergency authorization for a vaccine.Collecting the extra safety data probably won’t cause much of a delay once readout on the vaccine’s effectiveness is available, Sahin said.“Waiting another couple of weeks to complete the safety data should not be a concern,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-trial-remains-on-track-says-ceo/story-LUmVmcnTgEyo5h35XHXo3O.html
15-10-2020||World||‘They just took everything’: Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai on police raids||Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai said police raided his private offices earlier on Thursday, months after he was arrested on suspicion of violating the city’s national security law.Lai said police did not wait for his lawyers to arrive at his office and took away documents. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“They just wanted to get something to go against me,” Lai said outside a court, where he went for a hearing over unlawful assembly charges related to this year’s June 4 commemoration of China’s bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.“That’s not rule of law,” Lai said. “They just took everything.”Lai’s aide Mark Simon said on Twitter police did not leave any names or contacts for the 14 officers who searched the office.Lai was arrested in August on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple Daily anti-government tabloid, published by Next Digital Ltd. Police later also searched his yacht.He has not been charged.Lai had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor”.The security law was introduced on June 30 and punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.

15-10-2020||World||London readies for tightening of Covid-19 curbs as city inches towards average of 100 cases per 100,000 people||London is on course for an imminent tightening of coronavirus restrictions, as cases continue to rise in Britain and its response fragments.A change in the rules in the UK capital is likely in very short order, according to an official in London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s office. Khan and health leaders met Wednesday to discuss the potential move into stricter restrictions, which would ban two separate households from meeting indoors, the official said. London will soon hit an average of 100 cases per 100,000 people, the person said.The move by London would follow stricter measures taken by Northern Ireland and Wales to combat the virus. Northern Ireland is planning to close schools from Monday and impose new curbs on pubs and restaurants, while Wales wants to restrict travel from English hot spots, with new regulations coming into force Friday.Ministers and officials will brief MPs from northern England on Thursday morning on proposals for further curbs across large parts of the region, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock will update MPs in the House of Commons at about 11:30 a.m.The government has earmarked Greater Manchester for stricter restrictions, but has been locked in talks with local leaders over financial support for businesses and individuals affected by any new curbs.Growing angerThere was anger from all sides that people in the area had not been kept fully informed of the plans.“It is frustrating to keep learning of these developments from second-hand sources, alongside the speculation and hearsay,” William Wragg, the Tory MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, said on Twitter. “Says it all really,” he wrote, after discovering he had not been invited to a meeting of the region’s MPs.Britain’s increasingly fractured coronavirus picture comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson resists calls for a “circuit-breaker” national lockdown and continues to pursue a localized approach. He is trying to balance reducing virus transmission with keeping as much of the economy open as possible. He set out a three-tiered system of regional Covid alert levels this week to try to simplify the imposition of social-distancing measures.In England, the Liverpool region is currently the only area under the toughest rules in Johnson’s new three-tier system -- with any pubs not serving food forced to close. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who was briefed by government medical adviser Jonathan Van Tam on Wednesday evening, says he wants more support before agreeing to additional restrictions.New CurbsBusiness Minister Nadhim Zahawi appeared to confirm that new restrictions will be imposed in an interview with Sky News, before backtracking to say there needs to be agreement from local authorities.The meeting with MPs will be so “they can hear from the chief medical officer as to why we’re having to take this action,” Zahawi said. When pressed on whether that meant it was a foregone conclusion, he said “they need to see the data and of course that decision will be made jointly with local leaders.”Johnson is determined to avoid a national lockdown and pushed back against a proposal by Keir Starmer, leader of the oppisition Labour Party, for a two-to-three week “circuit breaker” to stem the spread of the disease.“Let’s try to avoid the misery of another national lockdown,” Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I rule out nothing, of course, in combating the virus, but we are going to do it with the local, the regional approach that can drive down and will drive down the virus if it is properly implemented.”On Wednesday, the UK recorded 137 Covid-19 deaths, down marginally on Tuesday’s 143, which was the highest daily death toll since June. New cases rose by 19,724, compared to 17,234 the day before. Scientists warn numbers will continue to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-readies-for-tightening-of-covid-19-curbs-as-city-inches-towards-average-of-100-cases-per-100-000-people/story-I5bZbFifmW0tu7DnTR8OlM.html

Further details, including the launch date, will be fleshed out in coming weeks, they said. “It is a safe, careful but significant step forward to revive air travel, and provide a model for future collaboration with other parts of the world,” Singapore’s Ong said.For Hong Kong, which has banned non-residents since March, the deal with Singapore is its first resumption of travel ties with another city. Travellers from mainland China and neighbouring Macau still face 14 days in quarantine.Singapore has already announced pacts on essential business and official travel from China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and opened unilaterally to general visitors from Brunei, New Zealand, Vietnam and most of Australia.This week, Singapore eased quarantine to just seven days for travellers from Hong Kong, from 14 earlier. It has put the city on its list of low-risk places.International travel in Asia has collapsed during the pandemic because of border closures, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines says.Following the news, shares in Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific surged more than 7 percent in afternoon trade. Hong Kong’s daily coronavirus infections have dropped mostly into single digits since August and it has eased some social distancing curbs. Singapore has similarly seen its daily cases fall below 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-singapore-announce-plans-for-travel-bubble/story-oz2Y1FJIKwa5TpWaMEqAmJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Biden assures immigration bill to provide citizenship access to 11mn people||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to provide citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants if voted to power in the November 3 presidential elections.Biden identified this as one of his priorities in addition to beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world.Responding to a question at a virtual fund raiser on Wednesday, Biden said there is a need to deal with what’s going on at the border. “We’re going to have to deal with the immigration crisis we have. I’m going to send the House and Senate an immigration bill that’s going to provide access to citizenship to 11 million people,” he said.According to the campaign, there were 37 attendees and the event was hosted by Jane Hartley, former US Ambassador to France and Monaco and current Chairman, Sesame Workshop; Blair Effron, Founder & Partner, Centerview Partners; Indian American Deven Parekh, Managing Director, Insight Partners and Roger Altman, Founder & Senior Chairman, Evercore.When asked how he would envision his first 30 days in office in terms of both domestic and foreign policy, Biden said: “A lot more can go wrong between now and January 21, and I’m not being facetious. Four more years, we’re not going to have the country we have now”.“If the American people elect me, we’re going to have an enormous task in repairing the damage he’s done,” he added of Trump. “We have to be beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world,” Biden said.Biden said he would move to quickly implement his plan to deal with the pandemic and reopen safely. The Democratic presidential candidate also made a note of the challenges facing “the so-called Z Generation, the very young.” “They’ve really gotten screwed since they got out of school,” Biden said. “The jobs aren’t there,” he said.“But guess what? They’re the most open, progressive and the brightest generation we’ve ever had,” he added. “And we have to embrace them. They know the change we need to make and how we need to be much more, much more integrated in everything we do,” he said. Biden was critical of the policies of President Donald Trump. “The rest of the world is wondering, what in the Lord’s name is happening? What we’re living through today is not normal,” he said.He reiterated his attacks on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting more than 215,000 Americans have died, and criticised the president for backing away from stimulus talks. “He didn’t walk away. He never was part of ‘em,” Biden said.“Three days later, after he said he was walking away, he said he’s coming back … One day, he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big … next day it’s too small. The longer he’s president, the more reckless he gets,” he added.While talking more broadly about the stakes of the election, Biden noted he just got off the phone with Warren Buffett.“We have to refuse to postpone what America has to do, the work we have to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity for God’s sake,” Biden said. “Just got off the phone with Warren Buffett and talking about how … we’re in a position, unlike we were 50, 70, 80 years ago, to lead the whole damn world in a way that no one else can. There’s no limit to America’s future. The only thing that’s going to tear America apart is America itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-assures-immigration-bill-to-provide-citizenship-access-to-11mn-people/story-GqSiOBy44SWBnKchwq4EYJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Production hurdles hurt Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine targets||Russia is going to miss its target of making 30 million doses of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine this year due to setbacks maintaining the serum’s stability while expanding production.“The main task is to scale up production,” Industry Minister Denis Manturov said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “To have 30 million doses by year-end is impossible, it is nonsense.”The Kremlin has pinned great hopes on the Sputnik V vaccine, which President Vladimir Putin promotes as the first registered inoculation in the world, to help establish Russia as a leader in the race to subdue the global coronavirus pandemic. The vaccine’s name is a nod to the world’s first artificial satellite that was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.The vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, the Defense Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, was approved for public use despite the fact that it is currently undergoing Phase 3 trials to determine if it is safe and effective.RDIF chief Kirill Dmitriev said in July the fund is aiming to produce 30 million doses this year.With a second wave of coronavirus cases sweeping Russia, the Kremlin needs the vaccine as it battles rising daily infection rates while seeking to avoid a repeat of a nationwide lockdown in the spring that battered the country’s economy. Russia has had more than 1.3 million infections, the fourth highest globally after the US, India and Brazil, and added a record 14,231 new cases Wednesday.RDIF says more than 50 countries have expressed interest in Sputnik V, with orders for 1.2 billion doses.However, ramping up production of the inoculation is proving more difficult than anticipated. Manturov said Russia will have made 40,000 doses by the end of this month, with the maximum possible by the New Year 2.3 million. Monthly output could exceed 10 million doses early next year, he said.“We believe these are very conservative projections and see the potential to produce 10 million doses of vaccines in December,” a spokesman for RDIF said. “Also, a significant part of production will be in India, China, Korea, Brazil and other countries.”Putin said at a government meeting Wednesday that foreign countries should be responsible for handling their own production even as Russia promotes its Covid-19 vaccines abroad. He also announced the approval of another vaccine ahead of final-stage trials.Manturov stood by Sputnik V, which has been questioned by international medical professionals who claim it needs more testing to prove it’s safe and provides immunity against the virus. Manturov said he and members of his family, including his 84-year-old mother, have received the shots.Putin has not received the vaccine, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/production-hurdles-hurt-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-targets/story-eotVJVx7jluutGOULlqPDJ.html

Interestingly, the WHO Director-General tweeted in Hindi. Earlier, in a video message, the Director-General urged the countries to opt for “case finding, isolation, testing, compassionate care, contact tracing, quarantine, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks, respiratory etiquette, ventilation, avoiding crowds and more” instead of herd immunity.Informing about the herd immunity, he said, “There has been some discussion recently about the concept of reaching so-called “herd immunity” by letting the virus spread. Herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95 per cent of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5 per cent will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. In other words, herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not exposing them to it.”He further said, “Allowing a dangerous virus that we don’t fully understand to run free is simply unethical. It’s not an option. But we do have many options. WHO recommends case finding, isolation, testing, compassionate care, contact tracing, quarantine, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks, respiratory etiquette, ventilation, avoiding crowds and more. This is what countries are proving works, every day.”According to the latest update by the Johns Hopkins University, 38,441,934 people globally have till now tested positive for coronavirus and 1,091,439 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-s-ghebreyesus-urges-leaders-to-protect-the-vulnerable-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-wVjXRg6W9VrTVJ2kzFf1ZM.html

The storms had paralysed the transportation system and destroyed thousands of houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-visits-sites-for-rebuilding-towns-hit-by-typhoons-floods/story-KCH9tTaOed4ms9izIdBq4M.html
15-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Canadian universities likely to lose billions of dollars in revenue due to travel curbs||With Canada’s data agency warning that the country’s universities could lose billions of dollars in revenue after pandemic-related travel curbs led to a fall in the enrollment of international students, those from India securing study permits this year have shown a sharp drop of over 50% compared to 2019.Indian students in Canada comprised the largest bloc of international scholars in the country - with 219,855, a record number - as of 2019 end, according to official data. The number of Indian students who were issued valid study permits grew in the first quarter of 2020, going up from 13,965 to 16,105. After that, the Covid-19 outbreak began, and the number plummeted from 27,395 in the second quarter of 2019 to 16,250 in 2020. The precipitous drop was even more in evident in the third quarter when the real rush begins as the new academic year commences in September. In 2019, 58,565 Indians students held the permits, while between July and August this year, the total number was only 15,700. Overall, the first eight months of 2019 had logged 99,925 for Indian students, while this year, the comparative figure is at 47,220 - a decline of over 50%.The surge of Indian students going to Canadian institutions of higher education began in 2017, as they overtook the Chinese for the first time to become the largest segment, with 82,955 permits. That increased to 107,085 in 2018 and further to 138,930 last year, according to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).This trend has led the country’s data agency, Statistics Canada or StatCan, to forecast a drop in earnings for universities this year. It said in a report, “It is estimated that international students paid almost 40% of all tuition fees and accounted for almost $4 billion in annual revenue for Canadian universities in 2017-2018.” Such students, including those from India, paid tuition fees that were almost five times the average for domestic students, which was $6,610.“The number of student permits issued from June to August in 2020 fell by over half (-58%) compared with 2019,” StatCan noted in a statement. It estimated that “depending on the size of the reduction in international student enrollments and the subsequent loss in tuition fees (unadjusted for inflation)”, Canadian universities could possibly “lose between $377 million (0.8% of projected revenues) and $3.4 billion (7.5% of projected revenues) in 2020-2021”.Indian students are estimated to have added between $6 billion and $10 billion to the Canadian economy in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canadian-universities-likely-to-lose-billions-of-dollars-in-revenue-due-to-travel-curbs/story-EtOxv7If8ttCxSfWxJpZMP.html
15-10-2020||World||In China’s Qingdao, two officials punished for latest Covid-19 case outbreak||The Chinese city of Qingdao said on Thursday it had suspended its health commission head and sacked a hospital director following an outbreak of coronavirus infections that ended China’s run of about two months without reporting a local case.The coastal city has reported 13 recent infections, most of them linked to the Qingdao Chest Hospital, where infected travellers arriving from overseas had been treated in an isolation area.One of the cases involved a dock worker who had earlier tested positive for the virus but only developed symptoms after about 20 days, the city said.Qingdao announced this week that it would test all of its 9 million residents for the virus over a five-day period. More than 7 million results had come back as of Thursday morning, with no infections beyond those reported, it said.The novel coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.After early missteps, China has taken aggressive measures to curb its spread, including mass testing campaigns when clusters appear, and has managed to nearly stamp out domestic transmission.The total number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in mainland China stands at 85,622, with 4,634 deaths.

15-10-2020||World||Only 28% companies prepared to deliver Covid-19 vaccines, survey shows||The medical industry’s dash to produce the world’s first coronavirus vaccines in just a few months is heightening the urgency for the workhorses of global trade to be ready for the historic charge to defeat the disease.Only 28% of companies involved in supply-chain logistics feel well prepared to handle Covid-19 vaccines and 19% characterized their readiness as very unprepared, according to a survey released Wednesday that showed a wide swath between optimists and pessimists. The poll, conducted in mid-September by the International Air Cargo Association and Pharma Aero, is part of an effort to coordinate widespread delivery of the immunizations.Just over half of 181 respondents already have the vehicles, containers and the connections needed to move hundreds of millions of vials in a constant deep-freeze. Almost a quarter said they’re still trying to procure such equipment, the survey of airlines, freight forwarders, airport operators and ground handlers showed.The preparedness of those responsible for moving the medicine from manufacturing sites to health clinics worldwide is paramount because the doses, once in transit, must stay ultra-cold as they traverse a world economy where supply chains are already at capacity. The industry is also trying to avoid bidding wars, shortages and every-country-for-itself attitudes that sparked a stampede for personal protective equipment in the initial months of the pandemic.“This is the greatest challenge that the logistics industry is facing today or maybe ever,” said Emir Pineda, manager of aviation trade and logistics at Miami International Airport and a board member of the association, known as Tiaca. “The supply chain is made up of many links and if one of those links breaks, then we’re going to have an issue.”With little precision about when drug makers will produce enough vaccines for mass distribution, logistics estimates are hard to come by and inherently unreliable. Pineda said that the Covid-19 vaccine rollout alone may generate 65,000 tons of air freight, more than four times the amount of vaccines transported in 2019 and enough to fill 930 Boeing Co. 747 freighters.Different BallgameThe drug industry has been transporting vaccines for many years without much fanfare, so the expertise exists. But the magnitude and complexity of this effort will require much more coordination between private industry, customs officials, governments and non-governmental organizations.“Before Covid-19, it was 100% scalable: We knew how many flus there were in the world, we know how many cases of meningitis there were,” said Frank Van Gelder, secretary-general of Pharma.Aero. “But suddenly you have a pandemic, which captures the entire global population and then you start to play a different ballgame.”Such a large airlift would be difficult in normal times. The task looks especially daunting on top of the sustained, solid demand for online merchandise and basic necessities like groceries that are already filling cargo planes and container ships. The cost of air freight is up about 50% from a year ago, and seaborne shipping-container rates have tripled since the start of the year.Meanwhile, transport companies have starting mapping out where the bulk of the vaccines will be produced -- in places like Illinois, North Carolina and the Northeast in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland and Germany in Europe, and in Asia’s pharma hubs in India and China.While companies like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. are investing in freezer space, there’s still concern about addressing “the last mile” of distribution, particularly in remote and often impoverished regions hard to reach with extreme refrigeration -- anywhere from -20 to -80 degrees Celsius (-4 to -12 degrees Fahrenheit) that will be required.Along parts of the vaccines’ journey, there will be electricity available for refrigeration and battery-powered coolers. On other legs, though, the survival of the doses will depend on dry ice packed in boxes, raising a range of risks including premature thawing to safety questions for handlers because of the fumes emitted when it sublimates.The complexity of the mission could exert strains on the logistics industry so great that it may require military might, through authorities like the U.S.’s Civil Reserve Air Fleet, a program established in 1951 after the Berlin airlift that lets the Pentagon use commercial aircraft for national-security reasons.Cold Corridor“It’s an iPhone 12 launch on steroids,” said Neel Jones Shah, global head of air carrier relationships at San Francisco-based freight forwarder Flexport and a Tiaca director. “I would still say that the confidence in our state of readiness is maybe a 6.5 out of 10.”That cautious optimism may grow as more companies step in to help. Among the leaders in cold-chain refrigeration is Thermo King, part of Trane Technologies Plc, a Dublin-based maker of industrial equipment. It’s positioning its line of units for each step of the cold corridor that the logistics industry is trying to establish.“We’re trying to make all our capacity available,” Francesco Incalza, the head of Thermo King’s business in Europe. “When I hear, for instance, that there is not enough capacity in the supply chain to move 8 billion doses of vaccine -- if you get organized, there is capacity.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-28-companies-prepared-to-deliver-covid-19-vaccines-survey-shows/story-YpZG1rIlqGnDSPABEQZqZO.html

She is also chair of the Sikh Police Association.The QPM will be handed over to Atwal in the coming months.During her 24-year career, the police force said she has worked in 18 areas of policing - including neighbourhood policing, youth offending, operational planning, intelligence gathering, and counterterrorism. She is also a trained hostage and crisis negotiator.Until July 2019, Atwal spent more than two years as the Commander of the City Neighbourhood Policing Area before taking up roles working with partners to help tackle and prevent serious violent crime. Atwal’s force said she has been highlighted as an “exemplary advocate for those under-represented in policing”, providing coaching to a number of officers through promotion and personal development programmes.After being named in the royal honours list, she said, “It is such an honour and I feel truly grateful to have even been nominated, especially when I think of all the amazing people who deserve recognition for the incredible work they do.”Atwal added, “It sounds like a cliché, but policing was something I’d always wanted to do from a young age growing up in Derbyshire. I’d seen a female Asian officer working in the city centre and I thought: ‘I’d like to do that’.”Simon Cole, chief constable of the police force, said, “Manjit has led the way on so many policing issues and has been instrumental in working with local communities, especially through our Sikh Police Association. She really is a role model for so many colleagues across the force.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-inspiring-woman-in-policing-uk-cop-manjit-atwal-gets-royal-honour/story-WENd5AZtVgHeo15CLyZfUO.html

The Trump campaign, which began raising money almost as soon as he took office in 2017, had once appeared to be a financial juggernaut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-and-democrats-raised-record-383-million-in-september-for-white-house-bid/story-eklMQlhkI8YNyZDYF0gILI.html
15-10-2020||World||Jacinda Ardern set for historic election win in Covid-free New Zealand||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is widely expected to win a second term this weekend, buoyed by a decisive yet compassionate leadership style under crisis, with polls showing her centre-left Labour Party comfortably in front.Ardern’s globally lauded responses to the country’s worst mass shooting and the coronavirus pandemic were also well received at home, although questions have been asked of Labour’s credentials to tackle the looming economic crisis.While it was initially thought Ardern could lead Labour to the country’s first outright majority government since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996, more recent polls have indicated she may need to lean on support from the minor Green Party.That would produce the country’s first pure left-leaning government since 1999. Current coalition partner, nationalist New Zealand First, led by deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, is likely to exit parliament, according to the polls. “It is hard to see an election outcome which does not return Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister,” said former Prime Minister Helen Clark and co-chair of a World Health Organization (WHO) panel looking at the global coronavirus response.“The election occurs in the context of the pandemic, and her response to it has been highly rated,” said Clark. Ardern, 40, worked a researcher in Clark’s office shortly after graduating university.Ardern removed all coronavirus restrictions last week after a second series of lockdowns and social distancing measures to eliminate COVID-19 transmission in the country of 5 million.She this week joined 31,000 rugby fans at a Wellington stadium to watch the All Blacks take on the Australian Wallabies, becoming one of the first international sporting events to allow spectators.“I say to the world ... welcome to paradise,” one fan was captured shouting to television cameras broadcasting the game. Ardern herself is often mobbed at public events by fans bearing selfie sticks. Still, National leader Judith Collins has clawed back some support for her party by focusing on the tough financial challenge ahead as unemployment rises, recession looms and government coronavirus support packages expire. Collins has warned a left-leaning coalition would mean more taxes and a business-unfriendly environment. Ardern has long had a small but vocal band of critics at home. Early in her leadership she was labelled ‘Stardust’ and ‘part-time PM’ by her critics for turning up more often on the cover of the Vogue magazine than in the corridors of parliament.Some critics suggest the extraordinary events that have shaped her first term - the pandemic, the Christchurch mosque shootings and the White Island volcano explosion - have masked some shortcomings.A flagship affordable housing building programme was set back by embarrassing blunders, economic growth has flattened, and her government fell embarrassingly short of its aspirational goals of reducing child poverty and inequality.MAORI CONCERNSThousands of indigenous Maori - traditionally a key part of Labour’s support base - took to the streets last year over land and civil rights. Those protests were viewed as a proxy for a wider disenchantment within the indigenous community over inequalities that leave Maori lagging on social indicators like housing, education and health.“Jacinda Ardern’s Labour-led government ushered in an impressive number of Māori MPs – in fact, a record number. It sounds good but something has been missing. None of them have been a staunch enough voice for Māori,” Leigh-Marama McLachlan, a communications leader for her Maori tribe, wrote in an opinion piece in The Guardian this week. Still, Ardern retains a solid international following as an ‘anti-Trump’, promoting issues such as social justice, multilateralism, environmental protection and equality in high-profile international forums including the United Nations.“In a world where the news cycle focuses a lot on the latest utterances of the world’s populist and authoritarian leaders, Jacinda Ardern represents a refreshing and sharp point of difference,” said Clark.The challenge for Ardern will be to redirect some of her international shine homeward while tackling an unprecedented economic crisis.

15-10-2020||World||Trump administration’s new appointment to scrutinise China’s human rights violations in Tibet||The Trump administration appointed a senior official to oversee Tibetan issues after a vacancy for almost four years, as the US increases pressure on China over its human rights record, including the use of forced labor among ethnic minorities.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Wednesday named Robert Destro as the US’s new Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. Destro will primarily be responsible for advancing dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama and protecting the religious, cultural and linguistic identity of Tibetans, according to the State Department.“The United States remains concerned with the PRC’s repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” Pompeo said in a statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China.Destro is currently assistant secretary of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, the special coordinator post had been vacant since January 2017. The commission had urged the State Department to fill the job, saying the role was “crucial to raising the profile of religious freedom issues in Tibet and mobilizing government resources to address the issue.”China’s authority over Tibet has long been an irritant in US-China relations, with support for the region’s autonomy and its exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, often a bipartisan issue in Washington. The US in July imposed travel restrictions on Chinese officials determined to be “substantially involved” in restricting access to Tibet.Tibet and the neighboring region of Xinjiang have long endured intense social, security and religious controls, as China seeks to suppress what it calls terrorist and separatist elements. Last month, prominent researcher Adrian Zenz released a report alleging that China is instituting a mass labor system in Tibet similar to the one that has ensnared Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.In response to Zenz’s research and additional reporting on the subject by Reuters, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement to the news organization saying that forced labor “simply does not exist” in the country and that workers participated voluntarily and were properly compensated.“We hope the international community will distinguish right from wrong, respect facts, and not be fooled by lies,” according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-new-appointment-to-scrutinise-china-s-human-rights-violations-in-tibet/story-0VOTchIqbaurHGWwYnXuQP.html

We were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation--it could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China but they did not stop it from coming out and going to Europe, the United States and the rest of the world,” Trump said here at a rally organised for his re-election to the Presidency.He added, “We are now putting it together. We had it done and now we are doing it again and next year we will be stronger. This coming year will be even better.”The US president further hit out at the former Vice President and his Democratic counterpart Joe Biden for supporting China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), stating that it was a “catastrophe for our nation”.“Since the ChinaVirus, we have created a record of 11.4 million jobs. We have cut the unemployment rate by half. We are down to 7.8 per cent. Jobs have been recovering 23 times than the Obama-Biden recovery,” he said.“He supported NAFTA--a disaster, he supported China’s entry into the World Health Organisation-- a catastrophe for our nation. China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation. Not anymore; if Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, China will own our country.”The US presidential elections are scheduled to be held on November 3, this year.

Zhang Chunhui, spokesman for China’s eastern theatre command, said in a statement that the Chinese military followed and monitored the USS Barry when the destroyer made what the US Navy called a “routine Taiwan Strait transit” on Wednesday. China considers Taiwan a wayward province that needs to be reunited with the mainland, by force if needed. The United States government, on the other hand, has stepped up support for the island recently to support what it considers an important democratic outpost. Beijing has accused Washington and Taipei of “collusion” towards the island declaring formal independence and recently ramped up air force activity near Taiwan in a show of force.The White House is pushing forward to sell to Taiwan sophisticated military equipment including MQ-9 drones and a coastal defensive missile system, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, fuelling further tensions in what is already an increasingly adversarial Sino-US relations. Zhang said the United States should stop its provocative words and actions in the Taiwan Strait, adding the Chinese military will resolutely defend the country’s territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a separate statement that the USS Barry sailed in a northerly direction through the strait and that its forces also monitored the warship, adding that the situation was as normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-us-for-undermining-peace-and-stability-in-taiwan-strait/story-eyQM5KfTWuFpwpwjuruWUL.html

The proposals would see the restrictions kick in once an area records 35 new infections per 100,000 people over seven days. Previously, Germany had used a yardstick of 50 new infections per 100,000.In the UK, the opposition Labour and experts on Wednesday called for another lockdown following advice that the new three-tier alert system may not effectively suppress the recent surge in new Covid-19 cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson resisted the calls after Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded the second lockdown. The PM is facing criticism for ignoring advice from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies as early as September 21 for a short “circuit-breaker”. As the three-tier system came into effect in England on Wednesday, Northern Ireland announced a partial lockdown. Bars and restaurants will close across Spain’s northeastern Catalonia region for the next 15 days as the country tackles one of the highest rates of infection in the European Union, with nearly 900,000 infections and more than 33,000 deaths.Italy registered 7,332 new infections in 24 hours, its highest ever daily tally since the pandemic began, and steeply up from 5,901 on Tuesday.

The violation of human rights and curbing the freedom of its people are the core challenges that the US has identified from the CPC, he said. “They are in consistent violation of the most basic and fundamental human rights for their own people,” Pompeo told reporters at a news conference here. “This is what Communist parties have a history of doing. It’s what President (Donald) Trump has directed us all to work to try and preserve; as much freedom, as much dignity, for every citizen of China as we possibly can when they are confronted with these massive human rights violations that are being conducted by the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. That is true, whether it is Xinjiang, what is taking place there, whether it is Tibet; and the inner Mongolians’ simple desire to live in freedom and exercise their own understandings of what freedom and human dignity look like, he said. “In each of those places, and I’d add Hong Kong, in each of those places, we simply are demanding from the Chinese Communist Party what we ask of every nation, is to preserve basic freedom, human dignity, religious freedom for every one of their citizens. “We’ll work hard to do everything we can to build out a coalition all across the world that comes to understand how important that is alongside of us, and works to impose costs on the Chinese Communist Party when they act in ways that are inconsistent with those basic fundamental human freedoms,” said the top American diplomat. Pompeo noted that a day earlier, the State Department had publicly announced its policy requesting that think tanks, which accept money from foreign governments including China, publicly disclose that information. “We think it’s important and want the American people to know who’s influencing our think tanks so that they can better evaluate the work that they publish,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/communist-party-of-china-consistently-violates-basic-fundamental-human-rights-of-the-chinese-people-says-pompeo/story-G62QKQaWDokM3i1GU37V2O.html
15-10-2020||World||Pompeo calls inclusion of Russia, China on UNHRC a ‘win for tyrants’||The election of countries like China, Russia and Cuba on the Human Rights Council is a win for tyrants and embarrassment for the United Nations, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, China as well as Russia and Cuba won seats on the Human Rights Council, which is a win for tyrants and embarrassment for the United Nations, Pompeo told reporters at a news conference here. “It’s an example, an indication of why we were right to leave that body. When institutions are irredeemable as was demonstrated yesterday, the United States under President (Donald) Trump simply will not participate,” he said. In 2018, President Trump withdrew the US from the UN Human Rights Council due to its well-established pattern of anti-Israel bias and membership rules that allow the election of the world’s worst human rights abusers to the Council. Prior to making this decision, and after its exit, the United States urged the UN member states to take an immediate action to reform the Council before it became irreparable, Pompeo had said in a statement a day earlier. “Unfortunately, those calls went unheeded, and today the UN General Assembly once again elected countries with abhorrent human rights records, including China, Russia and Cuba. Venezuela was elected in 2019,” he said. These elections only further validate the US decision to withdraw and use other venues and opportunities to protect and promote universal human rights, he alleged. For example, in September, the US hosted a landmark side event during the UN General Assembly’s high-level week centered on the continuing significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Last year, Trump hosted a landmark event on religious freedom, he said. Pompeo said that the US’ commitment to human rights consists of far more than just words. “Through the State Department’s action, we have punished human rights abusers in Xinjiang, Myanmar, Iran and elsewhere. Our commitments are spelled out clearly in the UN’s declaration, and in our record of action. The United States is a force for good in the world and will always be,” he said. Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley supported the US statement. The UN Human Rights Council just voted to let even more human rights abusers join its ranks, she tweeted. “The council voted in Communist China, Communist Cuba and Russia, joining Venezuela, Sudan and Libya. This further validates the US decision to leave the Human Rights Council in 2018,” Haley said. Commenting on China’s appointment to the UN Human Rights Council, the East Turkistan Government in Exile’s prime minister Salih Hudayar said, “China’s election as a member of the UN Human Rights Council is equal to the Nazis being elected. By voting for China, the UN General Assembly is only empowering China to continue its brutal campaign of colonisation and genocide in Occupied East Turkistan.” The Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) said that it is dismayed by the election of China to the UN Human Rights Council, and urges member states to take immediate steps to hold China accountable for ongoing and egregious abuses targeting Uyghurs. “Governments committing genocide shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the Human Rights Council,” said UHRP Executive director Omer Kanat. “It’s clear from the vote, however, that China has been losing the confidence of the international community over time,” Kanet added.

15-10-2020||World||TikTok looks forward to blocking second round of US restrictions||TikTok Inc. asked a federal judge to block a broad set of government restrictions designed to curb use of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app in the US, less than three weeks after the company succeeded in halting the Trump administration’s ban on new downloads.US District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington blocked the download ban on Sept. 27, ruling that the US likely exceeded its legal authority under the emergency powers statute it invoked to justify the prohibition. TikTok on Wednesday asked Nichols to issue an injunction against proposed rules forbidding companies from providing the underlying web services that make the app accessible in the USIf those prohibitions go into effect on Nov. 12, people who currently have TikTok installed on their phones would still be able to use it, but the app’s functionality would degrade over time.The US contends that TikTok is a national security threat because its ownership by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. gives the Chinese government access to the personal data of millions of Americans. President Donald Trump has demanded that ByteDance find an American buyer for TikTok, and the company is seeking US approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc.A lawyer for TikTok argued at a hearing last month that it “makes no sense” for the government to ban the app while ByteDance is still in talks for the deal the president sought.Last week, the Trump administration appealed Nichols’ ruling blocking the download ban to the US Court of Appeals in Washington. The court on Wednesday issued a briefing schedule for the appeals process: The government will submit an opening brief by Oct. 16, with TikTok required to respond by Nov. 6.The Court of Appeals case is TikTok v. Trump, 20-5302, US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia (Washington).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-looks-forward-to-blocking-second-round-of-us-restrictions/story-Qf8l1hC3ril41yUo4MtowN.html
15-10-2020||World||Donald Trump heads to Iowa looking to galvanize his base, gain boost against Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump headed to Iowa on Wednesday seeking to make up ground against Democrat Joe Biden as part of a three-week sprint to Election Day on Nov. 3.Trump, a Republican who is trailing Biden in national and some key state opinion polls, will stage a rally at the Des Moines, Iowa, airport. Biden has a virtual fundraiser and plans to give pre-recorded remarks to a Muslim advocacy group. Trump’s Iowa stop is part of a barnstorming tour in states critical to deciding who will won the election.On Thursday he will be in North Carolina and Florida, on Friday he will campaign in Florida and Georgia and on Saturday he will speak in Michigan and Wisconsin. He is expected to spend Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nevada, and then launch into a western swing.Trump on Wednesday pulled into a statistical tie with Biden in Florida, a key battleground, at 47% vs 49% with a credibility interval of four points, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed though Biden’s lead widened in Arizona and he had a 10 percentage point advantage nationally among likely voters.On Thursday, Trump and Biden, who had been due to hold a second presidential debate, will instead take part in dueling televised town halls. NBC News said Trump’s event in Miami would take place outdoors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Biden’s ABC News event will take place in Philadelphia.That Trump, who battled the virus earlier this month, is traveling to Iowa so close to Election Day suggests his campaign is concerned about voter support there for his re-election. Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state by almost 10 percentage points in 2016, but opinion polls have shown Iowa to be competitive.More than 13 million Americans have cast ballots, setting a record early pace, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida. Many seek to avoid the large crowds expected on Election Day.In the last presidential election, some 1.4 million Americans had cast early votes as of Oct. 16, 2016.About two dozen people showed up more than two hours before polls opened in Memphis, Tennessee, to claim spots in line, local media reported, as voting opened in Kansas, Rhode Island and Tennessee.In Georgia, where long lines snaked out of polling places and down sidewalks on the first two days of early voting this week, Gwinnett County election officials reported waits of up to three hours to cast early ballots on Wednesday.A US District Court judge extended voter registration in Virginia through Thursday after a severed cable line caused the state’s website to crash on Tuesday, the final scheduled day of registration.Biden widens lead Trump looks to be spending much of the week aiming to galvanize his white, conservative base rather than seeking to appeal directly to undecided voters, many of whom live in the country’s suburbs.On Thursday, he heads to Greenville in rural North Carolina, a closely fought state where early voting will begin that day, then on to rural Georgia and central Florida the next day.Reuters/Ipsos polling released this week showed Biden widening his lead in the key states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – states Trump won in 2016.Iowa has experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases, with hospitalizations at an all-time high. Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has resisted any statewide containment measures such as a mandate to wear masks and urged Trump supporters on social media to turn out en masse for the president.Trump’s bout with coronavirus has put the focus of the campaign’s closing stretch squarely on his response to the pandemic, with Biden repeatedly criticizing Trump’s handling of a virus that has infected more than 7.8 million people in the United States, killed more than 214,000 and put millions out of work.In Florida on Tuesday, Biden told seniors at a community center that Trump had recklessly dismissed the threat that the virus had posed to their at-risk population.“To Donald Trump, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable,” Biden said.Trump has touted his handling of the crisis.The Trump campaign said it would conduct temperature checks and hand out masks at his rallies but not require attendees to wear them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-heads-to-iowa-looking-to-galvanize-his-base-gain-boost-against-joe-biden/story-AJ1NREMHyqxzUyAEUYSMsJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Trump infuriated at Twitter, Facebook restrictions over article linking Bidens to Ukrainian energy company||President Donald Trump and his political allies reacted with fury after Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. on Wednesday restricted a New York Post article linking Joe Biden and his son Hunter to a Ukrainian energy company that figured in the impeachment investigation of Trump.Facebook said it would reduce distribution of the article, seeking to slow the pace of its spread before the social network’s fact-checkers have a chance to evaluate its authenticity.Twitter inserted a warning to people who clicked on the article. The company later said it took action to block links to the story because some of the article’s images contained material that violated Twitter’s rules about sharing personal information and hacked materials.“So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of ‘Smoking Gun’ emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost,” Trump wrote on Twitter as he headed to a rally in Iowa. “There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician. REPEAL SECTION 230!!!”The president was referring to part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that protects technology companies from being sued over users’ content on their platforms.Trump used the article in an extended attack on the Bidens at the rally in Des Moines.Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, accused the companies of “censorship” and his office said in a statement that he had written letters to Facebook’s Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, charging that they were trying to influence the presidential election.Another Republican, Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has emerged as a prominent critic of US technology giants and their influence since his arrival in Washington last year, tweeted: “Next week when the full Senate returns we should VOTE on my bill allowing Americans to sue #BigTech for censorship & unfair treatment.”Neither Facebook nor Twitter immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s tweet and Cruz’s letters.Facebook has warned that the US’s foreign adversaries, including Russia, may seek to trick journalists into amplifying hacked or inaccurate content they want to spread ahead of an election. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, issued this warning again Wednesday on Twitter, “given this morning’s news cycle.” He did not directly say whether this was why Facebook took action on the New York Post content.According to the Post, emails that the newspaper said were from Hunter Biden show he introduced his father, then the vice president, to Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of the energy company, Burisma. The younger Biden served on the board.The paper claimed that the communication contradicts an assertion by Joe Biden that he hadn’t spoken to his son about his business dealings. A purported email from April 17, 2015, shows the Ukrainian energy executive thanking Hunter for the introduction. Bloomberg News hasn’t independently verified the authenticity of the purported emails.Yet the Post offered no proof that the meeting took place, or that the Bidens discussed the matter.The Post’s story said the emails came from data recovered from a laptop and hard drive left at a repair shop in Delaware in April 2019.The Post reported that it had obtained the emails from Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, whose attempts to obtain disparaging information on the Bidens from Ukrainian officials last year contributed to Trump’s impeachment by the US House. Trump was acquitted early this year at a Senate trial.Trump claims that Joe Biden’s actions in Ukraine, in which he pushed for the dismissal of the country’s prosecutor general, were to benefit Hunter Biden and Burisma.That accusation has been widely debunked. In pushing for the firing of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, Biden was acting in concert with official US foreign policy and other allied nations that viewed Shokin as corrupt.A Ukrainian investigation into Burisma had long been dormant by the time Joe Biden was pushing for Shokin’s ouster in early 2016, a former Ukrainian official told Bloomberg News in May 2019.And in September, the Treasury Department sanctioned one of the Ukrainians that Giuliani met with, Andrii Derkach, calling him a Russian agent who is trying to interfere in the 2020 election.The Biden campaign said Wednesday that the former vice president did not meet with the Burisma executive.“We have reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,” campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.The Post report said that Pozharskyi thanked Hunter Biden in the April 2015 email for inviting him to Washington and “giving an opportunity to meet your father.” Hunter had joined the company’s board about a year earlier, according to the Post.The salvos fired at Twitter and Facebook by Trump and the others are part of a larger conflict over the power of technology giants and a growing willingness by the administration and lawmakers of both parties to bring them to heel. Conservatives will likely argue that the restrictions imposed by Facebook and Twitter amount to fresh evidence for a longstanding complaint: That social media platforms silence their views.On Wednesday evening, Trump said that Twitter had locked the personal account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany after she tweeted about the Post article.Not long afterward, McEnany commented on her White House account: “Censorship should be condemned!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-infuriated-at-twitter-facebook-restrictions-over-article-linking-bidens-to-ukrainian-energy-company/story-YBNa3TVvknBn0RzyTYIlSO.html
15-10-2020||World||‘Long Covid’ may affect multiple parts of body and mind, say doctors||Ongoing illness after infection with Covid-19, sometimes called “long Covid”, may not be one syndrome but possibly up to four causing a rollercoaster of symptoms affecting all parts of the body and mind, doctors said on Thursday.In an initial report about long-term Covid-19, Britain’s National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) said one common theme among ongoing Covid patients - some of whom are seven months or more into their illness - is that symptoms appear in one physiological area, such as the heart or lungs, only to abate and then arise again in a different area.“This review highlights the detrimental physical and psychological impact that ongoing COVID is having on many people’s lives,” said Dr Elaine Maxwell, who led the report.Many thousands of people worldwide have linked up on social media platforms and online forums to share their experiences of ongoing Covid-19 symptoms. Some call themselves “long haulers” while others have named their condition “long Covid”.According to UK-based patient group LongCovidSOS, data from a King’s College London-devised symptom tracker app shows that 10% of Covid-19 patients remain unwell after three weeks, and up to 5% may continue to be sick for months.Maxwell, who presented the findings of the “Living with Covid” report in an online media briefing, said health services are already struggling “to manage these new and fluctuating patterns of symptoms and problems”.She and her co-authors urged patients and doctors to log and track symptoms so that health researchers can learn more about the condition and how to ease it as swiftly as possible.“Despite the uncertainties, people need help now,” she said. “We need to collect more data.”For this initial report, Maxwell’s team held a focus group with 14 members of a Facebook group called Long Covid.Their testimony suggested ongoing Covid can be cyclical, Maxwell said, with symptoms fluctuating in severity and moving around the body including around the respiratory system, the brain, cardiovascular system and heart, the kidneys, the gut, the liver and the skin.“There are powerful stories that ongoing COVID symptoms are experienced by people of all ages, and people from all backgrounds,” the report said.Maxwell said an urgent priority is to establish a working diagnosis recognised by healthcare services, employers and government agencies to help patients get support.“While this is a new disease and we are learning more about its impact..., services will need to be better equipped to support people with ongoing COVID, as emerging evidence is showing there are significant psychological and social impacts that will have long term consequences,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-covid-may-affect-multiple-parts-of-body-and-mind-doctors-say/story-Upcf9zbGTsX6HYro4DTQVJ.html
15-10-2020||World||China targets US buyers with $6 billion dollar debt sale||China drew bumper demand for a dollar bond sale amid growing uncertainties over the US elections and tensions with Washington.For a fourth straight fall, China brought a dollar debt offering with three-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities, according to people familiar with the matter who aren’t authorized to speak publicly. The nation pulled in more than $30 billion of investor bids, which includes $10.8 billion of joint lead-manager interest.The country’s ministry of finance raised about $6 billion via the new deal. The shorter-dated bonds have lower premiums than during the final price guidance marketing phase of the nation’s last dollar bond sale in 2019.The ministry of finance opened up its bond sale to a broad pool of US investors for the first time, potentially diversifying its investor base and setting aside concerns of decoupling in credit markets.The deal includes China’s debut issuance of 144A notes, as well as previously sold Regulation S senior bonds, allowing participation from a wider range of potential international investors compared to last year’s jumbo global offering of $6 billion dollar bonds and 4 billion euro notes ($4.7 billion).“144A issuance shows that China is keen to promote its USD bonds globally, including to U.S. investors,” according to Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “China has taken a pragmatic approach to deepen and liberalize its financial markets, and this is likely to continue with or without political tensions with the U.S.”Officials at the ministry weren’t available to comment.The fresh sovereign debt sale this week comes as uncertainties ahead of the U.S. elections in November are beginning to weigh on investor sentiment. Issuing the notes in October helps avoid potentially less receptive market conditions, according to analysts.China’s business-as-usual approach contrasts with rising concern about a decoupling between the world’s two largest economies. The ministry of finance said during its 2017 resumption of dollar-debt sales that it would help build a benchmark yield curve for Chinese issuers, which range from developers to local governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targets-us-buyers-with-6-billion-dollar-debt-sale/story-6enWKh9tvgx7qE5gF5BKJI.html
15-10-2020||World||Trump’s court pick Barrett calls presidential self-pardon an ‘open question’||President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, said on Wednesday it was an “open question” whether Trump could pardon himself and added that the top US judicial body “can’t control” whether a president obeys its decisions.She also sought to allay Democratic fears that she would be an automatic vote to strike down the Obamacare healthcare law in a case due to be argued Nov. 10, promising an “open mind.”Barrett wrapped up about eight hours of questioning on the third day of her four-day Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. The committee will hear on Thursday from witnesses both for and against her confirmation, but Barrett herself will not be present.Trump has said he has the “absolute power” to pardon himself, part of his executive clemency authority. Asked by Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy whether a president could pardon himself for a crime, Barrett said the “question has never been litigated.”“That question may or may not arise but it’s one that calls for legal analysis of what the scope of the pardon power is. So because it would be opining on an open question when I haven’t gone through the judicial process to decide it, it’s not one on which I can offer a view,” Barrett added. Trump also has issued executive clemency to political allies and friends.Barrett, a conservative federal appellate judge, is Trump’s third selection for a lifetime Supreme Court post. Trump has asked the Senate, controlled by his fellow Republicans, to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 US election.While saying that “no one is above the law,” Barrett twice declined to answer directly when Leahy asked whether a president who refuses to comply with a court order is a threat to the US constitutional system of checks and balances within the three branches of government.“The Supreme Court can’t control whether or not the president obeys,” Barrett said.Supreme Court rulings, Barrett said, have the “force of law,” but the court lacks enforcement power and relies on the other branches of government.“A court can pronounce the law and issue a judgment but it lacks control over how the political branches respond to it,” Barrett added.Barrett declined to discuss whether Trump was violating the US Constitution’s “emoluments” clause with his business dealings. The provision bar presidents from taking gifts or payments from foreign and state governments without congressional approval. “I don’t know if I would characterize it as an anti-corruption clause,” Barrett said, disagreeing with Leahy, adding that it was designed to “prevent foreign countries from having influence.”Obamacare case Barrett could be on the high court for arguments in a challenge by Trump and Republican-led states to the 2010 law formally called the Affordable Care Act that has helped millions of Americans obtain medical coverage and includes protections for people with pre-existing conditions.Responding to Democratic suggestions that she would vote to strike down Obamacare in its entirety if one part is deemed unlawful, Barrett said if a statute can be saved, it is a judge’s duty to do so. Barrett added that she would approach any ACA case “with an open mind.”Barrett has criticized previous Supreme Court rulings upholding Obamacare. Senator Kamala Harris, who is Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s running mate, said that the proceedings “lack legitimacy in the eyes of the people of our country” because they want the winner of the election to decide who fills the court’s vacancy. “Americans right now are suffering from a deadly pandemic and we are also suffering from a historic economic crisis,” Harris said. “The Senate should be working day and night to provide economic relief to families and not rushing a Supreme Court confirmation.”Barrett, 48, would be the fifth woman ever to serve on the court. As a devout Roman Catholic, Barrett personally opposes abortion.“This is history being made folks,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panel. “This is the first time in American history that we’ve nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology, and she’s going to the court.”Barrett would not say if the landmark 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling that protects the right of married couples to use contraceptives without government restrictions was properly decided, but said it was “very unlikely” to be imperiled. Some conservatives including Barrett’s mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, have criticized the ruling, which recognized a constitutional right to privacy and paved the way for the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide as well as decisions recognizing LGBT rights.Democratic Senator Cory Booker raised concerns to Barrett about racial issues, noting that Black Americans are disproportionately affected in criminal sentencing and restrictions on voting access.“In my private life, I abhor racial discrimination and obviously for both personal reasons and professional reasons I want to ensure that there’s equal justice for all,” added Barrett, who has two Black adopted children from Haiti among her seven children.Barrett’s confirmation would give the court a 6-3 conservative majority. Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority, making Barrett’s confirmation a virtual certainty.Republicans are preparing for a committee vote next week and a final Senate confirmation vote before the end of October. Trump nominated Barrett on Sept. 26 to replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-court-pick-amy-coney-barrett-calls-presidential-self-pardon-an-open-question/story-QFr92q6yd5N82WJguCVIFL.html
15-10-2020||World||US book stores launch ‘Boxed Out’ campaign against Amazon||The American Booksellers Association has launched an advertising campaign against Amazon to alert the public to what it calls the growing danger that book stores are under from the online goliath during the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign, the first of its kind, was sparked by Amazon’s “Prime Day” on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which Amazon offers bargains on products.Since the pandemic began, 35 book stores belonging to the ABA have had to shut their doors for good, the association told AFP, adding that some 20 percent of independent bookstores are under threat of closure. “When these independent bookstores close Covid will be listed as the cause of death, but the pre-existing condition for many may be listed as Amazon,” the association said in a statement.Dubbed “Boxed Out,” the campaign plays on the delivery boxes that have become the hallmark of Amazon home deliveries.For Allison K. Hill, the director general of the ABA, the rise of the online commercial giant represents “the loss of local jobs and local tax dollars; the loss of community centers; and the loss of opportunities for readers to discover books and connect with other readers in a meaningful face-to-face way.”According to the ABA, in 2019, 104 bookshops opened during the year. Only 30 have opened in 2020.The ABA campaign was launched on social media but also in bookshops themselves, of which 1,750 are ABA members.Some, like Solid State Books, in Washington, have covered their front windows with a giant brown cardboard, reminiscent of the Amazon delivery boxes.“Buy books from people who want to sell books, not colonize the Moon,” said the logo on the cardboard, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ space travel side-project, Blue Origins.Another caustic message read, “If you want Amazon to be the world’s only retailer, keep shopping there.”Turnover from sales from bricks-and-mortar bookstores was down 31 percent in the first seven months of 2020, according to the census office. At the same time, in the third quarter of 2020 online sales were 16.1 percent of all retail sales, a record and up by a third from the first quarter, the same source said.tu/la/jh/dwAMAZON.COM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-book-stores-launch-boxed-out-campaign-against-amazon/story-AJp7NDD3CxTPcleOmbbmYJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Paris goes under curfew as Europe ramps up Covid-19 restrictions||France on Wednesday became the latest European country to toughen anti-coronavirus measures, imposing a curfew in Paris and eight other cities from Saturday, while Germany and Ireland also ramped up restrictions. “We have to act. We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus,” President Emmanuel Macron told public television, announcing a shutdown between 9:00 pm and 6:00 am that will remain in force for as long as six weeks.Other major French cities such as Lyon, Mediterranean port Marseille and southwestern Toulouse will similarly impose curfews, with around 20 million people affected in all, out of a total population of some 67 million.Just minutes before Macron’s announcement, his government had said it would prolong a state of health emergency.With over one million coronavirus deaths and nearly 40 million cases worldwide, regions like Europe that suppressed the first outbreak are again facing tough choices on how to control a new wave without the economic devastation wrought by nationwide lockdowns.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced tougher measures on gatherings and mask-wearing. “I am convinced that what we do now will be decisive for how we come through this pandemic,” the leader said. New infections in Germany continued to rise Wednesday, pushing past 5,000 cases in 24 hours -- a level not seen since a lockdown imposed on Europe’s biggest economy in the spring.“We’re in a situation where I think we can still flatten the exponential growth,” Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s disease control agency said. “But for that we all need to make an effort.”Worsening situationIn Spain, bars and restaurants will close across the northeastern region of Catalonia for the next 15 days as the country tackles one of the highest rates of infection in the European Union, with nearly 900,000 cases and more than 33,000 deaths.Measures also came into force across the Netherlands, including restrictions on alcohol sales and new mask requirements, while Northern Ireland announced a four-week closure of pubs and restaurants. Ireland’s prime minister Micheal Martin announced a raft of new curbs along the border with the British province of Northern Ireland, including the closure of non-essential retail outlets, gyms, pools and leisure centres.Earlier on Wednesday Northern Ireland’s devolved government announced plans to shut pubs and restaurants for four weeks, tighten restrictions on social gatherings and extend the mid-term school break to counter soaring case numbers there.Infection rates “must be turned down now or we will be in a very difficult place very soon indeed,” First Minister Arlene Foster told lawmakers in the Northern Ireland Assembly.Lockdown ‘disaster’British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also under increasing pressure to impose more stringent measures to cut spiralling rates in England, including a two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown.Johnson said a new UK-wide lockdown would be a “disaster” but refused to rule it out as the government’s science advisory committee endorsed a temporary shutdown.And in Italy, authorities recorded 7,332 new cases on Wednesday -- the highest daily count the hard-hit country has yet seen.Rome has already imposed new, tougher rules to control the virus’ resurgence, including an end to parties, amateur football matches and snacking at bars at night.Beyond Europe, Iran on Wednesday announced new travel restrictions affecting the capital Tehran and four other major cities, as well as new single-day records in both Covid-19 deaths and new infections.And neighbouring Iraq’s death toll since the start of the pandemic passed 10,000 people.At least 1,089,039 people worldwide have died of the coronavirus since it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late in 2019, according to an AFP tally using official figures.

15-10-2020||World||Top Russian diplomat skeptical about nuclear pact extension with US||Russia’s top diplomat voiced doubt Wednesday that Moscow and Washington could negotiate an extension of their last arms control pact still standing, even as the United States offered a more optimistic view.Speaking in an interview with several Russian news outlets, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia can’t accept the conditions put forward by the United States for the extension of the New START treaty.“I personally don’t see the prospect,” Lavrov snapped when asked if the extension is possible before the pact expires in February. “We will never say that we will shut the door and cut all contacts. But we explain that it’s impossible to talk on the basis of an ultimatum they put forward that fully ignores the principles which were acknowledged as the basis for all our agreements for decades.”Lavrov’s pessimistic view contrasted with the statements from US diplomats, who said that Moscow and Washington were close to a deal.“We would welcome the opportunity to complete an agreement based on understandings that were achieved over the last couple weeks about what the range of possibilities look like for an extension of New START and an outcome that benefits the entire world, increased stability of the most dangerous weapons in the world,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday.Pompeo said that “I am hopeful that the Russians will find a way to agree to an outcome that, frankly, I think is in their best interest and in our best interest,” voicing hope that China will eventually join the talks too.A person familiar with the talks told The Associated Press Friday that US and Russian negotiators have agreed in principle to continue freezing their nuclear warhead stockpiles in a bid to salvage the New START. The person, who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it’s not yet clear if the agreement for a freeze will succeed or translate into an extension of the pact.If it works, the person said an agreement could be announced before the Nov. 3 presidential election with an eye toward extending the accord and eventually bringing China into it, a longtime demand by President Donald Trump’s administration.The New START treaty was signed in 2010 by US President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, the New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries.Russia has offered its extension without any conditions, while the Trump administration has pushed for a new arms control agreement that would also include China. Moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, pointing at Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much smaller nuclear arsenal.Lavrov specified Wednesday that Russia can’t accept the US proposal to limit battlefield nuclear weapons alongside nuclear warheads that arm strategic missiles and bombers until the US agrees to withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.He also noted that Moscow wouldn’t agree to the US demand to have intrusive verification measures like those that existed in the 1990s when inspectors were positioned at missile factories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-russian-diplomat-skeptical-about-nuclear-pact-extension-with-us/story-PSMvm9LeywqWPvLteO3KcN.html

Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms.”She added: “He has since tested negative.” She didn’t say precisely when Barron Trump was tested for infection.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday, the president said: “Barron’s fine.”The president announced that he and his wife had contracted Covid-19 on Oct. 2, and he was hospitalized later that day. Melania Trump never required hospital care.“I am happy to report that I have tested negative and hope to resume my duties as soon as I can,” she said in her post. “Along with this good news, I want people to know that I understand just how fortunate my family is to have received the kind of care that we did.”The White House physician, Sean Conley, cleared the president to resume his normal activities on Saturday and he returned to the campaign trail on Monday with a rally in Florida.

The Reserve is located on the banks of Yamuna river near Dehradun district in Garhwal region of the Himalayan state. “Ramsar declares Asan Conservation Reserve as a site of international importance. With this, the number of Ramsar sites in India goes up to 38, the highest in South Asia and Uttarakhand gets its first Ramsar site,” tweeted the environment ministry.Manju Pandey, joint secretary in the environment ministry, also confirmed the development and said that Asan Conservation Reserve has become Uttarakhand’s first Ramsar site. “Asan Conservation Reserve cleared five out of the nine criteria needed to be declared as a Ramsar site and get identified as a Wetland of International Importance,” said Pandey. It cleared the category on species and ecological communities, one on water-birds and another on fish. Deep Chandra Arya, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Chakrata forest division, which is home to Asan Conservation Reserve, said, “The certificate was given on July 21, 2020 by the Secretary General, Convention on Wetlands but it was officially announced by the union environment ministry on Thursday as certain queries had been pending and were being fulfilled.” “Asan is home to many rare and endangered species like the Ruddy Shelduck, Red Crested Pochard, among others.

15-10-2020||India||Cop, brother of Assam Chief Secy arrested in police recruitment scam||A senior police officer who is suspected to have played a key role in the Assam Police job recruitment scam was arrested on Thursday, police said. Kumar Sanjit Krishna, who was serving as the superintendent of police (SP) of Karimganj district till his transfer on Sunday, was arrested by the criminal investigation department (CID). “Kumar Sanjit Krishna has been arrested by CID today (Thursday) evening in connection with CID PS case no 21/2020. He would be produced in competent court tomorrow (Friday),” said a brief statement issued by Assam Police. Krishna, who was transferred as SP of foreigners’ regional registration office (FRRO) in Barpeta district, is the younger brother of Assam’s chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna. Police officials were questioning Krishna and few of his close associates since Monday, but he suddenly disappeared from his official residence in Guwahati on Tuesday night only to resurface on Thursday. The written exam to select 597 sub-inspectors (SI) to Assam Police was cancelled on September 20 after the question paper was leaked. The exam will now be held on November 22. Police officials had conducted searches at Krishna’s residences in Guwahati and Silchar on Wednesday and reportedly unearthed several incriminating documents. The police officer is reported to have clicked photos of the question paper prior to the exam and gave them to other accused in the scam. On Tuesday, chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna had written on social media that the law would take its course and his name should not be dragged in as his brother “is a mature, independent individual in a different profession”. The police have so far arrested over 50 people in connection with the case including a retired IPS officer PK Dutta and a ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Diban Deka (who has since been expelled from the party). Dutta and Deka are suspected to have fleeced many candidates for the SI post by assuring them jobs in lieu of cash. Deka is alleged to have procured the question paper ahead of the written test. Police have recovered nearly Rs 6 cr rupees, allegedly collected from candidates for posts of sub-inspectors by the accused, after conducting raids at several places in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ips-officer-brother-of-assam-chief-secy-arrested-in-police-recruitment-scam/story-kHVWhwYeu3JPBJLv3vYpKI.html
15-10-2020||India||Delhi pollution: What AAP government has done so far in 2020||During the 2020 Delhi Assembly election Arvind Kejirwal-led Aam Aadmi Party promised two-third reduction in Delhi’s pollution. While the lockdown from March 25 to combat the spread of Covid-19 resulted in some marked difference in the capital city’s pollution level, after unlocking, the air quality started worsening and in the last two weeks, it hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ categories.Here is what the AAP government has done so far to handle the air pollution challenge through their campaign ‘Yuddh Pradhushan Ke Virudh’ (war against pollution):1. The Delhi government has launched a ‘Green War Room’ which will be the centre for collaboration of different agencies that will work together to tackle air pollution. 2. Arvind Kejriwal announced the launch of a mobile app called ‘Green Delhi’ in order to increase public participation and awareness. 3. Delhi Pollution Control Committee has banned electricity generator sets of all capacities (diesel, petrol, kerosene) from October 15, except for essential or emergency services. This comes under Graded Response Action Plan, a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels.4. The Delhi government will also be coordinating with the neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab in order to ensure that alternatives to stubble burning are found.5. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also focussing on increasing the green cover in Delhi with a plan called the ‘Tree Policy’, which will focus not only on preserving the existing tree cover but also on transplantation of new trees in order to increase the green cover. 6. To ensure strict adherence to the rules, the Delhi Government has decided to impose heavy fines on those who are found violating the anti-pollution guidelines.7. Okhla Phase II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri have been deemed as pollution hotspots by the Delhi government. 8. On Thursday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a new anti-pollution campaign under which people will be encouraged to switch off the engines of their vehicles while waiting at traffic signals.People are advised to wear face masks as it helps to protects from Covid-19 and also reduces exposure to air pollution significantly. People must also avoid outdoor exercise during peak pollution hours and children and people aged over 60 must avoid venturing out. Patients with chronic lung diseases must take extra precautions during this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-pollution-what-aap-government-has-done-so-far-in-2020/story-xN38We42pO6sZZfDl0cnDL.html

According to Pratap Jadhav, deputy divisional commissioner for Pune division, Solapur was one of the worst affected districts in the current spell of rain.“A total of 27 people have died due to rain-related incidents in Solapur, Sangli and Pune districts. Of these 27 casualties, 14 are from Solapur district, 9 from Sangli and 4 from Pune district,” said Jadhav.According to the administration, six of the 14 casualties in Solapur were due to a wall collapse on the banks of Chandrabhaga in temple town Pandharpur. The district received 138 mm rainfall on Wednesday forcing authorities to release 1.4 lakh cusecs of water by Thursday afternoon.“The rest of the casualties in Solapur were related to flood-like situations,” said Jadhav.He said that in Pune, four people died after getting swept away in a swollen stream in Daund tehsil, while one is still missing.He added that nine deaths in Sangli district are also related to rain-induced accidents.“As per the preliminary information, around 20,000 people have been shifted to safer places in Solapur, Sangli and Pune,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-claims-27-lives-across-western-maharashtra-solapur-worst-hit/story-UNMQwlJyvmM4RfaDZG0qKJ.html
15-10-2020||India||2 Trinamool leaders appear before Bengal CID in BJP leader’s murder probe||The outgoing chairman of Barrackpore municipality, Uttam Das, and his counterpart in Titagarh municipality, Prashanta Choudhury, appeared before the West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Thursday in connection with the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manish Shukla. The 39-year-old leader was gunned down on BT Road at Titagarh in North 24 Parganas district on the night of October 4. The two senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders were however not questioned. Their personal appearance was recorded at an office of the Barrackpore police and they left after 30 minutes. An officer aware of the development said on condition of anonymity that Das and Choudhury’s name were put in the First Information Report (FIR) on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s father Chandramani Shukla.The two TMC leaders had denied the allegation after the murder, saying the BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh accused them because they built up movements to stop the BJP from making further inroads in the district before the 2019 assembly election. “There was an internal squabble in the district BJP unit,” said Das. Dismissing this, Singh said, “Calling the two TMC leaders was an eyewash. The government is shielding the real killers of Shukla. Only a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can reveal the truth.”Singh and Shukla both left the Trinamool and joined the BJP in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Singh made news by defeating TMC’s sitting MP Dinesh Trivedi in the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat in 2019. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya also demanded a CBI probe on Thursday, alleging that the hitmen came from Bangladesh.“People involved in trans-border smuggling are directly involved in Shukla’s murder,” he said.The Barrackpore court on Thursday issued an order to produce Subodh Singh, a convict lodged at Nalanda Jail in Bihar. He is a prime suspect in this case. A few days ago, a CID team went to Bihar to interrogate him. It is suspected that though Singh is lodged in jail he made phone calls to the shooters. The CID team wanted to bring Singh to Kolkata for interrogation but the Bihar Police turned down the request. Singh is involved in dacoities and murders in several states, including Bengal. Last Thursday, the CID arrested Subodh Yadav, a resident of Barrackpore. This was the fourth arrest since early October 6. Three suspects, Muhammad Khurram, Sheikh Gulab and Muhammad Nasir Khan were arrested earlier. A day after the murder, the West Bengal Police said personal enmity could have led to the killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-trinamool-leaders-appear-before-bengal-cid-in-bjp-leader-s-murder-probe/story-4PQAtNn5vAQTvY25eDEA2N.html

He made the comments at the Annual General Meeting of Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) and St. John’s Ambulance. “We are very much into the vaccine development process...in the next few months at the most we should have a vaccine and in the next six months we should be in the process of delivering the vaccine to the people of India,” he said. Vardhan said to fight against Covid-19 the social vaccine of maintaining a distance of six feet should be followed, along with regular washing of hands and wearing of masks and face covers, especially in public places. “Maintaining a distance of six feet, regular washing of hands and wearing of masks/face covers, especially in public places can save lives along with livelihood, which has been the ultimate goal of government,” he said. He said this potent social vaccine can stop the disease and it also forms the foundation of the ‘Jan Andolan’ against Covid-19. Vardhan said IRCS, through its blood centres, has gone out of its way to ensure that there is no shortage of blood for the people in need. “Innovative ways of promotion of voluntary blood donation coupled with dedicated efforts of the staff, managers and volunteers have resulted into the 24/7 operations of blood services across the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expected-to-have-covid-19-vaccine-in-next-few-months-harsh-vardhan/story-7gUvELbhEoyAcGbFTwZovJ.html

The external affairs ministry dismissed China’s stance on not recognising Arunachal Pradesh state and the union territory of Ladakh, saying both regions are an integral part of India and Beijing has no locus standi to comment on such internal matters. The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava reflected the stalemate in efforts to end the standoff in Ladakh sector, which has entered its sixth month, and the lack of progress in disengagement of troops at friction points after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, participating in the Bloomberg India Economic Forum online, made it clear that New Delhi wasn’t to blame for the tensions. Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, he pointed out that India and China had built their relationship and expanded cooperation over the past 30 years “predicated on peace and tranquillity along the border”. “If that underlying peace and tranquillity is disturbed, if the agreements which the two sides signed are not honoured, then clearly that is the primary cause of the disruption,” Jaishankar said. He added: “If you disturb the foundation of this relationship, you cannot be impervious to the fact that it will have consequences...that problem...was not created on our side.” China’s foreign ministry had on Monday cited India’s infrastructure development and troop deployments as the root causes of tensions. It also said India should refrain from actions that could escalate the situation. But Srivastava said India was creating infrastructure that improved the lives of its people. “The government gives careful and specific attention to improvement of infrastructure for the development of border areas in order to facilitate economic development of these areas, as also to meet India’s strategic and security requirements,” he said. Peace and tranquillity can be restored by “scrupulously observing all relevant agreements” on border management, he added. Responding to China’s contention that it doesn’t recognise Arunachal Pradesh and the union territory of Ladakh, Srivastava said both regions are an integral and inalienable part of India. “China has no locus standi to comment on India’s internal matters. We hope that countries will not comment on India’s internal matters, as much as they expect the same of others,” he said. Srivastava described troop disengagement as a complex process requiring redeployments by each side towards their regular posts along the LAC, and indicated there would be more talks to take this process forward. “To achieve this, the two sides will maintain the current momentum of communications based on the guidance of our leadership to not turn differences into disputes and work towards a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement in all the friction areas along the LAC and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas,” he said. Jaishankar also told the Bloomberg India Economic Forum that the talks between military commanders and diplomats were a “work in progress”. He said: “What is going on is something confidential between us and the Chinese and we will wait to see how this plays out.” A key issue was whether a rising China and a rising India could find equilibrium, and the situation on the border is an expression of “the inability to meet that challenge”, he said. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash described the situation on the LAC as a battle of wits, with both sides waiting to see who would blink first. “The Chinese are playing chicken, since they staged a misadventure with the expectation of quickly fulfilling the objective of grabbing some land but were surprised by the Indian response,” he said. “They have hit the pause button after they realised it wasn’t going to be an easy ride. It is a battle of nerves as the Chinese have upped the psychological warfare. They are also watching other developments, such as the outcome of the US election,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-a-work-in-progress-s-jaishankar-on-india-china-border-row/story-clSMPBz4JKEdpCHK0xjtNJ.html

Life has changed drastically and we all in this business are reeling under financial crunch too. It will take another two months to get back on our feet. Also, many of our clients have fallen behind due to lack of practice now that’s another challenge for trainers.”A regular gym goer and fitness freak, Rajkumar Saini, “Gyms were closed and we were locked in our homes. I decided that I will not lose the kind of fitness I have attained in all these months so I did my best. But, after all these months, we required getting back on track and thankfully gyms are functional. I went back to my trainer and I’m glad that slowly all is getting back to normal.” With members now re-joining, Fitness Habit gym is expanding to maintain social distancing. “For now, we have stopped aerobics. We are adding a new floor where we will have aerobics, yoga and include cross-fit workouts. For now, we have staggered timings to maintain distancing besides other precautions.

I have done plays for my school, college and state government organisations. Whatever I am today, I have polished my craft with raw and practical learning because I never had that kind of finances to afford big acting colleges,” said the ‘Tujhse Hai Raabta,’ actor. Being an actor didn’t come easy for Shagun. “I believe struggle should be part of everybody’s journey. As, the amount of efforts we put to shape our lives the more we learn to value it. I remember those days when I had no money to even commute in and around Mumbai, had no permanent place to reside but I never gave up on my dreams. Work that came my way was demanding too! Then I got to play a character that was physically challenged in ‘Badho Bahu.’ Nobody was ready to take up that role but I took as a challenge and that character made me stand out for the makers.”The suave actor is currently seen in the daily ‘Shubhaarambh.’ “I’m seen portraying Mihir Doshi, who is in love with the female protagonist and I am very excited to be part of the show that has kept viewers engaged all this time,” said Shagun who was one of the finalists at the reality show ‘Splitsvilla-11’ and daily soap ‘Shaadi ke Siyape.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/struggle-makes-us-value-our-journey/story-hbMPwMDEVwvNMxzGYvsvBN.html

An accused charged with Cofeposa can be kept in preventive custody up to a year. Cofeposa is usually invoked on habitual offenders who pose a threat to the country’s economy. The accused moved the court saying they were under custody for more than three months and they committed only an economic offence. But the NIA opposed their plea saying the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act was invoked against them. But the court said UAPA cannot be imposed on all accused and some of them were eligible for bail as they have completed 90 days in jail.Also read: Gold smuggling case suspect claims ‘vested interests’ seek his arrest, gets reprieve While opposing the bail plea on Wednesday, the NIA had told the court that it suspected that some of the accused were in touch with the gang of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and they visited Tanzania several times where the he has a strong network. In Delhi, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan citied the NIA’s contention of a D Company link to the smuggling case and sought the resignation of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.“We want the CM to resign as everything happened right under his nose. His secretary was helping some of the accused. The main accused even said she visited the CM’s official residence several times. When his office is under investigation how can he continue in his office?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-get-bail/story-2cvkL4zHZFqW2Orgh83jzJ.html
15-10-2020||India||Bengaluru riots: Congress leader seeks colleague’s suspension, Shivakumar denies||Congress legislator Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, whose house was burnt by a rioting mob in Bengaluru in August, on Thursday publicly demanded the suspension of his party colleague and former Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj, who has been named by the police as a key instigator of the violence. However, the state unit chief DK Shivakumar said that no such action would be taken.The Central Crime Branch of Bengaluru police, which is investigating the riots, had said in its interim chargesheet that riots was caused by internal rivalry in the Congress party and had named Sampath Raj, who is a sitting corporator, as well as Congress corporator Abdul Zakir apart from 58 others as some of the key players who instigated the violence.The riots in DJ Halli and KG Halli allegedly started after Murthy’s estranged nephew responded to a social media post viewed as offensive to Muslims. In the violence that followed, three people were killed and more than a hundred injured in the DJ Halli and KG Halli police station limits on August 11 and 12.The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is also investigating the case, had questioned two Congress MLAs - Zameer Ahmed Khan and Rizwan Arshad - regarding the riots. DK Shivakumar said that the chargesheet by the Bengaluru police naming Congress corporators as key players was politically motivated and timed just ahead of the two bypolls scheduled in the state.Accusing the police of acting as puppets of the ruling BJP, Shivakumar said that there was an effort to defame the Congress party. “No Congressman was involved (in the riots). We will fight this out both politically and legally.”The ruling BJP has accused the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the Congress of being behind the riots. Responding to a question on whether any action would be taken with regard to Murthy’s demand for suspension of Sampat Raj, Shivakumar said, “No. That maybe his (Murthy’s) political agenda, we are not going to suspend anyone.” On whether the party would stand behind Murthy, a Dalit MLA, Shivakumar said that “the party would stand behind all Congressmen”.Deputy CM Ashwath Narayan said this only showed the internecine strife within the Congress. “Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy himself has said that his political rivals within the party were trying to finish him off. The police and NIA are investigating the matter and truth will eventually come out,” said Narayan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-riots-congress-leader-seeks-colleague-s-suspension-shivakumar-denies/story-IDw1LajttjswU250Jh0DsM.html

They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,” said the statement.On the situation in Tibet as well as developments along the LAC, Jaishankar said, “I do not think we should get into other issues which frankly has nothing to do with the situation currently in Ladakh.” He said relations between India and China improved following signing of a series of agreements since 1993 on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border.“For the last 30 years, we have built a relationship predicated on peace and tranquillity along the border,” he said. Jaishankar said if peace and tranquillity is not ensured and the agreements signed are not honoured, then that is the “primary cause of disruption”.

According to him, one of the accused wanted to grab 15-bigha land at Bukna village, which was the temple property.A police official on condition of anonymity said, “In the CCTV footage obtained from a petrol pump located in Sapotra town, which is about 4.5 km away from the (crime) spot, the 50-year-old victim is seen purchasing petrol in a plastic bottle at 9.15 am on the day of the incident.”After that the victim reached Karada Ki Dongri in Bukna village, where his house is located, he said. “However, this fact is not enough to prove who immolated the priest,” the official added.Another police official said, “We are yet to find any eyewitness in this case.”The victim, in his dying declaration, said that the accused - Kailash, Shankar, Namo, Kishan and Ramlakhan – poured petrol on him around 10 am on October 7 and set him on fire. A few unknown villagers had rushed towards him but he fell unconscious. When he opened his eyes, he was in hospital, the priest told the police.The police official said, “In our investigation one thing is clear that there is no caste conflict between communities. Some leaders, locals and even some media persons tried to create a conflict between two communities, but in his dying declaration the victim said that when his land was encroached, the panchayat members, who gave the decision in his favour, are from the community of the accused,” the police official said.ML Lather, director general of police (crime), who also holds the additional charge of director general of police, said that a police team is stationed in Karauli district. “It is too early to make a comment or reveal anything related to any evidence in this case as it may hamper the investigation,” he said.When Lala, the victim’s nephew, was asked about the petrol that his uncle bought, he said, “My uncle in his dying declaration said that he was set on fire by the named accused. Police investigation will reveal the truth.”On the caste conflict, he said that people from all communities were with his family over their demands. “The villagers extended us their full support,” he said.The alleged killing of the priest had snowballed into a political row with the Opposition attacking the state government. In a tweet, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje had said that the killing of the priest in Sapotara did not evoke government response. “We cannot express enough grief over it,” she said.After facing flak, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had tweeted: “The murder of Babulal Vaishnav in Sapotara, Karauli, is extremely unfortunate and condemnable; civil society has no place for such acts. The state government is with the bereaved family in this sad time. The main accused has been arrested and action continues. The culprits shall not be spared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-in-rajasthan-s-karauli-who-was-set-ablaze-had-bought-petrol-an-hour-earlier-say-police/story-gXUbo9qCRXqEd8MyCJIgOJ.html

Work began on the Drass side of the tunnel on Thursday with Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari initiating the first blasting of the tunnel. The tunnel assumes significance in the light of India’s standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. “It was a long pending demand of the people of Ladakh. It will be a strategic tunnel that will connect Ladakh with the rest of India 24x7,” Kargil district commissioner Baseer-ul-Haq Choudhary said.“Obviously, it is going to be a major achievement for us. The tunnel will not only provide physical connectivity to the region but will also establish an emotional connect with the rest of India,” he added. The district commissioner said with this tunnel employment opportunities will open up for the people of Ladakh and supply of essential commodities will also be maintained round the year. “Ladakh being a tourist destination, this tunnel will give immense impetus to tourism, especially winter tourism like ice hockey, skiing and other activities,” he said. Choudhary also said that from the defence point of view, the tunnel will add more teeth to the Indian security forces in the region and in turn strengthen national security. “It will be of great importance to the defence forces of the country. This project shall bring to fruition 70 years of overwhelming public demand of Ladakh region,” he said. After infrastructure development and finance company IL&FS went bust, the project that was allotted to it in May 2018 was stopped in July 2018, and the contract was terminated in January 2019 by the National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL). The project was re-awarded to Megha Engineering & Infrastructure LTD (MEIL).In February, Gadkari reviewed the whole project in detail and the project was approved afresh on May 23. The construction period is now six years. The total integrated cost of the project including Zoji La tunnel and approaches up to Z-Morh tunnel works out to Rs 10,643 crores. The tunnel is being constructed at an altitude of about 3,000 metres under Zoji La pass which connects Srinagar to Leh through Drass and Kargil but remains open for only six months in a year. Heavy snow forces the closure of the road for six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoji-la-tunnel-to-give-more-teeth-to-indian-army-in-ladakh-says-kargil-dc/story-GQ1WevqupGbqiIG4h5Q1nI.html

Be it testing, vaccine and medication, the solution has to be cost-effective, easily available and scalable, the Prime Minister said. The meeting was attended by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, NITI Aayog member (health), principal scientific advisor, senior scientists, and other officials.The meeting comes as three vaccines are at present under trial in India. Bharat Biotech, which is developing an indigenous vaccine in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is conducting its second phase trial, the results of which are expected soon. Also Read: Healthy young people may have to wait till 2022 for Covid-19 vaccine, says WHOLauding the efforts of the Indian vaccine developers and manufacturers, the PM said that the government is committed to facilitate and support all these efforts. But India has to cater to the world as well, the PM said.As the vaccine trials are going on, the health ministry has started addressing aspects like vaccine storage, distribution, prioritisation etc. Under the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 that is chaired by Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, there are subgroups looking into these various aspects of vaccine development, procurement and distribution, including one that looks at cold chain requirements.The Centre has begun identifying both government and private facilities to create hubs for vaccine storage. The focus is on maintaining cold storage as most vaccines require to be stored and distributed at a fixed temperature, failing which the vaccine becomes ineffective.The Prime Minister during his Thursday’s meet took stock of health ministry’s distribution and delivery mechanism for vaccines.India has about 27,000 vaccine storage centres across all 700 plus districts that are connected through eVIN; with at least 50,000 temperature loggers to monitor storage temperatures as accurately as possible for at least 40,000 frontline workers to manage logistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-vaccine-development-progress-asks-to-focus-on-cost-effective-solutions/story-vQffk3iHDOs9NCfUlH4SDL.html
15-10-2020||India||India pummels Imran Khan’s adviser for fictional claim, then a parting shot||India on Thursday rubbished claims by an aide to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan that New Delhi had sent messages for talks, saying Islamabad’s support for terrorism and the Pakistani leadership’s hate speech were not conducive to normal relations. Moeed Yusuf, special assistant to Khan on national security and strategic policy, had said in an interview with the Indian media that New Delhi had sent messages to Islamabad with “a desire for conversation” but declined to give details. He also set pre-conditions for any dialogue, including the release of political prisoners in Kashmir and making Kashmiris party to potential talks. Also Read: India roasts Imran Khan adviser’s claim of New Delhi’s outreach to PakExternal affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava dismissed Yusuf’s claims during a weekly news briefing, saying: “As regards the purported message, let me make it clear that no such message was sent from our side.” Srivastava described Yusuf’s comments on India’s internal matters as an effort by Pakistan to “divert attention from domestic failures of the present government and mislead its domestic constituents by pulling India into headlines on a daily basis”. He asked Yusuf to “restrict his advice to [Pakistan’s] establishment and not to comment on India’s domestic policy”. He added, “The statements made by him are contrary to facts on the ground, misleading and fictitious.” India has consistently linked any talks with Pakistan to the issue of Islamabad ending support for terror groups operating from its soil. The two sides have not held any structured dialogue since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which were carried out by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, though there have been sporadic contacts between the leaders of the two sides in the years since then. Ties received a boost when Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to Lahore in December 2015 while returning to India from a trip to Afghanistan. The two sides agreed at the time to launch a “comprehensive dialogue” but these efforts were put on the backburner after a terror attack on the Pathankot airbase in January 2016. Srivastava reiterated India’s accusation that Pakistan “continues to support, aid and abet cross-border terrorism against India” and that it has been resorting to unprovoked ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir to support terrorist infiltration. “The Pakistani leadership continues to indulge in inappropriate, provocative and hate speech against India. Such support to terrorism against India and use of derogatory and abusive language are not conducive to normal neighbourly relations,” he said. During the interview, Yusuf blamed India for “deliberately delaying sending evidence and witnesses” for the trial of the seven men accused of involvement in the Mumbai attacks so that it can use the issue to run down Pakistan in front of the world community. He also levelled several allegations against India, including the funding of the Pakistani Taliban and having a hand in a terror attack on an army school in Peshawar in 2014, but didn’t offer any concrete evidence to back up these claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-message-was-sent-india-on-pak-official-s-claim-about-talks/story-gtpcWbnannAg1G8xRI0e5L.html

China has no locus standi to comment on India’s internal matters,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“Arunachal Pradesh is also an integral part of India.

We stand against the development of infrastructure facilities aimed at military contention along the border area,” said the Chinese spokesperson.“We stand against the development of infrastructure facilities aimed at military contention along the border area. Based on the two sides’ consensus, neither should take actions along the border that might escalate the situation that is to avoid undermining the two sides’ efforts to ease the situation,” Zhao added.Talking about infrastructure development in border areas, Srivastava on Thursday said the government is focused on creating infrastructure for improving livelihood, economic welfare of people. “Government gives specific attention to development of border areas for economic development and to meet India’s security,strategic requirements,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-no-locus-standi-to-comment-on-ladakh-arunachal-centre/story-hrgZroMwth9lNX9q6rc0QM.html

The victim, identified as Vilas Methar (40), was doused with petrol and set on fire. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition but succumbed to his injuries this morning. His attackers whose identities are yet to be established remain at large with police saying that they are investigating the case. “What happened yesterday, in which a man was set ablaze after being drenched with oil (petrol) is highly condemnable, people are now afraid.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant in a tweet late Wednesday night had termed the incident ‘heinous’ and vowed to bring the assailants to justice. “I have directed Goa Police to take strong action against the attackers in the dreadful incident… Such heinous crime is intolerable and will be dealt with an iron hand,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-set-ablaze-by-unknown-assailants-in-goa-succumbs-to-injuries/story-KSblIDnCH3QK8JN5FXpHbM.html
15-10-2020||India||Yogi Adityanath monitors progress as UP revives 2 dying rivers, 19 left||The Uttar Pradesh government has embarked upon bringing 21 rivers, considered dead or endangered, back to life. The plan involves two other aspects. One is that some 12 lakh people, mostly the migrant workers who returned during the lockdown, get employment through this endeavour. The other important aspect is that the revived rivers would be linked to increase irrigation facilities. Two of the rivers, Mandakini (which finds mention in the epic Ramayana) and Tamsa have been rejuvenated and work is on to revive the remaining 19, including Tedhi, Manorama, Pandu, Varuna, Sasur, Khadedi, Sai, Aril, Morva, Naad, Karnavati, Baan, Sot, Kaali, Poorvi, Daadhi, Eshan, Boodhi Ganga and Gomti, which pass through 39 districts of the state. For example, Aril passes through Rohilkhand region and Sai through Unnao-Hardoi-Lucknow but over the years these rivers nearly went dead. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the brain behind the plan, is personally monitoring the revival of these rivers. “Every river or water source has its bio- diversity. It is essential to maintain environmental balance. Besides maintaining water level of the land masses, a river also supports livelihood of people,” the chief minister said in a statement. “The death of a river deprives us of many such benefits for a healthy and prosperous generation. It is imperative to have rivers flowing naturally along the land masses,” he said. In March 2017, the chief minister had said revival and linking of the UP rivers was a priority as it would have a positive impact on agriculture. The state’s rural development department was working in close coordination with the Jal Shakti ministry. A state level committee headed by principal secretary, rural development, has been set up for time bound completion of work on each of the 19 rivers. The efforts are also aimed at giving employment to migrant workers - 40 lakh of whom returned during the lockdown enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus. “With the ongoing restoration of rivers more than 12 lakh job opportunities have been created for the local labour force,” said Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh. “They are working wholeheartedly as the rivers are still considered sacred in the rural hinterland; a massive plantation drive is on for protection of the environment and creating more job opportunities,” he said. In Kanpur, the work is on to revive two rivers Pandu and Eshan. A Chennai-based company has been roped in to clear the Pandu river through bioremediation technology, which involves using living organisms like microbes and bacteria to remove contaminants, pollutants and toxins from water. At the same time, four drains carrying industrial and domestic waste are being tapped. RK Singh, chief engineer, Kanpur Municipal Corporation, said the company would start treating the water at the origin point from November before it gets into the river. At present 140 MLD of waste was getting into the river from the four drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-monitors-progress-as-up-revives-2-dying-rivers-19-left/story-qmvaSna1xu5AAPyTrppUVN.html

15-10-2020||India||Legendary Malayalam poet and Jnanpith winner Akkitham dies at 94||Malayalam poet and Jnanpith winner Akkitham Achuthan Namboodiri died of age-related ailments at a private hospital in Thrissur on Thursday, his family members said. He was 94. A freedom fighter, Vedic scholar, journalist, social reformer, poet and writer all rolled into one, he authored 40 books and remained a colossus in the literary and social world for more than eight decades. Akkitham was conferred with the highest literary award of the country Jnanpith at a special function held at his house at Kumaranellur in Palakkad district of Kerala on September 24.He was honoured with Padma Shri in 2017 and was also the recipient of many other awards. His masterpiece ‘Irupatham Noottandinte Ithihasam’ (Epic of the 20th Century) is considered as one of the best literary works in Malayalam. One of the couplets in the book “Velicham dukkam annu Unni, thamas allo sukhapradam” (Worldly Knowledge Is Pain, My Child, Ignorance Is Bliss In This World”) is on the lips of even youngsters in the state. He was one of the writers who brought modernism in Malayalam literature. His literary works sparkled with values of humanity and brotherhood. Born in a conservative family in Kumaranellur village in Palakkad in 1926, Akkitham he was attracted to the freedom movement at a young age. He wrote his first poem at the age of eight on the walls of a temple in his village. He once said that one of the biggest regrets of life was that he could not meet his idol Mahatma Gandhi. But he remained a true Gandhian throughout his life. In the company of V T Bhattathiripad, a social reformer and writer and EMS Namboodripad, Marxist legend and former CM, he fought against social evils in upper caste societies like child marriage, promoted wedding of widows, community feasting and women’s education. Closely associated with the Communist movement he later distanced from the ideology after ‘Calcutta Thesis’ that called for a popular uprising and revolution. Later some of the liberal writers and a section of the party also dubbed him a camp follower of Sangh Parivar. But in one of the interviews he had said he was neither a Communist nor a RSS supporter, but a follower of humanity and brotherhood. When playback singer K J Yesudas was denied entry into Guruvayur Sreekrishna temple because he is a Christian, Akkitham was on the forefront to criticise it. “His song is waking up the God every day, why can’t he be allowed,” he had said. Akkitham also worked with All India Radio from where he retired in 1985. Both Akkitham and M T Vasudevan Nair, master storyteller and another Jnanpith laureate, belong to the same village and were thick friends. “He was an epitome of virtues. I lost my elder brother who guided me well,” Nair condoled the writer’s death. “A writer of rare integrity, he was a bridge between tradition and modernity in literature,” said writer and social activist Prof M N Karassery. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also paid tributes to the poet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legendary-malayalam-poet-and-jnanpith-winner-akkitham-dies-at-94/story-ioonJ2WwgiB1AqsxeeLBjO.html
15-10-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Investigation is still going on, says CBI||In the wake of reports that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has finished its probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the probe agency on Thursday confirmed that the probe is still going on.“Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continues to investigate the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. There are certain speculative reports in media that the CBI has reached a conclusion. It may be reiterated that these reports are speculative and erroneous,” the agency said issuing a statement.Various reports claimed that the Special Investigation Team, which was looking into the case, has wrapped up the investigation process and is going to submit the report soon. It has also been rumoured that the probe agency did not find any “foul play” in the actor’s death. The actor was found dead in his Mumbai residence on June 14. Mumbai Police, which said the actor died by suicide, was carrying out the initial investigation of the case. In August, the Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe into the case. The CBI approached the forensic department of the AIIMS for a second opinion on Rajput’s autopsy. The forensic team has submitted its report to the CBI and has reportedly asserted that there was no mark to prove that it was not a suicide. Several agencies are parallelly probing into the case: CBI is probing the ‘suicide’ case, while Enforcement Directorate is probing a money-laundering angle and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is probing a drugs-related angle. As several Bollywood stars were summoned by the NCB, Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh alleged that the investigation has been derailed. At that time too, CBI issued a statement saying all angles of this case are being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-investigation-is-still-going-on-says-cbi/story-KkkViSWTAPt9fG9JOjdxhM.html

15-10-2020||India||Supreme Court issues notice to Centre on PIL to regulate OTT platforms||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought the Centre’s response on a Public Interest Litigation( PIL) for regulating Over-the-top(OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime by an autonomous body.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notices to the Central Government, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoI&B) and Internet and Mobile Association of India(IAMAI).“We will issue notice,” the apex court said while hearing the plea filed by advocates Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia seeking a proper board/institution /association for the monitoring and management of content on different OTT/Streaming and digital media platforms.  “With cinemas theatres unlikely to open anytime soon in the country, OTT/Streaming and different digital media platforms have surely given a way out for film makers and artists to release their content without being worried about getting clearance certificates for their films and series from the censor board,” the plea said.At present, however, there is no law or autonomous body to monitor and manage these digital contents and it is made available to the public at large without any filter or screening, it said.“Lack of legislation governing OTT/Streaming Platforms is becoming evident with each passing day and every new case that is filed on these grounds.  “The Government is facing heat to fill this lacuna with regulations from the public and the Judiciary; still the relevant government departments have not done anything significant to regularise these OTT/Streaming Platforms,” the plea said.None of the OTT/Streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting since February 2020, it added.The ministry had earlier told the top court in a separate case that there is a need to regulate digital media and that the court may first appoint a committee of persons as amicus before laying down guidelines with respect to the regulation of hate speech in media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-to-regulate-ott-platforms/story-iOJ2Xkf8LLcf6tSnPIQWWM.html
15-10-2020||India||India approaches Pakistan court for release of four prisoners||The Indian mission in Pakistan has approached the Islamabad high court seeking the release of four Indian prisoners who were convicted by military courts and have completed their sentences. The writ petition—which was filed in the high court by Aparna Ray, first secretary in the Indian mission, through three Pakistani advocates—identified the prisoners as Birju Dung Dung, Vigyan Kumar, Satish Bhog and Sonu Singh and said they were currently being held in jails in Lahore and Karachi. All the prisoners have served the sentences given to them by field general courts martial of the Pakistani military—Dung in 2007, Singh in 2012, Kumar in 2014 and Bhog in 2015, the petition said. Also Read: India, Pakistan in war of words over Kashmir, terror at Commonwealth meetThe petition, which named Pakistan’s foreign and interior secretaries as respondents, said the prisoners were arrested by the Pakistani military and charged under the Pakistan Army Act and Official Secrets Act. It further said the prisoners had contended that they hadn’t committed any offence and “the entire proceedings initiated from the arrest till culmination in the ultimate conviction are an abuse of the process of law”. The petition also pointed out that Pakistan’s Constitution states that no person “shall be deprived of life or liberty in accordance with the law” and asked the high court to facilitate the release of the prisoners. The Indian mission noted in the petition that it had formally written to Pakistan’s Foreign Office on May 18 to remind authorities that the matter of releasing these four prisoners had been taken up through 31 notes verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence between October 2019 and May 2020. The communication stated that the nationality of the prisoners too had been confirmed.

India and Pakistan currently have hundreds of each other’s nationals in their jails, a majority of them fishermen arrested for straying across the maritime boundary. Work on identifying and releasing these prisoners through a joint judicial commission has been hit by the troubled bilateral relations in recent years. Besides exchanging lists of prisoners on two occasions every year, the two sides have not been able to make headway on proposed measures to speed up the release and repatriation of prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-approaches-pakistan-court-for-release-of-four-prisoners/story-jCvhGCKggVIxJ4bse24EkO.html

Sarma’s letter to all the Deputy Commissioners and District Registrar of Citizen Registration (DRCR) did not mention how many people will be excluded but people familiar with the developments told news agency PTI that around 10,000 people will be excluded.Sarma said in the letter, “...as per the reports received from your end through Webform, some names of ineligible persons belonging to the categories of DF (declared foreigners)/DV (’D’ voters)/PFT (pending in Foreigners Tribunals) along with their descendants have found entry to the NRC.”Chief minister Sarabananda Sonowal had earlier this month said that the government is committed to fulfil all clauses of the Assam Accord, including Clause 6, and publication of a flawless NRC, according to PTI.Here is everything you need to know about the massive government exercise:■The NRC is an exercise to verify citizenship in India. But despite being released in August last year, it still remains to be notified by the Registrar General of India.■The final NRC list excluded close to 20 lakh people. A total of 3.1 crore names were included out of 3.3 crore applicants.■After the publication of the final NRC, almost all stakeholders and political parties criticised it as a faulty document, alleging exclusion of indigenous people and the inclusion of illegal immigrants.■On August 31, 2020, a year after the final list was published, parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said in the Assembly that the Assam government had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court for re-verification of 20 per cent names in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10 per cent in the rest.■Organisations like the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) will be looking forward to it after Sonowal’s promise of fulfilling all clauses of the Assam Accord.■The Assam Accord was signed in the year 1985 which ended half a decade long, violent anti-immigrant movement in the state, which borders Bangladesh and was also among the states which saw a huge influx of Bengali refugees, both Hindus and Muslims, following the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971. Assam had also taken in refugees before 1971 after India’s independence.■The Clause 6 of the Assam Accord states that, “Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.”■The coronavirus pandemic has also affected the process of sending out rejection orders to people who have been excluded from the list. The rejection order can be challenged 120 days after it has been issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-nrc-list-the-eligibility-issue-and-other-latest-developments/story-cPjwwWUJLVDqGFbMDO1JJM.html

15-10-2020||India||Nitin Gadkari launches blasting process for Zojila tunnel construction work||Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday launched the first blasting for construction related work at the 14.15 km Zojila tunnel.One of the longest in Asia, the tunnel will provide all-year connectivity between Srinagar valley and Leh. The project holds strategic significance as Zojila Pass is situated at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National Highway and remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall. Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari termed it a moment of pride for India and said the re-modelling of the project will result in savings to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore to the public exchequer without any compromise on safety, security and quality. It involves construction of a 14.15-km long tunnel at an altitude of about 3,000 m under Zojila pass (presently motorable only for six months in a year) on NH-1 connecting Srinagar and Leh through Drass and Kargil. “This tunnel when completed will be a landmark achievement in the history of modern India. It will also be of great importance to the Defence of the country, in view of the fact that massive military activities along our borders in Ladakh, Gilgit and Baltistan regions are taking place,” a government press release said. Zojila Tunnel project shall bring to fruition, 30 years of overwhelming public demand of Kargil, Drass and Ladakh region, the statement said and added that the project will make the travel on Srinagar-Kargil-Leh Section of NH-1 free from avalanches, would enhance safety and would reduce the travel time from more than 3 hours to 15 minutes. The project was re-awarded this year to Megha Engineering & Infrastructure Ltd (MEIL) which had emerged as the lowest bidder quoting Rs 4,509.5 crore for the project. The other two bidders in the race were Larsen & Toubro and Ircon International JV. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018, had laid the foundation stone for the Rs 6,800 crore project, billed as Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir.However, the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) on January 15, 2019 terminated the contract awarded to troubled IL&FS group company -- IL&FS Transportation -- after it abandoned the project citing financial problems. “The construction cost of Zojila tunnel was earlier worked out at Rs 6,575.85 crore and after considering the escalation @ 5 per cent per annum and the total capital cost of the project as Rs 8,308 crore by NHIDCL. Thus, the total integrated cost of the project including Zojila tunnel and approaches up to Z- Morh tunnel works out to Rs 10,643 crores,” Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said. Compared to the present cost of the integrated project, based on the tender received at Rs 4,509.5 crore, the total capital cost of the project would be Rs 6,808.63 crore, it added. “Thus, after re-modelling of the project and reaping the benefit of integrated project management by segregating the egress tunnel & utilizing the excavated rock material in construction of approaches, generated from tunnel boring, resulted in an anticipated saving of Rs 3,835 crore,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-launches-blasting-process-for-zojila-tunnel-construction-work/story-XcDJpQ3OxvlLue9P0FWETN.html

Addressing both the questions, the chief scientist of WHO said by 2021, there will be at least one safe and effective vaccine. But it will be available in “limited quantities” and hence vulnerable people will be prioritised. “People tend to think that on the first of January or the first of April, I’m going to get the vaccine, and then things will be back to normal.It’s not going to work like that,” Swaminathan said. Countries like China and Russia which have been administering its population with vaccine shots are also following vaccine prioritisation pattern. Reports said China vaccinated its army in July and is now immunising government officials, store staff apart from health care professionals. It is also mulling vaccinating students who are headed abroad for studies. Russia prioritised journalists in vaccination apart from frontline health workers.In India, a high-level committee will chart out the prioritisation process. “Prioritisation of groups to be vaccinated shall be based on key considerations like occupational hazards, risk of exposure to the infection, overall health etc.,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has recently said. The states have been asked to submit lists of priority population groups that need to receive vaccine first -- doctors, nurses, sanitation staff, ASHA workers, surveillance officers etc. of both private and government sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-healthy-young-people-may-have-to-wait-till-2022-says-who/story-AlVS7dBVEdefO3LFmtiqIJ.html

Those suspended policemen include Kharakuan police station in charge ML Meena and sub-inspector Niranjan Sharma. Seven people, most of them labourers, were found dead in different localities of Ujjain on Wednesday. At least six of them had drunk an intoxicant called potali, Ujjain’s city superintendent of police (CSP), Rajnish Kashyap said. On Wednesday morning, two labourers were found dead in Kharakuan police circle while two others died during treatment in the district hospital in the evening, police said. The two who died in the hospital told the police that they had purchased ‘potali’ (also known as ginger liquor in the local areas) from a person in Kaharawadi area and that many of labourers used to frequent the locality for cheap liquor that cost between Rs 20 to Rs 50 per ‘potali’. Two of the four dead found on Thursday morning were identified as Ratan Malviya, a resident of Jharda village in Ujjain and Rakesh, a resident of Harda district. Their bodies were found in Narsingh ghat and Dhaba Road areas, police said. “All these 11 deaths are suspected to be linked to consumption of illicit hooch given the manner in which they have died. However, we have preserved viscera and a forensic examination of the same will establish the exact cause of death,” chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Ujjain Mahavir Khandelwal said. “There is a possibility of more such deaths if there were more labourers who consumed the same hooch,” he said.Confirming the arrest of 10 people in connection with sale of the illicit hooch Ujjain’s superintendent of police (SP), Manoj Singh said, “Some of the deaths are linked with consumption of ginger liquor. However, the exact cause of deaths can be known after post-mortem. Four police personnel have been suspended.” Taking a dig at the BJP government, state Congress president Kamal Nath said, “There are complaints regarding liquor mafia’s operation in several districts of the state. They have no fear of the law as there is no Congress government now. We had launched an operation against all kinds of mafia across the state. The BJP government is engaged in bypolls and the law and order situation in the state is deteriorating by the day.”The BJP said the government has acted promptly by forming an SIT.“The state government has already ordered an SIT investigation and several accused have been arrested in a prompt action. The Congress should desist from playing politics on such a sensitive issue like deaths of labourers,” BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said.

JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department said the purpose of radio-collaring the pachyderm was to prevent man-animal conflict during the Maha Kumbh next year.“The state forest department along with a team from Wildlife institute of India has successfully radio-collared a male tusker in Dassowal area of Rasiyabud range in Haridwar forest division. We will now monitor the movement of this tusker with the aim of preventing man-animal conflict during the 2021 Maha Kumbh,” said Suhag.Earlier this month, Uttarakhand government had received permission from the Central government to radio-collar ten elephants and study their movement, as they usually stray in areas of human habitation. The Jumbo population has increased in the state and so have man-elephant conflicts. In June, according to the elephant census conducted earlier this year, the numbers of the elephants in the state had reached 2,026. In 2012, there were 1,559 elephants, while in 2017 there were 1,839 elephants in the state. Neeraj Sharma, divisional forest officer for Haridwar forest division, said in the past three months, ten elephants have been identified for radio-collaring after continuous monitoring.“One such elephant was radio collared on Thursday in the presence of senior scientists from WII and veterinarians from the state forest department. The state forest department will now get hourly updates of the movement of the elephant and this will not only help us prevent man-elephant conflicts during Maha Kumbh but we will also be able to check if the elephant is moving near agricultural fields and will move it from there on time,” said Sharma. Last September, the Rajaji Tiger Reserve landscape in the state was chosen as the pilot area for a project on man-wildlife conflict mitigation launched by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). The forest officials had started their preparations for Maha Kumbh 2021 since last November, when man-animal hotspots were identified and geo-tagged. Response teams at multiple levels were formed and a geo-tagged map was prepared by the Haridwar forest division by collating information on all the conflict incidents over the past two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-elephant-radio-collared-in-uttarakhand-with-eye-on-maha-kumbh-2021/story-oX0w0fhijYCJuvbNZcNLDN.html

Kerala’s BJP chief K Surendran accused the government of shielding the smugglers and demanded that the chief minister resign as he has “lost moral rights to continue.” “The relationship of the accused in the gold smuggling case with D company and ISIS has been established,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Congress’ Ramesh Chennithala called the news shocking and said it was the biggest crime that has happened in the state. He too accused the Vijayan government of “supporting” the accused. “Unfortunately, the state government was supporting the culprits. NIA will unearth details of this crime,” he told ANI. The accused in the gold smuggling case had challenged the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), arguing that smuggling comes under economic offence and no terror angle was involved in the case. The NIA countered the claim saying some of the accused in the case have links with anti-national forces. They visited Tanzania several times where the underworld don has an extensive network, the agency told the court. It further said that accused No 5 KT Ramees and accused No 13 M Sharafuddin had visited Tanzania a number of times and met Dawood’s contact Feroze ‘Oasis’ to discuss ways to smuggle firearms into the country.Ramees was earlier caught with smuggled revolvers at the Kozhikode airport but he later got away, saying he was a member of the shooting association and remitted fine. Another arrested in the case Muhamad Ali was accused of chopping off the palm of a college teacher who prepared a controversial question paper. He was later acquitted in 2015. He had close links with some of the fundamentalist outfits conspiring against the country, according to NIA. This first smuggling case in which the anti-terror law was invoked surfaced on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized by the customs from a package camouflaged as diplomatic consignment marked to the UAE consulate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-accused-linked-with-dawood-opposition-demands-kerala-cm-s-resignation/story-4JFczasEidJAQgsvNI6pPL.html

What Delhi people did in the last 15 days to have led to the worsening air quality, the minister asked the Centre. “It seems the Centre has become spokesperson of states where stubble burning takes place and is competing with Delhi. We are taking measures to fight pollution in Delhi and want cooperation from the Centre on source of pollution outside Delhi,” Rai said.“The Union Environment Minister today said that stubble burning contributes only 4% to pollution in Delhi. Air Quality Index was normal 15 days ago, I want to ask him as to what people of Delhi did in 15 days which led to this kind of situation,” Rai said attributing the rising pollution level of the capital city to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana.The gains of lockdown started diminishing in the last two weeks as air quality of Delhi started to feature in ‘poor’ category. On Thursday at 11.10am, the air quality index was 315, which falls under ‘very poor’ category. On Wednesday, the overall air quality index was 276 in the “poor” category.The AAP-led Delhi government has been taking a slew of measures to mitigate the impact of rising pollution levels. On Wednesday, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee banned the use of fuel-powered generators from October 15 under the Graded Response Action Plan, which is a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels. Grap also includes severe steps like a ban on trucks, odd-even road restrictions, curbs on construction work, and an advisory to shut schools. On Thursday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a new anti-pollution campaign under which people will be encouraged to switch engines of their vehicles off while waiting at traffic signals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-did-delhi-people-do-in-last-15-days-delhi-versus-centre-on-pollution/story-ofWLOgm5lwFG8jloQUzGSI.html

A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde indicated that the monitoring would be by Allahabad High Court. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that it had no objections to the trial being monitored by any court but objected to interventions by activist Teesta Setalvad. The victim’s lawyer Seema Kushwaha demanded the trial to be shifted to Delhi and that status reports of investigation be submitted to the apex court. When a host of other lawyers and organisations poured in with their suggestions, the bench remarked, “We don’t need the assistance of the whole world in this matter.”The accused were represented before the court by senior advocate Sidharth Luthra who objected to investigation records being put out in the media in order to influence trial. The top court directed him to approach the concerned court in UP. The petition seeking Supreme Court-monitored probe and investigation by CBI was filed by one Satyama Dubey. The UP government had upfront agreed for CBI probe monitored by the apex court. During pendency of this case in Supreme Court, the UP government recommended a CBI probe.

Though infighting is not new in the TMC, the current phase has its roots in the induction of younger faces in district committees after a reshuffle in July on Kishor’s recommendations. The structural changes have made many old-timers insecure. Banerjee and Kishor discreetly held meetings with leaders from five north Bengal districts at a hotel near the Tenzing Norgay bus terminus in Siliguri on Monday and Tuesday. The districts are Darjeeling, Alipurduar, South Dinajpur, Cooch Behar and Malda. On Wednesday, a similar meeting was held, though not so discreetly, with legislators, MPs and officer bearers from Hooghly district at Kishor’s office on Camac Street in the heart of Kolkata. TMC’s Bengal unit president Subrata Bakshi was also present. Some of the legislators and TMC office bearers who were summoned to the Siliguri hotel said on condition of anonymity that Banerjee and Kishor – the two have been working in close coordination with each other since 2019 – met some leaders individually while the rest were called in groups. Among the attendees, the most senior person was minister Goutam Deb who is from Siliguri town and represents the Dabgram-Phulbari constituency in Jalpaiguri. The only one who was reportedly not seen at the meetings despite being summoned was Mihir Goswami, the legislator from Cooch Behar South constituency, TMC leaders said. “During the talks, Kishor dished out data on incidents of infighting and insubordination in each district. He mentioned incidents where anti-party statements were made in public. Abhishek Banerjee, on the other hand, gave clear instructions after hearing us during one-on-one meets to end infighting,” said a north Bengal leader, who did not want to be identified. North Bengal is crucial for both the TMC and the BJP after the latter wrested seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the region in 2019 and managed to win 18 of the state’s 42 seats. It was after this debacle that Kishor - who earlier helped the BJP, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and the YSR Congress Party win elections - was roped in by Mamata Banerjee. In 2019, the TMC’s tally in the Lok Sabha came down from 34 seats to 22, giving the BJP a position to pose a challenge to Banerjee in 2021. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight seats in north Bengal, the BJP is ahead of the TMC in 35. The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats. BJP president J P Nadda will be visiting north Bengal on October 19 to interact with party workers and leaders and some prominent non-political persons as the party gears up for 2021 elections.Explaining how the meetings went, a TMC leader said that Udayan Guha, who represents the Dinhata constituency in Cooch Behar, was cautioned for making an explosive statement at a party meeting on October 9 which put the party in the opposition’s line of fire. In a video that went viral, Guha could be heard saying in Bengali, “you have eaten a lot. If you stop eating now, people will give you the opportunity to eat again in future.” It was apparent that he was talking of corruption. A leader said that office-bearers from South Dinajpur and Malda, where infighting has cropped up, were asked to work together. The meeting with leaders from the Hooghly district had to be held in Kolkata on Wednesday because two Lok Sabha members Kalyan Banerjee and Aparupa Poddar and three legislators, Tapan Dasgupata, Prabir Ghosal and Becharam Manna had all expressed their grievance against TMC district president Dilip Yadav. They said Yadav was taking autocratic decisions. Hooghly district is crucial for the TMC. The agitation against acquisition of farmland for the proposed Tata Motors plant helped Mamata oust the Left Front government in 2011 but in 2019 the BJP wrested one out of three Lok Sabha seats in the district. “While the meeting was on, the chief minister called Abhishek Banerjee and asked him to form a core committee with all those who are unhappy with Yadav. She said Yadav should be there in the committee along with Ashima Patra, the MLA from Dhanekhali and Snehasish Chakraborty, the MLA from Jangipara,” said a leader who attended the meeting. The first meeting of this core committee will be held on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhishek-banerjee-prashant-kishor-hit-the-road-to-stop-infighting-in-tmc/story-sjHxNDkQmizG5m634IBodJ.html

A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde said, “we will issue notice. Here there is apprehension that the entire regime of payments will commence before the entire regulatory framework is put in place.”Senior advocate Shyam Divan appearing for Viswam said that RBI issued an order in April 2018 asking these multinational firms to ensure data transacted on these forums is secured in a server within India. This was to be complied by October 2018 but was not done, Divan added. He further informed the court that WhatsApp stores data with its parent company Facebook having server outside India.The court has also issued notices to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The petition filed through advocate P Sriram said, “The RBI and NPCI, instead of looking into such allegations (of data protection) have turned a blind eye and have permitted the operation of Amazon, Google, and WhatsApp in the UPI platform even contrary to public interest. This at a time when India has banned host of Chinese applications on the ground that these applications were or could be used for data theft.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-centre-google-amazon-and-facebook-on-petition-seeking-data-protection-of-transactions-made-over-upis/story-ieNwZTpiyR00vue3tQpWCK.html
15-10-2020||India||Rating agency BARC to pause audience estimates of news channels amid TRP fraud probe||Rating agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) has decided to temporarily suspend news channels’ ratings following the fake TRP scam, the agency said in a statement on Thursday.“BARC Board has proposed that it’s Technical Committee (Tech Comm) review and augment the current standards of measuring and reporting the data of niche genres, to improve their statistical robustness and to significantly hamper the potential attempts of infiltrating the panel homes,” the agency said in a statement, adding that starting with the news genre, BARC will cease publishing the weekly individual ratings for all news channels during the exercise. The exercise, which the agency said is likely to take eight to twelve weeks, will cover all Hindi, regional, English news and business news channels. Also Read: ‘Your office is at Worli’, SC tells Republic TV to approach Bombay HC in TRP caseBARC, however, will continue to release weekly audience estimates for the genre of news by state and language, the statement added. Punit Goenka, Chairman of BARC India Board, said that the temporary suspension of ratings was necessitated “to enable the industry and the agency to work closely to review its already stringent protocols and further augment them to enable focus on collaborating for growth and well-natured competitiveness”.The rating agency’s CEO Sunil Lulla said, “We at BARC take our role in truthfully and faithfully reporting ‘What India Watches’ with the greatest sense of responsibility and work with integrity to ensure that our audience estimates (ratings) remain true to their purpose”.He added that BARC is actively exploring options to discourage unlawful inducement of its panel home viewers and further strengthening its code of conduct to address viewership malpractice, besides augmenting current protocols and benchmarking them with global standards. The alleged fake TRP scam came to light when BARC filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. It was alleged that some families at whose houses metres for collecting data of viewership were installed were being bribed to tune into a particular channel.Last week, Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had claimed that Republic TV and two Marathi channels - Box Cinema and Fakt Marathi - manipulated TRP for better advertisement revenue. The Mumbai police then registered a case in the TRP scam against Republic TV and summoned the channel’s chief financial officer (CFO) S Sundaram for investigation.The police have already arrested owners of channels Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema in the case.Republic TV , meanwhile, has rubbished Singh’s claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rating-agency-barc-to-pause-audience-estimates-of-news-channels-amid-fake-trp-fraud-probe/story-WmsMNjwvvoSF7HEkGg4pKI.html

The protestors apprehend that the project would not just destroy the fragile ecosystem of the area which comprises Teetsa river basin and the Khangchendzonga National Park, which is a UNESCO World heritage site, but would also destroy the Dzongu, the last bastion of the Lepchas. “Nearly 99% of landmass in Sikkim and Darjeeling hills is held by Teesta basin. It is very important to allow the Teesta river, already destroyed for hydro power projects, to flow freely. The upcoming project is going to destroy the last bastion of the Lepchas. Around 60% of Dzongu falls under Khangchendzonga national park, a UNESCO World heritage site,” said Gyatso Lepcha, general secretary of affected citizens of Teesta (ACT). Dzongu is a protected area as per a 1956 notification when Sikkim was a separate country. Lepchas consider it to be their holy land and outsiders need permission to visit the place. Seven hydropower electric projects in Sikkim including the biggest-- 1,200 mw Teesta Urja-- have already been commissioned, while two more are likely to come up. On Teesta River only, there are four big projects inside Sikkim while two are in West Bengal. Environmentalists have been saying that power projects in the ecologically sensitive Teesta basin region will be harmful. Also Read: Foundation stone of Nechiphu Tunnel on road to China border in Arunachal laid by Rajnath Singh “This project is even economically unviable. It will hugely increase the disaster vulnerability of the Teesta basin in multiple ways. We have the examples of Teesta Stage VI proving unviable, Teesta V increasing disaster potential and Teesta III in terms of corruption,” Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of south Asia network on dams, rivers and people (SANDRP) said. Way back in 2006, the National hydro power corporation (NHPC) had signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government to build the state’s second biggest hydropower project, which had to be stalled later following agitations by the ACT. Also Read: 54 done, BRO rushes to build 48 bridges that can shoulder T-90 main battle tanksThe ACT launched a 915-day-long hunger strike in Gangtok, stretching from 2007 to 2009, forcing the state government to scrap at least seven hydro power projects, some of them in Dzongu. The Teesta Stage IV project was also stalled after local people boycotted the mandatory public hearing in protest. Both the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) government and the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) party- when it was in the opposition-- had promised not to go ahead with the project unless and until local people gave their consent. The Sikkim government on July 18, 2020 constituted an expert group for social impact assessment in respect to acquisition of land by NHPC, which is carrying out the project. The move has triggered tension among the Lepchas. “We are preparing for our agitation and are writing to the state government,” Lepcha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-s-lepcha-tribe-vows-to-stall-hydropower-project-in-their-holy-land/story-2WI8qE5RbcRNZ4Hdr7FEMP.html

The team, headed by assistant chief of air staff (projects), reached France earlier this week for a scheduled review of the project, the officials said. Five Rafale jets of the 36 ordered by the IAF reached the Ambala airbase on July 29 after a stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi, although a formal induction ceremony took place later on September 10. The officials said next batch of three or four Rafale jets is expected to arrive in the next few weeks (the date is being finalised) and will further boost the IAF’s capability to rapidly deploy the advanced jets amid tensions with neighbouring China and Pakistan. Also Read: IAF has shown capability to engage adversary: Air chiefThe IAF is expecting three or four Rafale jets to be delivered every two months, with all the planes likely to join the air force’s combat fleet by the year-end. ALSO WATCH | Watch: IAF’s Chinook helicopter carries out night sortie in Ladakh The Rafale fighters—the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997—have significantly enhanced the offensive capabilities of the IAF. The IAF is operating the Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert to deal with any provocation by China even as military and diplomatic talks have failed to reduce friction in the sensitive Ladakh theatre. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria recently said the integration of Rafale fighter jets brought in a platform armed with advanced weapons, sensors and technologies that gave the IAF an operational and technological edge. “Combined with upgraded operational capabilities of our current fighter fleet, it gives us the ability to shoot first and strike deep and hard, even in contested airspace,” the IAF chief said.

The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions —ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry almost 10 tonnes of weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-team-in-france-to-review-rafale-project-as-india-prepares-to-induct-more-jets/story-FTnzBkNnkEMJxiYpL1jYDJ.html

There is also an approach road of 18 kilometre from end of Z-Morh tunnel to the start of Zojila tunnel with avalanche protection structures such as catch dams, snow galleries, cut and cover, deflector dam, etc to make it an all-weather connection between two tunnels.At present it is one of the most dangerous stretches in the world to drive a vehicle and this project is also geo-strategically sensitive. The stretch remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall. The project was first conceived in 2005 but could not be taken ahead. In May 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone at Leh but work could not be progressed after July 2019 as IL&FS, the firm that was given the contract, ran into financial problems. The project was terminated on January 15, 2019. Gadkari then reviewed the languishing project in February 2020 and referred it to an expert group to reduce the cost and to execute it on priority. After due consultation with tunnel experts and other stakeholders, the expert group submitted its report on May 17, 2020, which was approved by the minister, the statement added. “The construction cost of Zojila tunnel was earlier worked out at Rs 6,575.85 crore and after considering the escalation @ 5 per cent per annum and the total capital cost of the project as Rs 8,308 crore by NHIDCL. Thus, the total integrated cost of the project including Zojila tunnel and approaches up to Z-Morh tunnel works out to Rs 10,643 crores,” the statement said.Compared to the present cost of the integrated project, based on the tender received at Rs 4,509.5 crore, the total capital cost of the project would be Rs 6,808.63 crore, it added.“Thus, after re-modelling of the project and reaping the benefit of integrated project management by segregating the egress tunnel & utilising the excavated rock material in construction of approaches, generated from tunnel boring, resulted in an anticipated saving of Rs 3,835 crore,” according to the statement. The tunnel project shall bring to fruition 30 years of overwhelming public demand of Kargil, Drass and Ladakh region and will make the travel on Srinagar-Kargil-Leh Section of NH-1 free from avalanches. Project would enhance the safety of the travellers crossing Zojila Pass and would reduce the travel time from more than 3 hours to 15 minutes, it added. The project will also generate employment for the locals.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-to-initiate-first-blasting-of-all-weather-zojila-tunnel-between-srinagar-and-leh/story-M1IzoZ93isMJjqgRP8C4YO.html

As defence minister, Ishwar Pokhrel had been one of India’s sharpest critics in PM Oli’s cabinet.The change of guard at the defence ministry - PM Oli will hold the charge of this portfolio - has been timed ahead of the Nepal visit of Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane on November 3.Pokhrel has been attached to the Prime Minister’s Office, an assignment that Nepal media said, effectively means he will be a minister without portfolio.Back in May this year when General Naravane had hinted at China’s role in Nepal’s shrill reaction to an 80-km road to Lipulekh built for pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar in Tibet, Ishwar Pokhrel had sought to provoke Gurkha soldiers who have been an integral part of the Indian Army for decades.ALSO WATCH | India-Nepal tussle: Oli govt forced to defer new map claiming Indian territory Gen Naravane’s comment had “hurt the sentiments of the Nepali Gurkha army personnel who lay down their lives to protect India”, Pokhrel had said, claiming that Gurkha soldiers in the Indian army wouldn’t respect their superiors after Gen Naravane’s comment. There were other offensive remarks by the minister as well.Nepal watchers say Pokhrel had recently also opposed General Naravane’s November 3 visit to the Himalayan country and wanted India to first sit across the table to discuss the boundary dispute between the two countries.Pokhrel would often have run-ins with his own army chief General Purna Chandra Thapa as well. Gen Thapa, for one, had refused to play his game over the Lipulekh row when he declined to issue a statement. A report in the Kathmandu Post said General Thapa had also been upset about the minister dragging the armed forces in a row over the purchase of medical equipment to fight Covid-19.Also Read: PM Oli breaks ice with PM Modi on I-Day, tweets from top Nepal leaders followPokhrel, who was considered one of PM Oli’s most-trusted lieutenants, faced corruption charges in the procurement of medical equipment from China and has also been blamed for messing up Nepal’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. PM Oli had appointed him to lead the country’s high-level Covid-19 crisis management centre.During his Nepal visit, General Naravane would be conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army by Nepal’s President Vidya Devi Bhandari in keeping with a long-standing convention between the armies of the two countries on a reciprocal basis. Nepal Army Chief Gen Thapa was conferred the honorary rank of general of the Indian army in January 2019.PM Oli had laid the groundwork for his India outreach in August when he dialed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to greet him on the occasion of India’s 74th Independence Day. Last month, he stopped the distribution of a new text book that included the country’s revised political map that has riled India.

Cumulatively, these electric locomotives have already clocked over 1 million kilometres, thus providing a significant fillip to the country’s freight logistics landscape,” Alstom said in a statement on Wednesday.Electric locos allow heavy freight trains to haul 6,000 tonnes at a top speed of 120 kmph. The trains are planned to be deployed for operations on major freight routes including the Dedicated Freight Corridors. They are expected to increase the average speed of freight trains in India by at least 20-25 kmph, the company said.Also read: Railways to upgrade high speed trains with only special AC coaches“In line with India’s push towards self-reliance, we have successfully leveraged our local engineering and manufacturing capabilities. Alstom is also committed to support IR [Indian Railways] in reducing its carbon footprint and adopt cleaner technologies in its quest to transform into the world’s largest Green Railway network,” Alain SPOHR, managing director of Alstom India and South Asia, said in a statement on Wednesday.“Equipped with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based propulsion technology, it would lead to considerable savings in energy consumption due to the use of regenerative braking.

15-10-2020||India||BJP laps up ‘Bhookhe Nange’ slur to make MP polls Chauhan vs Nath battle||The Bharatiya Janata Party has turned the campaign for the upcoming by-election in Madhya Pradesh into a contest between “son of the soil” Shivraj Singh and “entrepreneur” Kamal Nath. Congress leader Dinesh Gurjar’s “Bhookhe-Nange” (impoverished) jibe at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has given the BJP the arsenal to accuse the Congress of being anti-poor. VD Sharma, president of the BJP‘s state unit told HT that the statement reflects how detached Congress is from the ground and the contempt its leaders hold for the poor.“We are going to the people with a simple message that Kamal Nath is not a public figure, he is an ‘Udyogpati’ (entrepreneur) who came to Madhya Pradesh to fill his coffers. He is not a leader, but only a manager who was a ‘darbari’ (courtier) for the Congress and the Gandhi family. The campaign lays bare the five months of Kamal Nath government’s misrule in the state,” Sharma said. In the campaign rallies and the outreach through social media, the BJP has been alleging that the Kamal Nath government transferred schemes meant for the development of the whole state to his own constituency in Chhindwara. “Take the case of an agriculture college that was sanctioned for the Bundelkhand area, it was forcibly moved to Chhindwara. A Rs 1400 crore super-specialty medical college and irrigation projects meant for Bundelkhand and Bhind were also transferred to Chhindwara and 2.43 lakh houses under the PM Awas Yojana could not be built because the state government refused to release its share of 24% of funds for their construction,” Sharma said. Also Read: Bihar assembly election: 30% of phase-1 candidates have criminal recordsBypolls will be held in the state on November 3 to fill 28 seats in the legislative assembly. Of these 28 vacancies, 22 arose after congress MLAs along with senior Congress leader and former minister Jyotiraditya Scindia broke away from the Kamal Nath government and joined the BJP. The BJP which has 107 MLAs needs 9 more to reach the half-way mark in the house, while the Congress with 88 needs to win all the 28 seats if it hopes to return to power. On how the party will defend the government’s Covid-19 containment response and the large scale movement of migrant workers during the pandemic, Sharma said, the state would have been worse-off had the Congress been in power. Also Read: How will the LJP factor play out in the Bihar Assembly Election 2020?“Swift action was taken to ensure that the hospitals are equipped and there is provision for medicines and oxygen. In five months Rs 22,000 crore was transferred to farmers; similarly welfare schemes discontinued by Kamal Nath were restarted, so there is no anger against the government,” he said. According to functionaries involved in the electioneering process, the BJP has set a target of winning over 25 seats to give the government the cushion it needs to formulate policy without requiring support from independents or friendly parties. “Campaigning is being done across the election bound constituencies keeping the Covid protocol in mind. But our Panna Pramukhs have been given the duty to ensure that people come out to vote in large numbers. They have been tasked to alleviate the fear that voters might have about voting during the pandemic,” Sharma said. Political analysts Shirish Kashikar said the jibe at Chauhan will work in favour of the BJP. “While the party will definitely gain from highlighting this jibe; the goodwill that Scindia has in the region is a big factor that will help the party gain electorally,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-laps-up-bhookhe-nange-slur-to-make-mp-polls-chauhan-vs-nath-battle/story-S2hww0AUV60FTmoqlq6hLO.html

But since parting ways, the allies have been attacking each other.Ahead of Rajarajeshwari Nagar (a locality in Bengaluru) assembly bypoll, JD(S) leader and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy fired another dart at his party’s erstwhile ally.“Congress party’s game plan will not work this time in RR Nagar. How will they face the voters when they could not do anything for the constituency despite winning the elections from here twice?” Kumaraswmay said on Wednesday as he accompanied his party candidate V Krishnamurthy who filed nomination for the bypoll.The election is going to be interesting as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have also fielded their candidates. While N Munirathna is fighting the bypoll on BJP ticket, H Kusuma is the Congress candidate for the November 3 bypoll.Munirathna was twice elected on Congress ticket from RR Nagar constituency - once in 2013 and second time in 2018.However, his resignation from the Assembly last year under anti-defection law along with 15 other MLAs of Congress and the JD(S) necessitated the bypolls in the constituency.After resigning from the assembly, he joined the BJP and now, he is contesting the polls on the BJP ticket.Congress candidate Kusuma, wife of deceased IAS officer DK Ravi, was accompanied by former chief minister Siddaramaiah and Congress state chief D K Shivakumar as she filed the nomination papers.Shivakumar said the election was crucial as it is a way to send a message to the state government as well as the Centre.Earlier this month, Kumaraswamy had made a scathing attack on Congress, saying it was not a party worthy of an alliance and it does not honour coalition dharma.“Who had placed the proposal from the JD(S) to have an alliance with the Congress? None of us have gone to Congress’ doors like they had come to H D Deve Gowda’s (JDS supremo) doors after the 2018 assembly polls,” Kumaraswamy tweeted.Both Congress and JD(S) had formed a coalition government led by Kumaraswamy after the 2018 assembly polls, but parted ways following the collapse of government due to internal differences and defection from several legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-game-plan-won-t-work-this-time-hd-kumaraswamy-attacks-former-ally/story-57ertwQndLQGrVEWfLZBnJ.html

15-10-2020||India||Schools, cinemas, religious gatherings resume today: All you need to know||After remaining shut for nearly seven months due to the lockdown imposed across the country in view of the coronavirus pandemic, cinemas and schools across several states are set to reopen on Thursday while religious gatherings too have been allowed with restrictions. Even as recent trends suggest the peak of the Covid-19 infection in India may be over, the latest ‘unlock’ measures - reopening of schools, cinemas and religious gatherings - pose a big risk given that Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease, may easily spread in closed spaces like movie theatres and auditoriums, children may contract the disease and take it home where there may be more vulnerable people, and if people do not remain cautious crowds at festivals may catch the infection. Owing to the risks involved in returning to normalcy, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday said, “The next two-and-a-half months are going to be very crucial for us in our fight against corona because of the winter season and the festival season. It becomes the responsibility of every citizen to not let our guard down and follow Covid appropriate behaviour to curb spread of the infection.”Here is everything you need to know about the latest phase of unlockingSchools -- The Centre has allowed states to let students to get back to classrooms starting Thursday, the final call, however, remains with the state governments. A few states resumed classes from September 21, as advised by the Centre earlier.--While schools are partially opening for Classes 9 and upwards in several states with the consent of parents, they will remain closed in Delhi, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh. --Uttar Pradesh government has decided to reopen schools from the beginning of the next week - October 19.Movie theatres, multiplexes--The state governments in Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, UP, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka have decided to reopen cinemas. They are required to follow guidelines stated by the Centre.--Since no fresh titles have been released ever since the pandemic began, most halls will rerun old hits. “We’ve picked some old blockbusters like Simmba, Chhichhore, Malang, Section 375 depending which movie fits best in which pocket and was preferred in that place. So, cinemas in Delhi would show a different film than a cinema in Gurugram or Kanpur,” said Kunal Sawhney, senior vice president of operations, Carnival Cinemas. --Cinemas are allowed to operate with 50% occupancy so as to maintain adequate physical distance between people. Not only on seats, floor marking will be done at box office counters too to ensure social distancing. --Show timings of the screenings will be staggered to avoid overcrowding. Advance bookings have also been made available for the purpose. --People have been advised to use digital modes of payment at the theatre. Multiple sale counters for food and beverages will be open, people will be allowed to carry only packed food and no delivery will be permitted inside the auditorium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-cinemas-religious-gatherings-resume-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-KsOurqbw56KFvvNwd75H2K.html

The depression is likely to intensify following its merger with the Arabian Sea.It is likely to move west-north-westwards and emerge into east-central Arabian Sea off Maharashtra coast on Friday (October 16) morning.

He lived near the girls’ house in Paska town.“Police launched a search for the accused and late evening [on Tuesday], a police team saw him [Chaurasiya] arriving on a motorcycle. His bike slipped when he saw the police jeep and he opened fire at police, and police personnel retaliated in self-defence during which the accused got injured. He has been arrested and sent to a hospital for treatment,” the ASP said.Chaurasiya’s arrest led to a protest by local traders and residents of Paska town as they blamed the police for framing Chaurasiya in the case. Chaurasiya’s mother Laxmi Chaurasiya demanded a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation in the case.The ASP rejected the allegations and said that two of the three girls had told the police that they had seen Chaurasiya escaping from the house after throwing the acid-like liquid on them. The ASP also said the accused confessed to committing the crime during interrogation. Three Dalit sisters were attacked with a chemical while they were sleeping inside their house in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda in the early hours of Tuesday. The eldest sister suffered major injuries on her face and chest while the other two suffered minor burns on hands. Superintendent of police Shailesh Kumar Pandey had said on Tuesday that all three girls are out of danger.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-yr-old-arrested-for-throwing-acid-on-3-sisters-in-up-s-gonda-district/story-RJf5L6ls76i5OThjJXoQvI.html

Nepal’s defence ministry announced on Wednesday that Naravane will visit in November. “The visit was approved by the government of Nepal on 3rd February 2020 but was postponed due to [the Covid-19] lockdown in both the countries,” it said in a statement. In keeping with a long-standing convention between the armies of the two countries, Nepal’s President Vidya Devi Bhandari will “confer the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army to General Naravane in an investiture ceremony during this visit”, the statement said. Though the statement did not give the dates for the trip, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian Army chief is expected to be in Nepal during November 3-5. Naravane’s visit will provide an opportunity for the two sides to push defence and security cooperation after bilateral relations were affected by a border row that erupted in May. At the time, Nepal objected to the opening of a new road to Lipulekh region on the border with Tibet by India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh. Nepal then issued a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory, exacerbating the row.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-general-mm-naravane-to-visit-nepal-next-month/story-uiaPbg8FoWvULd2mDF3FFL.html
15-10-2020||India||After ad row, Tanishq store made to put out apology||A Tanishq jewellery store in Gandhidham town in Gujarat’s Kutch district put up a note apologising for a recent advertisement featuring a Muslim woman with a Hindu daughter-in-law, police said on Wednesday.The police statement came after TV reports said a group of people angry with the advertisement barged into the store and threatened the manager. The store owner and the police, however, denied the reports. “The store owner told us that he was not threatened. As demanded by some people, he had put up that apology in Gujarati as Tanishq had issued the same in English at the national level. There is no element of threat or attack involved,” said Mayur Patil, superintendent of police, Kutch-East.The advertisement in question, for Tanishq’s new collection called Ekatvam (which means oneness), showed a Muslim family organising a baby shower for their Hindu daughter-in-law. The Tanishq jewellery brand is a division of the Titan company, promoted by the Tata Group in collaboration with the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation.Some people had asked the store owner to put up the apology in Gujarati so that more people could understand it, police said. The note condemned the advertisement, which has been withdrawn from all platforms after it received a backlash with #BoycottTanishq trending on social media. “We apologise to the Hindu community of Kutch on the shameful advertisement of Tanishq,” the handwritten note said.The note was put up on the store’s door on October 12, and has since been removed, police said. The SP said the showroom had received some threatening calls on October 12 regarding the advertisement after which security was stepped up around the showroom. “But there was no attack,” he said.Later, a person who purportedly asked the showroom manager to apologise, Ramesh Maitra, said he went to the showroom and his intention was not to hurt anyone’s business.“Yes, I went there to apprise the showroom people about the feelings of the Hindu samaj (society) of the area and asked them to write an apology for the advertisement. I did not intend to hurt the business of anyone,” he said in a video issued on Wednesday.Photos of the apology note have since been widely shared on social media.Advertising bodies came out in support of the advertisement featuring the interfaith family.“Such baseless and irrelevant attack on creative expression is extremely concerning,” The Advertising Club said on Twitter. “The Advertising Club on behalf of the Indian Media and Advertising industry strongly condemns the threatening and targeting of Tanishq and its employees in regards to their latest advertisement on the new jewellery line.”The Indian chapter of the International Advertising Association said the events that led to the withdrawal of the advertisement were “very unfortunate”, and demanded action from the government against “intimidating behaviour”.“While we respect the opinion of every individual on subjective matters, these should not descend to illegal threats and anti-social behavior. We appeal to the concerned governments to take a serious view of such intimidating behaviour and take exemplary action where required to ensure that businesses are provided a safe environment to communicate their brand advertising messages,” the association tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ad-row-tanishq-store-made-to-put-out-apology/story-Bp94K5oSqKWcwMwYrZMZAK.html
15-10-2020||India||Hathras case: CBI questions victim’s father, two brothers||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioned the father and two brothers of the Hathras gang rape victim for six hours on Wednesday, the second straight day the probe officials have quizzed the kin of the 19-year-old Dalit woman whose death and subsequent midnight cremation last month roiled the country. The questioning began at the CBI’s camp office in Hathras at 11am and continued till 5pm. “The male members of the victim’s family were called to the camp office of CBI and were taken there under full security,” said Anjali Gangwar, subdivisional magistrate, Hathras. The agency’s camp office is at the office of the deputy director (agriculture) in Hathras. On Tuesday evening, Seema Pahuja, who is heading the CBI team, reached the house of the victim and met the women of the family. The relatives of the victim requested the authorities to shift the four accused – all from the Thakur caste -- from the Aligarh jail to another prison far away. “Such a decision can be taken at the government level, if such a demand is being made,” Gangwar said. A 15-member CBI team had inspected the crime scene on Tuesday and called the victim’s brother there. The victim’s mother and aunt were also called to the spot later in the day. The CBI team also went to site where the Hathras victim was cremated at 230am on September 30 against the wishes of her family.In Mathura, a team of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) quizzed four men, who were arrested a week ago for alleged links with the Popular Front of India (PFI) and its associate body, Campus Front of India (CFI). The interrogation by the six-member ED team in Mathura jail lasted about five hours, but officials refused to share any details with the media.The questioning revolved around sources of funding raised through a website, which is at the centre of a state government probe into an international conspiracy to foment caste violence. The four men -- Atiq-ur- Rehman of Muzaffarnagar, Siddique from Mallpuram (Kerala), Masood from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur -- are currently in Mathura jail.

15-10-2020||India||Mehbooba Mufti meets political leaders, to attend key meeting today||The release of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti from more than 14 months of detention appears to have galvanised political parties of Jammu and Kashmir, where all mainstream groups will meet on Thursday to take stock of the situation in the erstwhile state and decide on their next course of action.A day after her release, National Conference leaders Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah on Wednesday visited Mufti’s residence and invited her to the meeting. Mufti, who like the Abdullahs is a former chief minister of J&K, accepted the invitation.Mufti, and other major politicians of J&K including the Abdullahs, were detained ahead of the Constitutional changes pushed through by Parliament on August 5, 2019, nullifying Article 370 of the Constitution to divest the state of its special status and reorganising it into two Union territories -- J&K and Ladakh. Farooq and his son Omar Abdullah were released in March.Also Read| People will continue struggling for resolution of Kashmir: Mehbooba Mufti’s message after release“My father and I called on Mehbooba Mufti Sahiba this afternoon to enquire about her well-being after her release from detention. She has kindly accepted Farooq Saab’s invitation to join a meeting of the Gupkar Declaration signatories’ tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon,” Omar Abdullah said.“Today, our visit was without any political motive and we wanted to know her well-being... In the meeting tomorrow, the present political situation will be reviewed and what will be the future agenda of the Gupkar Declaration signatories in one view, that will also be discussed,” he said. Gupkar Declaration is a joint initiative of all the regional mainstream political parties – the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party,the People’s Conference, the Awami National Conference and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) - of J&K.On August 4, 2019, a day before the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, a group of prominent politicians of J&K met in Srinagar at Gupkar and issued a joint statement vowing to defend the “identity, autonomy and special status of Jammu & Kashmir against all attacks and onslaughts whatsoever”. The statement has since come to be known as the Gupkar Declaration.After the meeting with the Abdullah, Mufti said she was hopeful that together they could change things.“It was nice of you & Farooq sahab to come home. It gave me courage listening to him. I am sure together we all can change things for the better,” Mufti said in response to Omar Abdullah’s comments. Mufti sent a terse message to Delhi just an hour after her release from detention. “I have become free today after more than a year. During this time the black decision of August 5, 2019, black day, would always pain my heart and soul. And I realize that the people of J&K would have the same feeling. Nobody among us can forget the day’s robbery and humiliation,” she said in a 1.23 minute long audio message.“Now we all will have to reiterate that whatever Delhi Darbar, unconstitutionally and undemocratically, snatched away from us will have to be taken back,” said Mufti, who spent Wednesday meeting leaders and workers of her party who came to visit her from all over the Kashmir valley. More than a year after the constitutional changes related to J&K, on August 22, 2020, the six signatories again issued a statement and announced that they would carry forward the Gupkar Declaration.Also Read: Former J-K CM Mehbooba Mufti’s release welcomed widely, press conference likely on FridayIt was the first such joint statement signed by mainstream parties after the revocation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the region into two union territories; it hinted at a joint campaign for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.“We all reiterate that we are bound, wholly, by the contents of the Gupkar declaration and will unwaveringly adhere to it. We are committed to strive for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, the Constitution ofJ&K and the restoration of the State and any division of the State is unacceptable to us. We unanimously reiterate that there can be ‘nothing about us without us’,” the joint statement said.Article 35A empowered the Jammu and Kashmir legislature to define the permanent residents of the state and provide them special benefits and privileges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-meets-political-leaders-to-attend-key-meeting-today/story-tNYGaG75EwhQtzagIcZZoJ.html
15-10-2020||India||How the Covid-19 pandemic has hit GDP growth||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its World Economic Outlook (WEO) report on Tuesday. The previous WEO was released in April this year, when the extent of the Covid-19 pandemic and ts economic implications were still being evaluated. The report gives the economic forecast on a host of indicators up to 2025. While these numbers are subject to revision even in the short-term horizon, it is worth comparing India’s post-pandemic economic trajectory with that of other South Asian countries -- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Pakistan -- and with China, the only emerging market economy that is bigger than India. India’s post-Covid losses the biggest in South Asia India’s GDP will contract by 10.3% this fiscal year, IMF has projected. This is the biggest contraction among the countries which have been selected here. Three other countries, Afghanistan (5%), Pakistan (0.4%) and Sri Lanka (4.6%) will also experience a contraction in GDP this year. India will only be the second country apart from Afghanistan, which will not be able to regain its 2019 GDP level even in 2021.

This number had come down from 39.6% in 2011 to 29.7% in 2019. It is expected to fall to 27.8% in 2020 and will not cross the 31.7% level of 2018 until 2025. To be sure, all countries except Bhutan, China and Myanmar will experience a fall in investment-GDP ratios in 2020.  Per capita GDP While India’s per capita GDP (in current dollars) will fall below Bangladesh’s in 2020-21, it will overtake it marginally once again in 2021-22. India’s per capita GDP is significantly less than that of Bhutan and Sri Lanka in the South Asia region. With a dip in India’s per capita GDP trajectory, Bangladesh will enjoy almost similar per capita GDP levels as India’s up to 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-has-hit-gdp-growth/story-7enJJQpWNdPMb2UGAHdomO.html

A three-fold protection mechanism, comprising armed constabulary, civil police, and CCTV cameras and lights, has been deployed at the victim’s village entrance, house and surroundings, a compliance affidavit filed by the Yogi Adityanath government said. “The state government has deployed adequate forces to ensure protection of the victim’s family. The government of Uttar Pradesh is committed to provide complete security to the victim’s family and witnesses to ensure free and fair investigation,” the affidavit said.

The affidavit also stated that the victim’s brother informed the additional superintendent of police that they engaged two lawyers on behalf of their family as private advocates in the matter.The affidavit was filed pursuant to an order passed by the Supreme Court on October 6 seeking details of the security being provided by the state government to the victim’s family and witnesses. The apex court’s order came after a plea by a social activist, Satyama Dubey, and two lawyers, Vishal Thakre and Rudra Pratap Yadav. alleged failure on the part of Uttar Pradesh authorities in dealing with the matter. The petition sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the incident in which a 19-year old Dalit woman from Hathras was gang raped and murdered. The victim, a member of the Valmiki caste, was allegedly attacked by four members of the dominant Thakur caste on September 14, and breathed her last on September 29. At 2.30am the next day, her body was forcibly cremated by local authorities in a field outside her village, triggering outrage across the country. The UP government has maintained that it was forced to do so in order to avert an extraordinary law-and-order problem posed by protestors and political parties.The state, in an earlier affidavit filed on October 5, said that it is in agreement with the prayer for a CBI probe but that such a probe should be monitored by the top court. The probe was handed over to CBI by the state on October 10.

15-10-2020||India||Farmers’ groups walk out of govt meeting on new agricultural reforms||A delegation of protesting farmers’ leaders from Punjab invited for talks by Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal walked out of the meeting, demanding the presence of farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar, according to an umbrella platform representing the cultivators. The Centre had invited at least 31 farmers’ organisations and their leaders from Punjab for talks in New Delhi, the second attempt in a month to reach out to farmers protesting a set of laws enacted to liberalise agricultural markets. “The meeting was an effort to try and create a false impression that the central government is engaging with farmers, when in fact it is going all out to roll out and enforce the black anti-farmer laws,” the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said. Also Read| Govt always open for discussion with farmers on new farm laws: Prakash JavadekarThe farmers’ delegation demanded the presence of agriculture minister Tomar and tore up copies of the laws. “First, the government should be ready to review and if necessary, repeal the three laws. Second, the government should be ready to consider legislating minimum support price as a legal right and deal with input cost...” the AIKSCC said. Avik Saha, convener of the AIKSCC, said the meeting with the agriculture secretary “did not meet any of these criteria” as a the bureaucrat is not in position to repeal, amend or enact new laws. “Rather his job is to implement the laws made by government so he is the wrong person for the right discussion,” Saha said. Farmers have blocked roads and railway tracks since September 24 in a protest against legislation they fear could pave the way for the government to stop buying cereals at guaranteed prices (minimum support prices or MSPs), leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private entities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defending the laws, has called the new measures “historic”. He has said that while the laws give farmers options to sell their produce to private buyers, the government would continue to purchase staples at MSPs. The laws seek to end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees by opening up to private competition. These assurances have done little to satisfy farmers in Punjab, Haryana and western parts of Uttar Pradesh. Big farmers’ groups, who usually produce substantial surpluses, fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses.

Asked about the absence of agriculture minister at the meeting, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said: “If some one wants more (discussion), we are always open (to) meet everyone. But (agriculture minister Narendra Singh) Tomarji has an engagement today, therefore he has gone. When he will get free, he will meet all.

15-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Antibody tests administered to a huge swathe of the population (or sero surveys as they are called) have shown that a significant proportion of the Indian population has been exposed to the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease.How significant?A previous instalment of this column, Dispatch 158 on September 15 attempted to address that question. The answer (based on results of sero surveys conducted across the country, and some conservative assumptions): 15% of the urban population and around 5% to 7.5% of the rural population can be expected to have been infected with the virus. Assuming a rural population of 850 million and an urban of 450 million, and taking the rural infection rate as 6.25%, the weighted infection rate for the country is around 12%. This is not a measure of those with current infections, but those who have been infected and cured (many times without their knowledge).India’s positivity rate for the week ended October 13 was 6.2%, according to the health ministry. This is consistent with an infection rate of 12%. Both antigen and molecular tests for Covid-19 test for current infections, unlike the antibody tests which look for antibodies — they can only diagnose current infections where antibodies have been produced (one reason why they aren’t recommended for diagnosis) or previous exposure — and logic demands that the positivity rate always be lower than the infection (or exposure) rate.Also Read: Researchers find evidence of antibody production 5-6 months after Covid-19 infectionThere’s been a lot of talk of herd immunity (again) in recent days, especially with the release, last week, of the loftily named Great Barrington Declaration (https://gbdeclaration.org/) which basically calls for building herd immunity. “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection,” it says. A report in the New York Times suggests that the Trump White House has embraced this declaration.Because it’s important to say this, I will do so straightaway: I do not agree with the course advocated by the declaration, and believe it is downright dangerous. Several experts believe that the only way to achieve herd immunity in the case of the coronavirus disease, without significant loss of lives, is vaccination.The herd immunity level may be just around 40% instead of the widely believed 60%, according to mathematicians at the University of Stockholm and the University of Nottingham; and only around 11% of people exposed to an infected person are likely to contract Covid-19, according to a team led by Ramanan Laxminarayan of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. It still does not make sense to pursue an expose-and-infect strategy. That’s because some of those infected tend to be superspreaders (8% infect 60%, according to the second study cited above); we do not know enough about the long-term impact of even mild infections; and the mathematicians themselves, in the first study cited above, caveat that the 40% number is not even directional but merely to show how “population heterogeneity affects herd immunity”.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicStill, sero surveys are important — not so much for assessing when a city or region or country is likely to achieve herd immunity, but to measure prevalence of the infection and the proportion of the population that has been exposed to it. A city or state with a high exposure rate (as measured by the sero survey), can safely assume that with stringent enforcement of mask discipline, social distancing, hand hygiene and rules on public gatherings, it can open up just about anything (including schools) with a lower risk than a city or a state with a lower exposure rate. That’s good enough reason for the Union government as well as states to get serious about sero surveys, just as it is good enough reason for them to get serious about the enforcement of Covid-safe behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-3AB7atPLUejgozoOne7zZN.html

Vinay Bhargav, divisional forest officer of Pithoragarh division said the incident happened around 4 pm on Wednesday in Papdeo Van Panchayat area. “When the woman had gone to cut grass in the forests, she was mauled by the leopard and the animal further dragged her around 50 metres into dense bushes. Upon hearing her scream, other women who had accompanied her reached the site by tracing the blood trail, but the woman had died by then,” Bhargav said. The body was recovered by local forest staff and sent to the district hospital for a post-mortem examination. “As the incident happened inside a forest area, it prima facie appears to be a result of confrontation and panic attack,” said the forest official. This is not the first incident of a leopard attack in the state. On October 11, a 7-year-old girl was killed by a leopard in Tehri Garhwal district when she had gone to use the washroom outside her house. This was the fifth case of a child being killed by a leopard in the past one month. On October 7, a 7-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack outside her house in Berinag division of Pithoragarh district. On October 1, a 14-year-old boy was killed in a leopard attack in Pauri Garhwal district when he took his cattle for grazing in the forest area. On September 24, an 11-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack in Pithoragarh district when she was working near her house and collecting fodder. On September 19, a 7-year-old girl was mauled to death by a leopard when she was playing near her house in Almora district.

15-10-2020||India||Tribal woman gang-raped in south Bengal village, one arrested||A 22-year-old tribal woman was allegedly gang-raped by two youths while two others, including a woman, stood guard late on Tuesday night in a village in south Bengal, about 100 km north of Kolkata. “We have initiated a case based on the victim’s allegations. A tribal youth has already been arrested. A search has been initiated for the others. Investigation is going on,” said Bhaskar Mukherjee, Superintendent of Police of Purba Burdwan district. According to the police, the woman who was staying with her in-laws, had gone out to relieve herself around 10:30 pm on Tuesday. “She said she saw a light outside the house and went to investigate. When she found nothing and had just turned back, the miscreants attacked her from behind. She was gagged and taken to a field where she was raped by two men. According to the victim, there were four people including a woman,” a senior official said. Though the victim could not identify any of the miscreants since their faces were covered with towels, the police later identified one youth and arrested him. He has been identified as Daktar Hembram, 24. Around 3.00 am, the victim managed to reach home and was rushed to a hospital by villagers. She was later treated and discharged. Her husband was not at home when the incident took place. “She said that she couldn’t see any of the miscreants as it was dark and their faces were covered. But she could make out that there was one woman in the gang,” said the victim’s mother-in-law. This comes a month after a 19-year-old was allegedly gang-raped by four men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras. The woman succumbed to her injuries in hospital days later. The incident triggered outrage across the country. The Bharatiya Janata Party has already attacked the ruling Trinamool Congress over the incident. “When something happens in Uttar Pradesh, TMC goes there. Will Mamata Banerjee demand a CBI probe now? Why is she silent now?” Agnimitra Paul, Bengal BJP women’s wing president said. “Police has already started an investigation. The BJP is shouting unnecessarily. West Bengal has a woman chief minister and women are safe in West Bengal. The guilty won’t be spared,” said Prasenjit Das, TMC spokesperson of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-woman-gang-raped-in-south-bengal-village-one-arrested/story-fR1MkXlLNnEn5EALVf2X1J.html
15-10-2020||India||PM Modi saves bulk of salary, banks on term deposits||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s movable assets have increased by Rs 36.53 lakh over the past 15 months and, like most Indians, he saves most of his money in savings accounts and term deposits with banks, according to his latest declaration of assets and liabilities.PM Modi’s movable assets grew by 26.26% to Rs 1,75,63,618 from Rs 1,39,10,260 in the previous fiscal year. The PM’s latest voluntary disclosure, published on October 12, shows his financial status as of June 30.The increase would largely appear to be on account of the PM saving most of his salary -- a known fact in government circles -- and reinvesting interest from his fixed deposits.There is almost no change in his immovable assets. The PM has listed a plot and house in Gandhinagar worth Rs 1.1 crore. He is a part owner of this along with his family.The disclosure shows that the 70-year-old Prime Minister steered clear of the equity market. His preferred tax-saving tools are life insurance, National Savings Certificates (NSCs) and infrastructure bonds. The declaration of assets and liabilities also shows that he has invested more in NSCs and that his insurance premium has come down.Modi, who draws a monthly salary of Rs 2 lakh (low by global standards), along with the President, the Vice-President, his Cabinet colleagues and members of Parliament, accepted a 30% cut in pay and allowances beginning April in a cost-cutting exercise necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic.His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government also announced an austerity drive, scrapping the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years and pumping money into stimulus and relief packages to reive an economy that shrank by a record 23.9% in the quarter ended June 30 from a year ago.The Prime Minister’s savings account balance was Rs 3.38 lakh on June 30 against Rs 4,143 on March 31, 2019. He held Rs 31,450 in cash at June-end.His fixed deposit in State Bank of India’s Gandhinagar branch rose to Rs 1,60,28,039 as of June 30, 2020 from Rs 1,27,81,574 in the last fiscal year.These numbers are consistent with those in his affidavit filed ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last year which listed movable assets of Rs 1.41 crore including Rs 1.27 crore in deposits.The Prime Minister has no liabilities and doesn’t own a car. He has four gold rings. He saves taxes through the National Savings Certificates of Rs 8,43,124 and paid a premium of Rs 1,50,957 for his life insurance.In FY19-20, the Prime Minister had Rs 7,61,646 of National Savings Certificates and paid Rs 1,90,347 as life insurance premiums.The infrastructure bond he purchased in January 2012 for Rs 20,000 has not yet reached maturity.The public disclosure of assets and liabilities of the union council of ministers was introduced in 2004 by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government for greater transparency in public life. Members of Parliament, too, have to file a statement of their family income every year and provide an affidavit of assets and liabilities for filing election nomination forms.After the roll-out of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, commonly known as the Lokpal Act, all public servants are required to disclose their annual income.Apart from the Prime Minister, all senior ministers, including home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, have filed their wealth disclosures. Shah and civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri were among the first to do so.Some junior ministers including Ramdas Athawale, Babul Supriyo and Pratap Chandra Sarangi are yet to file their declarations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-saves-bulk-of-salary-banks-on-term-deposits/story-9pyc540y0K7W0YLx5CfBLN.html
15-10-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling accused have links with Dawood Ibrahim’s gang: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Wednesday told a special court in Kochi that some of the accused have links with the gang of Dawood Ibrahim and they visited Tanzania several times where the underworld don has an extensive network. The accused had challenged the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in the smuggling case, arguing that smuggling comes under economic offence and no terror angle was involved in the case. Countering that, the NIA said some of the accused in the case have links with anti-national forces. Elaborating its point, the NIA said accused No 5 in the case KT Ramees and accused No 13 M Sharafuddin had visited Tanzania a number of times and met Dawood’s contact Feroze ‘Oasis’ and discussed ways to smuggle firearms into the country. Earlier, Ramees was caught with smuggled revolvers at the Kozhikode airport. But later he got away, saying he was a member of the shooting association and remitted fine. It also said one of the arrested Muhamad Ali was an accused in chopping off the palm of a college teacher who prepared a controversial question paper but was later acquitted by a court in 2015. The NIA said he had close links with some of the fundamentalist outfits conspiring against the country. The court is expected to deliver its verdict on Friday. This is the first time that the anti-terror law was invoked in a smuggling case. Meanwhile, senior Indian Administrative Service officer M Sivasankar, who was Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s secretary, on Wednesday moved the high court for anticipatory bail after the Enforcement Directorate summoned him again in connection with the case. He was suspended in July after his alleged liaison with Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the case, came to light. In his bail plea he contended that he was questioned for more than 90 hours by different central agencies and they failed to detect any anomalies. He said he was fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation. To satisfy some vested interests, now agencies are under pressure to arrest him, he said in the plea which will be taken up on Thursday. There are reports the ED may file a case against him for money laundering. During investigation, it found that he had made several foreign trips and in some of them official permission was not sought. He was also aware of the questionable integrity of Swapna Suresh and he went out of way to help her, the ED said. The sensational smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized from a consignment in the UAE consulate. P Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate who came to receive it, was arrested by the customs and two other suspects, Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Sivasankar was suspended shortly after that. Now a multi-agency team is probing the case and 30 people have been arrested. Besides the NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax are also part of the investigation. The ED had questioned Kerala Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel in connection with alleged import of holy books and dry dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-have-links-with-dawood-ibrahim-s-gang-nia/story-jNGkPvy2p8YaNEMv5dRmQK.html

The risks are counterweighed by recent infection trends that suggest India may be over its first outbreak peak, and economic indicators that make for a case to allow more normalcy to return in order to stem the widespread erosion of earnings. The measures also come at a time when the country heads into winter, conditions in which the Sars-Cov-2 virus is projected to last longer and a Covid-19 infection feared to be worse due to increased pollution. Also Read: Govt chalks out plan for storage of Covid-19 vaccine“The next two-and-a-half months are going to be very crucial for us in our fight against corona because of the winter season and the festival season. It becomes responsibility of every citizen to not let our guard down and follow Covid appropriate behaviour to curb spread of the infection,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said at a meeting with central government hospitals on Wednesday.A review of state-wise protocols for schools, cinema halls and festival celebrations shows that most regions are playing it safe. Only around five states have decided to open up schools, and almost all of them will allow only students from senior classes to attend. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, which have the highest number of cases, have decided to keep them shut.More states, however, have chosen to open movie theatres. The Union home ministry, which defines a base level of restrictions that must be followed, said on September 30 that these businesses can admit only 50% of their capacity, and must ensure space is left between each guest.  With few new titles being released, most cinema halls are choosing to screen previously released titles as they also determine the risk appetite among their customers. “We’ve picked some old blockbusters like Simmba, Chhichhore, Malang, Section 375 depending which movie fits best in which pocket and was preferred in that place. So, cinemas in Delhi would show a different film than a cinema in Gurugram or Kanpur,” said Kunal Sawhney, senior vice president of operations, Carnival Cinemas.Also Read| Lights, Camera, Action: Safety is key as cinema screens flicker back to life in Delhi“We just want customers to come and see that cinema is safe, we’re only targeting to win back their confidence in this particular week,” he added.In Delhi, representatives of cinema halls — which include PVR, M2K Cinemas and INOX — told chief minister Arvind Kejriwal that in order to ensure guidelines are followed, they will sanitise food counters, prohibit patrons from consuming food inside auditoriums, leave a seat empty between two viewers -- even if they arrive as a group -- and ask customers to download the Aarogya Setu mobile application. As on Wednesday, India has recorded 7,304,804 cases and 111,314 deaths. Data from across the country showed there were 67,819 new cases, significantly lower than the roughly 93,000 cases being seen on average in mid-September when the outbreak was at its peak. Experts reiterated that risks have not diminished and people must not let their guard down. “Coming months are going to be crucial as for respiratory viruses, pollution, drop in temperature and congregation makes for a killer combination that helps these microbes thrive. Sars-Cov-2 may be a new virus but based on evidence available globally on the behaviour of respiratory viruses in winters, we should well be prepared for a surge in cases,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“Maintaining physical distancing will be difficult in coming weeks when there is festive season rush in markets, which could impact containment measures. A vaccine will take time, so the only effective option is to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he added. Paediatricians said opening schools is not a good idea since closed spaces such as classrooms pose a significant risk. “The problem is not opening of schools, the real challenge will be to ensure students follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, especially when you see adults around taking preventive measures too casually,” said JS Bhasin, head, paediatrics department, BLK Hospital, Delhi. “Kids themselves may not be very sick but once they come back home they might pass it on to the more vulnerable population such as their grandparents. It’s definitely going to lead to a spurt in cases,” Bhasin added. The latest unlocking exercise is the fifth in a series of such decisions since June 1 but with a changed nomenclature (earlier, the reopening process was called “Unlock”). For large gatherings, the home ministry’s September 30 announcement set a limit of 200 people if an event is held indoors, provided that this gathering does not exceed 50% of the established capacity of the venue. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicFor outdoor events, the government did not set a limit but specified that people need to follow the social distancing practice of keeping 6 feet apart, cover their faces, use hand sanitisers and are screened for fever. Over the next month, the country will also witness its first elections since the pandemic broke out. Polls will be held in Bihar for all 243 assembly constituencies and bypolls will be held for 59 seats in 11 states. Results of the Bihar assembly elections and the bypolls will be declared on November 10. On October 8, the Union home ministry allowed election meetings to be held in these 12 states, putting the responsibility on political parties to ensure people observe precautions such as distancing and covering their faces in order to minimise the risk of infections. Regular international flights remain banned, as one of the most prominent pre-Covid activity that is yet to be restored fully. For domestic flights, 60% capacity has been currently allowed by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlock-test-today-reboot-begins-for-cinemas-schools/story-JOWgaMvY6lcdsB87sBscHM.html
15-10-2020||India||Delhi High Court notice to govts on same-sex marriages||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought responses from the Centre and the Delhi government on pleas by two same-sex couples seeking legal recognition of their marriages under two different civil laws, the Special Marriage Act (SMA) and the Foreign Marriage Act (FMA), and observed that “laws are gender-neutral” and are for the rights of “every citizen”. A bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon said that marriage is not defined in both acts, but the concept emanates and is interpreted under customary laws which do not recognise same-sex marriages. Issuing notice to the authorities, the bench stated that inhibitions could be shed after Rajkumar Yadav, one of the counsels for the Centre submitted that the pleas presented a peculiar circumstance and that such a situation has not been faced in 5,000 years of Sanatan Dharma.“We may shed our inhibition. The laws are gender-neutral. You please try to interpret the law for the citizens of Sanatan Dharma in the country. This is not an adversarial litigation. This is for the right of every citizen of the country,” justice Menon said.Central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said that the issue would require a detailed reply.During the proceedings, the court said that SMA was enacted as there were no customs for inter-faith and inter-caste marriages, and stated that once same-sex marriage is recognised under the customary laws, other statutes like SMA and FMA would follow suit. It stated that if the petitioners wished to make any change in their pleas to challenge the definition of marriage, now was the time to do so.“Please understand that till the concept of marriage is not challenged, it would not be able to move forward in the matter because marriage is not defined. There is otherwise no question on the maintainability of the pleas but in both the Special Marriage Act and Foreign Marriage Act, the term marriage has not been defined,” said the court.However, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy who argued for the petitioners said the plea was not to challenge customary or religious laws, but discrimination by civil laws. “This is about the civil law, a statute provided by the Indian law for inter-caste, inter-faith, modern couples, same sex couple etc,” she said and added that past judgments have held that sexual orientation cannot be grounds for discrimination.The court posted the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2021.The first petition was filed by two mental health professionals — Kavita Arora, 47, and Ankita Khanna, 36 — who said they had been living together as a couple for eight years, took care of each others’ parents, were in love with each other, but unable to marry each other.“The petitioners are like any other couple you might meet, except they are both women,” their petition read.The second petition was filed by two men — Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an overseas citizen of India — who got married in the United States, where same-sex marriage is legal, in 2017. An Indian consulate refused to register their union this year under the 1969 Foreign Marriage Act.The two have been in a relationship since 2012 and are supported by families and friends, also they claimed that during the Covid-19 pandemic, India’s non-recognition of their marriage prevented them from travelling to India as a married couple.“The petitioners submit that non-recognition of same-sex marriages is a wanton act of discrimination that strikes at the root of dignity and self-fulfillment of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) couples,” the petition read.The two women said that issues like opening a joint bank account, buying family health insurance, or securing address proof — things that a married couple takes for granted — were a struggle for them. On September 30, they approached the marriage officer (the sub-divisional magistrate, South East Delhi, Kalkaji) seeking solemnisation of their marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.“The marriage officer would have solemnised the marriage of any similarly placed opposite-sex couple. Sexual orientation discrimination is constitutionally prohibited under Article 15, but the petitioners were refused the right to marry a person of their choice on grounds of their sexual orientation alone,” they said.The petitions argued that the non-recognition of marriage between LGBTQ persons violated the fundamental rights of liberty, equality, life and freedom of expression guaranteed to them by the Supreme Court judgment, Navtej Johar vs Union of India, which decriminalised adult, consensual same-sex relations in 2018.The Delhi high court is already hearing a Public Interest Litigation filed by defence analyst Abhijit Iyer Mitra and three others. In response to that petition, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said last month that Indian values didn’t recognise same-sex unions.The two petitions before the court on Wednesday were represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar. Guruswamy and Katju were among the lawyers who argued the case against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which led to the Supreme Court decriminalising homosexuality in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-notice-to-govts-on-same-sex-marriages/story-r7StVAAItq3TCSnWmyVmJJ.html
15-10-2020||India||Govt chalks out plan for storage of Covid-19 vaccine||With several experimental vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reaching late-stage trials, the government has started making logistical arrangements for procurement, storage and distribution to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of a vaccine, when one becomes availableThe Centre has begun identifying both government and private facilities to create hubs for vaccine storage. The focus is on maintaining cold storage as most vaccines require to be stored and distributed at a fixed temperature, failing which the vaccine becomes ineffective.Under the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 that is chaired by Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, there are subgroups looking into various aspects of vaccine development, procurement and distribution, including one that looks at cold chain requirements.“The subgroup has already mapped the existing cold chain that is presently being utilized under the immunisation programme of the government, and it has also made a projection of the additionality that will be required. Presently, that group is engaged with mapping the private sector facilities where with minor modifications they could be converted to serve the needs of supplementing the cold chain equipment. So, that is how things are currently developing,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayReal-time tracking of vaccine movement- from procurement to storage, to delivery and distribution is being planned using the electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) that is used for the immunisation programme. This cloud-based application tracks realtime stock positioning and supply route based on the information fed by ground staff.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan recently announced that the government was looking at procuring and utilizing about 400-500 million vaccine doses, covering about 200-250 million people.India has about 27,000 vaccine storage centres across all 700 plus districts that are connected through eVIN; with at least 50,000 temperature loggers to monitor storage temperatures as accurately as possible for at least 40,000 frontline workers to manage logistics.“We already have a well-oiled machinery in place as far as vaccine delivery is concerned with a robust national immunisation programme running. That will be made use of for Covid-19 also. Apart from polio there are other vaccines needing cold storage like the measles vaccine. It won’t be a problem,” said Paul.Experts said India has the capacity to handling the logistics.“I don’t see it as a problem as India already has a large-scale Universal Immunisation Programme running that can easily be made use of for Covid vaccine delivery also. A lot of logistical arrangements are currently being made in a well-coordinated manner that should see us through,” said Dr YK Gupta, former head, pharmacology department, and advisor, Translational Health Science & Technology Institute. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe pricing of each dose has not been fixed. “The price of single-dose or the price of two-dose vaccine, because most of the vaccines that are being worked across the globe are two-dose vaccines, is still evolving. And we have seen that in an extremely dynamic situation as the vaccines prove their safety and efficacy, and till the time they prove their safety and efficacy, whatever figure is being bandied around is just a figure. So, any indicative price for a single-dose or a double-dose vaccine becomes a plausible figure once the vaccine has been able to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. And once that is done by multiple vaccines, then the prices decline, and decline drastically. Therefore, at the present moment in time, we do not hazard a guess,” Bhushan said.The health secretary reiterated that there were sufficient financial resources for vaccine procurement.“We are parallelly making arrangements for putting in place procurement and distribution logistics of Covid-19 vaccine as and when it is available for use. We will be prepared to ensure it is delivered to all,” said Dr Paul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-chalks-out-plan-for-storage-of-covid-vaccine/story-JDu7QOjO9a5dk1vMzDkWyN.html
15-10-2020||India||Tamil Nadu, Delhi pick borrowing option to meet GST deficit||Tamil Nadu and Delhi are the latest states to opt for the first borrowing option proposed by the Centre through the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, even as the Union finance ministry on Wednesday permitted the southern state to raise Rs 9,627 crore from the open market, taking the total amount for 21 states to Rs 78,452 crore.“The permission was issued after the State (Tamil Nadu) formally communicated its acceptance for Option 1 to meet the shortfall arising out of GST implementation. Twenty-one States and two Union Territories -- Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) -- have so far requested Option 1,” the Union finance ministry said in a statement.The seven dissenting states left now are Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal. Initially, 10 states had opposed the proposal, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi The Centre had given states the choice of borrowing Rs.97,000 crore(the shortfall resulting from GST implementation issues) without having to pay principal or interest or the entire Rs.2.35 lakh crore revenue deficit from the indirect tax (including that arising from the Covid-19 pandemic) projected for this fiscal year. The Rs.97,000 crore amount was subsequently raised to Rs.1.1 lakh crore. The principal and interest in the first option would have been paid out of the cess levied on luxury products and sin goods such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles and coalThe borrowing plans of Delhi and J&K will soon be forwarded to the department of expenditure (DoE) by the home ministry, a government official said, requesting anonymity. DoE is an arm of the Union finance ministry, which is coordinating borrowing by states along with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).“With the latest development, only seven states have so far refrained from taking the borrowing option. Puducherry had already indicated its preference for the first borrowing option, but it is yet to formally communicate the same to DOE,” the official said.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said the Capital was left with no choice but to go for the first option suggested by the Centre. “The Centre had already told us that Option 2 was not applicable for Union Territories such as Delhi and Puducherry,” he said.“Delhi is facing a shortfall of Rs 16,000 crore in GST this year. As per the GST amendment, the central government should take a loan and give this loan to us and the same can be paid from the cess after 2022... Now, against the shortfall of Rs 16,000 crore, we would get a loan of Rs 6,000 crore. We have to survive under a huge shortfall which will result in cutting on lots of schemes and plans,” Sisodia told HT.The 21 states that have been granted clearance to borrow are: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. “The borrowing permission issued to the 21 states [on Tuesday and Wednesday] is over and above the borrowing permission of around Rs 1.10 lakh crore to be issued to enable the states to meet the revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation. A special window is being created by the Ministry of Finance to facilitate this borrowing,” the Union finance ministry said. The current additional borrowing permission has been granted at the rate of 0.50% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to states as a precondition for picking the first option. The Rs 20.9 lakh crore Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan [Self-reliant India Initiative] stimulus announced on May 17 had permitted 2% additional borrowings to states with some conditions. “This is over and above the Special Window of Rs 1.1 lakh crore,” the statement said. The official quoted above said: “After Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi agreeing to borrow, the numbers of dissenting states have now reduced to seven. Some more states could opt for the first option in next couple of days.” Kerala’s finance minister Thomas Isaac said on Wednesday that he was in talks with other dissenting states, and they were considering moving the Supreme Court over the issue.Archit Gupta, founder & CEO of tax consulting firm ClearTax, said: “Nobody could have foreseen this kind of a black swan event (Covid-19) and in the spirit of federalism it is important that centre and states resolve this amicably. If state borrowings keep escalating, they might have to be bailed out at a later date by the central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-delhi-pick-borrowing-option-to-meet-gst-deficit/story-RpFkXeahvR4ubQcs6KSDxL.html

15-10-2020||Editorials||Why Pakistan is wrong, again | HT Editorial||The decision by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special assistant on national security issues, Moeed Yusuf, to do an interview with the Indian media (he spoke to The Wire) has generated debate on both sides of the border. Mr Yusuf contended that India has sent messages to Pakistan with a desire for conversation but didn’t say who had sent these communications and what had become of them. Indian officials have called his claim “fiction”. He laid pre-conditions for any dialogue between the two countries, most of them related to changes made to the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. This is solely India’s internal matter. Mr Yusuf also used the interview to trot out a string of accusations against India, from funding the Pakistani Taliban and Baloch activists to the more serious allegation of a hand in the 2014 terrorist attack on a school in Peshawar. These charges are baseless.But the interview was significant for several reasons — for the all-powerful military would have signed off on the interview since it still has a vice-like grip on foreign policy. This was also the first time a Pakistani official engaged with the Indian media since the changes in Kashmir more than a year ago, and it was seen by some in India as an attempt by the Pakistani side to open a channel of communication after the passage of a decade without any structured dialogue. The environment for talks, though, is hardly conducive. Not a week goes by without India and Pakistan taking swipes at each other at a multilateral forum — Mr Yusuf himself joined a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting with an inaccurate map of Pakistan that triggered a walk-out by the Indian side. Pakistan may have decided to use its new-found utility in facilitating talks in Afghanistan to get others to prod India to join a dialogue, but these efforts aren’t likely to lead to a positive response from New Delhi. Mr Yusuf didn’t adequately address the sole issue holding up dialogue between the two countries — anti-India terror groups operating from Pakistani soil. Pakistan may have locked up a handful of terrorist leaders due to pressure from the Financial Action Task Force but India believes such actions aren’t irreversible. If Pakistan was expecting the interview to lead to a thaw, it will have to go back to the drawing board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-pakistan-is-wrong-again-ht-editorial/story-kj1xCF5miiD1fq0McBVFjI.html
15-10-2020||Editorials||A long, fragile winter in Ladakh | HT Editorial||With the seventh round of talks between Indian and Chinese military commanders failing to yield a breakthrough, yet again, over the impasse in Ladakh, it is now clear that the confrontation in the region will persist through the winter, and perhaps, even beyond. The standoff — caused entirely by Chinese aggression across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and its violation of border pacts — has posed the most serious national security challenge to India in recent years.New Delhi has deployed a range of diplomatic, economic, and military tools to enhance the pressure on China to pull back. This has involved dialogue; deepening international partnerships, particularly through Quad; announcing economic measures against Chinese companies; keeping the eligibility of Huawei for 5G trials hanging in balance; boosting Indian counter-mobilisation at the border; and taking pre-emptive steps, including occupying the heights on the southern banks of Pangong Tso. All of this has ruffled Beijing — but not enough to withdraw, for China now sees this as a battle of prestige symbolically and an attempt to gain a strategic advantage in a key geopolitically significant location substantively.This means that Beijing is not going to behave responsibly. This also means that just like Galwan, the possibility of a military standoff escalating into a clash is alive. Citing past standoffs which went on for years, Indian officials believe that the challenge is not to blink first and signal determination. This, indeed, must be the case and India must not let its guard down. But do remember that the China of 2020 is different from the China of the late 1980s and early 1990s. India will have to come up with more creative ways than just wait for a solution to present itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-long-fragile-winter-in-ladakh-ht-editorial/story-rz2BTpN05OZFRu2t8VNE7H.html
15-10-2020||Editorials||In defence of secularism | HT Editorial||In a letter to the Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, urging him to open religious places for worship, the state governor, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, commented on Mr Thackeray’s politics of Hindutva and asked him, mockingly, if he had “turned secular”. In a separate development, an advertisement for the jewellery brand, Tanishq, which portrayed a multi-religious home where Muslim family members adopted rituals to make their Hindu daughter-in-law feel at home at her baby shower ceremony, drew a backlash on social media for ostensibly hurting Hindu sentiments. The ad, which was based on the theme of unity, was withdrawn.Both events — one related to the functioning of the Indian State and the other related to cultural trends in Indian society — are disturbing. Take the governor’s letter first. Mr Koshyari, as the constitutional head of the state, is perfectly within his rights to correspond with the chief minister, and even make suggestions — including the need to open religious places, though whether this is indeed wise in a state that has had the highest share of Covid-19 cases in India is open to question. But the problem is not the letter or its specific theme; the issue is the contempt with which Mr Koshyari used the term “secularism”, equating it with the closure of religious places. Secularism may be a controversial word for dominant sections of India’s polity, but it is a cherished constitutional value. There have been distortions in the practice of secularism, but this does not take away from the importance of the principle. To demean the word is not just to undermine the Preamble, but also encourage a majoritarian conception of the nation.But what is equally worrying is the controversy around what was an evocative advertisement, which was about love and warmth between communities. The Hindutva Right, based on its entirely flawed and incorrect idea of “love jihad”, frowns at Hindu-Muslim relationships, especially if the man is a Muslim. The fact that even a moving ad triggered a backlash, and that the company withdrew the ad, speaks of a deep divide that could threaten the very idea of India. Both the State and society must return to the original constitutional vision of pluralism, coexistence and integration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-defence-of-secularism-ht-editorial/story-5gNbFQO5Y8tlkXatQMIw8L.html
