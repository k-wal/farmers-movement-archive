India has earned (back) goodwill and traction with Afghans from all parts of the country. Before Taliban rule in Afghanistan, India had an exiguous presence in the minds of Afghans, who felt that India had turned away from them. They now know that India wants Afghans to stand on their own feet and make their own decisions. They know India is working for a sovereign, united, and peaceful Afghanistan. They believe in the commonalities between Indian and Afghan objectives, and that India will celebrate Afghan successes.India’s effort to rebuild Afghanistan goes beyond financial support or constructing the Afghan parliament, a dam on the Hari Rud River, transmission lines and a power station to bring electricity to Kabul, and Small Development Projects for education and health. India has contributed to building institutions, developing human resources, training Afghan public officials and providing the country with a new generation of educated and skilled workers.The Taliban gained ground in parts of Afghanistan not because they are “smart” and “tough” as Donald Trump believes, but because of American mismanagement, Afghan incapacity, and support to the Taliban from the Pakistan army. Afghanistan’s defence minister, Asadullah Khalid, told me several years ago, when he was Kandahar’s governor: “It is not that the Taliban are strong, it is that we are weak.” The Taliban profile is disproportionate to its gains on the ground.Many in Pakistan insinuate that India is sabotaging the Doha negotiations because India would not like Afghanistan and Pakistan to have good relations. Far from it. Unlike Pakistan, which fears harmonious ties between India and Afghanistan, India would be quite content with friendship between Pakistan and Afghanistan. After all, the same families, clans and tribes straddle the two sides of their long and porous frontiers. That said, India would be content if, irrespective of relations between Islamabad and Kabul, the Afghan people and government were free to decide the kind of relationships they should have with other countries, including India.Does India have reasons to worry about the peace deal concluded between the United States (US) and the Taliban and a future peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government? Not if all Afghans agree that the peace deal safeguards their interests. Not if they can preserve the gains made in Afghanistan since 2001. All parties, including the Taliban, should feel assured that they will have India’s support if they acted independently.India is, therefore, just right in lining up behind Afghanistan, with the external affairs minister participating in the September 12 inaugural of the Doha inter-Afghan negotiations. It is not to suggest that India has now warmed to the Taliban but to underline that India has no reservations in interacting with the Taliban if the Afghan government has none. With Doha, India has ended the erstwhile ambiguity in its policy. India is willing to engage with any party committed to peace and stability in Afghanistan. The invite to India was an acknowledgement that India has vital interests in Afghanistan. While Iran’s foreign minister, Jawad Zarif, did not participate because of the presence of the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, a way must be found to involve Iran in the Afghan peace process, which will receive a blow should there be a flare-up between Iran and the US.Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation will be in Delhi from Tuesday to consult with India’s top leadership, seeking a reiteration of India’s support for the peace process.India has supported efforts to bring inclusive peace to Afghanistan by advising leaders of different ethnicities to work in cohesion with others for peace and nation-building. India favours the social and political reintegration of those who give up their physical and ideological association with terrorist groups and networks, resile from violence, and embrace pluralism and democracy. India opposes the political accommodation of individuals, groups or Islamist entities associated with the al-Qaeda, the Daesh, and their associates since this will subvert the nascent Afghan democracy, undermine human rights, and destroy emerging Afghan institutions. A subverted Afghanistan in the hands of terrorist networks will be a catastrophe for India, the region and the world. The restoration of status-quo-ante in Afghanistan could also lead to the unravelling of the state system in neighbouring Pakistan — a matter of deep concern.For peace in Afghanistan, there should be an immediate ceasefire. “Reduced violence” that is being promoted as an interim measure will not be enough, as the Taliban has continued with its attempts at targeted assassinations and bombings. A ceasefire must be followed by the cessation of sanctuary, sustenance and support to the Haqqani Network, the military arm of the Taliban most closely linked to the Pakistan army, and other like-minded terrorist groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/where-india-stands-on-peace-in-afghanistan-opinion/story-gAYLu0YkvPYEOy3PyqTYkN.html
05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Now, ATM loot bid in Chandigarh’s Sector 39||In yet another attempt to loot an ATM, miscreants struck at a booth in the Sector-39 market in Chandigarh, police said on Monday. The complaint was filed by Charanjeet Grover, manager, Punjab National Bank, Maloya. He said when the ATM caretaker reached the booth in the morning, he found its shutter open and machine damaged. Police have written to the bank to procure the CCTV footage in order to identify the accused. A case under Section 380 (theft) read with 511 (attempt to commit a crime) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. Burglars have made at least five such unsuccessful bids to loot ATMs in Chandigarh in the past four months, though on June 18, a masked man was able to flee with ₹7.6 lakh from a Union Bank of India ATM at Kishangarh. The previous bid was at an ATM in Sector 34 on the night of September 18. Around 10:30pm, a group of youths with their faces covered had entered the booth, applied a tape on six CCTV cameras installed on the premises and then started to try and open the ATM. They ended up damaging the kiosk, ripping off its screen and breaking some wires, but could not get an access to the money. Other such attempts have been made in Sector 44, Manimajra and Kishangarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-atm-loot-bid-in-chandigarh-s-sector-39/story-CWT4YLQVajs1HbWEdbCOxN.html
05-10-2020||Lucknow||UP claims tax collections up, earning-expenditure gap remains||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday claimed an increase in its tax collections for the third consecutive month, collecting Rs 890.26 crore more as taxes in September 2020 vis-à-vis the tax earnings in the same month last year. Although this indicates an increase of about 10.5 percent in tax collections for September 2020, a wide gap of about Rs 13,000 crore remains in revenue collections in the first six months of 2020-2021 in comparison to the earnings during the same period in 2019-2020. “We have collected Rs 9,334.17 crore as taxes in September 2020. This is 890.26 crore higher than tax collections of Rs 8,443.91 crore made in the same month in 2019. This is the third consecutive month of increase in earnings,” said state minister for finance Suresh Khanna while speaking to media. The state government’s non-tax revenue also increased to Rs 182.33 crore in September 2020 against Rs 120.89 crore in the same month in 2019. With this, the state government’s total revenue collection in September 2020 has gone up to Rs 9516.50 crore, about 80.2 percent of revenue earning target of Rs 11,873.17 crore for September 2020. Also read: Is YSR Congress joining NDA? CM Jagan flies to Delhi to meet PM amid buzz“We hope for further increase in revenue collections in coming months, including in October 2020,” said additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal. “An increase in revenue is a good sign. It indicates that the state’s economy is on the road to recovery. But the state government will have to make more efforts to mobilise more revenue to provide funds for development and should not hesitate to go for extra borrowings from the market,” said Yashvir Tyagi, retired professor, department of economics, Lucknow University. A close scrutiny of the state government’s performance on the financial front, however, indicates that although its total revenue earnings have increased consistently, they have remained behind targets in the past three months. Moreover, the tax earnings in September 2020 are less than the earnings in July and August 2020. As per the state government’s statistical data, it earned a total revenue of Rs 10,675.42 crore in July 2020 and Rs 9,545.21 crore in August 2020 against Rs 9516.50 crore in September 2020. Moreover, the state government’s major revenue earning departments have failed to achieve their targets during the first six months of 2020-2021 due to the impact of Covid-19.“The state government collected revenue of about Rs 45,890 crore from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, against Rs 58,600 crore earned during the same period in 2019-2020. Lower collections are obviously a result of Covid-19,” said a senior officer. The government’s revenue in the past three months has apparently increased due to hike in excise duty on liquor and the rate of VAT on petrol and diesel, etc. In September 2020, too, the highest increase was witnessed in excise collections. The state government collected excise of Rs 2,140.61 crore, about 95.1 percent of Rs 2,250 crore target for the month. As the government spends Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore every month on payment of salaries and pension to its employees, the total revenue earnings remain insufficient to meet the committed expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-claims-tax-collections-up-earning-expenditure-gap-remains/story-MSw4spoZAmxD3ZfFa1O6rM.html

Her body was recovered by the locals near Haji Ali in Worli on Monday morning. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has set up an inquiry under deputy municipal commissioner (infrastructure) and the report is likely to be concluded within 15 days. According to BMC statement, on Sunday at 12.06pm they were informed about the victim Sheetal Bhanushali falling into an open manhole under Asalfa Metro Bridge, opposite Global Hospital. BMC then deployed fire brigade and stormwater drains personnel at the spot who carried out rescue and search operations. When they could not find Bhanushali until Sunday evening, the operation was called off. Following this, BMC received a call from Mumbai Police on Sunday at 9.55am, about an unidentified body found at Haji Ali. After investigation, the police had concluded the body was of Bhanushali. However, the family claims that name of the deceased is Sheetal Dama.According to Kamlesh Bhanushali, a friend of Dama’s family, Sheetal left her home at around 6pm on Saturday, to buy groceries. Her 12-year-old son accompanied her because he had to buy stationery items. Mid-way, Sheetal sent her son home, as it started raining heavily, and told him that she will return after shopping for groceries. When Sheetal did not return on Saturday night, her family filed a missing person’s complaint. Bhanushali said, “She was carrying two kilos of wheat flour on her way home. The next morning (Sunday morning) we heard that a drain was open near Global Hospital, and there was a bag of wheat flour lying next to it. We identified the bag, and informed the police.” On Monday morning, the family was informed by Tardeo police that the body of a woman with clothes and jewellery matching the description given by the family, in the missing person’s complaint, was found. Kirit Somaiya, former member of Parliament from the Ghatkopar area tweeted on Monday, “I visited & filled complaint with Ghatkopar West Police Station, asking action under IPC section 34, 279, 304, 406, 420... against BMC Officials & Contractor...for death of 32 year Sheetal Dama. Who drawn in Asalfa Ghatkopar Nala & Deadbody found next day near Haji Ali (Sea Side).” Somaiya said, “The fibre manhole covers installed by the BMC are not sturdy, and they easily dislodge, unlike the earlier metal covers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-woman-falls-into-open-manhole-at-ghatkopar-body-discovered-at-haji-ali-bmc-orders-probe/story-5h5x1Y27V3x3O3Vs0uUONM.html

The incident took place on September 30, when the victim Gulzar Khan, 22, was working at his employer’s shop at Poisar in Kandivli (West). According to Khan, he was on a call with a customer when a van stopped outside the shop around 1pm. “Four men came out and caught hold of me. They pushed me inside the vehicle. I wanted to scream, but they gagged me. There were eight persons in the vehicle,” Khan told Kandivli police. “I was tied to a chair and beaten up by the men for more than two days,” he added. On October 1, Khan’s employer Lukman Khan registered a complaint with the Kandivli police and gave them the number of the vehicle. Ravi Adane, senior inspector of Kandivli police station said that on inquiring about the number plate, they found out that it belonged to a lawyer from Trombay. Further investigations revealed that Khan’s relative Tabassum Khan had eloped with a boy from Mallipur in Uttar Pradesh and that Khan knew of their whereabouts. Tabassum’s uncles had kidnapped Khan to find out where Tabassum and her boyfriend were hiding. Kandivli police then searched the Cheetah Camp area and tracked down Tabassum’s uncles Mobin Khan and Salman Khan. The two then took the police to a room where they had confined Khan. Police rescued Khan and arrested Mobin and Salman for kidnapping and assault. “We are on the lookout for the six other men who had helped to kidnap Khan,” said Adane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-arrested-for-kidnapping-and-assaulting-22-year-old-from-mumbai-s-kandivli-area/story-glVVYqCg9hkJWjW90hH1GI.html
05-10-2020||Chandigarh||PU plans to reopen research labs||Panjab University (PU) is planning to reopen its laboratories for its research scholars in accordance with the unlock 5 guidelines of the Union home ministry. A committee set up to examine the move met on Monday at PU and discussed a way out for the 3,000-plus research scholars in the university who had no access to labs which closed down after the Covid-19 outbreak. Although no final decision was taken on Monday, the panel discussed the modalities to be worked out to allow the research scholars to visit the campus.PU’s dean students welfare (DSW) SK Tomar said to allow the students to visit the campus “we have to keep in mind their safety as well.”Many students want to get back to work. Last month, the Panjab University Research Scholars’ Association had submitted a representation to the university requesting that students be allowed to return to labs and hostels.However, it was observed during Monday’s meeting that providing hostel accommodation to scholars could be a problem as four of the hostels had been handed over to the Chandigarh administration as Covid care centres.Guidelines of unlock 5 would be followed strictly, PU’s dean research VR Sinha said.Punjab Engineering College (PEC) has already decided to open its labs for research scholars from October 15. Various student bodies of PU have also demanded that labs and libraries should be reopened.“Research work is suffering due to inaccessibility to labs. University authorities should reopen labs with proper standard operating procedures and they should also make arrangements for their accommodation,” said a researcher in the chemistry department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-plans-to-reopen-research-labs/story-I7ki7uXq8KHF9ic8aNhInN.html
05-10-2020||Mumbai||Five months after new academic year began, training for Class 12 teachers in Maharashtra to commence||Nearly five months after the new academic year began, the state board is organising a training session for teachers of Class 12. In a circular issued last week, teachers were asked to enrol themselves for the training session by October 8.From the current academic year (2020-21), the state education department revised the syllabus of Class 12 and brought new textbooks. Due to the Covid-19 situation and the resultant lockdown, the textbooks were first released online in May and were then distributed in bookshops before the new academic year began in June.After teachers enrol for the training session, they will be able to attend online sessions which will brief them about the revised syllabus and the marking pattern to be implemented from this year.“With the revised syllabus, teachers need some clarity on the changes that have been introduced in the paper pattern and marking style. Also, with the reduction in the syllabus and the loss of teaching hours, we think there might be some changes in the board pattern. This training should have happened a little earlier, as it has been a long time since we began teaching Class 12 students,” said the principal of a college in the eastern suburbs.This year, the state education department announced a 25% reduction in the syllabus for state board students of Classes 1 to 12. The decision will be applicable for the current academic year 2020-21 and has been taken considering the possible loss of teaching hours as physical schools are yet to reopen due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-months-after-new-academic-year-began-training-for-class-12-teachers-in-maharashtra-to-commence/story-QLGK2jU8gJuFZlTrI0ifwK.html

Karmuse was allegedly beaten up by Awhad’s body guards who took him to Awhad’s bungalow after the former made an objectionable comment on the leader on social media. All three of them were released on bail. Of the three arrested constables, one was attached with the Thane Police and two with the Mumbai Police. All three of them were deployed for personal security of Awhad since the past one year. Senior inspector SB Patil of Vartak Nagar police station said, “We have checked CCTV footages of the incident and found these three police constables Sagar More, Suresh Janathe and Vaibhav Kadam with the people who assaulted Karmuse. Hence, we arrested them.” In April, few people visited Karmuse, a city-based civil engineer, and told him that he would have to visit the police station for his post. However, they took him to Awhad’s bungalow where he was beaten up by around 10 to 15 followers of Awhad. Karmuse had posted a morphed picture of the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/assault-at-maharashtra-minister-jitendra-awhad-s-bungalow-three-cops-arrested/story-VbZ2h8GtDtg16aODO3I97K.html

05-10-2020||Mumbai||In a first, NCP sets up LGBT cell||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday formed a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) cell that will push for their rights. With this move, NCP is claimed to be the first political party across the country to have set up a dedicated cell for the community. State NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil and party MP Supriya Sule launched the cell at the party headquarters. The party has also declared a 15-member body headed by Priya Patil, a community activist. “NCP was the first party to experiment by setting up Yuvati Congress (young women) cell and now it has established an LGBT cell in an attempt to bring justice to the deprived section,” Patil said at the event, adding that the party declared forming a dedicated cell for the LGBT community in its election manifesto.“Glad to announce that NCP has launched an LGBTQIA+ cell in order to voice the issues of the queer and bring them to the mainstream. Unfortunately, the LGBTQIA community is subjected to bullying and violence due to prejudice,” said Sule in a series of tweets.“We must eliminate the prejudice that we have towards the queer community and be more inclusive towards alternative gender identities and gender expression. Work needs to be done to make a more inclusive society free of prejudice, homophobia and transphobia,” she said.LGBT activist Harish Iyer said every political party should have such cells with adequate representation from the community. “Every party should have a cell for queer people, and even within the queer people there needs to be adequate representation of all the LGBT communities that come from different caste and communities. We need such cells to include diversity within the LGBT community with a focus on not just working on issues but also the intersections of the issues,” Iyer said“It is a much welcome step taken by the NCP but we hope to see a system to map progress of the community in the coming future. The Maharashtra government has established a Transgender Welfare Board as well, but nothing happened later,” said Ashok Row Kavi, LGBT activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-a-first-ncp-sets-up-lgbt-cell/story-LyrK4BCZcDFXqOxlGFn3QP.html
05-10-2020||Mumbai||Shift biomedical waste plant out of Mumbai within a year to reduce air pollution: Aaditya Thackeray||Following air pollution concerns raised by Govandi residents over the past few months, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has directed the city’s only biomedical waste plant to be shifted out within a year. The minister also directed that private waste operator SMS Envoclean Pvt Ltd, which was appointed by the civic body to deal with Mumbai’s Covid-19 waste and associated biomedical waste, needs to expedite the process of identifying an alternative site for their operations within a month.The decisions were taken by Thackeray during a meeting on Monday with private waste operators, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and other state government officials.“There are two sides to this issue. While we must realise that the presence of this plant within a residential area makes it a threat to citizens with regard to unfavourable air quality, at the same time this is the only certified biomedical treatment centre in the city which is also dealing with Covid-19 waste,” said Thackeray. He added, “The plant has been directed to reduce treatment by the permissible limit of its current carrying capacity, and submit a plan within 10 days as to how they intend on shifting out of Mumbai. Once the site is selected, based on permissions issued by various state departments, it would take at least a year to phase the plant out of Mumbai.”Thackeray added that another follow-up meeting will be held within 15 days to examine developments in the matter. Local residents have filed several complaints since the beginning of lockdown against SMS Envoclean for allegedly violating air pollution norms by releasing black smoke through its chimney into residential areas.On September 11, a legal notice to MPCB issued by advocate Saif Alam and signed by 100 residents from Govandi, Mankhurd, Deonar and surrounding areas, alleged that repeated complaints between July and September went unnoticed and that MPCB did not conduct any investigation. The notice further alleged ignorance by the pollution regulator about residential and slum areas in the vicinity of SMS breathing ‘poisonous air’ and ‘having skin ailments’ even as one of the slums had witnessed 8.9% fatality rate due to Covid-19.As a response to the notice, MPCB Mumbai’s regional officer AN Harshwardhan directed SMS Envoclean to divert 50% of the treatment carrying capacity of Covid-19 waste to another unit in Taloja-Mumbai Waste Management Ltd. He further stated that black smoke was emitted after incinerating personal protective equipment (PEE) kits and highlighted that the plant was complying with air quality emission standards.On Sunday, Alam had written to Thackeray requesting action in the matter or he would be forced to move the National Green Tribunal seeking closure of the plant. Reacting to Monday’s decisions taken by Thackeray, Alam said, “A year is too long a time frame for this plant to remain operational as air pollution is increasing on a daily basis. We will await a formal response to our letter to the environment minister since we were not invited for the meeting on Monday. Once the decision on action on this plant is clear, we will take a call whether to move NGT.” Meanwhile, SMS plant operators said they were receiving 30-32 tons of Covid-19 and associated biomedical waste daily from Mumbai against their capacity of 24 tons. “We are already sending a large quantity of waste to Taloja and have reduced incineration significantly. Directions issued by the minister on Monday will be followed and a plan will be ready to shift the plant to a 3-acre area in Khalapur within one year from the time we receive permissions such as consent to establish the unit from MPCB, environment clearance, and construction permission. We will be submitting our plan of action within the next 10 days,” said Amit Nilawar, director, SMS Envoclean.SMS WAS ISSUED CLOSURE NOTICE BUT THEY GOT STAY FROM BOMBAY HCIn 2018, MPCB had issued a closure notice to SMS after it failed to meet safety standards under the air and water pollution Acts. However, the unit managed to get a stay on the order from the Bombay high court. Thereafter, SMS refurbished their air pollution control system in full compliance as per norms, said MPCB. The plant follows a process of secondary combustion across four chambers through scrubbing and water sprinkling to remove hazardous pollutants. However, local residents said they had faced severe difficulty in breathing due to harmful black smoke daily emanating from the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shift-biomedical-waste-plant-out-of-mumbai-within-a-year-to-reduce-air-pollution-aaditya-thackeray/story-Nnbn3oXA47BJ3DF4xIpNHP.html

No arrest has been made so far.”“I will submit the evidence to the police so they can carry on further investigation and trace the man. The man is not known to me. I stepped forward to complain as a responsible citizen,” said Katarnaware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-man-booked-for-using-casteist-slur-in-video/story-hXiV5qOttziIzaqie83A1M.html
05-10-2020||City||PAU expert urges farmers to use Super SMS for straw management||An expert from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has appealed to farmers of the state to desist from paddy straw burning and use PAU Super Straw Management System (SMS) for its management.GS Manes, additional director of research (farm mechanisation and bioenergy), PAU, said: “This technology can chop and spread the straw coming out of the rear of combine harvester evenly in the field for uniform straw-load in the field. This also helps in ease of straw handling, better crop emergence, and establishment. In fact, the use of PAU Super SMS is a requisite for the adoption of specialised machines for wheat sowing like Happy Seeder, Super Seeder, etc.”The use of Super SMS attachment on paddy combine harvesters were made mandatory by Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in February 2018 and PAU has licensed this technology to about 120 manufacturers, he said.Referring to its benefits, Manes said that the uniform spread of paddy residue helps to retain moisture content in the field and favours better germination of following wheat crop. The chopping of paddy residue enhances the drying rate of residue due to increased surface area.As the paddy residue contains 60%-70% moisture on weight basis, the accelerated evaporation of moisture reduces the effective residue load in the field, he added. As the residue load in the field reduces to about one-third of its initial amount, the working of machines used for in-situ residue management improves.Machines like Happy Seeder, Super Seeder, and paddy straw chopper/mulcher (used for incorporation of paddy straw) benefit from Super SMS technology in terms of their field performance, he said. The Super SMS has the option of switching on or off using a small metal sheet. This enables the combine harvester with Super SMS attachment to be used as a traditional combine harvester without dismantling the SMS attachment (for collection of residues from the field), he added.Manes said, “All traditional combine harvester operators are already categorised as skilled operators. Any operator/person who can operate the combine harvester is skilled enough to operate the Super SMS attached with the combine harvester.”He further explained, “The Super SMS requires about 8-10 hp to operate in the field. The commercially available self-propelled combine harvesters have sufficient power to operate Super SMS attachment in addition to its conventional fieldwork. The fuel consumption for combine harvester with Super SMS attachment is about 25% higher (at about 26 cm height of cut) for combine with Super SMS attachment as compared to the conventional combine harvester.Higher fuel consumption and lower field capacity of combine harvester fitted with Super SMS translate into about ₹375 to ₹400 extra per acre. This is compensated by improved efficiency of the subsequent incorporation/mulching and seeding operations, he added. Emphasizing on balancing the Super SMS, he said, “The Super SMS rotor once properly balanced, works fine for a complete harvesting season until there is a major breakdown of the flails, blades of SMS rotor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-expert-urges-farmers-to-use-super-sms-for-straw-management/story-G0NUPleN8ZbWXEbsqm4nTK.html

Chemical analyses carried out at the Haryana Pollution Control Board’s district laboratory have shown that the treated wastewater conforms to India’s Discharge Standards for Treated Sewage, they added. The first of these three WWTPs (which are part of eight such facilities scheduled to become operational this year) was inaugurated in Farrukh Nagar’s Khentawas village in July. “Our assessment period, which lasts for a month and half since the plant starts operations, has been completed and the results are promising. The quality of the treated wastewater shows that the facility is performing as per expectations. The WWTP’s performance will get better over time as biological treatment systems improve as they adapt to local conditions,” said Sayani Halder, wastewater treatment specialist with Gurujal. There are four main indicators, Halder explained, which reveal whether the WWTP is effective. These include biological and chemical oxygen demand, pH level, colour and odour, and turbidity of the treated water. “On all these fronts, the Khentawas WWTP and pond revival project has been successful. Though we cannot share the reports of the chemical analysis, we can say that the water is safe for both recharge and for secondary uses,” Halder added.This is also the case with two other such plants, in Maujabad and Nawada villages, though these are yet to complete their six week assessment period. Nevertheless, preliminary tests have shown that these, too, are have been effective in treating wastewater from nearby households. “We will continue to test the water on a monthly basis even after the assessment period is complete,” Halder saidOn the basis of these results, Gurujal officials said that these nature-friendly technologies will be scaled up across rural Gurugram, where over 700 water bodies have been earmarked for revival. “We will also implement them in urban areas where suitable. For example, in Wazirpur and Dharampur, such plants are already under construction. We also planning to use a similar solution to revive a water body in Subash Nagar in Gurugram city,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, chairperson, Gurujal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pilot-plants-in-three-villages-in-gurugram-show-desirable-results-in-treating-local-sewage-officials/story-9HnjfII1DHbJR1ylXCf5YI.html
05-10-2020||City||‘Nature-based’ solutions for wastewater treatment in rural Gurugram||Gurugram: The district administration’s Gurujal society has planned to establish at least eight ‘nature-based’ wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across eight villages in Gurugram for the benefit of rural clusters that do not have proper facilities to treat household sewage. Three are already operational in Maujabad, Khentawas and Nawada villages while the rest are under construction. The purpose of these eco-friendly WWTPs are two-fold, Gurujal officials explained. “They are all part of a larger pond-revival project, where we will use the treated wastewater to recharge underlying groundwater aquifers and to fill up locally available water bodies. The other goal is to provide a sustainable, self-sufficient wastewater solution in villages where household sewage typically collects in some low-lying area outside the village,” Sayani Halder, wastewater consultant, Gurujal, said.Experts explained that these WWTPs differ from traditional sewage treatment plants (STPs) in that they do not rely on chemical treatment of wastewater, and do not use motors and pumps to transport the water within the plant. These plants do not have a high operational cost, do not require a constant supply of electricity (making them suitable for rural clusters), and do not require technically trained staff to manage daily operations. Subhi Kesarwani, chairperson, Gurujal, said Gurugram is the only district in the country implementing these technologies on a large scale. “In other parts of the country, such WWTPs have been built, but at smaller capacities of 25KLD or less. We are building them to treat between 100KLD and 500KLD of wastewater every day. Moreover, each of these will serve as its own pilot project so we can gauge the efficacy of various technological solutions.”The eight villages in rural Gurugram earmarked for such WWTPs are Maujabad, Hariahera, Dhaula, Tajnagar, Khentawas, Nawada, Budera and Kasan. Of these, the first four plants are based on ‘root bed zone systems’, wherein “wastewater passes through a bed of specialised plants, where treatment takes place by filtration through layers of soil,” explains a methodology brief shared by Gurujal. Various microorganisms present in these root systems of these plants are responsible for “cleaning up” the wastewater, which passes through the root beds.“These WWTPs are best suited for rural areas as they require a fair bit of land. These are called nature-based solutions because they use the natural topography of the region to channel wastewater from homes to treatment plants, where the water is filtered through biological systems, like root zones, or more sustainable material like gravel and coconut husks. The water may also be treated through biological enzymes. There is none of the chemical treatment that a traditional, electro-mechanical STP in urban areas would use. For the same reason, and because they rely on naturally available materials, they are much cheaper to build and operate,” said Halder. In Budera village, where the WWTP will operate at a capacity of 500KLD, the plant is based on a technology known as DEWATS (short for decentralised wastewater treatment system). Halder explained, “This technology is different from root zone systems in that there is no biological agent which oxygenates the water. Instead, the water is passed through multiple physical barriers made up of natural materials that filter out any unwanted biological and chemical agents.” These barriers are built in the form of ‘constructed wetlands’ and do not require much day-to-day maintenance, or skilled staff to operate it, Halder added. Variations and combinations of these technologies are being implemented in other villages. In Nawada, for example, biological filtration systems are being combined with the use of biological enzymes, which break down unwanted agents and possible pathogens in sewage. In Kasan, meanwhile, the WWTP will make use of bio-filters, but will also use an ozonation tank to eliminate any bacterial pathogens in treated sewage. Yet another technological solution, which is being implemented in Khentawas village, involves the use of an ‘advanced eco-reactor’ (AER). According to a brief shared by Gurujal, “This is based on the principle of trickling water, where wastewater is sprayed over numerous layers of gravel and coconut husks, which are initiated with bio-enzymes that provide both biological and physical treatment of water.” Kesarwani said each of these plants has been carefully planned after considering the local environmental context. “We have realised that it is not enough to simply have a cut-copy-paste solution. These specific technologies have been chosen after thorough investigation of the local situation. Is it more important to ensure groundwater recharge? Or is it more important to ensure availability of water for non-potable purposes? What is the local hydrogeology and what solution would it serve best? Depending on our findings in a given village, we have a range of solutions which can be used, either alone or in combination, depending on the local conditions.” Advantages of ‘nature-based’ wastewater treatment plants:1) Preventing pollution of drains, water bodies and groundwater2) Treated water can be used locally for secondary, non-pot able purposes like agriculture and washing3) Lower operational and maintenance cost4) Do not technically trained staff to operate5) Do not rely on electricity to work, making them ideal for rural clusters where power cuts are frequent6) Make use of naturally available materials, no chemical treatment of water involved||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nature-based-solutions-for-wastewater-treatment-in-rural-gurugram/story-pPkbK66dXwD707u2NlQS2J.html

She has threatened to launch an agitation if the demand was not met.The demand was raised following a hike in the toll charges from ₹35 to ₹40 for single entry with effect from October 1. Navi Mumbai residents have to pay toll at both the Vashi and Airoli toll nakas, the two entry points to Mumbai Mhatre said, “For long, the residents of Navi Mumbai have been paying the charges despite the government norm that those residing within 4 km of the toll plaza will be exempt from the payment. There was also an assurance that if traffic at the toll naka is over 100m, the vehicles should be allowed to pass without any payment.”She claimed that none of these was being followed at the toll nakas in Navi Mumbai. There is no provision for return pass either and hence the residents have been burdened every day.Mhatre added, “I have asked the chief minister to act on the matter. If no decision on the issue was taken soon, I will launch an agitation as the common man is affected by it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-mla-writes-to-maharashtra-chief-minister-demanding-toll-waiver-threatens-agitation/story-f4lUGP705CFOlP1iMISIdN.html
05-10-2020||Gurugram||ATMs may be sealed for not paying fees to Municipal Corporation of Gurugram||At least 600 ATMs across the city face the prospect of getting sealed if banks do not pay pending registration fees to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) at the earliest, officials said on Monday. Officials familiar with the matter said the banks had been served notices repeatedly over the last two months but they have not respond yet.“The ATMs of all banks falling within MCG area need to pay a registration fee to the civic body. We have already sent three notices to the banks concerned. The third notice (served around Mid-September) was the final one and we have started the proceedings for initiating the next step as per law,” said Sanjeev Maan, senior town planner, MCG.According to the Haryana government’s Communication and Connectivity Infrastructure Policy 2013, if any communication infrastructure is installed in any commercial building, the owner needs to pay the local municipal corporation a licensing fee for it or remove the structure altogether. As far as ATMs are concerned, a dish antenna is classified as a communication infrastructure for which banks need to pay Rs 5,000 to the MCG as licence fees per ATM, officials said. According to officials privy to the matter, a file in connection with the commencement of sealing operations has been sent to MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh for approval. “As soon as the MCG commissioner gives approval, we will initiate the sealing process. We have sent notices to banks on three separate occasions since August and they haven’t cleared their dues so far. Until we start the sealing process, the banks wouldn’t pay up. It was the same case in 2016 as well,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.MCG commissioner could not be reached for comment.In July 2016, the Haryana accountant general (audit) had directed MCG to shut around 400 ATMs in the city if banks failed to pay the Rs 5,000 licencing fee within 90 days. Following the expiry of the notice, around a dozen ATMs were also sealed at that time and subsequently, banks had started clearing their dues.“A meeting was conducted with MCG officials earlier this year where they had asked us for relevant contact details of all banks in the city for the licensing fee process. They had initially sought the same details from a national telecommunications company that provide dish antennas to all ATMs but hadn’t received any response. On July 29, email addresses of all banks concerned in the city were shared with the MCG’s planning branch for their perusal,” said Prahlad Rai Godara, lead district manager (LDM), Gurugram. The role of the LDM or lead banker is to work as an intermediary between the government and the banks.Godara said that there are 537 bank branches in urban areas of the city that fall within MCG’s jurisdiction and 1,489 ATMs in the entire Gurugram district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/atms-may-be-sealed-for-not-paying-fees-to-municipal-corporation-of-gurugram/story-1vl37SMKZz46NjZa9YDr1K.html

The three accused men had been identified but were yet to be arrested, said police on Monday. According to the police, the woman from Palwal, who decorates flower arrangements at weddings, got a call from one Jahir, a Nuh resident, on Saturday. The police said he told her to come for work to Hathin, where a wedding was scheduled on Sunday. The police said when she arrived at the scheduled location, Jahir told her to go to a room in an under-construction building nearby to pick up some garments. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “When she went to the room, two more men, identified as Meenu and Dony, were already present in the room. Jahir followed her into the room and locked it. The three men then took turns to rape her. She suffered some bruises on her face as she tried to resist them. She alleged that the accused men threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident and escaped.” The woman then ran from the spot and approached the women’s police station in Palwal, following which her medical examination was conducted and a case was registered under sections 376 D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code. The suspects hail from Nuh, said police, adding that raids were on to arrest them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/25-year-old-woman-gang-raped-by-three-in-palwal/story-5r8y2upCMXL2Mu2DPHo0TI.html
05-10-2020||Gurugram||Residents of DLF Phase-2 raise security concerns after gang-rape incident||A day after a 25-year-old woman was allegedly gang raped by four men, three of whom worked with food delivery aggregators, in a real estate office in DLF Phase-2, residents of the locality raised security concerns, alleging that police patrolling had been lax especially during the night time. They urged the police to increase deployment at key entry points of the locality to check crime. Several residents and representatives of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of DLF-2 met the station house officer (SHO) of Phase-2 police station on Sunday and discussed their concerns. Vivek Rastogi, a resident of J Block, said, “Security needs to be strengthened. There have been several incidents of crime in the past few months and police patrolling is insufficient. There have been cases of eve-teasing and snatching, while anti-social elements often lurk in the internal lanes, creating nuisance. Safety remains a concern especially during the night time. My car was stolen last year and we have now recruited a private guard for security.” The members of the RWA requested the police to have permanent police deployment at two check posts — near Sikanderpur Metro station on MG road and near DLF City Court side — on roads leading towards the locality. The colony, which has over 3,500 plots, is one of the oldest residential areas and serves as a link to MG Road and National Highway 48. Built in 1986, it is spread across 488 acres with more than 20,000 residents staying there. The responsibility of the upkeep of the colony is in the process of being taken over by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) from DLF. Praveen Chandra, another resident, said, “It is a shocking incident. Security needs to be beefed up especially at the entry and exit points. Trespassing is a major concern. The authorities should create a system to ensure that the security guards keep a check on people delivering groceries, food, courier services in the locality and register their details at entry points.” Manish Dhawan, president, DLF-2 RWA, said, “After the incident, the issue has been discussed among residents and we have shared our inputs with the police. On Sunday night, the SHO and some RWA members took a round of the colony and identified certain points, where vigilance needs to be ramped up. Meanwhile, we are also working to get boom barriers installed on all the external entry gates, which would automatically improve the situation of trespassing and access points would be secured.” Dhawan added that there are a total of six external gates to the colony, and at all the six gates, private security from DLF is deputed. Despite repeated attempts, representatives from DLF could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, the four accused men, who were arrested on Sunday morning, were produced in a district court on Monday and sent to judicial custody. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “At the two check points mentioned by the residents, additional policemen have been deployed. We are looking into the security concerns raised by the people and a security plan shall be prepared accordingly.” (With inputs from Kartik Kumar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-of-dlf-phase-2-raise-security-concerns-after-gang-rape-incident/story-H0bfRyUeMDcPZ2sHvYIqJI.html
05-10-2020||City||Two suspected criminals held after shootout in Vikaspuri||New Delhi: Two suspected criminals were arrested after a brief chase and a gunfight in west Delhi’s Vikaspuri on Sunday night, Delhi Police said on Monday. Both of them took one bullet each in their legs while two policemen were hit in their bulletproof vests but escaped unhurt. A total of eight rounds were fired, including five by the raiding team, police said.“The arrested criminals, Deepak alias Deepu,32, and Surender alias Sheru,40, are members of a gang led by Salman Tyagi and Saddam alias Gauri. Deepak was also wanted in a case registered against him under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), 1999,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), (special cell), Delhi PoliceOn Sunday evening, DCP Yadav said, the special cell team received information that the two associates of Saddam would go to Vikaspuri to kill a rival. Acting on the tip-off, the team waited at the Ganda Nala road near Vikaspuri. Around 8 pm, the team members spotted Deepak and Surender on a motorcycle.“The police team ordered Deepak to stop and surrender but he accelerated and tried to flee. The police chased them. The two suspects’ motorcycle skidded off the road following the hot chase by the police. Though the team surrounded the suspects, the duo whipped out their guns and fired at the police,” said DCP Yadav.“Deepak fired two rounds of which one missed a constable, who was trying to apprehend the duo. His other bullet hit the bulletproof vest of a head constable. Surender fired one bullet that hit a sub-inspector (S-I) in his bulletproof vest. Our team members fired five bullets in self-defence. Deepak and Surender took one bullet each in their left and right legs. Both the policemen, who were shot at, are safe,” the DCP said, adding two pistols and five cartridges were recovered from them.The injured men were admitted to an adjoining hospital, where they are undergoing treatment. A case was registered against the duo and they were arrested. The three were wanted in several cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion. They worked for the Salman Tyagi and Saddam Gauri gang.Police said Tyagi is a history sheeter of Hari Nagar police station and was externed from Delhi for two years in 2015 because of his criminal activities. He reorganised his gang and started extorting from illegal betting operators in west Delhi. He was arrested by police in 2016 and since then he has been operating from jail, they said.Saddam aka Gauri is a close aide of jailed gangster Neeraj Bawana. He was arrested by the special cell team in Meerut following a shootout in October, 2019.He was wanted in several criminal cases such as murder, attempts to murder, robberies, dacoities, snatching and for attacking police personnel. He was also booked under MCOCA, 1999, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-suspected-criminals-held-after-shootout-in-vikaspuri/story-P6YtD1pispoj1TVwYLkD0H.html

Sheetla Mata temple in Sector 6 records high footfall during the Navratri celebrations every year and expects to see more than four lakh devotees this year, officials said. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “A day before Navratri starts, all the staff members of the temple will be tested for Covid-19. Since the temple is expecting over four lakh people over a period of nine days, the health department will conduct a second round of the test for the staff on October 21 or 22 to identify people who might have contracted the virus.” Navratri will last till October 25.According to Yadav, the temple staff, who will be in direct contact with the devotees while distributing prasad and offerings, will be tested twice during the nine-day long period. The decision was taken in a meeting held between health department and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Monday. Taking further precautionary measure, the MCG team will sanitise the temple premises daily. Ashish Singla, medical officer, MCG, said, “Not only Sheetla Mata but other temples across the city are also being identified where high footfall is expected. The list of these temples is being prepared where sanitisation will be carried out on a regular basis.”Religious places in Gurugram were reopened for public from August 12 after the 68-day nationwide lockdown that was imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. An order was issued by the district administration, stating that the temple operators would have to follow prescribed social distancing norms and other precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-to-test-staff-of-sheetla-mata-temple-during-navratri-celebrations/story-ra7GbwgGeC3A9K5M15nuxK.html

05-10-2020||Mumbai||1,300 wild animals killed by electrocution in India over a decade: Report||Around 1,300 wild animals had been electrocuted across India due to deliberate and accidental electrocution between 2010 and 2020, reveals a data compiled by NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI). The report was shared on Sunday, during an edition of Maharashtra Forest Department’s wildlife week discussions. The numbers included over 500 elephants, 220 flamingos, 150 leopards and 46 tigers among other animals across the country.In Maharashtra, while there haven’t been any cases of elephant electrocution, WPSI members said 18 leopards, 16 tigers and 11 bears were major animals to be electrocuted, over a decade. Other animals included bison, deer, flamingos, monkeys, and wild boar. Overall, 74 wild animals had been killed by electrocution in Maharashtra (2010-2020). States such as Odisha, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand had all witnessed high animal electrocution deaths over the past decade. Maharashtra and Gujarat had witnessed most cases involving leopards and flamingos.“Animal electrocution continues to be a major issue but it has been tackled to some extent in Maharashtra,” said Nitin Desai, director (central India), WPSI adding, “Complete electrification in rural areas turning out to be a bane for wildlife because people are tapping 11 kilovolt overhead lines that are crisscrossing through forests and using those high tension wires to kill wild animals by laying uninsulated wires traps. Any animal coming in contact with those wires, get zapped and die instantly.”Desai explained that the modus operandi for deliberate electrocution or poaching was for cheap meat. “The economic angle is simple. Goat meat is ₹500-600 a kilogram, poultry is tasteless for hardcore meat-eaters. In that background, poachers offering wild animal meat for ₹80-100 a kilo, which also delivers home would easily find a lot of customers, and develop into a lucrative illegal business inside and along the periphery of forest areas,” he said adding, “The other issue is the fear of crop damage. Farmers use illegal power fences and set up uninsulated wire perimeters around their farm, and electrify them using their legal meter connections. Soft footed animals like tigers, bears, and leopards face instant death after coming in contact with them.” In 2017, Maharashtra recorded 21 tiger deaths, highest in a decade and second highest in India. Of the 21, six tigers were electrocuted either purposely or through accidental electrocution, making this a serious concern for the forest department to deal with. Cases had been reported from Chandrapur, Nagpur, Wardha, and Bhramapuri, including the death of iconic tiger Jai’s son Srinivas in Nagbhid range in April. A committee set up by the forest department in July 2017 called the Working Group on Electrocution comprising the Maharashtra chief wildlife warden, regional director of the Maharashtra State Electricity Development Corporation Ltd. (MSEDCL), a scientist from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun and Desai studied tiger movement and possible solutions to the electrocution issue in the Vidarbha landscape. The group has identified over 1,000 villages where these fences have been set up. Interventions led to the installation of solar fences across 556 villages in Vidarbha and 150 villages across central Maharashtra and Konkan, replacing high-intensity electric fences.“Since 2017, the committee through stakeholders has conducted several workshops wherein the MSEDCL officers and forest field staff have been exposed to issues related to electrocution. Exchange of ideas, contacts and suggestions highlighted the seriousness involved with this whole issue, said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra adding that now a group (including forest and MSEDCL) of officials work specifically with electrocution related issues in Vidarbha where alerts and anonymous tip-offs are immediately responded to on-site. “This has led to better coordination among all groups but one can never be complacent about this issue since it continues to be a looming threat,” said Kakodkar.In October 2016, the Union environment ministry issued guidelines detailing safe practices to avoid animal deaths due to electrocution by power transmission lines directing electricity distribution companies to preferably use air bunching of cables (ABC) - overhead ones or use underground cables as much as possible.Every case of animal electrocution reported is being taken with utmost seriousness by us,” said Avinash Sahare, superintending engineer (Nagpur), MSEDCL. “Along with the forest department, we have jointly surveyed core and peripheral forest areas where locations have been identified where ABC can be implemented. We are working on ways to ensure cables are tied together in such a manner that they cannot be tampered with.”Desai said ABC was a costly proposition but other measures included solar fencing, joint patrolling, and identifying sensitive sections where incidents have taken place repeatedly as hot spots. “There has been a positive decline in cases in Maharashtra from 2018-20 but the risk lingers,” he said.The Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) landscape in Vidarbha alone has witnessed 16 deaths in 2017 and 11 in 2018 due to animals being electrocuted by live wires in farms adjacent to forest patches with the majority of the cases in buffer areas. “As of now, ABC is being implemented in the Tadoba landscape, and based on the feasibility, we will extend to other places,” said Kakodkar.A senior forest official requesting anonymity said, “Since executing ABC is costly, the committee looking into electrocution needs to come up with a strategy to fund expenditure on this technique equally for MSEDCL, forest department and the district bodies for effective and timely implementation.”EFFORTS TAKEN SO FAR TO CURB ELECTRIC FENCING- Removing illegal fences, hooks and power supply lines coming from high tension wires in the vicinity- Joint patrolling with MSEDCL officials during the day and night to check areas prone to electrocution and issue notices, booking villagers who have flouted electricity norms- Awareness drives across villages about how these fences can be fatal for all animals and how it needs to be done only when necessary- With the help of the forest department, WPSI launched a scheme where cash rewards will be presented to villagers who alert the committee about illegal fences and similar violations||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-300-wild-animals-killed-by-electrocution-in-india-over-a-decade-report/story-zK5yrodyMJyxhMtNhjmtFI.html

From having a collection of more than 50,000 books for general readers, students and the elderly, the library will also have an employment desk and audio classes for the visually impaired.The library is being funded by the Haryana corporate social responsibility (CSR) advisory board, and the district administration plans to inaugurate the library by next year. Officials said they were in the final phase of confirming the plot required for the library. “The project has been approved by the district administration. The team is in the last phase of finalising the land,” said Gaurav Singh, additional chief executive officer and regional head, Haryana CSR advisory board, Gurugram region. The idea to establish a second public library in the district was mooted after noticing the increased footfall in the old district library, officials said. “Before Covid-19, it was noticed that old district library was receiving a positive response from students. After the renovation, the footfall increased from 80 to 230 on a daily basis,” said Singh. “Corporates have expressed their interest in setting up the modern library for the city after visiting the district library in old Gurugram. The new library will give an easy access to people living in the new Gurugram areas,” he said. According to Singh, the plot selected for the library comes under the jurisdiction of child welfare department(CWC), which has agreed to extend support. “For the appointment of the staff at the library, the department of higher education is likely to be roped in,” he said.Several official meetings have taken place for this project, whereby the administration teams visited some of the Delhi-based public libraries and the one at Management Development Institute in Gurugram. “By visiting these libraries, we are trying to incorporate some of their best practices in our plan, such as having books on subjects of foreign languages, study material on higher education, and books on both fiction and non-fiction,” said Singh, adding that the place will also have an employment desk, where students can inquire about the existing vacancies in government or private sectors and public sector undertakings (PSUs). To give it a modern look, the place is likely to have an eating area. Singh said that the plan is to make the library functional round the clock, provided that there is sufficient security facility. “But for the initial three months, it will be operational from 9am to 7pm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-plans-to-establish-a-new-public-library-in-dlf-phase-1/story-HygYMUnuyn10s5o8QtchlN.html

A large boundary wall and pillars on the plot were also demolished. We will also write to officials of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) regarding the presence of illegal commercial shops that have come up in the area but are under their jurisdiction,” said RS Bhath, district town planner.A team of Gurugram police comprising around 50 personnel supported the enforcement officials in the exercise, the officials said.Bhath also said the enforcement team also visited the Suncity commercial area in Sector 57 and got all the encroachments removed from its corridors and lanes. “ We had received a number of complaints from the residents, so the team visited the commercial area on Monday and got the encroachments removed. We have also told all the shopkeepers that such violations should not be repeated, else, they would face stringent action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/illegal-colony-in-sector-37d-demolished/story-tTzgFOrY2wa2hEVyejcCMN.html
05-10-2020||Gurugram||Health department struggles to track people providing office address as ID for Covid-19 tests||The district health department has once again directed the private diagnostic labs administering Covid-19 tests to ask for complete residential address for verification and contact tracing of people who are getting tested in their facilities.Many people have been allegedly providing their office addresses instead of residential ones, as per health department officials, thereby making it difficult for the authorities to reach out to them and trace their contacts.With industrial units resuming operations and multiple offices opening up in the district since Unlock 4, many people coming from the neighbouring cities for work here are getting tested in Gurugram labs, officials said. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that more than 60 such cases are being reported every day. “Of these over 20 cases are transferred to the police department for tracking as the rapid response teams (RRTs) are unable to reach out to them. Even for the police, it takes a day or two to trace such cases,” said Yadav.On Saturday, in a meeting with the representatives of private labs and hospitals conducting Covid-19 tests, the district administration directed them to focus on proper address verification of those seeking Covid-19 tests in order to avoid hassle pertaining to contact tracing of positive cases.“Many people from Delhi, Faridabad, Noida are coming to Gurugram as multiple industrial units and offices are now functional. It has come into our notice that many of these people are getting tested in the labs of Gurugram but are submitting their office address. Though they are spend eight hours or more in the city because of work, their residential address is taken is the only valid proof,” said Yadav.Although contact tracing of cases has remarkably improved from 82% in August to almost 97% in September, there is still a pendency of more than 150 cases every alternate day as numbers keep piling up. Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer for Covid-19, said, “Besides tracing such cases, enough time is consumed in changing the details on the government portal and further transferring the case to the respective city of the positive patient.”On the other hand, Rishabh Rajput, director of Covid-19 and microbiology division, Modern Diagnostics, said that besides recording the permanent address, which is shown in valid ID proofs such as Aadhaar cards, they also ask people to write down their temporary address. “As per the health department’s directive, these details have to be further verified at the lab’s end,” he said. Gurugram is currently conducting nearly 3,000 tests on an average in both government and private labs taken together. This figure includes both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-struggles-to-track-people-providing-office-address-as-id-for-covid-19-tests/story-FBaxu7fT9XkGP7iqp9vx4I.html

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||CHB to auction 200 properties by December end||The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) will offer more than 200 properties for sale by the end of December and is likely to lower last year’s reserve prices.Residential and commercial properties, both leasehold and freehold, will be auctioned and the CHB is currently drawing up a list of the units with their reserve prices. “In addition to the properties listed for auction last year, new units will be included too,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB.Reserve prices could be cut as the response to the auction last year was not on expected lines, he added. “We will offering the properties for auction by December end,” Garg confirmed.CHB’s committee on reserve prices is deliberating on the revised costs to find what’s attractive for buyers and as soon the revised rates are submitted, the housing board will fix the auction dates, he added. Last auction a damp squibCHB’s last auction in December 2019 turned out to be a damp squib due to lack of buyer response to its 212 properties, the blame for which was pinned on high reserve prices.The offerings included 64 residential units, of which nine were on leasehold and 55 on freehold. Most of these were located in Sector 63. All the 48 commercial properties offered were on leasehold.CHB also faced flak for the high property prices. For instance, the reserve price of a two-bedroom apartment in Sector 51 was Rs 99.92 lakh and that of an economically weaker section apartment was Rs 30 lakh. A one bedroom apartment in Sector 63 had a reserve price of Rs 54.80 lakh. Prices of commercial properties ranged from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore.The highest reserve price of Rs 1.07 crore was fixed for a freehold 3-BHK (bedroom hall kitchen) apartment in Sector 63. In the leasehold segment, a high income group apartment in Sector 39 had a reserve price of Rs 1.31 crore.Condition of properties a concernThe condition of CHB properties, both residential and commercial, which had remained vacant for years, will also be offered in the auction.Most of the units are located in Manimajra, sectors 45, 41, 47, 39, 38 west, 49 and 51.“The condition of such properties which have remained unused and vacant for a long time is deteriorating and CHB, which is also losing revenues simultaneously, has to spend considerable sums of money on their maintenance,” said a CHB official wishing to remain anonymous.Encroachment too is a concern, so “CHB has formed a team dedicated to periodically check all the vacant properties,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chb-to-auction-200-properties-by-december-end/story-eaaGAt6QxJqyqTERpSRaLO.html

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana mayor faces criticism from party members over bias||Mayor Balkar Sandhu, who had earlier been targeted by opposition leaders, is now facing criticism from leaders of his own party for not involving councillors of their respective constituencies in committees being formed for different development works. Congress MLA from Ludhiana east, Sanjay Talwar, and in-charge of Atam Nagar constituency, Kamaljit Singh Karwal, have raised objections over the non-inclusion of councillors from their respective constituencies from official tours being organised to study solid waste management and establishment of construction and demolition (C and D) waste plant. While a team of six councillors and MC officials is already on an official tour to Indore to study solid waste management, the mayor and few others councillors along with MC officials are expected to visit Jodhpur to study C and D waste plant on Tuesday. Karwal wrote a letter to the mayor on Monday seeking inclusion of councillors from Atam Nagar constituency in committees. “We cannot work for the development of the city by ignoring an entire constituency. If some changes have to be made in the working or a project has to be implemented, the mayor should involve councillors from every constituency. Only then can councillors learn and implement new policies for the betterment of public,” the letter stated.MLA Talwar said, “There are 14 Congress councillors in the east constituency, but not a single one has been made a part of these committees. Efforts should be made to take up development in the entire city and all constituencies should be considered equally. The mayor represents the entire city and no constituency should be left behind in terms of development.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that no constituency is being ignored and councillors from East and Atam Nagar constituencies will also be involved in the committees. He added that the list of councillors who will be visiting Jodhpur is not final yet and a councillor from Atam nagar constituency is also being included in the list.This is not the first time that MLA Talwar has raised objection on the working of the mayor. Earlier too, they had been at loggerheads over alleged discrimination while taking up developmental works. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mayor-faces-criticism-from-party-members-over-bias/story-tvJmclLdevB0CWyvPVu2vM.html

AAP convener Prem Garg, in a press conference on Monday, said that AAP will not impose any new taxes if it gets a majority in the MC elections. Garg welcomed former senior Congress leader Chander Mukhi Sharma into the party fold and nominated him as the in-charge for the upcoming MC elections. Sharma said, “A lot of grassroots leaders were being ignored in the Congress party because they refused to be sycophants of the Bansal family.” Chitranjan Chanchal, ex-district president, Congress, along with Ashok Kumar Danny, Ashwani Kumar Pandu, Girish Kapoor, and Raj Chadha, also joined the party. Garg said that if AAP comes to power, it will work on making the MC financially strong and profitable without imposing any new taxes. It will rationalise the current taxes without compromising on the quality of services and development of the city by cutting down the wasteful expenditure, controlling the corruption and generation of revenue from unutilised resources of the corporation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-aap-criticises-bjp-over-imposition-of-new-taxes/story-mRjLNkV5LYKj6EDpiVc4vK.html

After getting a nod from the Dental Council of India (DCI) to conduct exams according to their feasibility, the institute proposed to the varsity that the postgraduate (PG) exams be held offline as the number of students is small. PU has conducted the examinations of all exit UG and PG students but, the exams at its dental college are yet to be taken. An internal meeting of the college was held last month. According to sources, the UG exams have been proposed to begin from mid-October and the PG exams from November 1. Around 400 UG students and 17 PG students will be writing the exams.A faculty member, seeking anonymity, said, “We have already sent our proposal regarding the PG and UG examinations to the varsity. We want the exams to be held soon so that students’ time is not wasted.” Dr Jagat Bhushan, principal of the college, said, “We are waiting for the final notification from the university.” In August, after receiving a request from the dental college for the conduct of exams, a special panel of the university had allowed the college to conduct the UG exams in blended mode, while for postgraduates it has permitted regular exams, subject to DCI permissions. After this, the college had written to the DCI to seek their permission. The DCI, in its advisory of June 30, 2020, had directed all colleges/universities to conduct theory examinations for UG and PG, strictly following the council’s norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-pu-dental-college-proposes-online-exams-for-bds-students/story-Au1w58YsRQOVM1hfLeh1BN.html

05-10-2020||Noida||Air quality dips in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad as Punjab, Haryana burn stubble||The air quality over the past one week (September 29 to October 5), has deteriorated in the cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida with Punjab and Haryana starting their annual exercise of burning crop stubble to prepare the fields for rabi (winter) crops. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average air quality index (AQI) for the past on week is inching towards the ‘poor’ category, even though winter is yet to set in. The CPCB data shows that the same period the previous year had much better air quality with the AQI remaining in ‘moderate’ and ‘satisfactory’ categories. The average AQI for Ghaziabad was 199.86, just a few decimals shy of the ‘poor’ category, while it was 97.29 during the same period in 2019. The city had ‘poor’ AQI on five days of the week.On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI value above 200 is considered ‘poor’, while a value above 300 is considered ’very poor ’. A value between 100 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’ and below 100, ‘good’.In Greater Noida, the average AQI during the week was 186.29, again inching towards ‘poor’. In comparison, it had an average AQI of 107.29 during the same period last year. The city had ‘poor’ AQI on two days. The average AQI in Noida stood at 172.71 during the week, while it was much better at 97.57 during the same period in 2019. However, unlike Ghaziabad and Greater Noida, the AQI did not reach the ‘poor’ category during the current week in Noida. Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the north-easterly winds currently blowing over the region are responsible for the deterioration in air quality. “The winds are coming from Haryana and Punjab and bringing with them the pollution from stubble burning in the two states. The winds will change direction -- to slower easterlies -- in the next two or three days. This will prevent faster dispersal of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. According to statistics from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory , an interdisciplinary research initiative of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, there have been 537 instances of residue burning in Punjab between October 1 and October 4.The number was only 63 during the same period in 2019. In Haryana, the stubble fires during the period are 116, while they were just 49 during the same period in 2019. Likewise, Uttar Pradesh saw 33 farm fires between October 1 and 4, as against only eight during the same period in 2019. Overall, there have been 686 instances of stubble burning during the first four days of October in the three states. This was just 120 during the same period in 2019. The IMD officials also attributed the deterioration in AQI to less rainfall. “The last spell of heavy rain in the region was on September 6, followed by very light spells on September 7 and 8. Thereafter, we have had no rain that could have settled the pollutants. In 2019, September saw several spells of rain, which helped reduce pollutants. The coming week, too, there is no prediction of rain for the region,” Srivastava said. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board in Ghaziabad and Noida said they have started pollution abatement measures. “This September, we had less rain unlike the previous year. We are also keeping a tab on instances of stubble burning in rural areas. The winter action plan has already been drawn up and directions issued to different departments to take pollution abatement measures,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, Ghaziabad. Officials are also monitoring the two major construction sites -- Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the Regional Rapid Transit System -- to keep dust under check. “The present deterioration in AQI in Ghaziabad is mainly due to the high readings from Loni, where several infrastructure works are in progress. Different agencies and construction sites are also in the process of purchasing anti-smog guns and installing cameras for better monitoring. We are hopeful that the AQI this winter will remain better than it did last year,” he said. Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida, said local contributions to the deterioration in AQI was negligible. “The PM (particulate matter) 10 level has shown an increase during the past couple of days. We have already started pollution abatement measures and the authority has initiated washing of roads at night twice a week to reduce dust pollution. The police have also identified traffic congestion points and these areas are being monitored. We are also ensuring that the directions issued by the UPPCB for construction sites are being complied with,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-dips-in-noida-greater-noida-and-ghaziabad-as-punjab-haryana-burn-stubble/story-UINCUTSgWTcEvqKXy5ctZJ.html

The authority had conceived the project in 2017 to deal with construction waste, which posed a huge challenge to the city authorities. Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and Gautam Budh Nagar MP Dr Mahesh Sharma were present at the event to mark the launch of the plant.The authority had on September 6, 2018, hired Ramky Reclamation and Recycling Limited to process of C&D waste. According to the contract, the firm set up a plant in Sector 80 with a capacity to process 300 metric tonnes of construction waste daily.Officials said the agency can sell the recycled products and earn revenue. The agency will make bricks, tiles and other material to raise funds out of selling these items.“Companies or other units that generate 20 metric tonnes of construction waste daily or 300 metric tonnes monthly would be considered as bulk waste generators. These bulk waste generators will have to pay Rs495 per tonne to the authority for the treatment of their waste. If they collect and transport their waste to the plant, then they can pay Rs148 per tonne for treatment only,” said SC Mishra senior project engineer of the Noida authority.There are 20 collection points, where the agency will first collect the waste and then transport to the plant.There are at least 400 ongoing housing projects in Noida and hundreds of other infrastructure projects that include road repair, road resurfacing, repair of drains, development of parks and other individual construction sites. Construction or demolition waste generated at these sites used to be thrown on vacant places. Now that the plant is operational, this waste will be treated as per rules.“Our aim is to make the city neat and clean. To make the city clean, it is of utmost importance that we handle the construction and demolition waste properly as per the 2016 waste management rules. This plant will make sure the city’s roads and vacant places are not filed up with he construction or demolition waste,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/22-5-crore-c-d-waste-treatment-plant-begins-operations-in-noida/story-8g1FOmpdKJsmcF6gkDCK7O.html

Dhankhar even called for “independent expert probe” after meeting Chandramani Shukla, the father of the deceased, and a team of BJP leaders who demanded a CBI probe. “According to delegation it is a targeted political killing as hatched conspiracy and calls for independent expert probe,” the governor tweeted in the evening. BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra and other leaders raised the same demand. Trinamool Congress (TMC) described Dhankhar’s statement as “irresponsible” and alleged that Shukla was involved in extortion and murders and was propped up by BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP, Arjun Singh. “The governor should know Shukla’s background before making irresponsible statements. People in the region lived in fear because of him. He started his political career with the CPI(M) before joining the TMC and finally, the BJP,” said Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member from Dum Dum, the constituency located next to Barrackpore. “I know this well because Shukla lived in my constituency,” said Roy.

This led to a high-pitch drama and traffic chaos in the heart of Kolkata. The police stopped the convoy on SN Banerjee Road, saying prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC are permanently enforced around the Raj Bhawan. After a series of heated exchange with police officials, four BJP leaders and Chandramani Shukla were allowed to go to the Raj Bhawan. The rest of the convoy and the hearse left for Titagarh.  Tearful Chandra Mani Shukla father of 39 year ony son Manish pleaded for fair investigation.

The West Bengal police said during the day that Shukla, who was an outgoing councillor of the Titagarh municipality, faced several charges of murder and attempted murder. The state police also said that his death could be related to personal enmity. “A person was shot dead last evening in Titagarh area of Barrackpore. Police is investigating the crime and looking into all possible reasons including personal enmity because the victim was accused in some cases of murder and attempt of murder,” tweeted the state police without naming Shukla.  A person was shot dead last evening in Titagarh area of Barrackpore.

The governor retweeted this, saying, “Criminal Jurisprudence Principles thoroughly sacrificed @WBPolice @MamataOfficial An all out effort to cover up and fishing for alibis. The manner of this dastardly act calls for focus on all angles including terror. West Bengal Police far distanced from fair investigation.” While Titagarh witnessed pitched battle between police and BJP workers who observed bandh in large parts of the Barrackpore, the governor targeted the state government shortly after the state’s new chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay met him and held a discussion on several issues for more than two hours. “Conveyed my concern of the present alarming scenario @MamataOfficial to the new Chief Secretary. Am sure Chief Minister would be indicated all these critical aspects that run down democratic governance and lawlessness. Political violence and targeted killings must stop,” the governor tweeted at 1.35 pmEarlier in the morning, Dhankhar expressed his anguish that the director-general of police and the home secretary did not meet him on the Titagarh incident despite his direction. “Alarming nosediving law and order scenario @MamataOfficial. Targeted political killings in spite of alert by Constitutional Head. Neither ACS Home nor DGP @WBPolice responded. To CM at 10.47 PM. Would like to speak to you urgently !

The incident took place on the Delhi-Meerut Road, the police said, adding that the three suspects, two of them engineers, were arrested on charges of molestation, stalking and beating up the security guard. The woman said in her complaint that on the evening of October 3 she, along with her sister and the guard, were driving on the Delhi-Meerut Road in Ghaziabad when three suspects in their Skoda Rapid car began to follow them. The woman was going to her house in Noida. “Initially, they were driving rash and tried to overtake my car. Then they started to hurl abuses and even made vulgar signs towards us. As they continued their chase, we stopped near a showroom at the Delhi-Meerut Road when we saw a traffic policeman and decided to seek help,” the woman said in her FIR lodged at Sihani Gate police station. “In between the suspects also started clicking pictures of us and preparing videos. My security guard told them not to do so but they continued their acts,” she added. After the complainant sent the security guard to complain to the policeman and when he returned back to the car, the suspects arrived and pulled the guard out of the car and started beating him up, she said. “Upon this, many people gathered and some policemen also came who nabbed the suspects. They also threatened us that they have high contacts and it will be of no use if we lodge a police complaint. However, the police took them to the police station,” the woman added further. Based on the complaint, the police registered an FIR under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354d (stalking), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace). The police identified the suspects as Romil Kumar, who is from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan, and working as an engineer with a company in Noida, and his friend Rajat Rana of Indirapuram who is also a BTech and working with a company in Noida. The third suspect was identified as Shubham Pandey, a resident of Indirapuram who is also working after completing his course in mass communication. “We arrested the three suspects based on a complaint given by the woman. The three men were chasing her car on Delhi-Meerut Road and also misbehaved. The three suspects were unknown to the complainant. The further investigation is on,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-arrested-for-stalking-women-in-a-car-on-delhi-meerut-road/story-OqEtCS7uHXuiVV0sCe7evK.html

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Numbers of Covid cases, tests drop in Chandigarh||There has been a significant drop in Covid-19 testing and cases in the two-week interval between September 21 to 28 and in the subsequent week up to October 4, official data shows. Tests have dropped below the 1,000 mark since September 28, recording a low of 766 on Sunday, of which only 85 cases were positive. Cases in double digits were last logged on August 19. Data of the last 15 days shows testing almost halving from 11,271 (conducted between September 21 to September 28) to 5,110 tests last week. This collates with a drop in the number of cases from 1,380 to 767 in the same period. Positivity rate (ratio of persons found positive among those tested), however, increased by three percentage points in these two weeks. Health authorities said fewer people were coming for tests to private and government labs as compared to last month.Many went ahead so far as to say that infection spread appeared to been contained because fewer contacts of infected persons were being tested. “Health education is important and authorities should stress on giving this message that people should come forward for tests even for mild symptoms which in turn can stop infection spread and fatalities,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head, department of community medicine and school of public health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). On ease of getting tested, Dr Kumar suggested that mobile testing teams be set up to start community testing in case people were reluctant to go to centres. A trend had been noticed lately of youngsters with mild symptoms unwilling to come in for testing, said a community health expert at PGIMER. “This can be dangerous, otherwise the situation which is seen to be stabilising can spiral out of control again. Infection can spread because the majority of the population is still susceptible to the virus,” said another PGIMER expert wishing to remain anonymous. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has directed the health department to focus on economically weaker sections to prevent infection spread in the densely populated colonies. He also directed the doctors’ committees to review the situation daily and recommend remedial measures accordingly. The Administrator directed all concerned to focus on testing, tracking and treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/numbers-of-covid-cases-tests-drop-in-chandigarh/story-mcFs6k1rVPQjNJi4j3dnWI.html

05-10-2020||Noida||Uttar Pradesh redefines Covid rules, containment radius around active cases reduced||As various social and commercial activities re-open, the Uttar Pradesh government has redefined parameters of containment zones for coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, shortening the radius around positive cases. According to the district administration, with the smaller area under the redefined containment zone, the concept of neighbourhood watch will be all the more important.In his directions for urban areas, Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari said that micro containment zones will be those wherein one house has one or more than one Covid-19 case. In addition to the house where the infected person lives, adjacent houses on either side will be included under the micro containment zone. He said all people living under such micro containment zones will be tested for Sars-Cov-2, the strain of coronavirus which has caused the Covid-19 pandemic.Earlier, as per directions issued on July 24, a radius of 100 metre of a mohalla, whichever was less, was declared a containment zone if one case was found. If more than one case was found, the radius was 200 metre. An additional buffer zone also had to be created on the basis of local assessment by officials. “Since the government has now defined micro containment zones, lesser manpower resources will be required for their management. In such a case, the earlier concept of neighbourhood watch, which we had introduced during the start of home isolation, will play an important role. The neighbours will be asked to keep track of Covid-19 patients and inform the district administration accordingly,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. “However, regular monitoring and surveillance by the respective incident commanders (executive magistrates) will continue for better monitoring,” he added.The new directions have also specified cluster containment zones. The order said that in case multiple houses get positive cases, the containment area will be extended up to one house adjacent to the last affected house. This will be considered as a cluster containment zone, where strict perimeter controls will be undertaken based upon assessment by local administration. All people in these houses will be tested as per protocol. The Indian Council for Medical Research in its advisory on September 4 has advised for 100% testing in containment zones. The directions have, however, remained almost similar but with minor changes to the existing directions for sealing in high-rises and multi-storeyed buildings as part of containment zones. For the group housing as well as the multi-storeyed buildings, the state government’s directions say that if one floor has active Covid-19 cases, the entire floor will be sealed. in case floors have cases then only those floors which have Covid-19 cases will be sealed. According to previous norms, if several floors in a tower have active cases, the entire tower was to be sealed.The new directions also said that if Covid-19 cases are detected in more than one tower of a high-rise society, the respective towers along with common areas such as parks, gyms, swimming pools and community centre etc., should be sealed.The directions also clarified that in case a house has multiple cases, it will be considered to be having one instance, and it will be considered as one containment zone. “The parameters of containment zones have been redefined but no fixed radius has been directed for in the new directions given by the government. However, this will help other residents whose movements were earlier restricted as part of the containment zones. The revised guidelines will also be helpful to us in taking up 100% testing in containment zones. Earlier, the zones were bigger and required a huge workforce for testing and surveillance,” said an officer from the district health department, who wished not to be named.According to official records of the district administration, there were 231 containment zones till October 4 in Ghaziabad. On the other hand, Gautam Budh Nagar had 295 containment zones till October 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/uttar-pradesh-redefines-covid-rules-containment-radius-around-active-cases-reduced/story-8Q72HsR6uq97d2aFZw45RI.html
05-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad’s positivity rate declines after seven weeks||Even as fresh coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases continue to be reported in Ghaziabad, the test positivity rate (TPR) has seen a decline after a long gap of seven weeks in the district. According to district health department officials, a minor decline was seen in the previous week in the average number of cases being reported daily, when figures of the last eight weeks were analysed. According to official records of the Ghaziabad health department, the week from September 28 to October 4 saw a TPR of 3.69%, with 37,126 tests resulting in 1,370 positives in the district. Before this, in the last eight weeks, the TPR was lowest in the week between August 3 and August 9 at 2.64%, the figures show. During this time, the weekly TPR fluctuated between 3.72% and 6.49%, district records show.“The decline in positivity rate is due to effective surveillance as well as better monitoring of surveillance teams, which go out for testing in containment zones. Apart from containment zones, we have been monitoring non-containment zones as well. The declining positivity rate is the result of all measures we have taken for effective management of Covid-19,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.The figures also indicate that the number of new cases has dropped even with higher testing. For instance, during the week from September 7 to September 13, the district conducted 24,949 tests, which resulted in 1,619 cases, with a positivity rate of 6.49%. “Nowadays, our average daily testing is between 5,500 and 6,000 tests. Despite this, however, the number of cases has reduced over the past three weeks. We are closely monitoring the daily cases with effective surveillance and higher daily testing. At present, we can say that the positivity rate is on a decline. However, we will observe trends for another two-three weeks before we can say for sure that the TPR is down,” said an officer from the district health department, who wished not to be named. According to official figures, since March, the district till October 4 had conducted a total of 3,35,610 tests, which resulted in 15,087 positive cases, with an overall positivity rate of 4.49%.“The trend indicates that we are now moving in a state of plateau. It is likely that this will continue for another one or two months and hopefully, we will be able to see a decline thereafter. The present peak of the pandemic has taken a lot of time to reach and might have been worse had it not been for the lockdown and other measures. However, there should be no complacency and all health protocols must be strictly observed,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad. According to the state control room records of October 5, the district had a total of 15,141 cases with the last 1,000 cases being reported in just six days. The district had touched the 10,000-cases mark on September 10. After this, however, the district saw about 1,000 fresh coronavirus cases being added every four-five days.Amit Mohan Prasad, Uttar Pradesh’s additional chief secretary (health), said on Monday that the overall positivity rate in the state has also seen a decline and that the number of active cases has also reduced.“The week between September 7 and 13 saw a TPR of 4.8% in the state, which has now reduced to 2.6% in the week between September 28 and October 4. The number of active cases is also on a decline. We had 68,235 active cases on September 17, which have now reduced to 45,025 (on October 5, as per state control room records). The overall recovery rate has now reached 87.75%,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-s-positivity-rate-declines-after-seven-weeks/story-8Z6wDJRrXZKbgFPKk77EEL.html

The boy’s body was recovered from steel trunk at his maternal uncle’s home on September 29.The arrested women were identified as sisters Pinki (24) and Rinki (22) and they are the wives of his maternal uncles. According to the police, they killed the child as his mother was “interfering too much into their marriages”.According to the police, the boy, Bhavyansh, whose parents live in Sirsa village, had gone missing on the afternoon of September 29 while visiting his maternal uncles along with his mother. His maternal grandfather had filed a missing person complaint with the Surajpur police the same day after the family failed to find him even after a frantic search. A kidnapping case was initially registered which was later changed to one of murder after the boy’s body was discovered in a steel trunk around 9.30pm on September 29.The autopsy had revealed that the boy was suffocated to death. Police suspected the involvement of a family member in the child’s murder and pursued their investigation along those lines. On Monday, they arrested Bhavyansh’s aunts for his murder. “According to the two women, they were fed up with the boy’s mother (their sister-in-law) allegedly taunting them over various issues and for her alleged unnecessary interference into their marriages. The women resented their sister-in-law and decided to take out their frustration and anger on her child. So killed him,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander said.Police said Pinki lured the boy to them as he was familiar with her. “The two women then used a pillow to smother him. After Bhavyansh passed out, they stuffed him in the steel trunk, which they covered with a blanket. He was found over six hours later and by the time his parents rushed him to a hospital, doctors declared him brought dead. During their interrogation, the women admitted to the murder,” the DCP said.The women were produced in front of a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/child-s-body-in-steel-trunk-two-sisters-held-for-the-murder-of-nephew/story-TkQLZFBw4X7xmaUHhr60NP.html

In Noida, 5,192 responses were received of which 41% people said they will use e-commerce while 29% said they will prefer home deliveries from local stores and only 16% were willing to visit malls and markets for shopping.“Between the Covid crisis and competition from e-commerce sites, the markets are already working at only 30-40% profit margins. Once shopping malls become fully operational, that figure will go further down. In order to stay afloat, we have been appealing to all local vendors to take their businesses online. That is the only way we will have a fighting chance to survive,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association.He said during the pandemic, the dependency on e-commerce sites has gone up ever more and nearly 17.5 crore businesses, according to industry experts, across the country have shut because of the current market situation.“But we are still hopeful that we will make some profit during the festive season if only issues of parking and public transport are addressed,” said Jain.The survey further said nearly 45% of shoppers feel that shopping online is not only more convenient but also safer and 75% people are willing to make their purchases from small vendors if they are available online. Home renovation items such as furniture or sanitaryware, grocery and food supplies are some of the things on which Noida residents were most willing to spend, as compared to electronics, fashion wear or appliances, said the survey.“If the pandemic has shown anything, it is the importance of essentials. Unlike previous years, I will not spend money on frivolous items. And I will buy those things that are available for purchase from the comfort of my home,” said Ritika Singh, a resident of Sector 75.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/local-shop-owners-not-hopeful-of-much-business-this-festive-season-say-e-commerce-eating-away-at-their-clientele/story-uQvPrc4k9s48tboehINHxO.html
05-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: RJD, Cong finalise constituency-wise seat allocations, name candidates||After protracted and patience-testing negotiations, the Grand Alliance (GA) on Monday evening made the constituency-wise allocation of seats among its constituents - Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress and the Left parties - ahead of the first phase of elections on October 28. A formal declaration of seats by the RJD and the Congress is likely on Tuesday. However, most of the selected candidates of both the parties have been asked to kick off electioneering in their respective constituencies forthwith. The RJD is said to have offered symbols to the shortlisted candidates confidentially to avoid protest by the candidates and their supporters due to denial of tickets. The Congress too finalised the list of 41 candidates out of 70 after hours of deliberations in New Delhi on Monday evening. Candidates for the remaining seats will be selected on Tuesday. Senior leaders of both the parties said that the list of constituency-wise candidates going to the poll in the first phase would be announced on Tuesday. As many as 71 out of 243 constituencies would go to polls in the first phase on October 28, the nomination for which would end on October 8. Also read: Is YSR Congress joining NDA? CM Jagan flies to Delhi to meet PM amid buzzThe RJD is slated to contest 39 seats, while the Congress has identified 23 seats to field its candidates during the elections in the first phase. The Left parties, including the Community Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation (CPI(ML)), the Community Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) have announced their candidates for all 29 seats they have been allocated. As per the seat-sharing deal formalised on October 3, the RJD has been offered 144 seats, in which Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) would be accommodated, the Congress has been offered 70 seats, 19 for the CPI (ML), six for the CPI and four for the CPM. The allocation of seats turned out to be upsetting for many leaders, as a few sitting legislators had to give in in the wake of seat-adjustments among the allies. The residence of former CM and RJD leader Rabri Devi witnessed vociferous protests by supporters of party leaders who were denied tickets. A controversial Congress leader Lalan Yadav and former BPCC secretary Neetu Devi have been named to contest from Sultanganj (Bhagalpur) and Hisua (Nawada) constituencies as Congress nominees. Former minister Shyam Rajak, who recently joined the RJD, and sitting MLA of Karakat Sanjay Yadav are learnt to have been denied the tickets by the party. Children of senior RJD leaders like Sudhakar Singh (son of state RJD chief Jagadanand Singh), Rahul Tiwari (son of Shivanand Tiwari), Rishi Singh (son of former Union minister Kanti Singh) and Divya Kirti (daughter of former Union minister Jai Prakash Narain Yadav) have been given the party tickets. The first phase of polling is scheduled to be held in parts or whole of Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Sheikhpura, Patna, Bhojpur, Buxar, Kaimur, Rohtas, Arwal, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Jamui districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-rjd-congress-finalise-constituency-wise-seat-allocations-name-candidates/story-Gv4IoKndiYKy14S1Bh6CsK.html

05-10-2020||City||Warnings on cleaning agents should be prominent enough||In July this year, a 34-year-old woman in Surrey, United Kingdom, died from the toxic fumes that she inhaled while cleaning her bathroom. Unaware of the danger of mixing two cleaning products, Celia Seymour had used a bleach and a toilet cleaner together, with disastrous consequences. In November last year, 32-year-old Ryan Baldera suffered a similar fate in Burlington, Massachusetts, USA. He tried to remove a floor-cleaning agent spilt on the floor with another cleaner, without realising that in the process, he was mixing sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient in one cleaner, with some acids present in the other, leading to the release of chlorine gas. Inhalation of the poisonous gas proved fatal.Last week, a friend from Bengaluru forwarded a WhatsApp message from someone who had a narrow escape. To clean her bathroom surface, the consumer first used a toilet cleaner and on finding the quantity to be insufficient, had poured out a bathroom cleaner –two different products of the same brand, meant for the washroom. As she scrubbed, she inhaled strong chlorine fumes emanating from the mixture, without realising its toxicity. Fortunately, she recovered from a serious bout of coughing and acute breathlessness that she suffered for hours. Unfortunately, as with many such forwards, the name of the person who wrote it was missing, so also the date of the first send. Yet, the message is highly relevant. In fact a Google search shows several people from different parts of the country sharing such experiences. One of them, who used a bleach and a toilet cleaner, thinking that it would be effective in cleaning the tough stains on the bathroom tiles, suffered such deleterious effects from the poisonous gas released that he had to be put on a ventilator for several hours.When a cleaning product containing sodium hypochlorite (or chlorine bleach), for example, gets mixed with a solution containing one of two acids as an active ingredient, it releases toxic chlorine gas. Depending on the concentration of the gas and the length of exposure, inhalation of the gas could be life-threatening. The symptoms range from eye, nose and throat irritation, incessant coughing, breathlessness, chest pain, wheezing to acute lung damage or acute respiratory distress syndrome.Similarly, when sodium hypochlorite is mixed with ammonia, chloramines are produced . Exposure to these vapours also produce similar symptoms. When you mix rubbing alcohol or a hand sanitiser that contains ethanol or isopropyl alcohol with sodium hypochlorite, the resultant gas is chloroform, a powerful anaesthetic.So whether you are unclogging your drains or cleaning your kitchen surfaces, sanitising your bathrooms or disinfecting your living room floors, remember these are all chemicals and they should never be mixed -even if they are products of the same company. If you see the containers of cleaning solutions, besides a general caution against mixing with other cleaners or household chemicals, they all specifically tell you not to mix with bleach or acids, depending on their active ingredient. Some of them also tell you that such mixing could release chlorine.But that is not adequate. The warning should be far more prominent and on the front of the pack, so that it catches the attention of the consumer. And it should be in English as well as the local language. Manufacturers also need to take up consumer awareness campaigns on the risk of mixing cleaning or disinfecting agents. In fact the apex consumer court has held in several cases that failure to issue adequate warning about the usage of a product constitutes negligence. But more important, the new consumer protection law, the Consumer Protection Act , 2019, has a separate chapter on product liability and under that, the manufacturer will be held liable for any harm caused to the consumer , if “the product fails to contain adequate instructions of correct usage to prevent any harm or any warning regarding improper or incorrect usage”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/warnings-on-cleaning-agents-should-be-prominent-enough/story-zuxHKRMtSi02FJfHIFFojO.html

As per officials, the compactor had developed a snag and now the parts required to make the machinery operational are not available in the market.One of the residents of Dugri area, Dilpreet Singh said, “The static compactor site is situated near the traffic lights near the Dugri canal bridge. The stink from heaps of garbage is polluting the area and residents are irked due to the dumping of garbage in the open. They have been demanding the installation of compactors at different points however, the MC is not being able to maintain the existing infrastructure.”Meanwhile, the authorities said that they are working to arrange the required parts and the efforts are also being made to upgrade the compactor site for the collection of segregated waste.Member of A2Z company, Vishant Chaudhary said, “The compactor had developed a snag and it has been repaired. But a display that is required to make the compactor operational is not available in the market. We are looking for the display and the compactor site would be made operational in a few days.”MC Secretary Neeraj Jain said, “As the civic body is working towards waste segregation, it is also working to upgrade the compactor site so that dry and wet waste could be dumped separately.”Since 2016, when the first static compactor site was established in the Dugri area, the MC and the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) have been working on the projects to install static compactors to avoid open dumping of garbage in the city. While the MC’s project to install compactors at 22 sites under the Smart City Mission is still on papers, the LIT has established six static compactors sites out of a total eight, but those have also not been made operational due to the absence of required vehicles to lift the waste from the compactor sites. The LIT had commenced the construction at the sites in May last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/garbage-piles-up-in-dugri-as-static-waste-compactor-develops-snag/story-4vsVWiVhkZ255WXC7YBu5J.html

Mumbai police commissioner has asked the cyber cell to investigate and register cases under the Information Technology Act. Mumbai police’s cyber unit has made a report where it has been found that posts were uploaded on social media platforms from different countries like Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Romania and France. “We identified the posts in foreign languages because of the hashtags used like #justiceforsushant #sushantsinghrajput and #SSR. We’re in the process of verifying more accounts,” said a senior IPS officer. Also read: SSR death probe - What home ministry and AIIMS are saying“The campaign was run against Mumbai police just to demoralise us at a time when 84 policemen had died due to the pandemic and over 6,000 men were infected with the virus.

Pandey shared the information with media while revealing details of the draft of the state’s new sports policy in Dehradun. “There has always been issues with funds needed to provide adequate facilities to the sportspersons of the state. Hence we have decided to put 0.5 percent cess on the excise duty to collect revenue which will be used to develop sports facilities and infrastructure,” said Pandey, adding that the move has been approved in principle by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. Pandey said that the new sports policy would be the “best in the country” and will have various provisions to develop sports facilities and promote sports activities in the state. Also read: ‘CM Yogi playing ‘riots game’ to divert public attention’ - Samajwadi Party leader“To promote the sportspersons in the state, we would also offer 5 percent quota in admissions in state’s universities, colleges and even for vocational courses. There would also be sports quota in government jobs for medal-winning sportspersons - 10 percent in non-enforcement departments and 15 percent in enforcement departments,” he said. “Apart from this, outstanding sportspersons will also be given a pay hike and promotion.”The minister also informed that under the new sports policy, the government would open a sports science centre in the state to develop sports with related science. “We would also provide scholarship to young sportspersons ageing 8 to 14 years. The amount is yet to be decided. A single window system would also be introduced where a sportsperson or anybody related to sports activities would state their problems instead of going from pillar to post,” said Pandey. He also said that the policy will have special provisions for girls and women under which “they would be given sports training which will also help them in self-defence.”Under the new sports policy, the government will also provide travelling facilities, including free travel in Uttarakhand transport corporation buses, to sportspersons participating in national level competitions. “The government will also promote private entities interested in developing sports facilities by offering assistance of 20 percent of the total cost of the project. The whole idea of the new sports policy is to attract people towards the fields from the virtual world of phones and computers,” he said. Pandey, however, added that all the aforementioned provisions have been given in-principle approval by the CM. “The sports policy will be discussed in the next state cabinet meeting on October 14 before being approved.”Pandey, who is also the school education minister of Uttarakhand, stated that the government will soon start the work of opening Atal Utkrishta Schools in the state under which children from rural areas will be able to study in English medium on the lines of CBSE-affiliated schools. “The work for opening 190 such schools will soon be started in the state,” he said.The Opposition Congress, meanwhile, reacted to the new sports policy and said they welcome it if it’s for the benefit of the state’s sportspersons, the party, however, raised a doubt on its implementation. “It is good if they are coming up with a new sports policy to promote sports in the state. But the major question is of its proper implementation,” said Pritam Singh, Congress state president. The Congress slammed the state government for coming up with the policy when the next assembly election is due in 2022. Singh said, “It is ridiculous that the policy has come up after three and a half years of their rule. Wonder if they were sleeping all this while. This will take a long time before being implemented.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-s-new-sports-policy-proposes-cess-on-liquor-to-develop-facilities/story-GTmWMwXxgFDkyr0Ztw5HVL.html

The SP leader was reacting to CM Yogi’s statement on Sunday that “those who don’t like the state’s development are trying to trigger caste and communal riots.”In a statement, Chaudhary added, “All that people want is to make their voice reach him (chief minister). Instead of listening to their voice, he is suppressing them. And now, to divert public attention, the chief minister has started playing ‘riots’ game. People should give a befitting reply to him by staying cautious and calm.”He further added, “People only want restoration of law and order and safety of women.

Had some cases against him not been withdrawn during his chief ministership, he would have been in the grip of law. Instead of establishing the rule of law, the chief minister is destroying it.

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Daughters of small holder farmers, 19 others in Rewari’s Super-100 course clear JEE-A||Two daughters of small holder farmers from villages in Rohtak and Fatehabad were among 21 out of 48 students enrolled in the Haryana government’s Super-100 Programme at Rewari, many from rural areas and government schools, who cracked the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) advanced for admission to engineering colleges across the country.The results were declared on Monday.Simran of Hasangarh village in Rohtak and Kajal of Indachoi village in Fatehabad, both daughters of farmers with small land holdings, secured 1,392 and 293 all-India ranks, respectively. Kajal topped the Super-100 programme.For Simran’s father this moment was extra special as he had remained paralysed for years after an accident, but had not hesitated to encourage his child to excel in studies.No impact of Covid-19 on students’ performanceNaveen Mishra, head teacher of the programme at Rewari, who is assisted by five other Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) graduates to run the classes, said 37 students wrote the exam and 21 cleared it.“Out of 48 students, 46 cleared the first level JEE mains exam and 37 wrote the prestigious advanced exam, with 21 passing. The Covid-19 outbreak did not affect our students’ performance and they brought laurels to the entire state of Haryana,” he said.Their performances proved that children from rural areas too could touch the sky, Mishra added.The teacher urged the Haryana government to enrol more students under this programme, adding, “We assure them that we will deliver good results. Our students proved that JEE advance exam is not rocket science and by making sincere efforts everything can be achieved.” Meritorious and deserving students in the state are given free coaching in the programme.Did not know about IITs, says topper’s fatherShubhcharan Malik, Kajal’s father, thanked the staff handling the programme and the Haryana government for arranging free education to students from poor families, admitting that he had not heard about IITs earlier.“ I had not heard about IITs and never once dreamt of sending my daughter to such institutions where children of rich families study. I studied up to Class 12 and Kajal’s mother Saroj Devi studied up to Class 8. I urge the state government to open such centres at each block level so that students from poor families can achieve success,” he added.Simran said she was glad to see her performance in the exam bring smiles to her parents’ faces.“My father owns less than two acres and had been involved in an accident a few years ago. He remained paralysed for some time but still ensured that my siblings and I had access to quality education. I owe my success to Naveen sir, my parents and other teachers. I had studied at a government school in our village till Class 10 and secured over 90% but I had not heard about the JEE exam till I enrolled at the Rewari centre. I want to pursue engineering in computer science and fulfil my father’s dream,” she added.Attributing the reasons for her success to her father’s motivation “in these tough times,” she said the hardships he went through made her more determined to achieve her targets. Kajal said she would consult her teachers about her choice of IITs for counselling.Adding that she wanted to do her bit for society, Kajal said, “After graduating from IIT, I will give free coaching to underprivileged children. Our teachers guided us very well and they set small targets for us throughout our journey. Our teachers deserve more appreciation than us in achieving this target ,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/daughters-of-small-holder-farmers-21-others-in-rewari-s-super-100-course-clear-jee-a/story-mIDsOlAzE3ZZjsJvRKQKjM.html

The jawan is in hospital and the doctors have advised him two weeks’ rest, the BSF said. Police said jawan Shubam (28) came in contact with an electric wire that was installed by the accused farmers on the fringe of their farmland to save the crop from stray animals, on Sunday. The accused have been identified as Ajit Singh, Gopal Singh (both brothers) and Mehal Singh, all of Khayala Kalan village. The case has been registered under sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Bhindi Saida police station that falls under the Ajnala sub-division. Assistant commandant of the BSF’s 22-batallion Ravi Kumar Godhra told the police that the accused own farmland across the fence. “The accused had installed a live electric wire using an illegal power connection from a nearby transformer to keep away the stray animals. On Sunday, our jawan was patrolling in the area when he got entangled with the wire. The other personnel deployed at the border somehow managed to save the jawan using sticks and butts of the guns. The jawan is in hospital and the doctors have advised him two weeks’ rest.” Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Karnail Singh said raids were on to nab the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-farmers-booked-as-bsf-jawan-gets-injured-from-illegal-electric-fence/story-E94ZOmgtRfCXFtRWAvdilN.html
05-10-2020||Bhopal||Ramdev’s Patanjali institute to conduct clinical trial on Covid-19 patients’ immunity||Swami Ramdev’s Haridwar-based Patanjali Research Foundation Trust has been given a nod by Madhya Pradesh government to conduct a clinical trial through its institute on Covid-19 patients but with certain categorical riders. Trial will only be conducted at a Covid Care Centre and its medicines effect will be studied on the immunity of patients, government officials said. The permission granted to the Trust in June this year came to light on Monday through an order dated October 3, 2020, issued by the directorate of health to chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Indore, Dr Praveen Jadia to allot a Covid Care Centre in Indore for the trial, as per the order. A Covid Care Centre has very mild, mild and pre-symptomatic cases while moderate cases, that require oxygen therapy, are admitted to dedicated Covid health centres. Severe cases are treated at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, as per officials. Also read: Covid-19 disrupting mental health services in most countries - WHO surveyThe order dated October 3, 2020 states, “In response to Patanjali Research Foundation Trust’s application, permission was granted with several conditions under the guidelines of the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India and Department of AYUSH, MP government through a permission letter dated June 18, 2020. In reference to the permission, the applicant organisation is permitted to conduct the research by giving immunity booster medicines to Covid-19 patients at a Covid care centre.” As per an affidavit submitted by the Trust to the government, the organisation will have to ensure that the positive results of the trial will be used for common people and not for earning money. “Without prior permission, it will not be used in any way for any commercial gain,” the affidavit states. A health directorate official, who wished not be named, said, “The trust or its research institute can’t make any claim that it has treated any Covid-19 patient with its medicines. The best it can do, subject to results of the trial, is say that its medicines helped patients enhance their immunity level in fighting against the Covid. Also, since the trial will be limited to very mild, mild or pre-symptomatic cases, there can’t be a claim that the medicines work on moderate or serious Covid patients.” Also read: Europe tightens curbs as leaders gird for long Covid-19 fightHowever, vice-president of Patanjali Research Institute, Haridwar, which comes under Patanjali Research Foundation Trust, Dr Anurag Varshney said, “We are satisfied with the riders as underlined by the Madhya Pradesh government in its order in conducting the clinical trial. Once the trial is over, we will share the results with the media.” MP government’s Department of AYUSH’s deputy director Dr PC Sharma said, “The trial is limited to the study of Ayurvedic medicines’ impact on human immunity. We are also conducting a trial but despite the good results of the Ayurvedic medicines in boosting the patients’ immunity, we are avoiding making any claim in this regard given the fact the world of science across the world is still not completely sure about the nature of the virus.” Dr Sharma said, “Patanjali Research Institute will be the first institute from the private sector to conduct the trial in Madhya Pradesh on Covid patients, though mild or pre-symptomatic patients.” Chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Indore, Dr Praveen Jadia said, “I have just received the letter from the directorate regarding the allotment of a Covid Care Centre to Patanjali Research Institute. I will decide on the same after going through it.” “Earlier in May, reports of permission to Patanjali Research Institute by the district collector, Indore, to conduct a clinical trial on Covid-19 patients at a Covid-19 hospital triggered off a controversy and protest from the Opposition Congress and public health experts as a collector is not empowered to grant such a permission. Later, the order was withdrawn and the state government decided to go slow on the issue”, said an official of the directorate of health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/ramdev-s-patanjali-institute-to-conduct-clinical-trial-on-covid-19-patients-immunity/story-Kdqcnio9iPth8dlm5RNoGN.html
05-10-2020||Delhi||It’s a battle for survival for Delhi’s budget schools||New Delhi: Sanjay Aggarwal’s office desk is piled with notebooks, school diaries, uncollected report cards, and registers, one of which has a record of students who have paid September’s fee. “Our school has 573 students and only four non- EWS students paid last month,” says Aggarwal, manager of New SD Public, a middle school in Hastsal in Uttam Nagar, going through his fee register. EWS is short for economically weaker section. “We are a budget school and our fee ranges from Rs 700 to Rs 1,300, depending on the class, but almost all parents of our students say they cannot afford to pay. Our school is fighting for survival,” Aggarwal says. Aggarwal’s school is not the only one. Hastsal, a census town in west Delhi, which has over 100 low-cost schools in a 6 sq km geographical area, represents a microcosm of the larger education crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the threat it poses to the survival of over 3,000 budget schools across the capital, which are mostly located in working class neighbourhoods and rural areas such as Karawal Nagar, Sangam Vihar and Narela. With the pandemic and the lockdown hitting low- income groups hardest, their fee collection, the schools say, has gone down by as much as 90%. And as many as 30% of their children are “missing,” thousands of teachers have either lost their jobs, or have gone without pay since April. Many budget schools in Delhi (their average fee is Rs 800 for nursery and Rs 2,800 a month for class 12) which started coming up across the country after liberalisation in the 1990s have already shut down. A recent report State of the Sector — Private Schools in India, by Central Square Foundation (CSF), a think tank, says in just 20 years, the share of India’s children going to government schools has dropped from 71% to 52%. Nearly half of school students in India attend private schools, with 70% of them paying monthly fees of less than Rs 1,000, while 45% pay less than Rs 500/month. “ In the immediate aftermath of Covid -19, some of these children may shift to government schools. The lowest-fee schools may close and a large number of students may see their learning affected,” says the report. ‘No option’ At Vedpal Memorial Public School, another school in Hastsal, DP Sharma, the principal, sits in his room, painted pink, a collage of pictures of the school’s annual programmes adorning the wall behind him. These days, Sharma and his four teachers (14 others had to be furloughed) spend a lot of time calling up students for fees and for participating in online classes. The middle school charges Rs 800 for Class 8 and Rs 400 for nursery, and only 25 out of 400 children, Sharma says, paid the fee for September. “We have no contact with about half of our students, most of whom seem to have returned to their native places. Their parents are poor, working as vendors and daily wagers, and unable to pay even our meagre fee. I cannot blame them,” says Sharma, who used to be a math teacher at one of the private senior secondary schools in the area before he ventured out on his own about 15 years back. In the teachers’ room, Seema Majumdar, a science teacher, is checking answer sheets sent on WhatsApp. “Only about 50 children are able to take online classes; I hope the pandemic is soon over and these children are able to return to school; neither we nor our students have the means for any meaningful online education.” Many of these schools, which market themselves as model, modern, convent , public , perhaps appealing to the lower middle class parents’ desire for private English medium schooling for their children, came up in the past two decades, and are now shutting down. Among them is Hastsal’s AR Kiddz Way, a nursery school. “ I was dependent on the school for livelihood, and with no parents ready to pay fee I was left with no option,” says Mukesh Gupta, who started the school in 2014 and shut it in July this year. He has now rented out a portion of the school building in Hastsal to a garments shop, whose signboard has replaced that of the school at the front. Not just junior schools, the area’s secondary and senior secondary schools too are in crisis. Ravinder Yadav, chairman of RP Memorial Senior Secondary Public School, which had 1,800 students before the pandemic, says that his school is seeing a massive exodus with over 200 students from various classes having already taken their school leaving certificates. The school, he adds, has no information about another 250 students. “Many parents of children leaving the school say they do not want their children to study anywhere this year and will resume studies next year,” says Yadav. Bearing the brunt Outside, at the school’s fee counter , there is a long queue of parents accompanied by their children to apply for school leaving certificates. One of them is Sharda Devi, whose son has passed 10th class exams this year. “ My husband has lost his job and we are going back to our native place in Bihar,” she says. Another parent, Rajiv Kumar, wishes to shift his children to a government school. Things are no different in east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar , which has over 70 budget schools. Rakesh Bansal, chairman, Jeewan Jyoti Senior Secondary School, Karawal Nagar, says that only 25 percent of school’s 1000 students paid fee for September and only as many are able to attend online classes. “ Most people in this area belong to lower-income groups, which have born the maximum burnt of the pandemic. In fact , most of our children cannot take online classes as they do not have devices or space at home to do so. The school’s finances are under great stress.” Budget school associations say regulations that require all schools to meet certain standards in terms of infrastructure, facilities, student-teacher ratio, teachers’ training and the Seventh Pay Commission, have made their survival more difficult during the pandemic. “ The government should categorise schools either on the basis of the fee or the area where they located. A budget school in Karawal Nagar can not be compared to an expensive school in south Delhi, whose fee is 10 times more than us, ” says Ashwani Sharma, who runs City Modern Public School, a middle school in Sadatpur in northeast Delhi. His school, he says, has no trace of 40% of the 600 students it had in March. Many schools argue that if industries can be categories as micro, medium, small and are getting government support based on this categorization, the same can be done for schools. “ Unlike workers in industries, who will not work without pay, our teachers have no choice. How long can we go on like this? ” asks Hari Parkash Sharma, manager, New Happy Public School Narela and general secretary, Unaided Recognised Schools Welfare Association (URSWA),a body of budget schools in Delhi’s rural areas. Chandrakant Singh, general secretary, Private Land Public Schools Trust, says the government, which spends roughly about Rs 6,000 a month on a child in its school, should provide education vouchers to children studying in budget schools, whose number is about 2,400 in Delhi. “It can directly transfer the money in the account of the parents at least till the time this crisis lasts, so that we can pay our teachers, ” says Singh. “I have been able to provide only ration support to my teachers,” says Singh, also a manager at Ideal Radiant Public School in Hastsal. The education voucher system, says a senior official at deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office, has been proposed by advocacy groups before. “But it won’t be a viable option in the present circumstances as the economy has been badly affected and the revenue collections are low. Though it varies from area to area, we have added enough classrooms over the years to accommodate all students coming to government schools,” added the official. Parth Shah, president, Centre for Civil Society ( CCS), a Delhi-based think tank, which works in the area of education and livelihood, says budget schools have played a big role in raising literacy rates over the years. “The prevailing mindset within the government is that it is responsible for only government schools. But the fact is half of the children go to private schools and the government has an obligation towards them too, especially those studying in low-cost schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/it-s-a-battle-for-survival-for-delhi-s-budget-schools/story-4BXJ1hjntiagxKEROBPNsJ.html

Members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU Ekta-Ugrahan), including women, staged protests outside nearly 10 fuel stations of the Reliance Petroleum and four of Essar Group at Kheri, Malerkotla, Lehra, Bhawanigarh, Sunam, Benra, Toor Banjara and Katron villages of Sangrur and Bhotna, Dhaula, Mana Pindi and Sanghera villages of Barnala. The protesters also staged a sit-in outside the MBR Silo at Chhajli of Sangrur and a D-Mart store in Barnala. “We have been holding protests against the corporate houses whose owners are friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The big companies want to snatch our land. When these people will face losses, they will complain with Modi who will know about our protests,” said Roop Singh, a state committee member the BKU (Ugrahan). Saroop Chand, also a leader of the outfit, said, “The government wants to give away our land to the corporate sector. The protests will continue till the anti-farmer laws are repealed.”Senior officials of Reliance Petroleum said they were facing losses but refused to comment on the protests.Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir said the demonstrations are being held in a peaceful manner.Railway tracks blocked, singers extend supportHundreds of farmers blocked railway tracks in Sangrur, Sunam and Barnala towns to oppose the agriculture laws.

The man, who used toy guns to rob the banks, has been arrested.Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissioner Sudhansu Sarangi said Soumyaranjan Jena, alias Tulu, from a Tangibanta village on the city outskirts robbed Indian Overseas Bank and Bank of India last month.“He had looted nearly Rs 12 lakh from the Indian Overseas Bank, near Infocity area on September 7, and the Bank of India’s Barimunda branch in Mancheswar area on September 28. He got the idea watching YouTube videos and used a toy gun to rob the two banks. Police recovered cash amounting to over Rs 10 lakh and seized the vehicle and the toy gun used in the robbery,” said the police commissioner.Jena had allegedly barged into the bank wearing a helmet when few staff members were present and asked them to handover the cash. He had used a scooty to come to the bank to loot. “After looting the first bank with a toy gun, he had bought a pistol and bullets. His use of Scooty and other evidence in the bank gave us clues that helped us reach him,” said Sarangi.The accused has accounts in both the banks and had taken a loan of nearly Rs 19 lakh. The youth began his business by taking loans. Though he was doing a brisk business with a turnover of Rs 9 to 10 lakh, it was hit badly during the lockdown. After looting, he had come to the bank to repay some of the loan amount.There has been a spate of robberies in banks and ATMs in Odisha during the lockdown. Last month, a trader in Keonjhar town was robbed of Rs 2 lakh while going to deposit the money in a bank. In May, a 14-year-old boy of Bhubaneswar studying in class 9 was arrested while trying to break into an ATM in the city after getting the idea from YouTube. Similarly, in April, robbers unsuccessfully tried to break upon the cash box of an ATM of Tata Indicash under Jajpur police station. In August, police in Angul district had arrested 7 persons from Haryana who had robbed Rs 27.5 lakh from an SBI ATM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/businessman-robs-2-banks-in-odisha-after-watching-youtube-video-arrested/story-QnscXAHISAq5MdJ1KFHDcL.html
05-10-2020||Chandigarh||HP police keen to tap Aadhaar database to identify dead bodies||Keen to give a “dignified exit” to than a 100 unidentified bodies recovered every year in Himachal Pradesh (HP) and offer bereaved families a sense of closure, the state police plans to tap the Aadhaar biometric database (which stores personal information of more than a billion Indians) to trace their identities. To this end, director general of police Sanjay Kundu has written to the home department to see if limited access can be granted to the Aadhaar database through the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which administers the system. On the 100-plus unidentified bodies recovered every year in different parts of the state, Kundu said, “there were no documents or identifiable articles found with them.” Access to the database would allow biometrics of the bodies to be scanned and processed at the Aadhaar portal to trace pre-existing biometric details. This would help the police “hand over the dead body to the family/relatives so that a respectable and dignified exit could be made possible by performing last rites. It would obviously also provide great relief to the family and friends of the deceased,” Kundu added. According to the State Crime Records Bureau’s criminal investigation department, in the last five and a half years till July 15, 2020, 590 unidentified bodies were found in HP, roughly averaging 107 bodies a year. With no mechanism in place to identify them, nearly all of these cases end up under the ‘undetected’ category after years of investigation. Police personnel dealing with such cases also do not have access to a comprehensive database of unknown or unidentified bodies and missing persons.Maximum number of bodies recovered in Shimla As many as 111 such bodies were recovered in HP in 2015; 113 in 2016; 94 in 2017; 102 in 2018; 115 in 2019 and; 55 till the second week of July 2020. Shimla topped the charts among districts with the maximum bodies (119) recovered, followed by Kullu (95) and Kangra (64). In Mandi 64 were recovered while Solan was in the fifth spot with 53 bodies. Among the dead, 95% are male and 5% were female.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-police-keen-to-tap-aadhaar-database-to-identify-dead-bodies/story-8ndy5jJZODwtqa2kpMCvGN.html

The BJP had called a 12-hour bandh in Barrackpore and its adjoining areas on Monday. BJP supporters staged protests in the area since Monday morning. They blocked the Barrackpore Trunk (BT) Road at multiple points and burnt tyres demanding immediate arrest of the killers and a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Also Read: Protests, blockades in Barrackpore in BJP’s 12-hour bandh after leader’s murderWhen police went to disperse the crowd, clashes broke out and the area turned into a battlefield. BJP supporters allegedly attacked the police with bricks and glass bottles. A few crude bombs were also allegedly hurled at the police personnel, an official said. “Police had to fire tear gas shells and resort to lathi charge to disperse the mob,” he said. Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP national general secretary and election observer for West Bengal, has demanded a CBI probe into the incident. A large police contingent, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) and combat force personnel, had to be deployed to maintain law and order in the area. Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had summoned state home secretary HK Dwivedi and director-general of police (DGP) Virendra at Raj Bhavan on Monday morning. When neither turned up, Dhankhar tweeted that he would like to speak to chief minister Mamata Banerjee “urgently”. Later, Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who took charge as the new chief secretary last week, met the governor. “Conveyed my concern about the present alarming scenario @MamataOfficial to the new chief secretary. Am sure the chief minister would take note of the lawlessness. Political violence and targeted killings must stop,” Dhankhar tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-leader-murder-clashes-break-out-between-police-and-bjp-supporters-in-kolkata/story-VRUQiC8IqJSXzAlPQzOncO.html
05-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: HC tells Maharashtra to compensate kin of those who died due to negligence||The Bombay high court (HC) has observed that the Maharashtra government has an overriding responsibility and should compensate the families of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) victims in instances of alleged culpable negligence by the state authorities and hospitals run by civic bodies in disposal of their bodies. The court made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Ashish Shelar, a Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) member of the Maharashtra legislative assembly (MLA).Shelar pointed out 11 instances of alleged negligence in the management of bodies of Covid-19 victims by hospital authorities. The HC also asked the Maharashtra government to adopt the guidelines issued in March by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) and the additional directives given by the Calcutta HC in its September 16 order. Also read: India exceeds WHO’s Covid-19 tests advisory by 6 times, says govtThe HC is not clear which guidelines are being followed by the Maharashtra government for the management of bodies of Covid-19 victims. The state has also been directed to file an affidavit by November 4 elaborating the steps taken in the 11 instances of alleged negligence in the management of bodies of Covid-19 victims by hospital authorities. Shelar has also been permitted to give suggestions for additional guidelines for the management of bodies of Covid-19 victims before or after November 4. A two-member HC division bench, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice NJ Jamadar, heard the submission of senior advocate Rajendra Pai, who stated that the PIL sought accountability and deterrence regarding management of bodies of Covid-19 by hospitals that are run by civic authorities. The plea was filed following a viral video grab of Covid-19 victims, who were lying in a civic body-run hospital, where patients suffering from the viral infection were also undergoing treatment.Pai submitted that there was lack of clarity about the guidelines adopted by the Maharashtra government regarding the management of bodies of Covid-19 victims in hospitals run by civic bodies. The plea prayed before the court that the state government should be asked to clarify about the lacunae and also compensate the families of Covid-19 victims, who suffered due to alleged negligence of the hospital authorities. State pleader Kedar Dighe cited that the Aurangabad bench of Bombay HC is hearing a case regarding the payment of compensation to the next of kin of a woman (82), who had gone missing from a Covid-19 ward of Jalgaon Civil Hospital on June 2 and was found dead eight days later in one of the toilets of the healthcare facility. Dighe submitted that the civic authorities in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra were liable for negligence. The HC responded to Dighe’s contention and said: “The state has an overriding responsibility. If the instances are true, it would suggest culpable negligence on the part of the hospitals and the victim’s family will be entitled for compensation. We are just awakening the state to its responsibility and it should devise some mechanism to compensate the families of the victims.”The bench said that the management of bodies of Covid-19 victims was a larger issue, which is pending before the Supreme Court (SC) and it would await the top court’s decision on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-hc-tells-maharashtra-to-compensate-kin-of-those-who-died-due-to-negligence/story-TM0zbKHjXPx52zif4j5XOI.html

This is a share of 50%.The trend has been persisting. In 2018, 16 cops were killed in accidental firing in the country, of which nine were from Punjab; in 2017, of 13 such deaths in the country, six were from the state. The report adds that Punjab Police lost 45 personnel in 2019, of which 37 died in accidents, one was killed by criminals and seven died in accidental firing.Punjab also reported the second-highest number of cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS) Act at 11,536 cases, the report states. Maharashtra registered 14,158 cases and had the dubious distinction of topping the country.In Punjab, 5,927 cases were registered for possession of drugs for trafficking, which is the highest in the country. In 5,609 cases, possession of drugs for personal use or consumption was found.In cases of people escaping from police custody in 2019, Punjab was the third highest in the country at 84, with 104 and 102 people escaping police custody in Maharashtra and Rajasthan, respectively.

05-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Citing AIIMS report, Shiv Sena slams critics of Mumbai police||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Monday cited a report of a team of forensic experts from New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) ruling out murder in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and slammed those who targeted the Mumbai Police over its investigations in the case. It also sought an apology for those who “maligned” Maharashtra over the death. The Sena asked the Maharashtra government to file a defamation suit against those who “deliberately defamed” the state government as part of a “conspiracy” against the ruling alliance.In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the team dismissed the claims of “poisoning and strangling” made in the case of Rajput’s death.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput death investigation: Congress, BJP trade barbs“The truth ultimately comes out and this is what exactly happened when Dr Sudhir Gupta, who heads the Forensic Department [of AIIMS], declared it as a suicide. Dr Gupta does not belong to the Shiv Sena’s medical wing neither is he connected to Mumbai. In fact, AIIMS enjoys such a good reputation that even [Union] home minister Amit Shah regularly visits it,” said Sena’s mouthpiece, Saamna, in an editorial. It said this confirmed the Mumbai Police were a doing a professional job and was subject to unjust ridicule.The editorial said Rajput’s family was used by some vested interests for their narrow political agenda. It added for this former Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey, who has since quit to join the ruling Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), was seen running his agenda. “The Bihar elections did not have any issue and hence [chief minister] Nitish Kumar and other politicians latched on this issue. Gupteshwar Pandey also played along and finally joined Nitish Kumar’s party. He has in fact defamed the uniform. It is surprising now he has not uttered a single work condemning the Hathras rape incident,” said the editorial.The Sena said the experts’ opinion proves the late actor used to consume drugs and that was the reason why his partner, Rhea Chakraborty, is now in prison. “Had the law allowed, then even the deceased Sushant Singh would have been tried for the consumption of drugs.”The Mumbai Police were criticised for the mishandling the investigations. The Bihar Police also took up the case before the Supreme Court handed it over the case to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-citing-aiims-report-shiv-sena-slams-critics-of-mumbai-police/story-TuR1psKl29pMFV2VBwNciK.html
05-10-2020||Patna||Bihar polls: LJP finally walks out of NDA, but says will back BJP||After keeping the NDA on tenterhooks, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) Sunday decided to go it alone in the Bihar assembly elections citing ideological differences with the JD-U, but with a clear objective of ensuring a BJP-led government in Bihar. At the parliamentary board meeting chaired by LJP president Chirag Paswan, the party went on the much speculated lines resolving not to contest under the leadership of chief minister Kumar. However, to reiterate its stance for the BJP, the parliamentary board adopted a resolution that called for all LJP legislators to strengthen PM Modi. “The LJP wants that on the lines of the Centre, Bihar should also have a BJP-led government. After election results, all the LJP MLAs will work to strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said a statement issued by LJP principal general secretary Abdul Khalik. The LJP is likely to contest on nearly 125 seats, most of which will be fought by JD (U) also. How this would pan out will be interesting to watch in a state where it was hitherto considered a direct National Democratic Alliance (NDA) vs Grand Alliance (GA) fight, though Bihar has had a history of ‘friendly contests’ to alter the course of election. THE IDEOLOGICAL BATTLELJP has also made it clear at the outset that its decision could lead to ideological battle with the JD-U over seats especially with LJP president Chirag Paswan being openly critical of Bihar chief minister and JDU chief Nitish Kumar, accusing him of failing to meet poll promises of ushering in development in the state. This could create a piquant situation for the JD-U as also the BJP, as in case of small margins of victory split of votes will matter a lot. By maintaining that it wanted to continue with the arrangement that existed for the Lok Sabha election and focus on its ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ vision document for the state’s development, it has put the onus of decision on the JD-U, while maintaining that there was no love lost with the BJP. DRAWING PARALLELS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETThe LJP decision takes one back to 2005 when LJP fought alone with the sole objective of ending the 15-year rule of the RJD. Though it could not win many seats, its ability to split crucial votes made it a bit easier for the NDA to form government. After 15 years, it is doing the same with a different target – this time chief minister Nitish Kumar. In the two elections in 2005 February and October, LJP had contested on its own, contesting 178 and 203 seats respectively. However, it won just 10 seats in the October polls compared to 29 in February, but enough to make it easier for the Nitish-led NDA to end the 15-year-old RJD rule. Though LJP bagged six seats each in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections with nearly 100% strike rate in the company of NDA, it struggled badly in the Assembly elections of 2010 and 2015, bagging just two and three seats respectively in the 243-member assembly. In 2010, it had contested 75 seats, while in 2015 it fought on 40 seats. UNDERDOGS OR KINGMAKERSThough LJP has never been a big player in Bihar politics, it has often played deft politics to end up on the right side since its inception in 2000, when Ram Vilas Paswan set up his own outfit after splitting from the Janata Dal on the issue of joining the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Two decades later, LJP has undergone generational shift, with Chirag Paswan as the national president and his cousin and former MP Ramchandra Paswan’s son Prince Raj the state president. This has resulted in rising ambition of the party to expand its footprints, with Chirag being projected as CM candidate even at the cost of antagonizing Nitish Kumar. The 2020 election will be a big test for the LJP, as it would be the first election under the new and young leadership without patron union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who is ailing. FRIENDLY CONTESTEarlier, the party earlier had hinted at following the Manipur model in Bihar, where the party contested the 2017 assembly elections alone and later its only MLA joined the BJP government. In Manipur, the LJP had announced candidates for 11 constituencies, but won a single seat. In 2014, during the assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir and the 2019 assembly election in Jharkhand on its own, even as it was part of the NDA at the centre. Persons aware of the details said, the party will opt to have a friendly contest against the NDA partners, though the LJP leadership had qualified earlier that they will put up contestants against the JDU and not the BJP. The LJP leadership had announced last month that the party will contest 143 of the 243 seats, if it fails to reach an agreement with the BJP on seat sharing. In another development, Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party patron Ram Vilas Paswan has undergone a heart surgery, his son Chirag said on Sunday.Paswan ,74, who has been in active politics for more than five decades and is one of the country’s most noted Dalit leaders, has been hospitalised for the last few weeks.He was operated upon at a private hospital in the national capital. He has long suffered from a heart condition and family sources expressed confidence that he will soonrecover.In a tweet, Chirag said his father underwent a heart surgery due to sudden developments on Saturday evening, which forced him to cancel a party meeting and rush to his father’s side.If needed, the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution will undergo another operation in a few weeks, he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-polls-ljp-finally-walks-out-of-nda-but-says-will-back-bjp/story-0flBkWPEPA1bP3HkfiwEBO.html
05-10-2020||Mumbai||Infection rate in people aged 31-40 increased after unlocking: Maharashtra government||At 21.34%, the 31-40 age group accounts for the highest number of Covid-19 cases, data from Maharashtra government’s Medical Education and Drugs Department shows. The percentage of cases from the category was 20.54% on June 4, which increased to 20.74% a month later and then to 21.14%, the same day the following month, after the lockdown measures were eased. Maharashtra reported 1,443,409 Covid-19 cases and 38,084 fatalities until Sunday evening. The 31-40 age group is followed by 41-50 (17.9% cases), 21-30 (16.98% cases), and 51-60 (15.95%). “Major activities, including inter-district movement, a rise in office workforce and reopening of commercial activities from the first week of September, have led to a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 patients from the age group of 31 to 40 years over the past couple of months. The common perception is that youngsters can be allowed to step out, while senior citizens must stay at home,” said an official from the health department. Also Read: India exceeds WHO’s Covid-19 tests advisory by 6 times: GovtThe percentage of cases among the 41-50 and 51-60 age groups has declined gradually. The 41-50 age group contributed to 18.03% cases on June 4, which dropped to 17.9% four months later. Similarly, for the 51-60 age group, the percentage of patients came down to 15.95% from 16.69%. The 21-30 age category, too, has seen a drop – 19.55% on June 4 to 16.98% four months later. State health officials attributed the dip in the infection rate to closure of schools, colleges and high awareness among youngsters. Also Read: With 74,442 new Covid-19 cases and 903 deaths, India’s tally goes past 6.6 mnHowever, the spread among 61-70 and 71-80 age groups has increased during the corresponding period – June 4 to October 4 – from 9.72% to 10.63% and from 4.19% to 5.02%, respectively. “The rise in the percentage of cases in the 31-40 age group is because of their mobility after lockdown restrictions were gradually eased. The positive aspect of this age group is that they have a higher recovery rate. It also helps to develop herd immunity and increase the percentage of people with positive antibodies. Besides, the mortality rate is low,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital, said carelessness among people in the age group is the major reason. “Most of them are without any comorbidity and it brings the feeling of surety that they would not get infected. If due precautions are taken, like by those in the 40-60 age group, the number of cases can drop further,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/infection-rate-in-people-aged-31-40-increased-after-unlocking-maharashtra-government/story-PWUsNukhtcOhxH1bEEiLRJ.html
05-10-2020||Lucknow||UP govt to start doorstep delivery of food stock to ration dealers||To check pilferage in the long supply chain, the Uttar Pradesh government is introducing a new system of doorstep delivery of food stocks directly to ration dealers under the public distribution system (PDS) from Monday.The government has identified one block in each district for the implementation of the new scheme after the positive results of a pilot project launched in a few blocks in three districts.Also read: Odisha sarpanch alleges PDS corruption, fined Rs 1 lakh for organising protest“We tried the pilot project in two blocks each in Prayagraj, Moradabad, and Banda. Now, after the success of the project, the government has decided to implement the scheme in one block of each district from Monday,” said AK Singh, additional commissioner, food and civil supplies.“Later, the government may decide to replicate the model for all the blocks across the state.”Currently, the food grains are delivered in two stages — from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns to the block godowns and from block godowns to the ration dealers.Under, the new system, the food grains will travel directly from FCI godowns to the ration dealers.In most cases, ration dealers have to travel to block godowns to get the monthly quota while in some cases, the stock is delivered to them by the block godowns. In either case, the government used to pay the cost at the rate of Rs 15-18 per quintal, depending on the distance between a dealer’s shop and block godown.The new system, according to officials, may be helpful for the government in saving these expenses apart from curbing leakages in the long supply chain.The department of food and civil supplies has also prepared software to run and monitor the new system to ensure transparent transactions.“Soon after a delivery van starts from an FCI godown, the ration dealer concerned will get a message on his registered mobile number informing him about the same including exact quantity loaded and to be delivered.

Passenger vehicles across the state are off roads from 6 am on Monday due to the strike called by All Assam Motor Transport Association (AAMTA), who is seeking relief measures from the state government to offset massive losses suffered due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions.In Guwahati, besides city buses and buses running on long routes, taxis, tempos and other passenger vehicles are also off roads in support of the demands raised by the AAMTA.

But transporters have been denied such measures, forcing us to resort to a strike,” Pradip Das, general secretary, AAMTA, told media persons on Sunday. “At present, we are operating buses with 50% of passengers’ capacity, but with the same fares as earlier. It has become impossible to continue, as petrol prices have also gone up by leaps and bounds,” he added. The government had requested the AAMTA to refrain from resorting to strike as it would pose inconvenience for passengers. “We had requested them to postpone or call off the strike, as a meeting with the transport minister is scheduled on Tuesday to redress their demands,” said a transport department official. In a bid to ensure passengers are not stranded because of the strike, the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) has decided to operate 650 buses across the state, including 250 in Guwahati alone, from 6 am to 10 pm, on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indefinite-strike-by-assam-transport-body-from-today/story-1TDnm1qUHkIVFmIOf3H98H.html

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Modi weakening govt procurement system to benefit businessmen friends, Rahul Gandhi tells Punjab farmers||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of weakening the procurement system for foodgrains and snatching the economic freedom of farmers with the new farm laws. Gandhi was addressing farmers on the second day of the party’s Kheti Bachao Yatra at Bhawanigarh, 13km from Sangrur, which has highest per hectare production of wheat in India and also remains the epicentre of protests of farmers. Targeting the Modi government, Gandhi said the Centre makes policies to benefit few businessmen who are Modi’s friends. “Modi is paving the way for (industrialists) Ambani and Adani in the farm sector by enacting the new agriculture laws,” he said. He said that the illogical policies of the government had already created unemployment in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). He reiterated how demonetisation, the goods and services tax (GST) and unplanned Covid-19 lockdown had hit the common man, while the ventures of top businessmen grew. “The new laws will steal the economic freedom of farmers as a few businessmen will control the sale and purchase of foodgrains. The Congress is for strengthening the government procurement of foodgrains. But the government is bent upon destroying the nation’s food security. Otherwise, what was the hurry to bring in these laws?” he said. The Congress leader said that the government anticipated farmers won’t come out on the streets due to the Covid-19 restrictions. “The Congress will join the fight of the farmers till the illogical, black laws are scrapped,” he said. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder termed the new laws unjust for farmers. He said that the non-commitment on the continuation of the minimum support price (MSP) regime will create problems for farmers. He said that acting on the Shanta Kumar committee’s report, Modi is trying to scrap the Food Corporation of India, which purchases foodgrains from Punjab for public distribution across the country. “Instead of watching the interest of farmers, the government is promoting business interests,” Capt Amarinder Singh said. He said that the Akalis had failed to protect the interest of farmers while being a partner of Modi’s National Democratic Alliance. He asked farmers not to believe the PM’s assurance on MSP, as the NDA government is yet to fulfil its constitutional commitment to pay monthly GST to states. He said that the Congress will fight for farmers on the legal and political fronts. It will approach the Supreme Court besides calling a special session of the Punjab assembly on this issue. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar termed the agrarian laws as “death warrants” for farmers. He said that the Modi government is helping big businessmen but ignoring farmers, who are the backbone of the economy. Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who attended Sunday’s rally, skipped the event. Haryana Congress leader Deepender Hooda was present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/modi-weakening-govt-procurement-system-to-benefit-businessmen-friends-rahul-gandhi-tells-punjab-farmers/story-o8s5dnwkpHE1ELXYCu54dP.html
05-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A beautiful doorway, still living||It is arrayed out in six panels. The planks that link them are studded with cap-like decorations, like little black nails. Four gigantic latches are fitted at different corners, their metal chains as hefty as the ones used to imprison the courtesan Anarkali, in the movie Mughal-e-Azam.This wooden door, with an arched taak at the top, transports the viewer to an earlier era. The only contemporary giveaway is of a white electric door bell at the top-right.The door frames the entrance of a house in Old Delhi’s Galli Chooriwallan street. It is very close to the house with a beautiful doorway that was recently razed down to make way for a multi-storey building—the demise of that doorway was mourned on these pages a few days ago.As is true of most of the city, Delhi’s historic Mughal-era quarter is undergoing rapid transformation. Old is being replaced by new. But the Walled City continues to host souvenirs of its architectural past, here and there — though such treasures can be hard to find. This doorway is exactly one such place, snuggled at the end of a cramped alley. In fact this entire passageway is like a museum of doors, with scores of similar doorways lurking around, each an element of utmost elegance. Despite being hefty and grand, these doors are so rooted to this address that they look ordinary in a most surreal way, as if they were celebrities lounging in ordinary clothes in the privacy of their home, far removed from the vulgarities of fandom and self-importance.Each door is flanked by stone columns, which have patterns of flowers and leaves inscribed on them. The door sills show age and venerability, the weathered wood looks creased and has clearly seen the shift of many seasons. The lane has a series of small printing establishments. This morning a labourer enters from the main street outside, his back weighed down with a great stack of printing sheets. He hobbles on, without a glance at the beautiful doorways.The most attractive of these doors, the one described in the beginning, belongs to a private residence. A lady answers the doorbell. “Yes, our house is very old,” she says, and closes the door again||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-beautiful-doorway-still-living/story-kGAGOYnPL2MB4tmwhZtVPN.html
05-10-2020||City||New farm laws attack on federal structure: Sidhu||Former Punjab cabinet minister and Amritsar East legislator Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday attended a tractor rally led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi here to protest the Centre’s new farm laws. Sidhu’s participation in the rally came three days after All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat met him at his residence in Amritsar. Sidhu, who had been at loggerheads with chief minister Amarinder Singh, had stayed away from all Congress activities ever since he resigned as cabinet minister last year. Wearing a black turban as a symbol of protest against BJP government’s anti-farmer laws, Sidhu, took 15-minutes to complete his trademark address comprising poetry, satire and sharp political comments that invited repeated applause by the audience. Sidhu strongly opposed farm laws as an “attack on the federal structure” and also said these black laws would ruin the farming community and others associated in the agrarian economy. “They (BJP government) are robbing us of our rights,” he said, adding the Centre had imposed a “system which had failed in Europe and the US”. These new legislations would adversely affect five lakh labourers and 30,000 commissioned agents, Sidhu claimed. The outspoken leader also asked the cash-strapped Punjab government to take the onus of assuring minimum support price (MSP) and storage to farmers by amending state legislations.“Governments are not expected to turn its back on the key issues. Farmers need MSP and if the central government intends to dilute it, then the Punjab government needs to step in to ensure profitability on their crops. A special assembly session should be called on farmers’ issues,” Sidhu said while referring to his political bête noire Punjab CM.When Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on the stage asked Sidhu to cut short his speech, he replied, “ Bhaji aaj na rok... pehlan vee bithaye rakhya see (Brother, do not stop me today).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-farm-laws-attack-on-federal-structure-sidhu/story-rcr20MhQyUYfYVFhdJpCnI.html
05-10-2020||City||Rahul Gandhi vows to scrap contentious farm laws once Congress returns to power at Centre||Sharpening his attack on the BJP-led NDA government over the new agriculture laws, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said they will scrap these contentious legislations once the Congress returns to power at the Centre. Launching the three-day ‘kheti bachao yatra’ along with Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and a battery of senior Congress leaders at Moga district’s Badhni Kalan village, the Gandhi scion vowed to fight till end against the legislations passed during Parliament’s monsoon session and extended his party’s “firm support” to the agrarian community. “Some chosen corporate houses are dictating the Central government’s policy decisions. Land of farmers in the states like Punjab and Haryana is now facing the threat of acquisition by the powerful business houses,” he said while addressing the gathering in Moga. Expressing solidarity with the farmers against the farm laws, the Congress’s state unit tried to put a united face. Sulking Amritsar (East) MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, a bete noire of the Amarinder, also attended the march after staying away from party events for several months. The cricketer-turned-politician was invited over cabinet ministers to address the gathering. Rahul also released a `kisan-mazdoor ekta’ (farm labourer unity) flag. VILLAGERS THRONG RALLY VENUE AT MOGA VILLAGE Earlier, the rally venue at the Badhni Kalan grain market was well attended by people, including women. Villagers also came to the rally in private buses from adjoining Bathinda, Barnala and Ferozepur districts. Covid-19 guidelines of maintaining social distancing and wearing masks were flouted by people. Amarinder urged Gandhi to bring under one roof the farmers from across India for an organised protest against the Centre. “The Akalis sold off the farmers’ interests as part of the Central government, with Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal being party to the decision as a minister. The Centre might pay MSP for a couple of crops, but eventually it would scrap the system completely,” said the CM. Later in the evening, the tractor march led by Gandhi and Amarinder received a rousing welcome by thousands of waiting farmers at Lamme Jattpura village in Raikot of Ludhiana district. Gandhi and Amarinder were handed over resolutions against the laws by the panchayats in Raikot sub-division. Addressing the gathering, Gandhi said the Modi-led government has been attacking the poor. Earlier, travelling on tractors through Chakkar, Lakha and Manoke, Rahul and Amarinder met the farmers and assured them of full support in their fight against the new laws. At Chakkar village, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu handed over soil to Gandhi and urged him to save Punjab and its farmers from the new laws. Gandhi said the government at the Centre is not run by Modi or BJP but by the Adanis and the Ambanis. “The Adanis and Ambanis help Modi and they get help in return. It is a symbiotic relationship between them,” he said. JAKHAR DRIVES TRACTOR CARRYING GANDHI, CAPT State Congress president Sunil Jakhar drove the tractor carrying the Gandhi scion and Amarinder from Badhni Kalan to the Lamme Jattpur village in adjoining Ludhiana district. Gandhi was honoured by villagers with shawls at a couple of places. Due to the movement of security vehicles, several tractors could not join the march. Navjot Sidhu was aboard a tractor driven by Congress’ Rohtak MP Deepender Singh Hooda.A special engineering team was hired to modify the tractors used by the Congress leaders to make them comfortable and increase their seating capacity. The tractors also went through special security check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rahul-gandhi-vows-to-scrap-contentious-farm-laws-once-congress-returns-to-power-at-centre/story-MTfR2y7ZKKGJTbLLkr5MOJ.html

The deceased has been identified as Mukarram. He had been missing since the blaze started, even as all other employees managed to escape on time.High drama was witnessed in the morning as the labourers’ union gathered outside the factory and demanded a search operation to find their missing colleague. Following this, a fire officer and the Jodhewal Basti police team, led by station house officer Arshpreet Kaur, reached the spot to carry out the search.Cops said the search could not be carried out on Saturday as firemen had been focusing on dousing the flames.

We were being pushed and shoved away from the spot where the fire incident had taken place. Even the factory owner kept telling me that Mukarram did not turn up for work and had joined some other unit. He was lying. Had he told the truth, my relative could have been saved,” said Ibrahim. SHO Asrhpreet Kaur said, “We are recording the statement of the family members of the deceased and appropriate action will be taken in the matter.” Mukarram, a native of Bihar, is survived by his wife and two children.

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||At Amphalla jail in J&K, musical concert lifts spirits of infected inmates||In a novel way to pep up the spirits of Covid-19 infected prisoners, the Amphalla district jail here organised a musical concert with trained inmates performing live for their fellow mates.The 40-minute programme on Saturday saw a group of trained prisoners, including two women, performing live amid adequate preventive measures to check the spread of the infection.“Music is a great healer and we have started the concert on humanitarian grounds to uplift the morale of the inmates who were recently tested positive for the viral disease and isolated in separate blocks,” said district jail superintendent Mirza Saleem Ahmad Beig.More such concerts will be organised for the infected prisoners to lift their spirits, officials said.While one of the inmates with co-morbidities at the jail was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) after testing positive for coronavirus last week, rest of the 79 prisoners are asymptomatic and have been kept in isolation in their blocks to prevent the spread of the disease, they said.Besides the prisoners, three jail staffers have tested positive for the virus and their condition is stable.This is the highest number of prisoners testing positive for Covid-19 in any jail in the Jammu region though such cases have also surfaced in central jail Kot Bhalwal, district jail Kathua and district jail Bhaderwah in the recent past, prompting the jail authorities to plan separate facilities near the jail for the infected inmates, they said. “The objective of the concert was to de-stress the Covid-19 positive prisoners. All the six singers and two musicians who performed voluntarily were trained in the jail over the past one year,” the jail superintendent said.He said the programme was introduced shortly after testing of all 644 inmates and staff of the jail.Beig emphasised that all Covid-19 safety rules were followed while conducting the event. A distance of at least 15 feet was maintained for the safety of the performers, the official said.Another highlight of the programme was a poem written by the inmates on their resolve to fight back the infectious disease and emerge victorious by following the SOPs religiously, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-amphalla-jail-in-j-k-musical-concert-lifts-spirits-of-infected-inmates/story-CO5Irms2p8NE91l8fRapbI.html

There is no dearth of opportunities for development, employment and overall growth of Jammu Kashmir,” Sinha said.“Violence, killings of innocents should be condemned, whether it’s the killings of common people or security forces. We can’t be selective in condemning violence,” he said.‘Back to village’ is a programme wherein officers of the administration reach out to the public to listen to their demands, proposals, suggestions and address their grievances. This is the third phase of the programme which has been launched in J&K as the region has remained without an elected government for the past more than two years.The L-G said innovative financing, convergence of schemes, enabling infrastructure, effective and efficient implementation will be key to improve growth prospects of J&K.“With hard work, dedication and better execution on ground, every individual in our villages will attain social empowerment,” he said.Sinha said the UT has been provided with funds to an excess of ₹1,951 crore this year for the development of villages and the people.“Similarly, agriculture and horticulture sectors have been provided ₹1,872 crore, to an excess of ₹680 crore with respect to last year,” he said.The LG said that the government was working on four key points for development of J&K like accelerating growth, providing benefits of social security and social welfare schemes to all, eliminating regional disparities and effective execution of works. “In the recently sanctioned economic package and the upcoming mega Industrial Package, focus will be on industry, business and services; agriculture and allied sectors; village industries; technology and innovation; infrastructure; financial inclusion and social security,” he said.The LG said under the new economic package announced recently, the farmer-mandi link is to be strengthened so that the producers get more options and better prices for their crop.“Similarly, the number of satellite markets is to be increased from 17 to 22…Means and resources abound, with people’s participation, soon there shall be no backward village in entire J&K,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/back-to-village-event-j-k-l-g-asks-people-to-contribute-towards-peace/story-QhBZV9gWc9ubUH9lyN61yK.html

The police said the accused man, who lives near the victim’s house, is yet to be arrested. According to the police, the girl stated in the complaint that around 4.45am, she had gone to the washroom when the accused man crept up from behind, grabbed her and forcefully took her to his room, where he sexually assaulted her. The police said the girl tried to yell, but he threatened to kill her. Further, she could not identify him at that time. Her father, a labourer, said, “He put a hand on her face and took her to his room and raped her. Around 5.30am, I went out looking for her and saw her returning from the accused man’s room, which is near our shanty. She was crying and seemed frightened. She shared her ordeal with me. I told some people in the area and went to Sector 40 police station to report the incident.” The victim’s father, who hails from Madhya Pradesh, alleged that the police had initially tried to dissuade the family from filing an FIR. “The police told us to settle the matter and that if we proceed with the case, the girl’s future would be ruined and she would face difficulty in finding a match. They said that we would be caught up in expensive legal proceedings. So, under duress, I signed before the legal aid, saying that we do not want to pursue the matter. However later, I took help from others and went again to file the case,” he said. The police said in the morning, they had received a call from police control room (number 100) regarding an alleged sexual assault case. However, at the time, the victim and her family did not mention sexual assault in the statement recorded before legal aid, said the police. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sadar, said, “In the initial statement before the legal aid, there was no mention of assault and the family had said that the girl was talking to someone in the neighbourhood and a third party called the police. Later, the family changed their statement and said that the minor had been sexually assaulted and that they had recorded the initial statement under duress.” ACP said that after the complaint of sexual assault was received, the family was contacted again and an FIR was immediately registered in the case. “The accused is yet to be arrested. The medical examination of the victim has been conducted and the report is awaited, We shall verify all the facts pertaining to the case,” he said. A case was registered against the accused man under section 376 (rape) of Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Sector 40 police station on Sunday evening, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-16-year-old-raped-in-sector-45/story-olV1TKZAANmMbQONxv1JMN.html

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Shopian fake encounter: Kin of slain Rajouri youths demand justice||Destitute yet full of dreams, 21-year-old Imtiyaz Ahmad wanted to become a schoolmaster, Mohammad Ibrar, 18, aspired the life of a soldier, while Abrar Ahmad, 26, wished to join the police force someday.Bodies of these three young men, who were killed in an alleged fake encounter by the army in south Kashmir’s Shopian district in July, were exhumed and later laid to rest in their ancestral graveyards in Rajouri district by the family members on Friday.The youths had come to Shopian in search of work so they could return home with enough money to pursue their dreams. But they were killed in a staged gunfight and passed off as terrorists on July 18, a day before they went missing from their rented accommodation in Amshipora.The army had initially termed the three as “terrorists”. Later, it said that an inquiry had brought out evidence indicating that during the operation in which the three were killed, “powers vested under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA)-1990 were exceeded and the dos and don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Supreme Court have been contravened”. The army added that the “competent disciplinary authority has directed initiation of disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable”.The Jammu and Kashmir police last week said the DNA samples of the three had matched with their family members in Rajouri.Imtiyaz’s father Sabir Hussain, 45, said “My son and two nephews have been buried in our ancestral graveyards. Imtiyaz had gone to Shopian to work as a labourer and collect enough money to pay his admission fee for college. He wanted to be the first graduate from the family.”Hussain said that three young lives were snuffed out in a staged encounter. “Neither has any justice been done nor compensation given to us yet. They were murdered in cold blood for awards and rewards. We are very poor nomads and who cares for a poor man. It was nothing but sheer barbarism upon our innocent boys,” he said.He demanded that whoever tipped off the army branding three innocent boys as “terrorists” should also be taken to the task as per the law.“They all should meet the same fate and truth be made public,” he said.Hussain said his sister Shifat Jaan’s son Mohammad Ibrar was passionate to join the army, oblivious of the fact that one day he will be killed in a staged encounter.“We want justice. No money can compensate for the loss of human life and we have lost three young men. They had dreams to join the army, police, or become a schoolmaster. They all wanted to do well in their life despite penury,” he said.“Abrar has left behind his wife and a 15-month-old son, whose eyes keep looking for his father,” he lamented.Shamim Akhter, 40, Imtiyaz’s mother said, “The barbarians did not allow them to have food and picked them up from their rented room before killing them.”Two men believed to be informers of the security forces were arrested in connection with the staged gunfight on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shopian-fake-encounter-kin-of-slain-rajouri-youths-demand-justice/story-01OF4ZElj1VlDrqCpaHt2O.html
05-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Last week’s tally of Covid-19 cases lowest in over a month||Gurugram recorded 287 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the total tally of reported infections to 21,732 cases. The past week (September 28-October 4) saw 1,557 new cases -- the lowest seven-day aggregate in at least five weeks. The district over the past week also tested 19,200 new samples, resulting in a weekly test positivity rate (TPR, number of positive tests per 100 tests) of 8%-- also the lowest in at least five weeks. Health department officials cited the downward trend in these numbers as evidence that transmission of the coronavirus disease had decelerated in the district.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We have been testing at least 2,500 samples per day, and the TPR has now gone down to below 10%, which indicates that the virus has slowed in terms of transmission. If there was anything missing in our testing strategy, we would have found new clusters emerging, and this has not happened. This is the biggest sign that transmission of the virus itself has been curbed. Why this is happening despite more and more public movement opening up is still a matter of debate, but with fewer cases coming in each day, we are in a position to treat the most severe cases better and reduce mortality, which we have been successful in doing,” said Dr. Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer.From a fatality rate of 1% in early September, Gururgram’s case fatality ratio (CFR) has been on a steady decline, dipping to 0.82 percent on October 4. Bed occupancy in Gurugram’s hospitals is also the lowest it has been in at least four weeks. On September 7, ICU and ventilator bed occupancy was at 60 percent, whereas only 30 percent of ICU beds and ventilators are occupied at the moment. “So in terms of availability of resources, we are adequately equipped to deal with a rise in symptomatic infections if it happens,” Sharma said.The district at present has 2,408 active cases of Covid-19 (less than 2510 cases a week ago, and less than 2811 cases recorded a fortnight ago). Of these, 184 are presently hospitalised (down from 228 a week ago), while 2199 patients are under home isolation (down from 2257 patients a week ago). Another 25 patients (down from 38 a week ago) are under observation at district covid care centres. The daily growth rate of cases, from being well over 2 percent in mid-September, currently stands at 1.3 percent. This has resulted in an expansion of the doubling-rate of cases. From a doubling-rate of just 40 days in mid-September, Gurugram’s total tally would take 81 days to double at the current daily growth rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-last-week-s-tally-of-covid-19-cases-lowest-in-over-a-month/story-Np0phMIEldlLRMxRUlTV9L.html

A police team reached the spot and rushed her to a private hospital in DLF phase 2. After preliminary treatment, she was referred to the civil hospital.Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), DLF, said, “She suffered head injuries mainly and was bleeding.

05-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG sweeps clean Khandsa Road||As part of the 15-day cleanliness drive, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Sunday cleaned the entire stretch (about 7km) of Khandsa Road. Termed as the ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’, the drive was launched on October 2 across Haryana by the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) that will run through October 17. On the opening day, MCG had cleaned several areas in Chakkarpur village, and on Saturday the drive was conducted in the Sector 4 area.In the drive, MCG uses super suction machines and jetting machines to first unclog drains and then suction out all the sediments and debris. Further, garbage found lying in the open is picked up from the entire stretch and dumped in a tractor trolley. In the last step, the entire stretch is then swept by sanitation workers. During the Khandsa Road cleaning drive on Sunday, mayor Madhu Azad, along with several municipal officials, cleaned part of the stretch.“Gurugram will become a beautiful and healthy city only through cleanliness. For this, public representatives and citizens will also have to unite with the government. Every person is conscious of the cleanliness of his or her house, if they also become aware of the cleanliness of the surrounding area, it will not take long for Gurugram to become a clean city,” said Azad, stressing that residents need to consider cleanliness as their moral responsibility.Besides masks, gloves and face shields have been provided to sanitation workers for this task, said MCG officials. Further, all workers have been directed to not enter sewer lines on their own and strictly use machines to clear out the muck.“All efforts are being undertaken by MCG to make the city cleaner, and operations are underway to cover as many areas as possible in the 15-day drive,” said SS Rohilla, public relation officer, MCG.Among cities with 1-10 lakh population, Gurugram finished with a rank of 62 out of 382 nationally in the 2020 Swachh Survekshan. For 2021, MCG has set a target of breaking into the list of cleanest 50 cities in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mcg-sweeps-clean-khandsa-road/story-9xg5WfLwU3wuxqVk1o5rjL.html
05-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Apartment owners to challenge de-licensing of project land in court||A section of homebuyers has decided to challenge the recently amended Haryana land law that allowed retrospective rescinding of land permits for projects.The federation of apartment owners association (FAOA) said the amendment allowed developers to change their projects, and the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to act arbitrarily.The Punjab and Haryana high court had, in July, quashed DTCP orders to de-license land for constructing a residential complex and allowing a commercial complex to come up instead. De-licensing here meant that a part of the land for which a residential licence was issued was taken out of the purview of the residential licence. The CBI, on the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court, registered a case in this matter and found 54 similar cases of de-licensing.On August 26, the Haryana government passed a bill amending the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act and retrospectively validating and allowing DTCP to de-license.“This amendment will allow for correcting illegalities in the past and prior to this there was no allowance for delicensing the project. This is a way to pardon all wrongs committed by developers. The project plans have specifications but these are violated everywhere. We need to stop this illegality. The politicians and bureaucrats are not interested in helping buyers,” said Lt Gen (retd) SK Bahri, who the chairperson of the federation, adding it would jeopardise the interest of home buyers.The federation said that they have approached buyers’ associations, RWA in Gurugram, NCR and across the country to pool resources and generate funds so that this law could be challenged in court.Sanjay Lal, vice president of Ambience Lagoon RWA, said that the amended clause would give developers to act in whatever manner they please as there would be no representation regarding the proposed layout in case of apartment and no guiding factor to adjudge the completion of promised development works. “We will challenge this amendment in court and for that matter we have launched the drive to collect funds as we have no option but to approach higher courts,” he said.Praveen Jain, chairman, National Real Estate Development Council said that interests of buyers would not be affected as only those projects can be delicensed where property has not been sold. “How will the buyers get affected when third party right are not created,” said Jain. A senior DTCP official, when asked about the matter said that amendment does not impact the interests of the buyers but they had every right to approach the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-apartment-owners-to-challenge-de-licensing-of-project-land-in-court/story-ddcMc3s4PYvk5nSYpqAsRO.html
05-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG plants over 100K saplings in 3-month-long drive||Nearly 1.06 lakh saplings were planted by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) across the city this monsoon season — the highest in the city so far. MCG started its three-month-long plantation drive on June 27 in collaboration with the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of the city to plant saplings on all weekends during the months of July, August, and September.As part of this process, MCG asked RWAs to send them details of the type and quantity of saplings they wanted to plant. Accordingly, the civic body distributed the same from their own nurseries free of cost. Last year, the civic body developed four of its own nurseries across the city in four different locations — Kadipur village, Sector 15 Part 1, biodiversity park near Nathupur, and Sector 46.Overall, 269 RWAs took part in this year’s drive and a total of 1, 05,910 saplings were planted, as per the data shared by the civic body.MCG had launched this drive to curb the diminishing green cover of the city and increase it over time. According to a 2019 Forest Survey of India (FSI) report, only 9.2% of Gurugram’s total geographical area is under forest cover, where as in 2017, it was 9.3%.“We realise the importance of green cover in the city, especially in regards to checking air pollution. Hence, we coordinated with RWAs for our plantation drive this year not only to ensure that various parts of the city get covered but also to make sure that there is an additional body looking after the saplings apart from the MCG. Our objective is not only to plant saplings but to look after them properly,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Prior to 2020, MCG officials said that the highest number of saplings planted in the city in a single season was less than 10,000. “Due to the drive’s success this year, we will try to replicate similar measures in the next monsoon season as well and aim at increasing the existing green cover in the city even further,” said Singh.During the drive, MCG planted saplings of fruits, such as papaya, pomegranate and guava, and trees, such as babool, peepal, gulmohar and kachnar, apart from other ornamental plants, shrubs, medicinal plants, and native varieties.MCG officials said that this year, the audit of the planted saplings has been conducted to ensure they can be periodically maintained and assessed. They further said that the audit will also help the civic body to understand which plants, shrubs, and trees are best suited for Gurugram’s climatic and soil conditions so that they can plant only such saplings in the future drives.“Due to multiple construction projects, more than a thousand trees had to be axed in our area over the last decade, which led the a significant decrease in the green cover. Since there are a large number of vacant plots in both DLF Phase-1 and Phase-2, which were lying unutilised, we reached out to the MCG to provide us with saplings so that we can plant the same in both the colonies. After the drive, residents within the colony were allocated the responsibility of looking after the saplings,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of DLF Qutub Enclave RWA, which looks after DLF phases 1 and 2.

I tried to explain the rules to them, but they refused to listen to me and started threatening me and the workers at the store. The suspects then used barbed wire to assault me. They also took money from me and few goods that were kept outside the shop and fled,” said Singh in his police complaint.Based on the complaint, a case was registered under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt using a dangerous weapon) of the Indian Penal Code on Saturday against the three unidentified suspects at the Phase 3 police station while a medical examination was ordered for the victim.“Based on the medical report, we will add more sections in the FIR, namely section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide). One of the suspects has been detained and a search is on for the other responsible people,” said Jitendra Dikshit, station house officer, Phase 3 police station said on Sunday evening.According to the latest rules, revised in light of the pandemic, liquor shops in the district can remain open only from 10am to 9pm.In a separate incident, a security guard at a high-rise in Sector 119 was also assaulted allegedly by three men on Friday night after he had asked them to park their vehicle in a parking lot outside the society.“The alleged incident took place at the Amrapali Platinum society’s entry gate.

05-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Registration of 79,000 old vehicles cancelled for not adhering to NGT norms||Ghaziabad: The regional transport department has cancelled the registration of about 79,000 vehicles in Ghaziabad, in compliance with the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015 which had banned plying of petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years in the national capital region (NCR), officials said Sunday.The department, in September last year, had suspended registrations of at least 81,773 vehicles in compliance with NGT’s directions. These included 75,293 petrol vehicles and 6,480 diesel vehicles. “After suspension of the registrations, we had given the owners of such vehicles six months’ time to take no objection certificates (NOCs) and get their vehicles registered out of the NCR region. They were also given an option to register such vehicles in 34 districts identified in Uttar Pradesh,” said Vishwajeet Pratap Singh, additional regional transport officer.“Initially, it was a public notice which we issued after suspension. After the end of the six month period, we have cancelled registrations of about 79,000 such vehicles which include petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years. The rest of the vehicle owners had applied and obtained the NOCs, hence their registrations were not cancelled,” he added. The officer, while adding that such vehicles, if caught plying on roads, will be seized, said that the department has further identified about 25,000 more vehicles which have since come under the ambit of the NGT order, and that the process for the cancellation of their registrations will be initiated soon.At present, there are 9.84 lakh vehicles registered in Ghaziabad district, which also include diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years. “The decision will certainly help in compliance of the tribunal’s orders and will also help in reducing air pollution levels, which generally run high during the winter season. Apart from cancellation of registration, the department should initiate regular drives to seize such vehicles if found plying on roads. Likewise, special drives should also be initiated to check if owners of valid vehicles have proper pollution under control (PUC) certificates,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.Residents meanwhile said that for past several years, more and more residents are using their own vehicles.“The situation has come as there is no proper government-run city-bus service or intra-city transport mode which people can use on a daily basis. As a result, people prefer to use their own vehicles and this is why the number of registered vehicles has risen. However, this has also given rise to air pollution due to emission from vehicles,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of the apartment owners’ federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-registration-of-79-000-old-vehicles-cancelled-for-not-adhering-to-ngt-norms/story-1tcBVOqdCgKdWlFpSfEpDI.html
05-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad MP to take up financial issues of proposed government hospital in trans-Hindon area with CM Adityanath||Ghaziabad MP Gen (retd) VK Singh on Sunday said that he will talk to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to expedite the proposed government hospital in trans-Hindon area. Under the proposal sent to the state health department earlier in August, the district health department had selected two chunks of land in Vasundhara for the hospital. Singh had initiated deliberations for the hospital in 2018 as there was no government healthcare facility for the trans-Hindon area, estimated to have a population of about 1 million. Two land chunks belonging to UP Avas Vikas Parishad, were identified -- one in sector-6 (7,492 square metres) and the other in sector-3 (5232 square metres) -- for the project. The major issue is of funds -- estimated at ₹140 crore for both. In their proposal, the district health department requested the land on concessional rate. But there has been no development since.“I will be holding discussions with the chief minister to resolve the financial aspects and it is possible that the funds can be paid through book transfer between the government departments. I assure residents that the process will be initiated soon and all pending issues will be resolved,” Gen Singh said on Sunday during his visit to Ghaziabad. The trans-Hindon areas comprise localities like Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Kaushambi and Sahibabad, among others. “The land in sector 6 is proposed to be the hospital, while the one at sector-3, 1.5 km away, will have residential complex for doctors and health care staff,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. An official of the UP Avas Vikas Parishad said that existing government orders allowed them to give land for free only to fire station and police station. “The average rate of the two land chunks is about ₹1.10 lakh per square metres. We have government order that free of cost land is given only in case of fire station and police station,” said the official. “The UP Avas Vikas Parishad has powers to give land at concessional rate.” In absence of any government hospital, the residents of trans-Hindon are dependent on paid treatment at private hospitals and many even go to Delhi. “A government hospital has been a long pending demand of residents of trans-Hindon. The need is felt more in present times of the pandemic as patients have to foot huge bills for treatment in private sector while many also go to Delhi for treatment. If the proposal goes through and project gets a sanction, it will be a huge relief for common man here,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of the federation of association of apartment owners. The two nearest government hospitals of MMG District Hospital and the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital are located at a distance of about 10-12km from trans-Hindon areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-mp-to-take-up-financial-issues-of-proposed-government-hospital-in-trans-hindon-area-with-cm-adityanath/story-1veQEdXuAi0NO2ABpOnCxJ.html

05-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Over 500 Congress workers booked for protest on DND Flyway||Noida Police has registered a case against 502 Congress party workers for protesting on the DND Flyway on Saturday during the Covid-19 pandemic. The party workers had gathered to support Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and her brother former party chief Rahul Gandhi who were going to meet the family of the Hathras gangrape victim. RK Singh, station house officer of Sector 20 police station, said a case has been registered against two named – Congress Gautam Budh Nagar district president Manoj Chaudhury and Noida Congress presidentShahabuddin, and 500 unnamed Congress party workers under Indian penal codes sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), among others and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Chaudhury, however, said he was not at the DND Flyway as police had had him under house arrest on Saturday. Shahabuddin said that he had attended the protest on Saturday. “We had gathered to demand justice for the gang-rape victim. The government is scared of the Congress party and hence they have filed an FIR against us,” he said.Police said they are investigating Chaudhary’s claim of being under house arrest.In the FIR, SHO RK Singh, who is also the complainant, said that around 500 Congress party workers had gathered at the DND Flyway without informing the police and protested against the Uttar Pradesh government. “The protesters were informed by police that visiting Hathras in large numbers will affect law and order situation, but they did not agree to leave. The party workers did not follow Covid–19 guidelines, and a large number of them were without masks. They also flouted social distancing norms. Section 144 (prohibitory orders) of CrPc was in force in the district at the time and was violated,” he said. Singh added that to ensure peace and enforcement of law and order situation, the police did not arrest any Congress leader/worker on Saturday.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi had reached the DND Flyway with a number of party workers at 3pm. After much negotiation, five persons -- including the Gandhi siblings were allowed police to cross DND Flyway and meet the kin of victim who was gang-raped and murdered. This was their second attempt to meet the victim’s family. On Thursday, Noida Police had detained as they were walking to Hathras after their vehicles were stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-over-500-congress-workers-booked-for-protest-on-dnd-flyway/story-xTol9UA1kT8diQayRDnq8J.html
05-10-2020||City||Cop from Maharashtra faces inquiry for asking ‘objectionable questions’ to mother of suicide victim||Assistant inspector Deepak Girkar from Tulinj police station is facing inquiry after the mother of a 19-year-old suicide victim from Nallasopara (East) alleged that he asked her “objectionable questions” while probing her daughter’s rape case. The teen allegedly ended her life on Friday night. The police filed an accidental death report (ADR) and began probe. “The victim, who stayed at Ansari Nagar, was in love with a mineral water company employee named Sunil Mane, 28. As the girl’s parents opposed their relationship, the couple eloped from their homes in August. The girl’s mother then registered a missing complaint with Tulinj police,” said Vijaykant Sagar, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar (MBVV) police commissionerate. A month later, after knowing about the couple’s whereabouts, the girl’s parents agreed to get them married. “But Mane would give excuses and kept delaying the marriage. The victim’s mother then registered a case of rape against Mane on September 29 at Tulinj police station. He was arrested and sent to judicial custody,” said Sagar. After the incident came to light, the victim and her mother were subjected to humiliation by people in their vicinity. The victim’s mother approached Girkar to file a complaint against the people who mocked her and her daughter. “During questioning, Girkar allegedly asked inappropriate questions to the mother, following which she approached me to complain against Girkar and demanded his immediate suspension as she believed he was siding with the people in her vicinity,” said Sagar. On Friday night, unable to bear the humiliation, the teen allegedly ended her life, said Sagar. On Saturday morning, her mother refused to take her body from a civic hospital after post-mortem and demanded action against Girkar. “After I convinced her that an inquiry has already been initiated under Ashwini Patil, deputy superintendent of police, Vasai, the body was taken for cremation late on Saturday night,” said Sagar. Meanwhile, Chitra Kishor Wagh, vice-president, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Maharashtra, met Sagar on Sunday to discuss the issue. “I demanded that action be taken against Girkar and also against the people who made the victim and her mother go through humiliation. As the new MBVV commissionerate has come into force on October 1, I have demanded the recruitment of more women police officers. In one month alone, 100 rape and 200 molestation cases have been registered in Vasai-Virar region and hence more women officers are needed for such cases,” said Wagh. She also said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must control crimes against women in the state. “Recently, after the Hathras incident of Uttar Pradesh (UP) came to light, he said crimes against women will not be tolerated in Maharashtra. Vasai-Virar has reported an increase in crimes against women. So he should not play the ‘Maharashtra versus UP’ card,” said Wagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cop-from-maharashtra-faces-inquiry-for-asking-objectionable-questions-to-mother-of-suicide-victim/story-OW0rct4smpuWNFmXw5isQK.html

At Chi V sector that evening, a person with an injured leg approached Raju for a ride.“The man told Raju that his mobile phone was out of charge and so he couldn’t book a cab over an app. He asked to be dropped at Dankaur railway station around 15 km away,” said Bharadwaj. The driver struck a deal for ₹300. “The man sat next to the driver. On the way, he asked him to stop the car near a kiosk and buy him some cigarettes. Noticing that the man had an injury to the leg, Raju agreed. The car stopped near the Sirsa roundabout and Raju got out to buy the cigarettes. They were going to move again when the man said he preferred another brand. Raju again went out to the kiosk but this time had not taken the key with him,” he said. In the police complaint, Raju said that when he went to exchange the cigarettes, “the man swiftly jumped to the driver’s seat and fled with the car.” The driver had two mobile phones in the taxi which were also stolen.

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Second wildlife census in Chandigarh’s Sukhna sanctuary deferred to 2021||Last carried out a decade ago, the wildlife census in the city’s Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary will have to wait another year.The UT department of forest and wildlife was to carry out the second census in April this year, but the pandemic struck and the plan had to be abandoned. Consequent to the outbreak, a lockdown was imposed and the ideal season to perform a census elapsed. Confirming the development, Debendra Dalai, UT chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden, said it was tougher to spot animals in winter. “The census is season specific. We now plan to undertake the census next year, probably in March,” said Dalai.The first census exercise at the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, spread over an area of 26 square kilometre in the catchment area of the Sukhna Lake, was conducted in 2010 over three days. Experts from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, leading environmentalists, students from Panjab University’s biology and zoology department, and representatives from NGOs had participated. This year too, the department was to rope in WII.Findings of 2010 censusBy using direct evidence, including the animals and birds spotted in the area, and indirect evidence like foot-prints and animal faeces, nine species of mammals and 65 species of birds were accounted for.Sambar, spotted deer (chital), pangolin (anteater), wild boar, jackal, small Indian civet, jungle cat, porcupine, Hanuman langur, rhesus monkey, Indian hare, common mongoose and three- striped palm squirrel are some of the main animals in the sanctuary.As per the first census report prepared by WII, the estimated sambar population in the sanctuary was between 1,000 to 1,200, with an average group size between 3.39 to 10.07; peafowl population was between 900 to 1,100. Leopards were not spotted directly, though their foot marks were identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/second-wildlife-census-in-chandigarh-s-sukhna-sanctuary-deferred-to-2021/story-bU9pz195xJfzzIctgdB8uN.html
05-10-2020||Noida||Rapid antigen testing crosses 200,000, helps Ghaziabad reduce test positivity||Ghaziabad: Ghaziabad completed 200,000 tests through the rapid Covid-19 antigen kits on October 4, accounting for nearly 60% of overall testing in the district. The tests are, however, not accurate, but unlike the “gold standard” RT-PCR testing, it offers speedier results -- 30 minutes instead of days. These tests were first introduced on June 26, following which testing leapfrogged in the district. According to the official figures of the district health department, of the total 335,610 tests, rapid antigen kits share was 201,153. From March 5, when the first positive case was detected, till June 25, the district conducted 18,005 tests and recorded 1168 cases giving a test positivity rate (TPR, number of positives per 100 cases) of 6.48%. TPR has reduced rapidly since the antigen tests were introduced. On October 4, it was at 4.49%, well below the government’s target of 5%. “The use of rapid antigen kits has helped us in speedy detection of cases and this has helped us in early referral of patients for treatment at Covid facilities. As directed by the government, we are trying to conduct more of RT-PCR tests which should be about one-third of total daily testing,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “The delay in RT-PCR test results is because we have to send samples outside the district for testing due to capacity constraints, which is at at 200-250 tests per day while we are conducting more than 1500 RT-PCR tests per day with overall daily testing of 6000 samples,” said a district health officer who did not wish to be named.Experts, however, faulted the extensive use of antigen kits. “The ideal use of rapid antigen kits is in containment zones where guidelines have been issued for 100% testing. Since the rapid antigen kits are less specific than the RT-PCR test, the correct results may not be obtained. Otherwise, it helps in reducing the TRP and scale up testing figures. It is now a general trend of use of more rapid antigen kit.This way, the focus is more on quantity than quality of test,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). The extensive use of rapid antigen kits has also helped the district in increasing other numbers -- its number of tests per million per day has increased from 86.65 in July to 885.17 in September. The World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) recommendation is of 140 tests per million residents a day. Although the district has scaled its testing figures, it is still identified among the 16 districts in UP which have daily average of over 100 Covid-19 positive cases in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/rapid-antigen-testing-crosses-200-000-helps-ghaziabad-reduce-test-positivity/story-SepWzIU7Ovlm3PhP8ztBAP.html
05-10-2020||Delhi||Mercury drops, Delhi’s air begins to worsen||The Capital is inching towards an air pollution spike, with winds slowing down and the mornings getting colder. On Sunday morning for instance, winds in the city were calm and the minimum temperature was 18.5°C, three degrees below normal.The wind speed picked up to 12kmph only by noon, according to the regional weather forecasting centre. Air quality in the national capital begins to dip from October onwards every year, when temperatures begin to dip, winds slow down, and farmers in neighbouring states begin to burn crop stubble, smoke from which travels towards the city.According to the air quality early warning system under the Union ministry of earth sciences, air quality is likely to be ‘moderate’ (when the AQI is between 101 and 200) on October 5 and 6. However, it also noted that stubble fire points have been observed over Punjab, adjoining Pakistan, Haryana, as well as Uttar Pradesh, and are increasing over time — conditions that may adversely impact Delhi and the National Capital Region’s air quality. Winds in this region travel mainly from the northwest at this time.Also Read: EPCA asks agencies to jointly patrol industrial areas to check pollutionCurrently, the northwesterly winds travel at speeds of up to 14kmph and skies are mainly clear.“Nights and early mornings are getting colder, and wind speeds are reducing in the evening and early morning. We are expecting minimum temperature to hover around 18 to 19°C, but maximum temperatures will be moderate, around 35 to 36°C. Pollutants do not disperse easily when winds slow down,” explained Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre. He last week told HT that “there are clear skies now after the monsoon has withdrawn so day temperatures are high, but the heat is radiated back, so nights are cooler. The wind direction has changed from easterly during monsoon to north-westerly so the winds are blowing from the colder regions such as Jammu and Kashmir; Himachal Pradesh etc. If there is any rain or snow there due to western disturbance, it will get colder.”The air quality index (AQI) on Sunday was 184 in the “moderate” category. The ventilation index was approximately 12,500m2/s on Sunday. The ventilation index is a product of average wind speed and mixing height, and a value on the scale lower than 6,000m2/s, with average wind speeds lower than 10kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). A large number of crop stubble fires were seen in satellite images over northwestern India on October 3 and 4.“As soon as we have a recommendation from the member secretary of the CPCB, the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) will kick in. We will immediately issue orders,” said Bhure Lal, Chairman of Environment Pollution Control Authority (Epca).Also Read: Centre convenes meeting to review anti-pollution steps“State governments will have to take action on crop stubble burning. There are both in-situ and ex-situ options available to manage straw. The Centre has given funds to subsidise stubble management machinery. Subsidy of 50% is being offered to individuals who buy the machine and 80% to cooperative societies or panchayats. We have suggested that the small and marginal farmers get the machinery at concessional rates — almost free,” he added.Grap, drawn up in 2017, defines specific measures to tackle different levels of air pollution. The Supreme Court-mandated Epca is in charge of enforcing the Grap measures.When air quality hits ‘poor’ levels, under Grap, garbage burning is monitored and fines are levied on those caught burning garbage, apart from measures to control dust, increased focus on polluting industries, and others.Meanwhile Citizens for Clean Air, a group of citizens, environmentalists, waste management experts wrote to EPCA appealing that it issue advisories or orders prohibiting the sale and use of firecrackers during the pandemic as it could aggravate public health issues, including Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mercury-drops-delhi-s-air-begins-to-worsen/story-FNgrGPRkeTM1PrkMKYWdeO.html

The city and suburbs could expect cloudy conditions with the possibility of light rain on Monday, the weather bureau said. On October 13, 2011, Mumbai had received 71mm rainfall, while 140.8mm rain was recorded on October 4, 1988, which is the all-time high 24-hour monthly rain. The weather bureau had issued a yellow alert for Saturday and as per its prediction, the city witnessed thunderstorms during evening and late night. On Saturday, dense cloud cover from 5.30 pm onwards over parts of Kalyan followed by rain moved over parts of Navi Mumbai, Thane, Mumbai suburbs and finally to south Mumbai, with intense rain spells across isolated areas and wind speed ranging between 30-35 kilometres per hour (kmph). The Santacruz weather observatory – representative of the city and the suburbs – recorded 55.8mm rain over 24 hours, ending 8.30am Sunday, which is the second highest 24-hour October rain in a decade and highest since 2011. The Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 15mm rain between 8.30am Saturday and 8.30am Sunday. Many areas in the suburbs, south-central Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan received overnight rainfall between 70mm and 100mm. However, no rain was recorded between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm on Sunday. Location-wise, maximum rainfall over 15 hours (5.30pm Saturday and 8.30am Sunday) was recorded at Malad (106.6mm), Dahisar (103mm), Ram Mandir-Goregaon (94.5mm), Mira Road (84.5mm), Borivli (76.8mm), Andheri (72.8mm), Bhandup (69mm) and Powai (64mm). All these locations received ‘heavy rainfall’. “Mumbai witnessed two distinct events of thunderstorms, with lightning associated with intense spells of rains. One was from 5pm to 8pm on Saturday and the other early in the morning between 3.30am and 5am on Sunday,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The woman suffered serious head injuries and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital, where her condition is ‘stable’, according to the police. Four suspects, three of whom work with a food delivery service company, were arrested on Sunday morning, said police. Police said the incident took place around 1.30am when the woman, who lives in Delhi, was standing near Sikanderpur Metro station. Quoting her statement, the police said that she met a man and after a brief conversation, she agreed to accompany him on his motorcycle to an office in DLF phase 2, where he worked as a helper and cleaner. According to the police, when she reached there, three friends of the helper were already present. Police said, quoting the victim’s statement, that seeing so many men she felt uncomfortable and tried to leave but the accused forced themselves upon her and assaulted her. She alleged that the four men raped her and when she resisted, they thrashed her. As per her statement to the police, she was punched and kicked multiple times and her head was smashed against the wall and the floor. Police said after sexually assaulting her, the four accused left her stranded on the road, locked the office and escaped on motorcycles. Some private security guards called the police after they noticed the victim while she was profusely bleeding from the head and in a disoriented state. A police team reached the spot and rushed her to a private hospital in DLF phase 2. After preliminary treatment, she was referred to the civil hospital. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), DLF, said, “She suffered head injuries mainly and was bleeding. Since no neurosurgeon was available at the time at the civil hospital, she was taken to a private hospital in Sector 38 for treatment. Her condition is stable. She is conscious and has recorded her statement. She has alleged that she was raped by four men, who beat her up when she tried to resist. We have contacted her family and a team has gone to Delhi to inform them.” Goel said based on the information given by the victim, the police arrested all suspects on Sunday morning.

05-10-2020||Delhi||As complaints mount, Delhi govt ropes in SIAM to streamline HSRP process||After being flooded with complaints of a shortage of high-security registration plates (HSRPs) with automobile dealers despite vehicle owners being given appointments for its collection, the Delhi government on Sunday said it will fix accountability and streamline the process by roping in Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), a national body representing vehicle manufacturers.“We have received a lot of negative feedback from vehicle owners who claim they were given appointments but not given the high-security number plates by dealers when they landed up at their outlets. Clearly, there seems to be some lack of coordination between the OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and dealers, which is resulting in the mismanagement,” Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.To resolve these issues, Gahlot said he has convened a high-level meeting on Tuesday, which is to be attended by automobile OEMs and HSRP manufacturers.“Members of SIAM will also attend the meeting, as the plan is to hand over the task of coordination between the OEMs and the dealers to the organisation. A system will be worked on where dealers will have to inform the vehicle owner through a text message or phone call in case the HSRP is not ready at the time the appointment has been fixed,” the minister said.Over the past one week, scores of vehicle owners in Delhi have faced a harrowing time in getting HSRPs affixed in their two-wheelers and cars. The problem persisted on Sunday as well with people complaining that even after a wait of over one hour at the dealer’s outlet, they had to return without the new number plates.Dilkhush Nandi, an IT professional living in Kalindi Kunj, blamed HSRP manufacturer Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited for the mismanagement.“Rosmerta is making a fool of people. They are giving out appointment slots, but not handing over the number plates to the dealers. Even their helpline doesn’t work. Accountability should be fixed and the defaulting company should be penalised,” he said. Another vehicle owner said the website for HSRP bookings was not accepting his car’s registration number.Mahesh Malhotra, a senior official with Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited, however, denied these allegations. “There were some teething issues that people faced when the process started five days after the transport department issued the public notice on September 22. But it has been streamlined now. If there are any more complaints, we will look into them, but the problem should mostly be at the dealers’ end,” he said.“My car has a high security number plate installed since I purchased it in 2017. So, I tried to book the sticker only option from the website using my current HSRP number plate. The website said these numbers did not exist, forcing me to book for a new plate again. This has been faced by other users as well. Either Rosmerta, or the transport authorities have not linked them to earn Rs 500 more per driver or the HSRPs issued previously were all fake,” said a car owner who did not wish to be named.Another vehicle owner, S Kapur, said those who own Chevrolet or Hindustan Motors (HM) vehicles have been left in the lurch, because there are no dealers to offer HSRPs to them, since the companies have wound up operations.“Chevrolet-make cars have been completely kept out of this system. Even the website does not give an option for these brands on the home page. Rosmerta’s helpline does not work and no dealer is willing to give me a HSRP,” Kapur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-complaints-mount-delhi-govt-ropes-in-siam-to-streamline-hsrp-process/story-8xAs0A6DzwlmDkhqX285OO.html

05-10-2020||City||First DU cut-off likely on October 10||New Delhi: The Delhi University will announce its first cut-off on October 10, two days ahead of the commencement of the admission process on October 12, university officials said Sunday.In the admission schedule for the 2020-21 academic session released last month, the university had said that admissions under first cut-off would be conducted from October 12, and the first cut-off would be announced on October 11. The admission process in DU has been delayed by over three months this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, the first cut-off list was announced on June 28.Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai on Sunday said that though admissions will start on October 12, the varsity is keen on releasing cut-offs by October 10, due to the change in admission process this time.“Since the admissions are being conducted completely online for the first time, applicants should get enough time to think and discuss about the colleges or the courses they want to opt for. We will request principals to give us the cut-offs well in time so that we can release the lists earlier. We are trying to release the first list on October 10 to give applicants enough time,” she said.The admissions under the first cut-off list will be conducted between October 12 and 14. The second cut-off is scheduled to be released on October 19. There will be a three-day admission window for each cut-off. The third, fourth and fifth cut-offs are scheduled to be released on October 26, November 2 and November 9, respectively.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had shifted the entire admission process online eliminating the need for students to visit the campus. Earlier, students had to visit colleges to get their documents verified and complete the admission formalities. This time, the initial verification will be done online and the final check would be done by college staff, whenever campuses reopen and in-person classes commence. The university had also done away with the option of selecting courses and allowed students to be considered for all courses if they cleared the cut-offs.Former academic council member Pankaj Garg said the possibility of early cut-offs would help students. “If students get to know about the cut-off lists well in advance, it will help them to some extent while shortlisting colleges. This year, for the first time, students have not applied for specific courses so they have to choose both the college and the course. Since there is no scope for on campus counselling, students will get time to speak to more people before they make their decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-du-cut-off-likely-on-october-10/story-O6m1XwG4XAazsfELPiNYHO.html
05-10-2020||Mumbai||After steady dip, Maharashtra braces for a surge in Covid cases as eateries reopen today||For an eighth consecutive day, Maharashtra on Sunday reported less than 20,000 Covid-19 infections, with 13,702 new cases taking the tally to 1,443,409.However, despite the dip after the surge in the first three weeks of September, state officials said they were wary about a possible rise in cases over the next couple of weeks. “After inter-district movement was allowed from September 2, there was a sudden spike in the first two weeks. A similar spike is projected over the next couple of weeks after restaurants resume operations from today and running of more local trains [for essential services workers]. However, it would not be as high as last month,” an official said, on the condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal, during a press conference in Mumbai, said that they have not received a proposal from the state government to start local trains for all. There is a rising demand from political parties and various other sectors for the operation of local trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). “It is a decision to be taken by the state government. Resuming local trains is under consideration, but it may take a few more weeks,” said a state official. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, in an earlier interview to HT, had said local trains could resume from mid-October.The state on Sunday also reported 326 fatalities, taking the toll to 38,084. Mumbai clocked 2,109 fresh cases and reported 48 deaths on Sunday, taking the tally to 213,652 and toll to 9,108. Of the 326 deaths, 214 were from the past two days, 55 from the past week and 57 from the period before it, the state health department has said.Pune district remained the highest contributor at 2,343 new infections, including 1,033 in city, 814 in rural parts and 496 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The district also reported 41 fatalities, which included 25 in the city. Nashik district reported 1,034 cases and eight deaths, Nagpur 917 cases and 26 deaths, Ahmednagar 639 cases and 7 deaths, Sangli 472 cases and 14 fatalities. At 4,332 infections, nine cities in MMR and rural parts of Thane and Raigad saw a rise in its contribution to the state tally at 38.92%, up from 23-25% till last week. The state has reported a steady decline in cases over the past two weeks. The decline has been attributed to concentrated efforts in the districts where cases were high. Apart from Mumbai; Pune, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Nashik, Solapur and Jalgaon were top contributors to cases in the state. Barring Mumbai, other districts have been able to bring down the daily infection considerably. In Pune, the daily caseload dropped to 2,396 on October 3, from 4,664 four weeks ago on September 5, while Nagpur saw a drop to 631 cases, from 787 during this period. Kolhapur, Solapur and Sangli reported a decline in four weeks to 315, 338 and 205 cases from 714, 703 and 888 cases respectively. “We continuously focused on these districts with high cases over the past few weeks by closely monitoring with officials at district level. We expect the ‘My Family, My Responsibility drive’, which emphasises on behavioural communication, to help us further in early detection and early treatment, resulting in keeping mortality in check. We have also increased the daily testing to 90,000 a day, from 61,000 a few weeks ago. In Pune, our per million test rate has reached 96,000, which is even more than Mumbai’s. All these factors have helped us in bringing the growth rate down,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate.Dr Awate said that they expect daily infections to drop to the level of 6,000 cases by December-end. “Despite the unlocking rolled out this month, we expect cases to see gradual decline over the next few days after the peak reported in the past few weeks. Herd immunity, antibodies immunities developed and awareness among people are the contributing factors resulting in the decline. We have reached the juncture where the daily addition of cases is manageable,” he said.The growth rate as well as doubling rate of cases in most of the districts has improved over the past few weeks. Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation leads the chart of doubling rate with 85.47 days, while it’s fastest in Chandrapur district at 19.91 days, according to the daily report prepared by a group headed by Mumbai University economist Neeraj Hatekar.State’s recovery rate improved to 79.64%, after 15,048 new recoveries. After the recovery of 11,49603 patients, the number of active patients dropped to 255, 281. Maharashtra has 2,209,696 people under home quarantine and 27,939 institutionally quarantined. 75,908 tests were conducted in last 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 18.05%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-steady-dip-maharashtra-braces-for-a-surge-in-covid-cases-as-eateries-reopen-today/story-g97n6e2MI3lgUjV0043FfK.html

05-10-2020||City||Former MP tweets photo of burns on hand after being stamped at Delhi airport||New Delhi: Former Member of Parliament and national spokesperson for Congress Madhu Goud Yaskhi on Sunday said he has sustained skin burns and infection from the indelible ink used for stamping international passengers on arrival at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport.Yaskhi was stamped when he arrived at the airport from New York, on Saturday, to catch a connecting flight to Hyderabad.Currently, all the international passengers arriving at the Delhi airport who are approved for home quarantine are stamped by the officials of their respective states. All those who are to be quarantined in Delhi are stamped by Delhi government’s health department.An official from the airport said it is being looked into if Yaskhi was stamped by Delhi government health department officials or by his Telangana state health department officials.At present, all international passengers arriving Delhi need to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine. However, passengers can apply for an exemption from institutional quarantine by uploading their recent COVID-19 negative report on Delhi airports portal Air Suvidha ahead of their flight. Once approved, the passengers will only require home quarantine. Passengers can also get themselves tested for COVID-19 upon their arrival at the Delhi airport and if found negative may head straight for home quarantine. Yaskhi, who had arrived at the IGI airport around 12pm on Saturday had to board a connecting flight to Hyderabad. Before he headed for his flight, he was stamped on his left arm and was to undergo home quarantine in Hyderabad.“The moment I was stamped I started feeling itchy. I thought it was normal. By 4.15pm when my flight took off, the irritation grew and I felt a burning sensation. Gradually, it turned black and it became intolerable,” he said.After reaching Hyderabad, Yaskhi said he immediately contacted one of his dermatologist friends for medical advice. “My doctor told me that gradually my skin will peel off and that complete recovery may take more than a month,” he said.Yakshi, a former MP from Nizamabad constituency in Telangana, tweeted on a picture of his hand on Sunday, tagging Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri and asking him to look into the matter.Yaskhi tweeted, “Dear @HardeepSPuri Ji, can you please look into the chemical being used at Delhi airport for stamping on passengers coming from abroad? Yesterday I was stamped at @DelhiAirport and this is how my hands look now.”Responding to his tweet, Puri wrote, “Thank you for drawing my attention to this. A have spoken to CMD AAI.”Yaskhi said he tweeted the picture to bring this to everyone’s attention and to ensure that no other passenger goes through the same experience.DIAL, the Delhi airport operator, also responded to Yakshi’s tweet. “We deeply regret the inconvenience caused. The ink used for stamping is a standard indelible ink. We’ve reported the issue to the Delhi State Authorities. Currently, this batch of ink is being kept aside for testing by the supplier and further desired action. Thank you for highlighting this issue.”Officials from the Union health ministry did not respond to calls, texts or emails. When contacted, Delhi government also did not comment on the matter.Somesh Gupta, a dermatologist at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) said such it could be a case of dermatitis. “If you apply any dye, it may react with skin. Stamping in this way is not a good practise. They must find a substitute like in AIIMS they put a paper band on the wrists for identification,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-mp-tweets-photo-of-burns-on-hand-after-being-stamped-at-delhi-airport/story-kRch5wD4JQuSpQWW8FOtiM.html
05-10-2020||Delhi||BJP leaders start outreach programmes on new farm bills||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Delhi unit on Sunday organised an outreach programme to tell farmers about the new laws passed by the Parliament—three farm bills.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, some MPs, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and other party leaders held public meetings in villages to highlight the benefits of the decision taken by the Narendra Modi government.While addressing a meeting in Pooth Khurd in Bawana, Gupta hit out at the ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi for opposing the bill and said that they have not done anything for the farmers of Delhi.“You had promised that farmers in Delhi will get the status of farmers so that they can avail the benefits like all other farmers in the county. But Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal failed to deliver on his promise. Farmers don’t have the permission to dig borewell for irrigation. They don’t get any subsidy on the equipment used in farming, just like other farmers in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This is what Delhi government has done for them,” said Gupta. BJP MLA and LOP Bidhuri said that the opposition parties are trying to misguide the farmers. “The system of minimum support price (MSP) will continue and government procurement of food grains from farmers will be done in the mandis as before. Not only this, the government has also ensured that the price of the crop of the farmer should be paid in just three days,” he said at the meeting organised in his constituency.BJP MPs Ramesh Bidhuri, Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, Meenakshi Lekhi, Gautam Gambhir and Manoj Tiwari, former Delhi BJP chief, held meetings in their respective constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-leaders-start-outreach-programmes-on-new-farm-bills/story-6E4lBinPEk5kMDmbaJVCZI.html
05-10-2020||Delhi||Covid positive prisoner who fled police custody arrested again||A month after a 33-year-old man escaped from Delhi police’s custody while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a city hospital, police on Friday claimed that the man had been tracked and rearrested. The man, investigators said, is involved in multiple cases of murders, attempts to murder, robbery, dacoity and kidnappings. The suspect is even said to have opened fire at the police party that had gone to arrest him on Friday, senior officers said.The arrested man was identified as Soni alias Mehtab, a resident of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. Police have recovered a semi-automatic pistol from his possession.According to the police, Mehtab had escaped from custody on September 18 from LNJP hospital, where he was undergoing treatment for Covid-19. Police said, after fleeing, Mehtab had been living in a rented house in Sonia Vihar.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said since his escape, police had been conducting raids at all of Mehtab’s possible hideouts. “On Thursday, we received information that he will come to Khajuri Khas to meet his associate. A raid was conducted at 7.30 am and he was asked to surrender. but he took out a pistol and opened fire at the police. He was later overpowered and arrested. No one was injured in the firing,” Kushwah said.Police said Mentab had on September 14 been arrested in case of theft at Rajiv Chowk Metro police station and was sent to Tihar, where he tested positive for Covid-19.

05-10-2020||Delhi||DDA works on plan to give Dwarka a facelift||Dwarka, one of the three sub-cities developed three decades ago, is in for a revamp with the Delhi Development Authority working on a plan to resolve issues of traffic congestion, lack of commercial spaces and poor last mile connectivity. DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said the authority will integrate various infrastructure projects being taken up in the sub city that in different stages of planning and implementation for better coordination and “holistic development”.Dwarka, which has a population of over 1.2 million, was planned in the late 80s to “accommodate Delhi’s changing requirements”. It was projected as the “sub-city for the 21st century”. Narela and Rohini were also developed with the same promise. Even though Dwarka has emerged as a residential hub, lack of adequate transport and civic infrastructure are major problems that residents face.  Jain said DDA is working on a strategy to revamp Dwarka. “A comprehensive strategic plan is being prepared for Dwarka to make it sustainable, pedestrian and cycle friendly, and improve the quality of life of people residing here. The aim is to have a unified vision for holistic development of the sub-city. We are in the process of finalising the details of various projects,” he said.To address the problem of traffic congestion, one of the most pressing concerns of the residents, the land-owning agency has roped in the School of Planning and Architecture, which is expected to provide short-term and long-term solutions.Despite Metro connectivity, last mile connectivity is poor and there are fewer local transport options. With most residents depending on private vehicles, traffic congestion is a big problem here. The three main entry points — Dwarka Road (from National Highway-8 side), Sector 21-Dwarka Link road (Urban Extension Road-II) and Dabri Mor — get choked during peak hours. The Sector 21-Dwarka link road, used by Gurugram-bound traffic from north Delhi, Najafgarh and West Delhi is jam-packed during the morning hours. At Dabri Mor, encroachment on the main road slows traffic.Jain said, “One of the most important projects is to improve the connectivity of the sub-city with the rest of the city. Measures are being taken to decongest the township by improving road intersections, traffic and parking management. The School of Planning and Architecture is preparing a comprehensive mobilty plan for Dwarka. Short and long-term measures for improvement of inter and intra-city connectivity are being envisaged.”The DDA plans to redevelop the area around two of its important trunk drains-- TD 2 and TD5—as greenways and theme parks. A senior DDA official, aware of the development, said that there is a plan to develop walkways, cycle tracks, cafes and waterfront along TD-2. “The plan is in a nascent stage, but the idea is to develop a recreational zone for people. The work on Bharat Vandana park is already going on,” said the official. In its effort to improve the last mile connectivity, Jain said that the DDA plans to develop “70-km cycle tracks”. The work on developing the tracks is going on in Sector 11-14.Anuj Malhotra, knowledge partner to the high-powered committee under the ministry of home affairs, said there is a demand for cycling in the sub-city. “Dwarka has a great grid system of roads which is conducive to cycling. In 9-10min one can cover a distance of 3 kilometres. In our Dwarka survey, done five years back, we found that a majority of trips were educational and for work and that they were within 5-km distance. They can be covered within 20 minutes. The unused bus lane on Dwarka roads can be demarcated by tactile urbanism method (placing bollards), overnight, to make about 30km of cycle lanes in a matter of 2-3 days,” he said.Residents say that infrastructure development is the need of the hour, but they want DDA to develop the plan in consultation with the people. Rejimon CK, founder of Dwarka Forum, said, “There is a huge gap in DDA’s planning and execution. The DDA came up with the street design guidelines in 2011, but the roads developed by it do not conform to the guidelines. There is a huge mismatch in planning and execution. Before finalising the plan, they should consult people.”Former DDA planning commission AK Jain, who was involved in the planning of the sub-city in the 80s, said, “It is a good thing that DDA is integrating all the development projects. But with changing time, they should use the new standards of planning and execution. There is an urgent need to have an intra-subcity transport system. People currently are dependent on their personal vehicles for even short trips,”Another issue DDA is trying to address is the lack of economic development in the area. While housing came up in a big way in the sub-city, commercial sectors didn’t despite provision for planned areas. Jain said, “There was a linear commercial complex planned along the Metro corridor. The DDA needs to relook at its auction policy for commercial spaces to promote commercial activity. Currently, a majority of people travel from Dwarka to other parts of the city for work.”A senior DDA official said that there is a plan to dispose of commercial plots and develop a socio culture centre in Sector 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dwarka-set-for-a-revamp/story-m8BnC9EADwj5ZCymIKh5mO.html
05-10-2020||Mumbai||3-way fight between Sena, Congress-NCP and BJP for Mumbai civic committee polls||The elections for the chairpersonship of several committees of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expected to witness a three-way fight between the Shiv Sena, the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The elections to the chairpersons’ post will begin from Monday for the standing committee which has financial powers; the improvements’ committee that deals with land leases and other city properties; the education committee which handles primary and secondary education in Mumbai; and the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) committee. The members of the committees (except for BEST) are elected from among the elected corporators, who then elect the chairpersons. In the case of BEST, non-elected persons can also be nominated by the parties. Currently, all these committees are dominated by the Sena and the party is likely to retain hold in the elections, as it has majority of members in the panels. The Congress-NCP was expecting control of at least one committee each in return for their support to the Sena in the state government. The Sena, Congress and NCP have formed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance to govern the state and have been discussing possibility of contesting the Mumbai civic polls together in 2022. However, the three parties are far from reaching any similar consensus for the BMC, which is the governing body for the megalopolis. The Shiv Sena does not have a clear majority in the civic body, but it is not willing to share power with the Congress-NCP, which are in the Opposition. The Sena has 97 elected representatives in the civic house of 227, and is short of 17 representatives for securing a simple majority of 114. However, it has managed to remain in power as the Opposition is divided. The Congress has 29 representatives, while the NCP has eight. The Shiv Sena does not wish to dilute its hold over one of the richest civic bodies in the country and has decided to field its candidates for all the committees. With 83 seats in the corporation, the BJP is the second largest party and is also in the Opposition. The party has maintained that it will field candidates for all committees and is considering all its options. Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and member of the standing committee, said, “We are fielding candidates for all the committees as we are the second largest party and the Opposition in true nature.” The Congress has also announced to contest for all committees. It has claimed the support of the NCP and the Samajwadi Party (SP), which has six elected representatives. Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is the leader of Opposition in the BMC, said, “We are in the Opposition and we will field our candidates for all the committees. We have support of the NCP and the SP, and we are not seeking support of any other party.” The other smaller parties include All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) with two representatives and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) with one corporator. The representation for each party to these committees is given based on the strength of the party’s elected corporators. The members have a two-year tenure, while the chairpersons will have a tenure of one year. Meanwhile last week, Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav, who is also the sitting chairman of BMC’s standing committee from the past two years, filed his nomination for a third term. Sandhya Doshi, Sena’s corporator from Gorai, has filed her nomination for the education committee chairperson’s post. BJP has fielded Colaba corporator Makrand Narvekar for the standing committee chairperson’s post, while Kandivli corporator Surekha Patil is pitted against Doshi. From the Congress, Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria will contest for the standing committee, while Chembur corporator Sangita Handore is the party candidate for education committee chairperson’s post. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said, “It is highly unlikely that there will be any cross-voting, wherein Congress will get votes from the BJP. However, despite not having majority, the Congress may be fielding its candidate to stay relevant politically. The BJP is fielding candidates because it has to be active, being the second largest party in the BMC.” Jondhale added, “Whether the MVA parties will fight the 2022 BMC elections together or not will also depend on how sustainable their alliance is in the state. If they don’t fight together, it may also mean that Shiv Sena does not want to share power with anyone when it comes to BMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-way-fight-between-sena-congress-ncp-and-bjp-for-mumbai-civic-corporation-committee-polls/story-KKrfjBN5BMrnHpVUJfOIGK.html
05-10-2020||Pune||Katraj-Kondhwa road project faces land acquisition issues||The Katraj-Kondhwa road project is facing delays due to the resistance from residents of Sundarban and few other societies to not give up land. According to Vijay Kulkarni, chief engineer, road department Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), a portion of the land is still to be acquired. “70 per cent land is acquired while 30 per cent is still remaining. It will be completed soon. The pandemic was also one of the reasons for the delay,” Kulkarni said. The 3.5 kms Katraj-Kondhwa road is to be constructed between Rajas society chowk and Khadi machine chowk by the civic body to address traffic congestion in the area. The PMC has planned three grade separators and two vehicle underpasses on the stretch. The project cost is ₹225 crore. The stone laying ceremony of the project was held on November 2, 2018 in the presence of Devendra Fadnavis, former Maharashtra chief minister, but the project has hit a snail’s pace since then. “The work from Kondhwa is going at a good speed while we are facing hurdles in Katraj from societies like Sundarban and a few more. Where the land has been acquired, the work has started,” said Rajabhau Kadam, husband of corporator Manisha Kadam. From the beginning, the Katraj-Kondhwa road project has faced many hurdles as the PMC scrapped the tendering process four times because it felt the bids received were inflated. “The residents are asking for land in place of land, or too much cash for land. The PMC is ready to provide them flats but they are not ready to budge,” said Kadam. “We have no idea whether this road will be broadened or not. It is not only my shop but many shops which fall under the same lane, I don’t think the project will continue,” said the owner of Balaji Grocery shop. A group of youngsters were spotted playing cricket on the concrete slab laid for road work on the Katraj-Kondhwa stretch. “We have been playing cricket here since the last two months and work is going on at a very slow speed ahead in the same lane,” said Sudhakar Shinde, who was playing cricket with his friends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/future-of-katraj-kondhwa-road-uncertain-as-acquisition-issues-plague-project/story-fm2TgUsSwX2bHZk2BM087H.html

Around 200 parents participated in Sunday’s protest. The demands of the protesting parents were officially sent in a demand letter on August 10 by the parents’ group. “Schools are ignoring parents’ demands and are forcing them to pay fees on the pretext of online education. Considering the given Covid situation, the schools are not giving us any attention. Parents are forced to come onto the streets in protest. Parents from various schools participated in this protest. Our demand is an immediate ordinance regarding fee regulation,” said Mukund Kirday, coordinator, Pune Parents United. “The demand to cut down fees is totally reasonable as expenses on gymnasiums, labs, school lunches, transport, examinations and repairs are saved. Why should parents pay for these? Barring the expenses related to salaries of teachers and non-teaching staff, other expenses have not incurred. In some schools these expenses (apart from salaries) constitute almost 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the total expenses,” he claimed. “During this Covid pandemic everyone is hit hard financially. In such circumstances private schools can’t be thinking of maximising profit. All private schools, like Ryan in our case, shall only charge for online classes. As all other facilities are not being used, these charges should be skipped. School-management says there are no-clear guidelines from government about reducing fees hence they won’t reduce fees. We as parents fail to understand why the government can’t make a decision on this topic,” said Aarti Mahajan, a parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-parents-unite-to-seeks-school-fee-legislation-protest-held-in-city/story-dD5b5vEx5UHGB6dS77Rv2M.html
05-10-2020||Pune||Maratkar murder case: Four more in Pune police net||The Pune police, on Sunday, made four more arrests and called in two more persons for questioning in the case of the murder of Shiv Sena youth wing leader Deepak Maratkar (36), who was stabbed to death in Budhwar peth on Friday. While the four arrests on Sunday were made by the Faraskhana police station, the two others have been detained by the Pune police crime branch unit 1, for questioning. The four arrested have been identified as Rohit Kshirsagar, Sunny Kamble, Rohit Kamble and Rahul Ragir; while the identity of the two others detained by the crime branch officials has been kept under wraps. “The four we have arrested are prime suspects in the role of assailants who did the stabbing. They will be presented in court on Monday for custody. The role of the two brought in by the crime branch is yet to be ascertained,” said senior inspector Jahgannath Kalaskar of the Faraskhana police station. Maratkar was stabbed by five bike-borne assailants on Friday morning in Budhwar peth. He was found to have been stabbed 47 times as per information shared by the police after a post-mortem was conducted. The three people in police custody till October 6 were identified as Ashwini Kamble, Sunny Kolte and Mahendra Saraf, according to the police. Kamble and the deceased had been in a feud since the 2017 local elections when they were pitted against each other from their own parties. Both lost the election that year. Maratkar and Kamble had been at loggerheads ever since, according to the police. Saraf, who is a former Shiv Sena member, has had his own qualms with Maratkar since 1998, according to the police. Maratkar is the son of Vijay Maratkar, a two-time former corporator who recently died while being tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-more-arrests-in-maratkar-murder-case/story-PQJuZ7F6G22lznc6qEWvYK.html

05-10-2020||City||Digital shows offer hope to performing artistes of Rambo circus||Life came to a standstill for Biju Pushkaran ( 51), the head clown of Rambo Circus, along with other artistes of the circus as the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown left them with no source of income.“Our lives were shattered by Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown as it led to the closure of our shows and it affected more than 100 artistes. But now as the shows have started streaming online I feel optimistic and we will revive soon,” said Pushkaran.The shows have started streaming online from September 25. The crew members who were otherwise feeling dejected during the lockdown after the tents were folded believe that the virtual screening of pre-recorded videos has revived their hopes of surviving in the circus industry.The online circus fund-raising show was christened as ‘’Life Is A Circus’’ and it was organised in association with LaQshya Live Experiences and Production Crew Entertainment. The circus administration is contemplating to conduct more live shows on the Internet aimed at wider dissemination of the message of the circus and generate public interest in their contributions to society.”We are missing the real-life fun of meeting children, taking selfies with them and also shaking hands as part of goodwill gesture. All these have become memories and we get nostalgic about the recent past,” said one of the circus clowns.Pushkaran said, “Initially we thought that the lockdown would get over soon, but the restrictions are still in place. Many of our artistes are also in different parts of the state and are even facing a financial crisis. But things have just started to be better with each day,” he explained.Pushkaran thanked local politicians and social groups for lending a helping hand in providing the artistes with necessities during the tough times.“My wife and children who are in Kerala faced a tough time during the lockdown and I almost used up all my savings. The pandemic has affected people across all sectors,” he said.“Initially I was disappointed and lost hope, but things have started improving,” he said.Pushkaran explained that the circus management was approached by a production crew for online shows after which shooting for the virtual shows started and it generated a good response from the audience.On the first day of the shooting, Pushakaran was caught with fright before the camera. “ We are used to the physical experience of touch during live shows and digital medium is completely new for us, ” he says.Pushkaran who has worked as a circus clown for 21 years said that he was delighted to see small kids holding placards like ‘’We Love Rambo Circus’’.The online show has a feature called ‘’Meet & Greet’’ session wherein the clowns and circus artistes interact with children virtually.“During our online interaction, the children ask about our well being and our families. We were touched by this gesture,” he explained.Sujit Dilip, owner, Rambo Circus, said that online shows are garnered good response. “The circus business has taken a hit last time due to rains and this time due to the pandemic.““We had planned to introduce some changes in the circus format with the help of a Russian circus. I had gone to Germany and found that holographic animals are used instead of real animals in the circus. However, due to the current pandemic situation, all the plans are on hold,” he said.“This digital shows has given a new lease of life for all the circus crew. It is a 60-minute- pre-recorded show where all the acts were shot in the circus tent,” he said.Saurabh Khurana of LaQshya Live Experiences said, “They were working on the project with field experts and professionals for more than two months.”The show traces the journey of Rambo Circus and ends with an act dedicated to the Covid warriors for their role in mitigating the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/digital-shows-offer-hope-to-performing-artistes-of-rambo-circus/story-bMT2xW8Kui76GHt9zalV1H.html

More beds are now lying vacant and complaints regarding bed shortage have also gone down, say civic officials.According to the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) the city has a recovery rate of 86.40 per cent as out of the 1.46 lakh Covid-19 cases that were reported as of October 1, 1.26 lakh patients had recovered from the infection and 3,528 or 2.41 per cent were declared dead.Out of the 16, 369 active cases, about 56.38 per cent of the Covid positive patients are now under home isolation, 5,101 or 31.16 per cent are hospitalised in government or private hospitals and remaining 2042 or 12.47 per cent are in Covid care centres.More than half of those found positive have now opted for home isolation mainly because they are asymptomatic or do not want to be isolated at a government facility, say officials.Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The recovery rate of the city has been going up for some time now which is good news. More than 4,300 patients have been cured and discharged from civic-run Dr Naidu Hospital alone. Almost 2,400 were checked and home isolated and 25,000 patients visited OPD at the hospital.”Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “It is true that the recovery rate is going up and also the OPD cases are going down.

Now, almost after six months the local trains are resuming service on October 8 in Pune, which is a major transport mode for working people between Pune and Lonavla.An ‘action plan’ letter was sent by Pune police commissioner and the nodal officer to coordinate train operations in the region, Amitabh Gupta, to the Pune railway division. The number of passengers per local train will be reduced from 1,200 to 700 in order to maintain social distancing during travel, as per the instructions. Also a ‘QR code’ based e-pass system has been introduced for passengers which will be monitored by the IT cell of the Pune police department. People engaged in essential services will have to get the e-pass with the QR code and identity card in order to travel in the local trains. In the letter sent by Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta to Pune railway division on October 3, he has said, “Kindly find enclosed herein a detailed SOP for starting local trains in Pune Metropolitan Region prepared by us in consultation with local railway authorities based in Pune. I hereby request you to issue directions to the local railway authorities in Pune to start above stated railway service with effect from October 8.” “As per the instructions given by the Pune police commissioner we have started preparations to start the local train operations on the Pune-Lonavla route from October 8.

05-10-2020||Chandigarh||Privatisation of Citco hotels put on back burner||The proposed privatisation of the hotels run by Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation Limited (Citco) has been put on the back burner till “more appropriate” time. UT administration officials say that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, economic situation is not conducive for privatisation process to go through. Last year, UT had written to the Centre expressing its intent to ‘monetise’ hotels Mountview in Sector 10, Shivalikview in Sector 17 and Parkview in Sector 24. The letter was in response to the Union government recommending monetisation of UT’s assets with four stadiums first taken up for this purpose. But the administration considered that the Citco hotels should be privatised or their management and working outsourced. Stating that administration is keen, but current economic environment is not favourable, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “It is the proposal with the administration and we have informed the Niti Aayog about it too. The final decision is yet to be taken as it is not economically most opportune time to auction the hotels. We will wait till the economic activity becomes more favourable.” Management of Hotel Mountview and Hotel Parkview (then Chandigarh Yatri Niwas) was transferred to Citco in 1982. Initially, Mountview was run by a private group and after the company’s lease ended, the administration decided to take over the hotel. In 1988, Hotel Shivalikview (then Janta Hotel) was transferred to Citco and put in commercial use on January 1, 1990. Earlier, fund-starved Citco had made attempts to lease out its outlets with Baithak at Kalagram, Drop In at Sector 34 and Stop-N-Stare at Sector 10, but the last year was the first time when it actively considered privatisation of three major hotels. The administration had planned the process to start from Hotel Shivalikview. Monetisation in this case could mean privatisation of either the whole property or outsourcing of its management and functioning to raise revenue. The working of Citco has long been under scanner and experts in the hospitality industry have criticised it for not being run on commercial lines. Lack of operational flexibility, bureaucratic way of working, and large workforce has been touted as the reasons for sluggish performance of the public corporation. Citco has over 1,000 employees, with around 700 permanent and the remaining ones on contract. Nearly 52% of the revenue goes into paying the salary of these employees. Citco’s relationship with the administration has also been questioned. For instance, the administration is yet to pay Rs 13.43 crore it owes to Citco. Of this amount, Rs 11.71 crore is to be paid for the expenses of Citco’s canteen being run in the UT secretariat at Sector 9 and Rs 1.45 crore for expenses of Delhi guest house and cars bought by Citco for administrative use. Similarly, the money paid by the administration to Citco for certain events remains unaccounted. “After years of financial struggle, these three Citco hotels showed signs of economic gains at the end of last year but, with the Covid-19 pandemic, this recovery has come to a grinding halt,” said a senior UT official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/privatisation-of-citco-hotels-put-on-back-burner/story-HYc9hM0UKoH69PbT8ru8iJ.html

05-10-2020||World||Paris shuts bars to brake Covid-19 spread||Bars and cafes in Paris and its nearest suburbs, placed on maximum coronavirus alert Monday, will be shuttered for two weeks under new measures to slow the rapid spread of Covid-19 cases, officials said.With the rate of new infections, hospitalisations and deaths accelerating months after the lifting of a nationwide lockdown, new rules to enforce social distancing will enter into force on Tuesday.“These are braking measures because the epidemic is moving too fast,” Paris police chief Didier Lallement told journalists.France reported nearly 17,000 new coronavirus cases on Saturday alone, the highest daily number since the country began widespread testing. For Paris, the number was about 3,500 new cases every day -- with a high of nearly 6,000 recorded last Monday, said Aurelien Rousseau, director of the ARS regional health agency.- ‘Sad, and unfair’ -Bars in Paris have continued to draw large crowds of people often flouting physical distancing and mask-wearing guidelines.But some in the industry said they felt unfairly singled out.“We’re really the guardians of good behaviour, we keep an eye on our clients,” said Remi, who runs the morning shift in a cafe and restaurant in central Paris.“Everything is clean, everybody wears masks. When people entertain at home that’s when they become irresponsible. Nobody wears a mask during an evening with friends, me included,” he told AFP, declining to give his last name.Liam Porisse, co-owner of Corcoran’s, a spacious Irish pub, said revenue had already dropped 70 percent compared with pre-virus business, and his venue was losing more than 2,000 euros ($2,350) each day.“Closing down is a bit of a relief, really,” he told AFP, as he poured “a last drink” before shuttering the pub. “It’s cheaper than staying open.”Laurent, who runs a bar in Paris, said he too had been losing money for months.“I’ve kept the place open so I don’t lose clients, not to make money,” he said, “and now I’m going to lose them anyway, to restaurants.”“It’s sad, and unfair,” added Jacques, owner of another Paris bar. “Nobody thinks it’s going to be just two weeks, it’s more likely going to be a month or six weeks,” he said. “Time enough for all of us to get depressed.”Rousseau said there were 203 active coronavirus “clusters” in larger Paris.He urged inhabitants of Paris and its suburbs, which jointly form the Ile-de-France region and are home to nearly seven million people, to go back to working from home as much as possible.- ‘It’s not going to work’ -Restaurants, however, can continue to operate provided they meet stricter new conditions, Lallement said.These will include making sanitising hand gel available at each dining table, limiting patrons to six at a table with at least a metre (3.3 feet) between seats, and allowing patrons to remove their masks only for eating.“We must continually find a balance between the health of our fellow citizens and the reality and necessity of economic and social life,” Lallement said.For smaller restaurants the new rules sound like a death knell, said Michel, who owns a tiny eatery that also operates as a cafe and a bar -- depending on the time of day -- and as a tobacconist.The enforced distancing “is not going to work for small restaurants. They won’t be able to fit enough people in,” he told AFP. “Everybody is going have to crunch numbers: Is it worth staying open or not?”“I think I’m going to shut it all, except for the tobacco sales, until further notice,” he said.Rousseau said 36 percent of intensive care hospital beds in Ile-de-France are taken up by coronavirus patients -- a ratio expected to rise to 50 percent in the coming weeks.“The pressure is strong,” he said. “The point is to brake this progression.”Lallement said pools and gyms in Paris will remain off-limits except for school activities, public gatherings would be limited to ten people, and there would be a ceiling of 1,000 people on open air stadiums for sporting or cultural events.Visits to people in old-age homes may continue but only by appointment and limited to two visitors at a time.Alcohol sales after 10:00 pm will remain prohibited, as will weddings and other parties in reception halls.burs-mlr-jh/js/pma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-shuts-bars-to-brake-covid-19-spread/story-4cqOxii2PM21hA7i5IDRvJ.html
05-10-2020||World||Armenia and Azerbaijan clash as Iran works on peace plan||Armenia accused Azerbaijan of firing missiles into the capital of the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday, while Azerbaijan said several of its towns and its second-largest city were attacked.Iran, which borders both countries, said it was working on a peace plan for the decades-old conflict, which reignited last month and has killed scores of people on both sides.The region of Nagorno-Karabakh lies inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994.Armenian military officials reported missile strikes in the territorial capital of Stepanakert, which came under intense attacks all weekend. Residents told the Russian state RIA Novosti news agency that parts of the city were suffering shortages of electricity and gas after the strikes.Firefights of varying intensity “continue to rage” elsewhere in the conflict zone, Armenian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said on Facebook.Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said that while Nagorno-Karabakh’s army “confidently controls the situation” in some areas where fighting is going on, it is “very difficult” in other areas.The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, in turn, accused Armenian forces of shelling the towns of Tartar, Barda and Beylagan. Ganja, the country’s second-largest city far outside the conflict zone, also was “under fire,” officials said.Hikmet Hajiyev, aide to Azeirbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, tweeted that Armenian forces attacked “densely populated civilian areas” in Ganja, Barda, Beylagan and other towns “with missiles and rockets.”Armenia’s Foreign Ministry dismissed allegations of attacks being launched from Armenia’s territory as a “disinformation campaign” by Azerbaijan.Vahram Poghosyan, spokesman for Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader, warned via a Facebook post that the territory’s forces would target military facilities in Azerbaijani cities in response to strikes on Stepanakert and Shushi, another town in Nagorno-Karabakh.The fighting erupted Sept. 27 and has killed dozens, marking the biggest escalation in the conflict. Both sides have accused each other of expanding the hostilities beyond Nagorno-Karabakh.According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, about 220 servicemen on their side have died in the clashes since then. Eighteen civilians have been killed and 90 others wounded. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t given details about military casualties, but said 24 civilians were killed and 124 wounded.Nagorno-Karabakh was a designated autonomous region within Azerbaijan during the Soviet era. It claimed independence from Azerbaijan in 1991, about three months before the Soviet Union’s collapse. A full-scale war that broke out in 1992 killed an estimated 30,000 people.By the time the war ended in 1994, Armenian forces not only held Nagorno-Karabakh itself but also substantial areas outside the territory borders.Aliyev has repeatedly said Armenia’s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh is the sole condition to end the fighting.Armenian officials allege Turkey is involved in the conflict on the side of Azerbaijan and is sending fighters from Syria to the region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said “a cease-fire can be established only if Turkey is removed from the South Caucasus.”Turkey’s government has denied sending arms or foreign fighters, while publicly siding with Azerbaijan.On a trip to Ankara, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-country military alliance is “deeply concerned by the escalation of hostilities,” and urged Turkey to help end the fighting.“I expect Turkey to use its considerable influence to calm tensions,” Stoltenberg told reporters after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who reiterated calls for Armenia to withdraw from the region.“Everyone, and especially NATO, must make a call for Armenia to withdraw from these territories, in line with international laws, U.N. Security Council resolutions and Azerbaijan’s territorial and border integrity,” Cavusoglu said.The Foreign Ministry of Iran, which has nearly 760 kilometers (470 miles) of border with Azerbaijan and a short border with Armenia, said it is working on a peace plan.Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not elaborate but said Iran is talking to all related parties.“Iran has prepared a plan with a specific framework containing details after consultations with both sides of the dispute, Azerbaijan and Armenia, as well as regional states and neighbors, and will pursue this plan,” he said.Khatibzadeh also warned both sides against expanding the hostilities into Iranian territory.“Any aggression against the borders of the Islamic Republic, even inadvertently, is a very serious red line for the Islamic Republic that should not be crossed,” he said.Since the beginning of the conflict, stray mortar shells have injured a child and damaged some buildings in rural areas in northern Iran, near the border with Azerbaijan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-and-azerbaijan-clash-as-iran-works-on-peace-plan/story-CFSTwjMorRCbemuPoCwf3I.html
05-10-2020||World||Malaysia PM quarantines as minister tests positive for coronavirus||Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Monday he will self-quarantine after a Cabinet minister he was in contact with tested positive for the coronavirus, as cases in the country hit a record high.Muhyiddin had chaired an October 3 meeting attended by Religious Affairs Minister Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri, who confirmed Monday he has been hospitalized for treatment.The health ministry has warned that Malaysia is facing a new wave of virus cases as the outbreak has widened in recent days. New clusters have sprung up in many states amid increased travel to eastern Sabah state, a hotspot zone, for a state election last month.New virus cases hit a record daily high of 432 on Monday, bringing Malaysia’s tally to 12,813 with 137 deaths. Nearly half were from a prison in a northern state, and 130 were in Sabah.Muhyiddin, who took power in March after a political coup, said in a statement that he underwent virus testing every two weeks since April. But since returning from campaigning in Sabah, he had tested three times since Sept. 22 and all were negative.However, he said he will observe the quarantine and work from home until October 16. Muhyiddin said all those in close contact with Zulkifli at the meeting will undergo compulsory quarantine, while others are advised to observe self-isolation.Local reports said the attendees included several ministers, the national police chief, the armed forces chief and the health director-general. Health ministry officials couldn’t be immediately reached for confirmation and further details.This was the second time that Muhyiddin has voluntarily observed a self-quarantine. He did the same in May when one of his Cabinet officers was diagnosed with the virus.Local reports said religious minister Zulkfili visited two states and attended a number of events including at mosques and universities since returning from Sabah on Sept 24. Zulkifli apologized in a Facebook post and urged all those at events he attended to undergo virus tests.The government also announced Monday that more areas in Sabah, including state capital Kota Kinabalu, will be locked down to curb the virus. Sabah is just a boat ride away from the south of the Philippines, which has recorded more than 324,000 cases.Malaysia resumed its economic activities in June after nearly three months of lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-pm-quarantines-as-minister-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-Bb4pSHii2PYTALsTsYtqlJ.html
05-10-2020||World||US, Australia, India, Japan to discuss China’s growing power||Foreign ministers from four Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group are gathering in Tokyo on Tuesday for talks that Japan hopes will increase their involvement in a regional initiative called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” aimed at countering China’s growing assertiveness.The meeting — the first in-person talks among the foreign ministers since the coronavirus pandemic broke out — brings together US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.Japanese officials say they will discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that Japan and the US have been pushing to bring together “like-minded” countries that share concerns about China’s growing assertiveness and influence.On his way to Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters that the four countries hope to have some “significant achievements” at the meeting, but did not elaborate.The talks come weeks ahead of the US presidential election and amid escalating tensions between the US and China over the virus, trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. Pompeo is attending the Quad meeting, though he canceled subsequent planned visits to South Korea and Mongolia after President Donald Trump was hospitalized with the coronavirus.The talks follow a recent flareup in tensions between China and India over their disputed Himalayan border. Relations between Australia and China have also deteriorated in recent months.Japan, meanwhile, is concerned about China’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. Japan also considers China’s growing military activity to be a security threat. Japan’s annual defense policy paper in July accused China of unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea, where it has built and militarized manmade islands and is assertively pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea’s key fisheries and waterways.New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will make his in-person diplomatic debut when he attends part of the Quad meeting. He will also hold separate talks with Pompeo on deepening the Japan-US alliance and the FOIP.“The world is possibly becoming even more unpredictable and uncontrollable due to heightening selfish nationalism and growing tension between the US and China,” Suga said in an interview with Japanese media on Monday. He said he will pursue diplomacy that is based on the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone and “strategically promote the FOIP,” while establishing stable relations with neighbors including China and Russia.He said he also plans to promote the FOIP during a planned visit to Southeast Asia later this month.Suga replaced Shinzo Abe, who resigned due to poor health, on Sept. 16, pledging to carry on Abe’s hawkish diplomacy and security policies. Abe has been a driving force behind FOIP. Japan sees it as crucial to have access to sea lanes all the way to Middle East, a key source of oil for the resource-poor island nation.Suga, a former chief Cabinet secretary, has little experience in diplomacy. Balancing between the US, Japan’s main security ally, and China, its top trading partner, will be tough, analysts say.“The challenges of Japan-US relations are not in themselves, but in where Japan stands when US-China disputes intensify,” said Yasushi Watanabe, an expert on US diplomacy at Japan’s Keio University. ”It would be best for Japan to take a pragmatic approach to China while maintaining the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone,” he said. “And it is indispensable for Japan to strengthen cooperation with the EU, Britain, Australia and ASEAN.”Japan hopes to regularize the Quad foreign ministers’ talks and broaden their cooperation with other countries.That would be a major challenge for the Quad, said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. “A shared threat perception of China does not mean shared views on what to do and if it’s possible to build the Quad into something along the lines of NATO,” he said.The US and Australia would favor the idea, but Japan and India are ambivalent and so is ASEAN, he said. “Transforming the Quad into a collective security organization targeting China forces governments to choose sides. Beijing has generated an arc of anxiety in Asia but there is a preference for dialogue and negotiations, not saber rattling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-australia-india-japan-to-discuss-china-s-growing-power/story-NNmxsJYCp5NPutqKvjg4bM.html
05-10-2020||World||Covid-19: A royal thumbs up for journalism||The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of journalism and trusted sources of news at a time when people have access to a large number of sources, Queen Elizabeth said on Monday.The contribution of the news media has been ‘invaluable’ during the pandemic, she said in a message to the industry organisation News Media Association, which is holding a ‘Journalism Matters’ week from October 5 to 11.The queen wrote: “The Covid-19 pandemic has once again demonstrated what an important public service the established news media provides, both nationally and regionally”. “As our world has changed dramatically, having trusted, reliable sources of information, particularly at a time when there are so many sources competing for our attention, is vital”, the queen, whose family has at times had a tense relationship with the British news media, said.The ‘Journalism Matters’ week aims to highlight the vital role trusted news media journalism plays in democratic society, the association said.By campaigning on behalf of readers, independent news media can make a difference to people’s lives and bring about change for the better, it said.The queen added in her message: “The efforts of the news media to support communities throughout the United Kingdom during the pandemic have been invaluable – whether through fundraising, encouraging volunteering, or providing a lifeline for the elderly and vulnerable to the outside world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-a-royal-thumbs-up-for-journalism/story-kQtWufmARU5y0lpPyHVCFK.html
05-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, moving to show strength, aims for Monday release||President Donald Trump was hoping for a Monday discharge from the military hospital where he is being treated for Covid-19, a day after he briefly ventured out while contagious to salute cheering supporters by motorcade in a move that disregarded precautions meant to contain the deadly virus that has killed more than 209,000 Americans.White House officials said Trump was anxious to be released after three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where doctors revealed on Sunday that his blood oxygen level dropped suddenly twice in recent days and that they gave him a steroid typically only recommended for the very sick. Still, the doctors said Trump’s health is improving and volunteered that he could be discharged as early as Monday to continue the remainder of his treatment at the White House.“This is an important day as the president continues to improve and is ready to get back to a normal work schedule,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told Fox News on Monday. He said the determination on whether Trump would leave the hospital won’t be made until later in the day after the president is evaluated by his medical team, but that Trump was “optimistic” he could be released Monday.Less than one month until Election Day, Trump was eager to project strength despite his illness. The still-infectious president surprised supporters who had gathered outside the hospital, driving by in a black SUV with the windows rolled up. Secret Service agents inside the vehicle could be seen in masks and other protective gear.The move capped a weekend of contradictions that fueled confusion about Trump’s health, which has imperiled the leadership of the US government and upended the final stages of the presidential campaign. While Trump’s physician offered a rosy prognosis on his condition, his briefings lacked basic information, including the findings of lung scans, or were quickly muddled by more serious assessments of the president’s health by other officials.In a short video released by the White House on Sunday, Trump insisted he understood the gravity of the moment. But his actions moments later, by leaving the hospital and sitting inside the SUV with others, suggested otherwise.“This is insanity,” Dr. James P. Phillips, an attending physician at Walter Reed who is a critic of Trump and his handling of the pandemic. “Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary presidential ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days. They might get sick. They may die.”White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump’s trip outside the hospital “was cleared by the medical team as safe to do.” He added that precautions were taken, including using personal protective equipment, to protect Trump as well as White House officials and Secret Service agents.Joe Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, said the Democratic presidential nominee again tested negative for coronavirus Sunday. The results come five days after Biden spent more than 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump. Biden, who has taken a far more cautious approach to in-person events, had two negative tests on Friday.The White House has refused to say when Trump last tested negative and whether he was tested before the debate, but the Cleveland Clinic, which co-hosted the event, said that Trump’s team certified the day of the debate that he and everyone who accompanied him in the debate hall had received a negative COVID-19 test.For his part, Trump still faces questions about his health.His doctors sidestepped questions on Sunday about exactly when Trump’s blood oxygen dropped — an episode they neglected to mention in multiple statements the day before — or whether lung scans showed any damage.It was the second straight day of obfuscation from a White House already suffering from a credibility crisis. And it raised more doubts about whether the doctors treating the president were sharing accurate, timely information with the American public about the severity of his condition.Pressed about conflicting information he and the White House released on Saturday, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley acknowledged that he had tried to present a sunnier description of the president’s condition.“I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness has had,” Conley said. He said he “didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true. The fact of the matter is that he’s doing really well.”Medical experts said Conley’s revelations were hard to square with his positive assessment and talk of a discharge.“There’s a little bit of a disconnect,” said Dr. Steven Shapiro, chief medical and scientific officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.It was not clear for how long Trump’s recovery would continue at the White House once he is discharged.According to CDC guidelines, “In general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes.”Even before Trump’s motorcade outing on Sunday, some Secret Service agents have expressed concern about the lackadaisical attitude toward masks and social distancing inside the White House, but there isn’t much they can do, according to agents and officials who spoke to The Associated Press. This close to the election, thousands of agents are engaged on protective duty so they can be subbed out quickly should someone test positive.The disclosures about Trump’s oxygen levels and steroid treatment suggested the president is enduring more than a mild case of Covid-19.Blood oxygen saturation is a key health marker for Covid-19 patients. A normal reading is between 95 and 100. Conley said the president had a “high fever” and a blood oxygen level below 94% on Friday and during “another episode” on Saturday.He was evasive about the timing of the Trump oxygen drops. But he revealed that Trump was given a dose of the steroid dexamethasone in response. At the time of the briefing, Trump’s blood oxygen level was 98% — within normal rage, Trump’s medical team said.Signs of pneumonia or other lung damage could be detected in scans before a patient feels short of breath, but the president’s doctors declined to say what those scans have revealed.“There’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern,” Conley said. He declined to outline those “expected findings.”Asked about Conley’s lack of transparency, White House aide Alyssa Farah suggested the doctors were speaking as much to the president as to the American public: “When you’re treating a patient, you want to project confidence, you want to lift their spirits, and that was the intent.”In all, nearly 7.4 million people have been infected in the United States, and few have access to the kind of around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments as Trump.Trump’s treatment with the steroid dexamethasone is in addition to the single dose he was given Friday of an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that supplies antibodies to help the immune system fight the virus. Trump on Friday also began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways — the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus, and remdesivir curbs the virus’ ability to multiply.Garibaldi, a specialist in pulmonary critical care, said the president was not showing any side effects of the drugs “that we can tell.”The National Institutes of Health Covid-19 treatment guidelines recommend against using dexamethasone in patients who do not require oxygen. It has only been proven to help in more serious cases. Among the concerns with earlier use is that steroids tamp down certain immune cells, hindering the body’s own ability to fight off infection.Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications. First lady Melania Trump has remained at the White House as she recovers from her own bout with the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-moving-to-show-strength-aims-for-monday-release/story-ljV2EdYc00TlV1W6wIKm8L.html
05-10-2020||World||James Bond fails to save closure of theatre chain Cineworld||Agent 007 battled many warlords, mafia dons and criminals to save people over the decades, but on Monday failed to prevent the closure of Cineworld, one of the largest cinema chains in the UK and the US after the release of the latest James Bond film No Time To Die was put off again.Producers announced last week that the film, which has been postponed twice this year, would now be released on April 2, 2021. It was widely expected to help bring people back into cinema houses grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic.Over 5,500 jobs in the UK and 20,000 in the US are set to go after Cineworld announced temporary closure of its hundreds of cinemas on Monday. “Cineworld confirms that it will be temporarily suspending operations at all of its 536 Regal theatres in the US and its 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK from Thursday 8 October 2020,” it said in a statement.Earlier, a statement on the James Bond film’s website said: “MGM, Universal and Bond producers, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, today announced the release of No Time To Die, the 25th film in the James Bond series, will be delayed until 2 April 2021 in order to be seen by a worldwide theatrical audience”. “We understand the delay will be disappointing to our fans but we now look forward to sharing No Time To Die next year”, it added.Reacting to Cineworld’s announcement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go to cinemas and enjoy themselves to support them. Cinema houses and other entertainment venues have reported major fall in business in recent months. Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: “We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets,” adding that the company “cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was” to close the sites.“Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-bond-fails-to-save-closure-of-theatre-chain-cineworld/story-av1TzlDNOC9bIhs8xYMByL.html
05-10-2020||World||Prime Minister Rishi Sunak? ‘Definitely not,’ says UK’s chancellor of the exchequer||British finance minister Rishi Sunak on Monday denied he was eyeing the job of his beleaguered boss, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and vowed to uphold his “sacred responsibility” of rebalancing the books after a splurge of coronavirus spending.The 40-year-old Indian-origin chancellor of the exchequer is being portrayed as a leader-in-waiting by some Conservative lawmakers and right-wing commentators, after resisting stricter curbs on public life to counter the Covid-19 crisis.He told the Conservative party’s annual conference on Monday that the “overwhelming might of the British state” will be deployed to deal with the Covid-19 crisis and kickstart the ailing economy.Riding a crest of popularity among party members – the latest ConservativeHome survey places him at the top of the ‘cabinet league table’ – Sunak listed several multi-billion-pound schemes he had announced to help employees, companies and the self-employed.But when asked at a side event if he wanted the keys to Number 10 Downing Street, Sunak said: “Oh God. No. Definitely not, seeing what the prime minister has to deal with.”“It’s a job hard enough for me to do,” Sunak said, chuckling, asked whether he was looking to move next door from the chancellor’s residence at 11 Downing Street.“I think he and I are personally close,” Sunak said, and confirmed Johnson called him “Rish”.When asked what he called Johnson, Sunak said: “I call him prime minister. He keeps trying to tell me to call him other things... but I just stick with PM.” At the conference, Sunak downplayed any rift with Johnson, while acknowledging the “difficult trade-offs and decisions” forced upon the government as Britain endures the worst pandemic toll in Europe.On the coronavirus crisis, he told his audience: “(We) are only part way through this crisis. What began in March as a health emergency has grown and now reaches deep into our economy and society. Not only does it endanger lives, but jobs and education. It separates friends and family”.“I am committing myself to a single priority – to create, support and extend opportunity to as many people as I can. Because even if this moment is more difficult than any you have ever faced, even if it feels like there is no hope, I am telling you that there is, and that the overwhelming might of the British state will be placed at your service”.As of Sunday night, the UK had registered 502,978 cases and 42,350 deaths (including 813 patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in England). Technical issues about recording new cases have surfaced in recent days, but officials said these have now been resolved.Sunak admitted that borrowing to fund support schemes would challenge future budget exercises, and cautioned that hard choices would need to be made to balance the books, indicating that tax rises could be one of the ways of dealing with deficits.He said: “We have a sacred responsibility to future generations to leave the public finances strong, and through careful management of our economy, this Conservative government will always balance the books”.“If instead we argue there is no limit on what we can spend, that we can simply borrow our way out of any hole, what is the point in us? I have never pretended there is some easy cost-free answer. Hard choices are everywhere.

05-10-2020||World||WHO says 10 per cent of world’s people may have been infected with coronavirus||The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization said Monday its “best estimates” indicate that roughly 1 in 10 people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus — more than 20 times the number of confirmed cases — and warned of a difficult period ahead.Dr. Michael Ryan, speaking to a special session of the WHO’s 34-member executive board focusing on Covid-19, said the figures vary from urban to rural, and between different groups, but that ultimately it means “the vast majority of the world remains at risk.” He said the pandemic would continue to evolve, but that tools exist to suppress transmission and save lives.“Many deaths have been averted and many more lives can be protected,” Ryan said. He was flanked by his boss, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who minutes earlier led a moment of silence to honor victims as well as round of applause for the health workers who have strived to save them.Ryan said southeast Asia faced a surge in cases, Europe and the eastern Mediterranean were seeing an increase in deaths, while the situations in Africa and the Western Pacific were “rather more positive.”“Our current best estimates tell us that about 10 percent of the global population may have been infected by this virus,” Ryan told attendees from member governments who make up the executive board and provide much of its funding.The estimate — which would amount to more than 760 million people based on a current world population of about 7.6 billion — far outstrips the number of confirmed cases as tallied by both WHO and Johns Hopkins University, now more than 35 million worldwide.Experts have long said that the number of confirmed cases greatly underestimates the true figure.The comments came during a special session of the executive board to consider the follow-up to its previous meeting, in May, that passed a resolution to look into the world’s — and WHO’s — response to the pandemic. Ryan warned that the world was “now heading into a difficult period. The disease continues to spread. It is on the rise in many parts of the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-10-per-cent-of-world-s-people-may-have-been-infected-with-virus/story-6JUEpZaWTnJI4NpIBxKCzN.html

Separately, a court in Islamabad charged former president Asif Ali Zardari in two corruption cases.The Lahore police filed a first information report (FIR) against Sharif, Maryam and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi for conspiring against the state and its institutions a day after Sharif’s son-in-law Capt (retd) Muhammad Safdar was booked under sedition charges for “provoking the people against the state and its institutions.” The FIR also named three retired generals of the Pakistan Army. Journalist Hamid Mir tweeted on Monday that Prime Minister Imran Khan “always claimed to be an ambassador of Kashmiris but look at this FIR registered by Punjab police, they booked elected PM of AJK @farooq_pm under treason charges along with @NawazSharifMNS and three retired Lt Generals of Pak Army Face.”The FIR alleged that Sharif had conspired against Pakistan’s prestigious institutions by making provocative speeches from London, on a complaint registered by a citizen, Badar Rasheed.It alleged that in the speeches made on September 20 and October 1, the former premier supported the policies of India so that Pakistan would continue to remain on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) ‘grey list’ over lack of compliance on money laundering and terror financing.The complainant said that the main purpose of Sharif’s speeches was to isolate Pakistan in front of the international community and to declare it a rogue state. He added that Sharif is trying to turn the people against the democratically elected government of Imran Khan.The aim of the speeches was also to divert attention from “human rights violations” in Kashmir to benefit Sharif’s “friend” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the complainant alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-crackdown-on-oppn-continues-conspiracy-case-against-nawaz-sharif-graft-charges-on-zardari/story-IXsrvtvREs6OBZg2XsmYHM.html

05-10-2020||World||Ola to appeal after London refuses licence over public safety risk||Indian ride-hailing service Ola said on Monday that it would appeal the decision by London’s transport officials to refuse it another licence over a “number of failures that could have risked public safety”.Ola, which has been operating in London since February 2020, was granted a 15-month licence by Transport for London (TfL) on July 4, 2019, which expired on Saturday. After it lodged the appeal, officials said the company can continue to operate pending the outcome of any appeals process.Marc Rozendal, Ola’s UK managing director, said: “At Ola, our core principle is to work closely, collaboratively and transparently with regulators such as TfL. We have been working with TfL during the review period and have sought to provide assurances and address the issues raised in an open and transparent manner”. “Ola will take the opportunity to appeal this decision and in doing so, our riders and drivers can rest assured that we will continue to operate as normal, providing safe and reliable mobility for London.”TfL, the public body responsible for the capital’s network, said that before granting a licence, it must be satisfied that the operator is ‘fit and proper’ to hold a private operator’s licence. Ola also operates in south-west England.TfL added that the number of failures with potential public safety consequences includes historic breaches of the licensing regime that led to unlicensed drivers and vehicles undertaking more than 1,000 passenger trips on behalf of Ola.Besides, it said there has been a failure to draw these breaches to TfL’s attention immediately when they were first identified.Helen Chapman of TfL said: “Our duty as a regulator is to ensure passenger safety. Through our investigations, we discovered that flaws in Ola’s operating model have led to the use of unlicensed drivers and vehicles in more than 1,000 passenger trips, which may have put passenger safety at risk.”“If they do appeal, Ola can continue to operate and drivers can continue to undertake bookings on behalf of Ola. We will closely scrutinise the company to ensure passengers safety is not compromised.”TfL had raised similar issues with Ola’s rival, Uber. On September 28, the Westminster Magistrates Court ruled that Uber, whose licence was revoked last November, is now ‘fit and proper’ to run private car services after the issues were addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ola-to-appeal-after-london-refuses-licence-over-public-safety-risk/story-CBMDzgSZauMIZN0rvHCdwO.html
05-10-2020||World||FIR registered against Nawaz Sharif for ‘criminal conspiracy’||A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered against Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the case of criminal conspiracy for the “provocative speeches” he made in London to “defame Pakistan’s institutions”, Geo News reported on Monday.The FIR was lodged against Sharif on October 1 by a local in the Shahdra Police Station’s jurisdiction.According to Geo News report, the case was filed under the provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code for criminal conspiracy against the Pakistan Muslim League (N) chief and other leaders.Earlier this month, Pakistan failed to execute a non-bailable arrest warrant against Sharif, who was granted permission to fly abroad to get medical treatment in November last year.For nearly one month, the Pakistan government made several attempts to get Sharif’s arrest warrant signed.Last week, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had slammed Sharif over his failure to appear before the court after he was granted permission to fly abroad for medical treatment.“Accused [Sharif] knows that he went abroad after defeating the system. He must be laughing at the system while sitting abroad. It’s shameful conduct by the accused,” Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan had tasked relevant authorities to bring back Sharif at the earliest. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister also issued the directive to pursue the matter vigorously.A cabinet member had told Dawn the government had already sent a request to the British government for the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) leader’s repatriation but it would now send a fresh application.Last month, the IHC came down heavily on the Imran Khan-led government for allowing Sharif to go abroad without informing the court and it was up to the dispensation to take steps for ensuring the latter’s return to the country.Additional Attorney General Tariq Mehmood Khokhar had told a bench comprising Justices Aamer Farooq and Mohsin Akhtar Kayani that Pakistan’s Foreign Office implemented the court-issued non-bailable arrest warrants without delay through the Pakistan High Commission in the UK on September 17, Geo News reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fir-registered-against-nawaz-sharif-for-criminal-conspiracy/story-4qdKA8URMnFptniiCrDbOL.html
05-10-2020||World||Covid-19 disrupting mental health services in most countries: WHO survey||The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted critical mental health services in 93% of countries globally while the demand for these services is increasing, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) survey released on Monday. The survey was conducted in 130 countries from June to August. Nearly a third (35%) reported disruptions to emergency interventions, including those for people experiencing prolonged seizures, severe substance use withdrawal syndromes, and delirium, often a sign of a serious underlying medical condition. And 30% reported disruptions to access to medications for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders.Also read: Europe tightens curbs as leaders gird for long Covid-19 fightApart from emergency treatment, countries also reported widespread disruption of many kinds of critical mental health services.At least 60% reported disruptions to mental health services for vulnerable people, including children and adolescents (72%), older adults (70%), and women requiring antenatal or postnatal services (61%).Counselling and psychotherapy services have also affected in about 67% cases. As many as 65% reported critical harm to reduction services and 45% to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence.Even school and workplace mental health services have been adversely affected, and according to the WHO survey about three-quarters reported at least partial disruptions of services at these places during the pandemic.“Initial few weeks of the pandemic were worse when regular Out Patient Departments (OPDs) had to be shut, and people were finding it difficult to gain access to doctors, and even not able to procure medicines as freely as earlier. The problem was worse for people not living in the metros as transportation was also restricted. The elderly and children were much more affected. Gradually we opened online consultation services but not many were aware of it. So, yes, this pandemic has been tough on patients, including those suffering from mental illnesses. But things are now getting back to normalcy,” said Rajesh Sagar, a professor of psychiatry at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The survey provides the first global data showing the devastating impact of the pandemic on access to mental health services and underscores the urgent need for increased funding in this area.Prior to the pandemic, the surveyed countries were spending less than 2% of their national health budgets on mental health, and struggling to meet their populations’ needs, highlighting the issue of chronic underfunding of mental health. And the pandemic has only increased the demand for mental health services.Bereavement, isolation, loss of income, and fear have triggered mental health conditions or exacerbated the existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.The survey also found that Covid-19 can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke.“People with pre-existing mental, neurological, or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 [that causes Covid-19] infection - they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death,” it says.The survey evaluated how the provision of mental, neurological and substance use services has changed due to Covid-19, and the types of services that have been disrupted, and how countries are adapting to overcome these challenges.While many countries (70%) have adopted telemedicine or teletherapy to overcome disruptions to in-person services, there are significant disparities in the uptake of these interventions, shows the survey. At least 80% of high-income countries reported deploying telemedicine and teletherapy to bridge gaps in mental health, compared with less than 50% of low-income countries.WHO has issued guidelines to countries on how to maintain essential services, including mental health services, during this pandemic. It has asked countries to allocate resources for mental health as an integral component of their response and recovery plans. The Organization has also urged countries to monitor changes and disruptions in services so that they can address them as required.Although 89% of countries reported that mental health and psychosocial support is part of their national Covid-19 response plans, only 17% of these countries have full additional funding for covering these activities.This highlights the need for more money for mental health as pre-pandemic estimates suggest nearly US$1 trillion in economic productivity is lost annually from depression and anxiety alone. However, studies show that every US$1 spent on evidence-based care for depression and anxiety returns US$5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-disrupting-mental-health-services-in-most-countries-who-survey/story-1Z0GOtb2zXqg86FOZj8DtI.html

05-10-2020||World||Europe tightens curbs as leaders gird for Long Covid-19 fight||Europe is tightening restrictions to regain control of resurgent coronavirus infections, with Paris closing bars and new curbs likely on the way in Italy and Ireland.The continent is struggling to control the latest outbreak as opposition to limits on movement mounts and leaders resist the stringent lockdowns that hammered economies in the second quarter. Instead, the approach is on a shifting array of measures, which risks being similarly disruptive.“Authorities have an extremely difficult job at the moment,” Martin Hirsch, head of Paris hospitals, said on France Info. “If we go too far we are accused of killing freedom or the economy, and if we don’t go far enough, it’s homicide.”Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Monday will announce new restrictions to contain the spread after a surge in cases in the capital and its suburbs.Authorities are planning to entirely shut down bars and impose tighter distancing rules on restaurants as the region is declared on maximum alert, according to Agence France Presse. In Marseille, however, restaurants will be permitted to reopen after a week of closure.France’s virus cases increased the most in Europe over the past two months and monthly virus-related deaths tripled in September. The country reported a record number of laboratory-confirmed new cases on Saturday.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel will chair a special cabinet meeting on the pandemic response in Berlin. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said “it will take time” to return to pre-coronavirus levels of activity, even if more effective therapies and a vaccine are made available.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We will be dealing with this ‘new normality’ and with the virus into next year,” Scholz said in an interview with ARD public television late Sunday. “It’s not gone, and it’s a great danger for everyone around the world.”In Hungary, the government over the weekend announced what it called an unprecedented increase in doctors’ wages. Prime Minister Viktor Orban predicted that the “seven-eight months ahead will require extraordinary efforts” from medical professionals, according to a Facebook video.Amid a surge in cases in recent weeks, Ireland’s national health authorities recommended the country move to a level 5 lockdown. That’s the highest level of shutdown, with most stores closed, household visits banned and limits placed on how far people can leave their homes. Most of the country is currently at level 2, with Dublin at Level 3.While the government is set to consider the recommendation in coming days, the surprise proposal is already running into resistance, amid concern that such a drastic step would devastate the nascent economic recovery.“It is intolerable that after six months we are still receiving both vague and changing criteria to advance such serious restrictions,” said Danny McCoy, head of the nation’s biggest employers’ group, IBEC.In a sign of the economic risks, Cineworld Group Plc lost more than half its value after the companyu said it will temporarily suspend operations at all its American and British movie theaters now that crucial income from winter blockbusters has been pushed into 2021.Operations will resume when “key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,” the world’s second-biggest cinema chain said.Italian LibertiesItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that people may have to give up some liberties to combat the renewed spread of the coronavirus, as his government prepares to require masks in all outdoor areas and impose limits on gatherings, Corriere della Sera reported.Italy reported 2,578 new cases on Sunday, as figures continue to be higher than any time since late spring, though the flare-up has been more contained than in most neighboring countries.In a reminder of the risks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is self-isolating after being exposed to someone who tested positive.

05-10-2020||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan heads into his biggest challenge. Military is also target||Prime Minister Imran Khan is facing the biggest challenge to his leadership from opposition parties that united over the weekend to appoint firebrand cleric Maulana Fazalur Rehman to lead the freshly-minted 11 party anti-government alliance trying to unseat him.Rehman had last year the first round of his campaign against Imran Khan when he launched the ‘Azadi March’ from Karachi to the capital city of Islamabad against the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, or PTI government. That effort had fizzled out. This time, Khan’s orange-turbaned rival has support from other parties to keep the street protests going.A 26-point resolution adopted by the coalition - they call it Pakistan Democratic Movement - a fortnight earlier seeks to force “the selected prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the establishment in politics.” It also wants to ensure the “end of establishment’s interference in politics”, a reference to the army.The opposition’s combined attack on the powerful military is unusual in Pakistan; the army has ruled Pakistan for roughly half of its 73-year history and often had the last word in the country’s governance for the other half. Like Imran Khan’s critics say, it does now.That it was Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa who summoned political parties to a secret meeting last month to build consensus on turning the Gilgit Baltistan in the occupied northern areas into Pakistan’s fifth province at China’s behest underlined the role that the military was playing in the country’s politics.“It is saddening that the situation has escalated to the level where we now have a state above the state,” Nawaz Sharif said at the first opposition conference late last month, echoing their sentiment that Imran Khan was their proxy.His daughter and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz - who has been fronting the party’s battles with the government in the absence of Pakistan’s three-time prime minister - has been among the loudest to demand action against retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor chairman and PM Khan’s aide on corruption charges.Also Read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his handsImran Khan, who came to power on the back of populist assurances to root out corruption, faces allegations that his anti-corruption drive only aims at opposition leaders. In July this year, Pakistan’s top court also remarked in one case that the anti-corruption watchdog appeared “reluctant in proceeding against people on one side of the political divide”.A Pakistan watcher in New Delhi said it is not a surprise that the National Accountability Bureau arrested Pakistan’s Leader of the Opposition and PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif soon after the first opposition conference.“Nawaz Sharif is no hero but he represents the very essence of democratic choice,” he said, stressing that investigations directed at Nawaz Sharif and his family were important since he was the only leader to stand up to the army. In the absence of her father who is in exile in London, Maryam Sharif has been taking a blunt aim at the military. She has called Gen Bajwa’s meeting last month on Gilgit-Baltistan as an attempt by the military to tighten its grip over the country’s politics. “These decisions should be made in parliament, not in GHQ (army headquarters),” she said.A second Pakistan watcher in Delhi said there was an assessment that Maryam Sharif’s shrill pitch against the military did appear to expose her to “serious risk of physical harm”. She hasn’t backed down from her sharp criticism of the military and Imran Khan despite her uncle’s arrest.Street protests and mega rallies had been Imran Khan’s favourite tool to build public opinion against the Nawaz Sharif government back. Analysts say that the opposition doesn’t expect to succeed in the short term but is building the momentum to overthrow the Khan regime, quite like the 2014 Azadi march that he had led against Nawaz Sharif.Khan faces other challenges as well, some of them much more immediate. Next month’s meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, is one. The meeting, scheduled for 21-23 October, is to decide on Imran Khan’s request to take Pakistan off the global watchdog’s ‘grey list’.An Indian counter-terror official said Islamabad was likely to be disappointed given its patchy record of implementing anti-terror laws. That would make it hard for Khan’s government to access international markets at a time when the country’s economy has been faltering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-imran-khan-heads-into-his-biggest-challenge-military-is-also-target/story-khmBRSwEci9qDEAJXrecJO.html
05-10-2020||World||FATF all set to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status: Report||The Financial Action Task Force is all set to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status in a virtual meeting scheduled later this month, according to a media report on Monday. The Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic. Seeking to wriggle out of the FATF’s grey list, debt-ridden Pakistan in August imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. The virtual FATF plenary scheduled for October 21-23 will decide if Pakistan should be excluded from its grey list, based on a review of Islamabad’s performance to meet global commitments and standards on fight against money laundering and terror financing (ML&TF), the Dawn News reported. The meeting was earlier scheduled in June but Islamabad got an unexpected breather after the global watchdog against financial crimes temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines in the wake of grave health risk following COVID-9 pandemic, it said. The agency also put a general pause in the review process, thus giving additional four months to Pakistan to meet the requirements. In February, the FATF gave Pakistan, which missed 13 targets, a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against ML&TF committed with the international community. In its third plenary held virtually in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the grey list as Islamabad failed to check flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). With Pakistan’s continuation in the ‘grey list’, it is increasingly becoming difficult for the country to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.In July, Pakistan’s Senate unanimously approved two bills related to the tough conditions set by FATF. In August, Parliament’s lower house passed four FATF-related bills as part of the efforts by Pakistan to move from the FATF’s grey list to the white list.In September, the joint session of the Parliament amended about 15 laws to upgrade its legal system matching international standards as required by the FATF. The government has already submitted its report to the FATF and its affiliated review groups and responded to their comments, detailing compliance with the 13 outstanding action points, the Dawn report stated. The FATF meeting this month will review Pakistan’s compliance with the 13 remaining action points. The FATF will examine if the country had demonstrated remedial actions and sanctions applied in cases of violations relating to terrorist financing risk management and terror financing sanctions obligations.The FATF will also judge if competent authorities were cooperating and taking action to identify and taking enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and had proven implementation of cross-border currency and bearer negotiable instruments controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.Pakistan has also to determine if law enforcement agencies were identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that terrorist financing (TF) probes and prosecution target designated persons and entities, and those acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities besides showing TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, the report said.The country’s outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services, it said. If the FATF in its meeting finds that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country in the ‘Black List’ along with North Korea and Iran. In August, Prime Minister Imran Khan had warned that if blacklisted at the FATF, Pakistan’s entire economy will be destroyed due to inflation and a massive fall in Pakistani Rupee. The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations - the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council.

Auckland remained at level 2.5, but moved to level 2 later in September.New Zealand’s Health Ministry said on Monday that only one new case of Covid-19 had been registered in the past 24 hours. A total of 40 active cases of the coronavirus were reported.

05-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: Mike Pence’s campaign role grows at key moment||Vice President Mike Pence is in a familiar spot: standing by President Donald Trump.With Trump hospitalized with a virus that he spent months downplaying, his ever-loyal No. 2 will play an increasingly prominent role in the weeks ahead.Pence will take a leading role in campaigning around the country in the final stretch before the Nov. 3 election, aiming to keep the president’s supporters energized and deflecting criticism of his handling of a virus that has killed over 205,000 Americans. The president’s positive diagnosis on Friday has intensified scrutiny of the administration’s cavalier approach to the pandemic.The spotlight on Pence will be especially bright on Wednesday when he will participate in the vice presidential debate with California Sen. Kamala Harris. Pence will almost certainly be pressed to explain shifting accounts of the president’s health over the weekend and justify Trump’s decision to hold large in-person campaign rallies during a pandemic — events that often flouted public health guidelines by congregating thousands of mostly mask-less supporters.“Normally, the vice presidential debate is inconsequential. That is not the case in 2020,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential bid. “The public has so many questions about how we got here and it’s an opportunity for Pence to answer some of those.”Pence has often been called upon to smooth over fallout from Trump’s messy decision making and divisive policies. Since the 2016 campaign, he has served as a bridge of sorts between a brash, thrice-married former reality television star who long bragged about womanizing and the more traditional branch of the Republican Party, particularly conservative evangelicals.The smooth diction and humble demeanor Pence brings to the role was honed in the 1990s when he was a conservative talk-radio host in Indiana, when he referred to himself as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.”His approach hasn’t always been successful. As Indiana’s governor from 2013 to 2017, he was so relentlessly on-message that he sometimes struggled to contain fallout from fast-moving crises.That includes his handling of backlash over a 2015 law he signed that allowed business owners to deny service to gay people for religious reasons, which was later amended as a result of the uproar. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC when he was governor, Pence grew flustered after failing to answer direct questions about whether discrimination against gay people should be legal.“George!” Pence protested before letting out an audible sigh. “C’mon.”The debate with Harris will be a major test. The former California prosecutor’s political rise was fueled by searing exchanges with political rivals during major congressional hearings. And she is certain to press the issue of the virus and Trump’s diagnoses when the two meet in Salt Lake City.“That will be his challenge. But it is one he is well-suited for,” said Cam Savage, a veteran Republican strategist from Indiana who has closely observed Pence’s political career. “With Pence you get a very disciplined leader who is not likely to make mistakes.”One major uncertainty is what sort of condition Trump will be in during the weeks ahead.His administration has offered rosy assessments of his health and said he could be released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as early as Monday. But Trump’s blood oxygen level abruptly dropped twice in recent days and he was given supplemental oxygen before his hospitalization. His doctors continued to evade basic questions about his health on Sunday.There are also concerns that Pence could himself could catch the virus while campaigning, a troubling scenario that raises serious questions about national security and the transfer of power if either he or Trump took a turn for the worse.After the debate, Pence says, it’s back to “business as usual” and the campaign has appearances planned for him, as well as Trump’s children and other top surrogates in an effort billed as “Operation MAGA.” Pence is slated to visit Arizona and Florida and will return to Indiana on Friday to vote early.“We’ve got a campaign to run,” Pence said Saturday on a call with staff. “I promise you, this president, as soon as his doctors say so, he’s going to be back out there.”Pence often evokes faith when describing his approach to public office, citing the biblical concept of “servant leadership.”He has been a faithful servant to Trump since he was plucked from a difficult bid for reelection as governor to join the presidential ticket in 2016.Though Pence has long-held presidential ambitions, his own political career was on the ropes.The former congressman turned governor had a dismal approval rating. His enthusiastic support for religious conservative cultural issues alienated moderate Republicans and drew threats of boycott of the state. And he faced a difficult reelection battle against the same Democrat that he narrowly beat in 2012.His selection for the Trump ticket removed him from a lackluster campaign that leaned heavily on car racing metaphors that often fell flat even though the state has a deep affinity for the sport and is home to the Indianapolis 500.As Trump’s envoy to religious conservatives, Pence quickly revitalized his political prospects. Often referencing the Supreme Court, Pence reminded fellow religious conservatives that the future makeup of the judiciary would be determined by the 2016 winner — a prediction poised to become reality with Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg.At times, Pence’s defense of Trump involved few words.After the “Access Hollywood” video emerged in 2016 of Trump talking in lewd terms about grabbing women by their genitals without consent came to light just days before a debate, Pence’s mere return to the campaign trail was a signal of support.Whether Trump secures another term or not, Pence is a likely Republican presidential contender in 2024. His handling of the challenges before him could be a determining factor in what his future will bring.“We will find out in the next few days whether Pence will be a leading candidate in 2024,” said Conant, the Republican strategist.___Associate Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-mike-pence-s-campaign-role-grows-at-key-moment/story-oOdBFWaxZiKhdIYGYH7j6O.html

05-10-2020||World||Donald Trump criticized for leaving hospital to greet supporters||US President Donald Trump sparked an angry backlash from the medical community Sunday with a protocol-breaking visit to his supporters outside the hospital where he is being treated for the highly-infectious, potentially deadly new coronavirus.He was masked as he waved from inside his bulletproof vehicle during the short trip outside Walter Reed military medical center near Washington, which appeared designed to take back the narrative on his improving health after a weekend of muddled messaging from his doctors.The last-minute limousine outing came with Trump’s doctors satisfied enough about his progress to suggest the possibility of his being discharged on Monday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But experts complained that the outing broke his own government’s public health guidelines requiring patients to isolate while they are in treatment and still shedding virus -- and endangered his Secret Service protection. Trump, who has been repeatedly rebuked for flouting public health guidelines and spreading misinformation on the pandemic, said in a video that dropped on Twitter just before the appearance that he had “learned a lot about Covid” by “really going to school” as he has battled the virus.But health experts took to the airwaves and social media to criticize the “stunt,” which they said demonstrated that he had learned nothing at all. “Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,” said James Phillips, chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University.“They might get sick. They may die. For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage White House spokesman Judd Deere said “appropriate” precautions had been taken to protect Trump and his support staff, including protective gear. “The movement was cleared by the medical team as safe to do,” he added.But Zeke Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania and regular TV pundit, described the appearance as “shameful.”“Making his Secret Service agents drive with a COVID-19 patient, with windows up no less, put them needlessly at risk for infection. And for what? A PR stunt,” he tweeted.Confused messaging The episode came hours after a briefing by Trump’s medical team, who said he had “continued to improve” and could be returned to the White House, which has the facilities to treat and isolate the president, as early as Monday.The president was flown to Walter Reed with a high fever on Friday after a “rapid progression” of his illness, with his oxygen levels dropping worryingly low, Trump’s physician Sean Conley said in a Sunday briefing.Health experts have complained that the messaging from the administration -- and particularly Trump’s medical team -- has caused widespread confusion.Conley admitted Sunday that he had kept from the public the fact that the president had been given extra oxygen, in a bid to reflect an “upbeat attitude.”And he gave a rosy account of Trump’s progress Saturday, only for White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to tell reporters immediately after that Trump’s condition had been “very concerning” and that he was “still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”‘White House Cluster’With his tough reelection campaign in its final month against Democratic rival Joe Biden, Trump’s diagnosis and hospitalization have left him sidelined from what he does best -- campaigning.Meanwhile, Biden -- who announced Sunday his latest negative test for the virus -- will start the week with a trip Monday to key swing state Florida.But Trump and his advisors have done their best to project a sense of continuity.His deputy campaign manager Jason Miller told ABC Sunday he had spoken to Trump for a half-hour Saturday and that the president was “cracking jokes.” But controversy has been mounting over the possibility that Trump might have exposed numerous others to Covid-19 even after a close aide tested positive. A timeline provided by his advisors and doctors suggested he met more than 30 donors on Thursday in Bedminster, New Jersey, even after learning that Hope Hicks had the virus -- and just hours before he announced his own positive test.There were more than 200 people at the fundraiser, and a contact-tracing operation underway in New Jersey was looking at potentially thousands of people who may have been exposed.All this came in a week when a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll -- taken in the two days after a bruising presidential debate with Biden but before news emerged of Trump’s illness -- gave Biden a significant 53-39 percent lead among registered voters.As well as Trump and Hicks, numerous White House insiders and at least three Republican senators have contracted Covid-19, along with First Lady Melania Trump, who has not experienced severe symptoms.Public health experts have expressed alarm at the “White House cluster” that has been linked to the September 26 Rose Garden celebration of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-criticized-for-leaving-hospital-to-greet-supporters/story-HkhwCoen74RxqkwIa3v3HI.html
05-10-2020||World||Covid: Australia’s Victoria state to boost testing on path to easing restrictions||Australia’s coronavirus hotspot of Victoria will look into ways to increase testing for the disease to control its spread in anticipation of easing of the state’s stringent lockdown restrictions, officials said on Monday.New daily coronavirus infections in Victoria, Australia’s second most-populous state, fell to nine cases on Monday, down from 12 in the previous days. No deaths were reported. Melbourne, which has remained in a strict lockdown for nearly three months, is expected to see the bulk of its restrictions eased when the average for new daily cases over two weeks falls below five. According to the state’s modelling, that could occur in late October. On Monday, the 14-day day rolling case average was 11.6, down from 11.9 the previous day. Also Read: New York City seeks to reinstate Covid-19 restrictions in some spots“We want everybody who has symptoms, regardless of their circumstances, to be able to get tested, we get their results and that’s how we can protect them and indeed, the entire community,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said in a televised briefing. “There is some work going on in the next few days to see if we can increase the number of people who are eligible and increase the number of people who can get those tests.”Victoria accounts for 90% of the country’s 894 Covid-19 deaths. Since the start of the year, the state has conducted some 2.7 million tests. It had a population of about 6 million at the last census, according to government data.Australia has one of the world’s highest ratios of tests per capita and, despite the outbreak in Victoria, one of the lowest numbers of coronavirus cases.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe country has had just over 27,000 infections, according to health ministry data - less than the average daily number of cases for the United States in the past several months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-australia-s-victoria-state-to-boost-testing-on-path-to-easing-restrictions/story-qKNPxnoKN6ghzUV97nJm5H.html
05-10-2020||World||New York City seeks to reinstate Covid-19 restrictions in some spots||New York City’s mayor said Sunday that he has asked the state for permission to close schools and reinstate restrictions on non-essential businesses in several neighbourhoods because of a resurgence of the coronavirus.The action, if approved, would mark a disheartening retreat for a city that enjoyed a summer with less spread of the virus than most other parts of the country, and had only recently celebrated the return of students citywide to in-person learning in classrooms.Shutdowns would happen starting Wednesday in nine ZIP codes in the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.About 100 public schools and 200 private schools would have to close. Indoor dining, which just resumed a few days ago, would be suspended. Outdoor restaurant dining would shut down in the affected neighbourhoods as well, and gyms would close.Houses of worship would be allowed to remain open with existing restrictions in place, de Blasio said.The mayor, a Democrat, said he was taking the action in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading deeper into the city and becoming a “second wave,” like the one that killed more than 24,000 New Yorkers in the spring.“We’ve learned over and over from this disease that it is important to act aggressively, and when the data tells us it’s time for even the toughest and most rigorous actions we follow the data, we follow the science,” de Blasio said.Over the past two weeks, the number of new cases of the virus has been rising in pockets of the city, predominantly in neighbourhoods in Brooklyn and Queens that are home to the city’s large Orthodox Jewish population.Nearly 1,100 people have tested positive in Brooklyn in just the last four days, according to state figures.De Blasio made the announcement shortly after Gov. Andrew Cuomo complained that local governments with coronavirus hot spots had “not done an effective job” of enforcing social distancing rules.“If a local jurisdiction cannot or will not perform effective enforcement of violating entities, notify the state and we will close all business activity in the hot spots where the local governments cannot do compliance,” Cuomo said.Cuomo did not immediately comment on de Blasio’s proposed shutdown in the areas where the virus is spiking.As many as 500,000 people live in the neighbourhoods affected by the proposed shutdown, de Blasio said. He said the lockdown could be lifted in 14 days or 28 days if the percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 declines.The coronavirus was estimated to have hit between 1 and 2 million people in New York City, mostly in the spring before testing was widely available. Thousands of people fell ill each day. By the summer’s end, the city appeared to have the virus partly in check, averaging fewer than 240 new cases per day citywide as recently as Sept. 7.Overall, the city’s infection rate remains relatively low, with around 420 new cases a day over the past few days, but those have been concentrated in a handful of neighbourhoods. The nine ZIP codes singled out by the mayor have been responsible for more than 20% of all new infections in the city over the past four weeks, though they represent only 7% of the population.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDe Blasio had said in the past that public schools were largely unaffected by the rise in virus infections in Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods, but he said Sunday that public schools in the hot spot neighbourhoods would be closed “out of an abundance of caution.”United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew praised the decision. “This is the right decision, one that helps protect our schools, our neighbourhoods, and ultimately our city,” Mulgrew said Sunday.The staff at Public School 164 in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, one of the affected neighbourhoods, sent a letter to de Blasio on Thursday demanding that the school be closed.Teacher Frances Hidalgo said it was unrealistic to think the school would be immune from infection when students and staff interact with people in the neighbourhood daily.Hidalgo, a fourth grade teacher, pointed to the high positivity rate in Borough Park. “We don’t live in a bubble. We’re part of the neighbourhood,” she said in a phone interview Saturday.Cuomo allowed New York City restaurants to resume indoor dining starting on Sept. 30, but at only 25% of their seating capacity. Several friends in the restaurant business said Sunday that shutting down for a while might be better.“It’s going to be a hard winter,” said Alejandra Benitez, who owns Beco Bar in a Brooklyn ZIP code affected by de Blasio’s shutdown proposal. “But it’s almost cheaper to close. It’s just that people don’t want to risk it.”Mike Sternfield, who was dining with Benitez and other friends outside L&B Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn, agreed with her. “As a bartender, I don’t think we should be going inside to eat and drink at all,” Sternfield said. “But operating at 25% capacity isn’t going to help anyone anyway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-seeks-to-reinstate-covid-19-restrictions-in-some-spots/story-GAba07cKsz4jv0VISCrNqK.html
05-10-2020||World||2020 Nobel season opens with medicine prize||Breakthroughs in the field of health will be honoured Monday when the 2020 Nobel season kicks off with the medicine prize, as the world battles the worst pandemic in a century.The medicine prize announcement, due at 11:30 am (0930 GMT), will be followed by the physics prize on Tuesday and chemistry on Wednesday.The most closely-watched awards -- for literature and peace -- will follow on Thursday and Friday, while the economics prize wraps things up on Monday, October 12.This year, the coronavirus pandemic has put the global spotlight on research.“The pandemic is a big crisis for mankind, but it illustrates how important science is,” Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten said.No prizes are expected to be awarded this year for work directly linked to the new coronavirus, as Nobel prizewinning research usually takes many years to be verified.The prize-awarding committees are “not in any way influenced by what is happening in the world at the time,” Erling Norrby, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences which awards the science prizes, told AFP.“It takes time before a prize can mature, I would say at least 10 years before you can fully understand the impact” of a discovery, Norrby, himself a virologist, said.The work of the various prize committees is shrouded in secrecy and the names of the nominees are not disclosed for 50 years, leading to rampant speculation.- T-cells, breast cancer, scissors? -Swedish public radio SR and the country’s biggest daily Dagens Nyheter both suggested Monday’s medicine prize could go to French-born Australian Jacques Miller and Max Cooper of the US for their discoveries of T-cells and B-cells in the 1960s, which led to breakthroughs in cancer and virus research.The pair won the prestigious Lasker Prize in the US last year.Or the nod could go to Lebanese-born American geneticist Huda Zoghbi for her discovery of a genetic mutation that leads to the brain disorder Rett Syndrome, both SR and Dagens Nyheter said.Dagens Nyheter also tipped American Mary-Claire King, who discovered the BRCA1 gene responsible for a hereditary form of breast cancer, and researchers who worked on a cure for Hepatitis C, Ralf Bartenschlager of Germany and Americans Charles Rice and Michael Sofia -- a trio also awarded the Lasker Prize in 2016.Two names mentioned frequently are Emmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer Doudna of the US, for their gene-editing technique known as the CRISPR-Cas9 DNA snipping tool, a type of genetic “scissors” used to cut out a mutated gene in a human embryo and replace it with a corrected version.Chinese-born American Feng Zhang also claims to have discovered the technique, which could be eligible for both the medicine and chemistry prize.Others also mentioned include immunologists Marc Feldmann of Australia and Indian-born British researcher Ravinder Maini, for work on rheumatoid arthritis, and American oncologist Dennis Slamon for research on breast cancer and the drug treatment Herceptin.For Tuesday’s physics prize, astrophysicists Shep Doeleman of the US and Germany’s Heino Falcke could win for work that led to the first directly observed image of a black hole in April 2019, according to Dagens Nyheter.SR meanwhile saw it going to American mathematician Peter Shor who paved the way for today’s research on quantum computers, or France’s Alain Aspect for his work on quantum entanglement.For chemistry, SR predicted the honour could go to Christopher Murray for his work on semiconductor nanocrystals or to US gene sequencing pioneer Leroy Hood, while Dagens Nyheter tipped Americans Harry Gray, Richard Holm and Stephen Lippard for work in the field of bioinorganic chemistry.- Greta for peace prize? -Nobel watchers say the peace prize could go to press freedom champions such as Reporters Without Borders or the Committee to Protect Journalists, climate activists such as Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement, or an organisation like the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization or Transparency International.Stockholm’s literary circles saw Canadian poet Anne Carson and American-Caribbean writer Jamaica Kincaid as strong candidates for the literature prize, while Canada’s Margaret Atwood and US authors Marilynn Robinson and Joyce Carol Oates have made Nobel buzz for years.Kenya’s Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Hungary’s Peter Nadas, Albania’s Ismael Kadare, Korea’s Ko Un and France’s Michel Houellebecq are also frequently mentioned, while British novelist Hilary Mantel is a recent addition.map-po/cdw/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-nobel-season-opens-with-medicine-prize/story-ttcOxchStIm1aIUpAZwNCL.html

Mexico’s civil defense agency said in a statement that four of the deaths, including two children, were in Chiapas, where a landslide on a mountainous slope buried their home. The other death was in Tabasco state, where a person was dragged away by the water. Gamma, along with cold fronts, combined over the weekend to cause extreme rains in parts of the Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas, affecting more than half a million people. The hardest-hit state was Tabasco, where more than 3,400 were evacuated to shelters. The storm came ashore Saturday near Tulum with maximum sustained winds of nearly 70 mph (110 kph) — 4 mph (9 kph short of hurricane force), according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami. Mexican authorities continued to warn people in the Yucatan on Sunday afternoon as Gamma remained stalled offshore. The hurricane center said Gamma was about 130 miles (205 kms) northeast of Progreso, Mexico, and had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). The state’s tourism department reported Friday on Twitter that more than 41,000 tourists were present in Quintana Roo, with hotels in Cancun and Cozumel already at more than 30% occupancy. The area only recently reopened to tourism after a pandemic shutdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-gamma-leaves-5-dead-in-southern-mexico/story-iO3QUHtan2U7qDEKCW8yWK.html

If it had been anther 15-20 minutes it would have been a very different story.”Kircher described how residents awoke to find an inferno bearing down on them.“I talked to a gentleman who got up to his dog (barking) in the early hours, opened his door and there was this wall of orange,” he said.“He was the one that set off the town fire alarm and helped to wake people... there’s certainly some scary tales about how close it came to being an absolute disaster with fatalities.”Wildfires are relatively common on the South Island at this time of the year but the scale and intensity of the Ohau fire have been unusual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfires-raze-dozens-of-homes-in-new-zealand/story-I5bIsCOhSypkYiUMaKadcO.html

Trump’s motorcade drove past his supporters who were seen waving at him.Shortly before he left the hospital, Trump posted a video on Twitter, saying “I also think we will pay a little surprise to the patriots that are waiting outside in the streets.”In the video, Trump said that he had “a very interesting journey” where he learned a lot about Covid-19 by going to the “real school” and not the “read the book school”.“It has been a very interesting journey. I learned a lot about Covid-19. I learned by really going to the school and this is the real school and this isn’t the read the book school. And I get it and I understand it,” he said.The US President further said that he is getting great reports from the doctors at Walter Reed. “The work they do is absolutely amazing,” he added.Earlier today, Trump had appreciated his supporters who are outside the Walter Reed hospital as he is being treated for novel coronavirus. “I really appreciate all of the fans and supporters outside of the hospital. The fact is, they really love our country and are seeing how we are making it greater than ever before,” Trump tweeted.His medical team had said that Trump experienced two episodes of blood-oxygen drops during his illness but he is likely to be discharged on October 5 (Monday).On Thursday, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were tested positive for coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-learned-a-lot-about-covid-19-by-going-to-real-school/story-2DU1TwbkGL2A9LEkGazS2L.html
05-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to be discharged soon. How the world’s ‘most powerful man’ got Covid-19||After US President Donald Trump officially announced on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump have been tested positive, the question that has intrigued the world is how Covid-19 could enter the White House and incapacitate the world’s ‘most powerful man’. The questions have inevitable led the focus to the crowded Rose Garden event held on September 26, and something more.Donald Trump has been on the campaign trail for quite some time now. Going over his precaution pattern, the nature of meetings that he had, the Rose Garden event has been zeroed in on as a possible ‘superspreader’, but might not be the origin of the Trumps’ infections. Here are the points highlighted by several experts who traced back the journey of Covid-19 in the White House1. It was a crowded event. Social distancing was not maintained. Even not everybody had a mask on, going by the photographs.Also Read: Donald Trump ‘learned a lot’ about Covid-19 by going to ‘real school’2. It was an event to formally announce Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court. Videos and photos of the event have revealed that those who were present at the event shook their hands, even hugged each other. This is the Rose Garden event now known as the #RoseGardenMassacre.We are now seeing the results of this event.Please don't forget that the GOP bullied, threatened, and toiled to make sure that *THIS* was Every. Classroom. In. America. pic.twitter.com/b0o11p57ON3. Social distancing norms were thrown to the wind as far as seating arrangements were concerned. The chairs were not at all six feet apart. 4. Gatherings of more than 50 people at an event are banned under Washington DC, but the White House is exempt.5. Seven people who attended are now confirmed to have the virus. They are New Jersey ex-Governor Chris Christie, Kellyanne Conway, who resigned as Mr Trump’s senior adviser in August, Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, North Carolina senator Thom Tillis, Reverend John Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame — apart from Trump and Melania. A journalist has also tested positive.6. Donald Trump and Melania Trump were not wearing masks. Kellyanne Conway was sitting in the second row — just behind Melania, and was also without a mask. Also Read: Indian-American Trump supporters hold prayer vigil to wish for his speedy recovery7. Chris Christie and John Jenkins were sitting in the next two rows. they were also without masks. Mike Lee and Thom Tillis were sitting on the other side. Thom Tillis, however, was wearing a mask.8. Amy Coney Barrett who was standing next to the President has however tested negative. 9. While the event might be a superspreader, it is not clear whether the Trumps got their infection from the event. They got themselves tested after Hope Hicks, Trump’s communication director who travelled with Trump extensively in the recent past, tested positive. She was not present at the Rose garden event.10. Several reports said Trump held an indoor fund-raiser with his supporters — before the Rose Garden event — while the White House was aware of Hope Hicks’ test results.

05-10-2020||India||Kejriwal proclaims ‘war on pollution’||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced a “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virudh” (war against pollution) campaign, with a seven-point action plan ranging from measures to control dust and mitigate hot spots, to a mobile application for complaints to a “war room” for monitoring.Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said the activities under this programme will continue through the winter months, when pollution peaks and plunges Delhi into a public health emergency year after year.He said keeping pollution levels low was even more crucial than usual this year because Covid-19 directly affects the lungs of those infected by it, and pollution could make the situation worse.“October has started, and we know that every year, the level of pollution rises in the months of October, November, and December in the Capital. One of the biggest reasons for this rise in pollution is the burning of crop stubble in Delhi and the nearby areas, due to which farmers and their families have to bear the maximum brunt of the pollution caused by stubble burning,” he said, reiterating the state government’s position that farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were the biggest components to the spike in bad air in Delhi.The chief minister did not mention the odd-even road rationing scheme, which was one of the biggest innovations by the government to attempt to control vehicular emissions, and which is part of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) enforced under certain conditions by the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca).When asked if Delhi will see another odd-even drive, a Delhi government spokesperson said, “We have stringently followed Grap in the past and will continue enforcing it in the future too.”Experts said that while the steps taken by the government were welcome, the real test would lie in their implementation.Unveiling the components of the anti-pollution campaign, Kejriwal said the first action point of the campaign was to control stubble burning within Delhi.“This year, Pusa Agricultural Research Institute has devised a very cheap and simple solution. They have formulated a fermented liquid solution which is to be sprayed on the fields to soften the stubble and prevent its burning. This year, the Delhi government will spray the solution on the basmati rice farm fields for free. If this technique is successful in Delhi, we can tell the other states to implement the same to prevent stubble burning. The Delhi government is preparing the mixture in Delhi on a large scale, and the process will start tomorrow under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute,” Kejriwal said.The second point is an anti-dust drive in which construction sites will be strictly and regularly monitored, municipal corporations will carry out mechanical sweeping of roads, smog guns will be used, and road-owning agencies will be asked to fill potholes to prevent road dust. The government has identified 13 major hot spots across the city where Kejriwal said an “area-specific” action plan will be executed. The areas are Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri -- all classified as hot spots by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last year based on high particulate matter (PM) concentration. “We will be launching the Green Delhi App this month. If you witness a source of pollution, including vehicular and industrial emissions, click a photo, and post it on the app. We have specified a deadline for each type of complaint. I will personally monitor the grievance redressal. We are also creating a ‘war room’ against pollution for monitoring of various measures that are implemented and have to be implemented in the coming days. I will get the daily report of the frequency, impact and success of these activities,” the chief minister said, adding that more activities will be added under the campaign in the coming months.He also talked about two policies which the Delhi government has been working on for more than a year now -- the Delhi tree transplantation policy, and the Delhi electric vehicle policy. “The tree transplantation policy will be passed in about 10 days. Under the policy, if an agency cuts a tree for, say, construction purposes, they have to ensure scientific transplantation of a minimum of 80% of affected trees, over and above the compensatory afforestation of planting of 10 saplings. Also, the subsidies under the notified EV policy will also be soon rolled out,” Kejriwal said.The head of the SC-appointed Epca, Bhure Lal, said several measures announced under the campaign were steps which authorities anyway have to carry out during the winter months under the Grap every year. “What is important is the enforcement -- be it burning of waste, use of unapproved fuels by industries or construction companies adhering to dust -control norms. The agencies, including municipal corporations have to ensure strict enforcement of all measures given in the action plan, especially during the prevailing Covid pandemic. Polluted air affects lungs, which can further complicate the situation with Covid-19 also affecting the lungs,” Bhure Lal added. Kejriwal also appealed to the neighbouring states to control pollution by supporting farmers in providing a free alternative to burning stubble, and called for problems being faced by thousands of brick kilns in Delhi’s vicinity to be addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-proclaims-war-on-pollution/story-wplEFJfKFDDgxIc6XYzgFK.html
05-10-2020||India||Looking for some untold stories of UP: Ajit Arora||After making a critically acclaimed film ‘377: Ab Normal’, producer Ajit Arora is currently busy with a Marathi flick ‘Unaad’ and is all geared up for a Punjabi film which he may direct. But, for his Hindi directorial debut he is looking forward to set the story in Uttar Pradesh. “I did a recce in UP before the lockdown. I travelled to Lucknow, Varanasi and beyond. I was scouting for new stories or an existing content which is deep rooted in the culture. I met a lot of people, tried to gauge the flavour of the belt. Creatively, I am trying to pick-up a real story of athletes or achievers which I may direct,” he said. He was mesmerised with the richness of culture and heritage of Lucknow and Varanasi. “I want to incorporate Northern culture and make it a part of my script. Not just the protagonist, I want to weave in the culture part with multiple layered characters intertwined around it.” Exploring stories, he met Commonwealth Games bronze medalist weightlifter Swati Singh and others. Talking more about his work Ajit said, “I have directed couple of web films but for a feature film you need a big canvas and an untold story. I may even play a role in my directorial but that is still indecisive.” The state capital played a big role in his film ‘377: Ab Normal Hai’. “Yes, we did show the Lucknow-based Barosa Trust which led the fight for LGBT rights though we shot for the part in Mumbai.” He discreetly mentions that a sequel of the film is on the story-board stage. Currently, his Marathi film, directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, is being shot in Konkan belt and his production house is next gearing up for Punjabi film.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/looking-for-some-untold-stories-of-up-ajit-arora/story-C2nKIpdfBl0FaA1UaVUh2N.html

05-10-2020||India||IAF chief Bhadauria does not rule out procurement of more Rafale fighter jets||Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Monday did not rule out procurement of more Rafale jets, and said the induction of the French-made multi-role aircraft has given the Indian Air Force an operational edge to strike “deep and hard”.The Chief of Air Staff also said the government is concentrating on procurement of 83 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas (Mark 1A), 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) and having upgraded versions of the LCA besides focusing on indigenous development of the ambitious advanced medium combat aircraft.Asked whether the IAF was keen on having at least two more squadrons of Rafale jets, Bhadauria said it is a complex subject and that “various options” are being deliberated upon based on the future requirement of the force.“The entire subject is under discussion and debate,” the Chief of Air Staff said at a press conference. On induction of the first fleet of Rafale, he said,”the integration of Rafales brings in a platform armed with weapons, sensors and technologies that is way ahead and gives us an operational and technological edge in this area. “Combined with upgraded op capabilities of our current fighter fleet, it gives us the ability to shoot first and strike deep and hard, even in contested airspace.” The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.There has been a view among some officials in the military establishment that the IAF should at least have four squadrons of Rafale jets considering its operational aspects. There are 18 aircraft in a squadron.They think it will be the “cheapest option” as the cost of research and development for all India-specific enhancements have already been covered in the previous deal.the Chief of Air Staff also cited budget constraints as one of the factors in taking any decision (regarding procurement), In April last year, the IAF issued an RFI (request for information) or initial tender to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion, which is billed as one of the world’s biggest military procurements in recent years.The top contenders for the deal include Lockheed’s F-21, Boeing’s F/A-18, Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft MiG 35 and Saab’s Gripen.“Whether we go in for more Rafale or MRFA, it will be an open competition... The current status is that we have received all the RFIs (for the MRFA programme). All these issues are on the table now in terms of taking a final call....There are various issues that need to be considered,” he said.It is learnt that a preliminary discussion on a possible procurement of another batch of 36 Rafale jets by India from France figured during the talks between the two sides in the past one year, as the French officials are making efforts to push for a government-to-government deal.Ten Rafale jets were delivered to India so far and five of them stayed back in France for imparting training to IAF pilots. A second batch of four to five Rafale jets are likely to arrive in India by November.According to officials, Rafale jet would also take part in the Air Force Day parade on 8 October.Bhadauria said the IAF would get 3-4 Rafales after every 2-3 months till supply of the entire fleet of 36 is completed.The Rafale jets, known for air-superiority and precision strikes, are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.Known for air-superiority and precision strikes, the Rafale jets are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The newly inducted fleet has been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter border row for the last five months.“We have operationalised the recently acquired Rafale, Chinook, and Apache aircraft and integrated them into our current concept of operations in record time,” the IAF Chief said.“In the next three years we will see the Rafale and LCA MK1 squadrons operating with full strength, along with additional Su-30 and Mig 29 aircraft, that are being ordered in addition to the current fleets,” he said.Bhadauria said the mid-life operational upgrade of Mirage-2000, MiG-29 and Jaguar fleet would add to the IAF’s capability in this period, thereby further enhancing not only their operational capability but overall potential.“We have a focussed modernisation programme of our existing fleets to integrate and concentrate on latest weapons, systems, sensors, and technologies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-bhadauria-does-not-rule-out-procurement-of-more-rafale-fighter-jets/story-oSLPPLTCHJc1ggbcfCT0lI.html

Led by Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra, the delegation met the family members and enquired about the details of the case. Later, talking to newspersons, Mishra said she will be handing over a report of the case to Priyanka Gandhi soon and also meet Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. She said her party demands proper security for the victim’s family and immediate arrest of all culprits. We also demand a compensation of Rs one crore for the family and a government job for one of family members, she said. To a question, Mishra said crime rises under a government which gives shelter to criminals and the BJP government in the state is an example of that. She cited the Unnao rape case and Chinmayanand case among others to stress the point. The 22-year-old Scheduled Caste woman died while being taken to a hospital after she was allegedly raped last week. Both the accused in the incident have been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-directives-of-priyanka-gandhi-9-member-congress-delegation-meets-balrampur-rape-victim-s-kin/story-efeo5nOpqfjIZp6EmIlAwJ.html

Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and Indian Army chief General MM Naravane concluded a two-day visit to Myanmar on Monday with the focus on taking forward bilateral ties in areas ranging from economic cooperation to security. This was the first time an Indian delegation to Myanmar included both officials. Suu Kyi received a consignment of 3,000 vials of drug Remdesivir from the Indian side for treating Covid-19 patients. India announced a quota for importing 150,000 tonnes of urad dal from Myanmar till March 2021, and a grant of $2 million for building a bridge at Byanyu-Sarsichauk in Chin state to ramp up economic connectivity between Mizoram and Myanmar, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.During their meeting with Suu Kyi at the foreign ministry in Naypyitaw, Shringla and Naravane discussed the “possibility of joint production of Covid-19 vaccine, operationalisation of the Sittwe port in the early part of 2021 and conducting vocational training programmes for youth in Rakhine state”, Myanmar’s foreign ministry said in a Facebook post. The two sides discussed ways to further advance bilateral relations and strengthen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, connectivity, transport, energy, development projects, capacity building and people to people linkages, the foreign ministry said. The Indian side proposed the construction of a petroleum refinery in Thanlyn area near Yangon with an investment of around $6 billion, the people cited above said. “This will ensure energy security and the project would be a win-win arrangement for both countries,” said a person who declined to be named.The Indian delegation also met the commander-in-chief of Myanmar’s defence forces, senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyitaw, and discussed issues of bilateral importance. “Security and defence cooperation between the two sides is quite robust. Both countries are committed to not allowing the use of their territories against the security interests of the other. In this context, the handing over of 22 cadres of India insurgent groups by Myanmar was appreciated,” said the person cited above.During the visit, the project agreement was signed between Myanmar’s ministry of agriculture, livestock and irrigation and the Indian embassy for upgrading an agricultural mechanisation sub-station to promote custom hiring services under the Rakhine State Development Programme. The project will address challenges in agricultural productivity and is expected to improve the socio-economic status of the people in Rakhine, the people said.“India, as a close friend and partner of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, has a deep interest to see an early stabilisation of the situation in Rakhine state. India supports the safe, sustainable, and speedy repatriation of displaced persons from Bangladesh to Rakhine state based on the understanding between Bangladesh and Myanmar,” a second person said. “India fully understands the urgency of this situation and has committed itself to humanitarian efforts in Myanmar and Bangladesh to facilitate an early return of the displaced persons. India has provided five tranches of relief supplies to Bangladesh and is willing to do more,” the second person added.The Centre of Excellence in Software Development and Training (CESDT) at Myitkyina in Kachin state was also inaugurated. Under the ASEAN-India Cooperation Fund, New Delhi will set up IT infrastructure for advanced training using conventional and virtual classrooms and e-learning technologies. A liaison office of the Indian embassy in Naypyitaw was also inaugurated at a ceremony attended by Soe Han, permanent secretary of Myanmar’s foreign ministry, Shringla, Indian envoy Saurabh Kumar, and senior officials of both sides. The people described this as a significant step towards establishing an embassy in Naypyitaw.The operationalisation of Myanmar’s Sittwe port, as part of the Kaladan transit transport project, is part of India’s plans to boost connectivity with the landlocked northeastern states. India also wants enhanced security cooperation to counter the activities of militant groups, especially along the borders in Manipur and Nagaland, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-myanmar-discuss-operationalisation-of-sittwe-port-indian-side-announces-new-initiatives/story-gqnSFtu6qjABGzxK5i33AP.html
05-10-2020||India||India tests missile-assisted system to target submarines at long ranges||In a significant capability demonstration amid border tensions with China, India on Monday successfully tested supersonic missile-assisted release of torpedo (SMART) from a defence facility off the Odisha coast, the defence ministry said. The capability will allow India to target enemy submarines at long ranges, officials said. The system is a missile-assisted release of lightweight anti-submarine torpedo to strike targets way beyond the latter’s range. “All the mission objectives including missile flight up to the (desired) range and altitude, separation of the nose cone, release of torpedo and deployment of velocity reduction mechanism (VRM) have been met perfectly,” a ministry statement said. “This launch and demonstration is significant in establishing anti-submarine warfare capabilities,” it added. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chief G Satheesh Reddy said SMART was a “game changer” technology demonstration in the realm of anti-submarine warfare.Tracking stations (radars, electro optical systems) along the coast and the telemetry stations including ships monitored all the events related to the flight test, the officials said. The @DRDO_India has successfully flight tested the Supersonic Missile assisted release of Torpedo, SMART. This will be a major technology breakthrough for stand-off capability in anti-submarine warfare. I congratulate DRDO and other stakeholders for this significant achievement.Experts said it was an old idea that could find a new application as a land-based delivery system or a ship-borne weapon too. A rocket or missile-launched torpedo is a weapon delivery arrangement that was introduced decades ago by the Soviet as well as the US navies, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd). He said these were capable of striking at relatively shorter ranges with torpedoes or even nuclear depth charges. He said as ship-borne helicopters improved and maritime patrol aircraft became better equipped with sensors; missile-launched torpedo systems did not find favour as onboard weapon and launcher volumes were prioritised for anti-ship, land attack and anti-air missiles. “However, if accurate submarine targeting info is available, then a long-range ordnance delivery capability, especially from ashore could be something that will be useful once again. After all, at this moment, land-based anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft that can deliver ordnance at long ranges are amongst the most effective ways to target submarines. So, a supersonic missile capable of a few hundred kms flight can, in theory, drop a capable lightweight torpedo at the best-known position of an enemy submarine,” Shrikhande said. He said an effective torpedo as the payload was very important. “Ultimately, the deployment of the SMART system would depend on costs and mission needs of the navy,” he added. India has conducted a series of significant weapon tests in recent weeks. On Saturday, India tested a new version of the nuclear-capable hypersonic Shaurya missile that has a range of 750 km, days after the extended-range BrahMos supersonic cruise missile was successfully tested. The cruise missile can hit targets 400 km away --- its range increased from the existing 290 km.On September 7, India took the first steps towards developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence, with the DRDO carrying out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time. Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-maneuvering hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tests-missile-assisted-system-to-target-submarines-at-long-ranges/story-E37QiFHLADDwHUiM0QmCBN.html
05-10-2020||India||‘Game of intimidation’: Congress after multiple CBI raids on DK Shivakumar||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday carried out simultaneous raids across the country against Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar and his brother DK Suresh, alleging that they had amassed disproportionate assets (DA) worth Rs 74.93 crore, people familiar with the development said. The agency has alleged that while serving as a cabinet minister in Karnataka, between April 1, 2013 and April 30, 2018 – when Shivakumar held the portfolio of state energy minister his family members amassed illegal wealth to the tune of Rs 74 crore, which is 44.93% of their total income during this period. The CBI acted against Shivakumar on the basis of a sanction accorded to it by the Karnataka government on September 25, 2019 after the Enforcement Directorate (ED), during a money laundering probe, found that there is scope for an investigation under the Prevention of Corruption Act. After the state government gave a go-ahead to the CBI to investigate Shivakumar, the Centre too asked the agency to probe his role and others in February this year. The CBI filed a preliminary enquiry (PE) – a precursor to the FIR – in March this year, which, prime facie, revealed that DK Shivakumar amassed the ill-gotten wealth in his name and in the name of his family members. CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said that raids were conducted at 14 locations - including Karnataka, Delhi, Mumbai and at the premises of Shivakumar and others which led to recovery of Rs 57 lakh cash and several incriminating property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk, etc.Officials said that the searches started at 6 am at their residence located in Doddallahalli village in Kanakapura constituency, which is represented by Shivakumar in the state assembly. DK Suresh represents Bengaluru Rural in the Lok Sabha.According to the CBI FIR, reviewed by HT, preliminary inquiry revealed that Shivakumar and his family members had moveable and immovable assets worth Rs 33.92 crore before April 2013, according to his 2013 election affidavit. Between April 2013 and April 2018, the Congress leader and his family members acquired assets, movable and immovable to the tune of Rs 128 crore and the total value of the assets held by them at the end of the said period was at Rs 162 crore, said the CBI FIR. The FIR adds that their total income and receipts during these five years was Rs 166 crore while their total expenditure was Rs 113 crore. “Therefore, they are found to be in possession of assets disproportionate to the tune of Rs 74.93 crore which is 44.93% of their total income and the same cannot be satisfactorily explained by the accused,” the FIR adds. Congress instantly condemned the raids, calling it a political vendetta and an “insidious game of intimidation”.“The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar won’t deter us. CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’!” Randeep Singh Surjewala, the Congress’ national spokesperson, tweeted.“Let Modi & Yeddyurappa Govts & BJP’s frontal organizations i.e CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers & leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts. Our resolve to fight for people & expose BJP’s maladministration only becomes stronger,” he added.Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by the ED. He is currently out on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/game-of-intimidation-congress-after-multiple-cbi-raids-on-dk-shivakumar/story-Gqk4CFezGTfYuyGoMmGrPP.html

Citing imposition of Section 144, the police made Congress leaders return to Delhi on their first attempt. Yesterday, Bhim army chief Chandrashekhar Azad met the Hathras family and demanded ‘Y’ category security for them.Continuing his attack on the opposition, the CM lashed out at the Samajwadi Party rule, alleging it was synonymous with lawlessness. He also said that the Bahujan Samaj Party was synonymous with corruption and dismissed the Congress as a party without any political space or standing in the state. “That is why it’s clear that the BJP is up against none and would register an emphatic win in all the seven bypoll seats in the state,” he said. CM Adityanath was addressing cadres through a virtual connect campaign in Tundla, one of the seven assembly segments where bypolls will be held on November 3. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh also addressed the cadre. “There are forces that are not happy with development and progress the country and the state are making and are constantly engaged in whipping up caste and communal riots. In fact, in some recent incidents, conspiracies hatched by them have been detected and unravelled. We will have to respond to this through positive, development-oriented work,” the chief minister said. On Sunday, while virtually launching the BJP’s by-poll campaign from Naugawan Sadat assembly segment in Amroha, CM Adityanath had accused the opposition parties of attempting to whip up caste and communal riots/violence in the state and urged the cadres to be wary of their designs. The chief minister said due to Covid-19, there won’t be any big political meetings during the bypolls. He urged the cadres to focus on a door-to-door contact campaign. “Take up the door-to-door campaign while moving around in small groups and following all necessary precautions,” he told the cadre. The BJP is expected to declare its candidates for the bypolls soon. The state BJP chief also cautioned the cadres against what he called, “nefarious designs of the opposition to whip up trouble in the state”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yogi-adityanath-again-accuses-opposition-of-stoking-caste-violence/story-2cxIOd9Bo87AI6kJaIpyqK.html
05-10-2020||India||‘China can’t get the better of India in conflict scenario’: Air force chief||China can’t get the better of India in any conflict and the air force, with its capability and intent serving as a deterrent for the adversary, is ready to handle any contingency, Indian Air Force chief RKS Bhadauria said on Monday, even as he acknowledged the strengths of the Chinese air force and gave a broad overview of how the IAF would counter it.Asked if the IAF was ready to take on China in the Ladakh theatre, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said, “Of course, we are. There is no question of not taking on the threat there. We are very well positioned there and China can’t get the better of us in any conflict scenario there.” He said India was fully prepared for a two-front war with China and Pakistan. The air force chief was responding to questions from reporters during his annual press conference ahead of the IAF Day on October 8. The IAF chief said there was no question of underestimating the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) as it had made huge investments in “technology, systems and numbers”. He also spoke about the IAF’s assessment of the Chinese J-20 fifth-generation fighter aircraft, calling it “work in progress”. “Their strength lies in the number of surface-to-air systems they have deployed in that area and air-launched long-distance weapons. All that we cater to in our matrix and ensure we are in a position to not only take on their strong points but also deploy our offensive action accordingly,” Bhadauria said, responding to a question from Hindustan Times. “What we do is we integrate our systems and we train to handle such threats based on our assessment. It’s all a combination of training, systems and integration and then the area that we are going to get deployed in,” he said.He added that the PLAAF’s J-20 was a fifth-generation fighter, with advanced sensors and latest technologies but its engine technology was still not fifth-generation. The IAF chief --- short of giving operational details --- has explicitly stated that the IAF is well deployed to meet any threat, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “That no adversary can be taken lightly was also acknowledged by him and that indicates a professional approach to a serious challenge that can come our way,” Bahadur added.Asked if the IAF had come close to launching airstrikes against Chinese targets after the June 15 Galwan Valley skirmish in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, Bhadauria said, “No. But we were prepared for it.” The IAF chief said how things unfold in the Ladakh sector would depend on the outcome of the ongoing talks that were currently progressing slowly. “What we see is an increase in effort to dig in for the winter in terms of forces on ground, and the deployment of air assets. We hope that the talks will progress in the right direction,” he said.Responding to a question on the DBO airstrip in eastern Ladakh, the IAF chief said it was a “big threat” to the Chinese as India had the capability to operate aircraft so close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC).On China using air bases in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, including Skardu, and the possibility of a two-front war, the IAF chief said, “Whether China will use Skardu is an open-ended question. But if China needs Pakistan’s help to confront us, I have nothing to say. If Skardu gets used by China and we are in conflict with China, then it’s a collusive threat. And we will deal with it accordingly,” Bhadauria said. He said the IAF was prepared for any kind of conventional conflict, including a two-front war. “We have full capability for a two-front war,” he said. Earlier in his opening address, the IAF chief said the integration of Rafale fighter jets brought in a platform armed with advanced weapons, sensors and technologies that gave the IAF an operational and technological edge.“Combined with upgraded operational capabilities of our current fighter fleet, it gives us the ability to shoot first and strike deep and hard, even in contested airspace,” the IAF chief said.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016, of which five jets have arrived. The IAF is operating its Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert. “Our immediate offensive deployment of combat-ready units in response to the stand-off along the LAC in the north is indicative of our operational state. We are determined to handle any contingency --- undoubtedly our capability and intent would deter. Our airlift capability was also brought into focus as we supported the Indian Army in rapid mobilisation of troops and equipment to operational areas at a pace which our adversary didn’t expect,” Bhadauria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-can-t-get-the-better-of-india-in-conflict-scenario-air-force-chief/story-AdJJIbyGRJEWxrINbaCuLJ.html

While there have been demands to get a second opinion on this, political parties of Maharashtra are unanimously questioning the need for a CBI probe. Minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy has said that the CBI probe is going on and unless CBI report is out, he won’t comment on this issue. “The CBI is still conducting its investigation into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. As a minister of the Indian government, I would not like to present any of my observations in this matter until the CBI probe is completed and a report published,” the minister told ANI.The CBI also issued a statement reiterating that the probe is going on and no angle is being dismissed by the agency.  The CBI is still conducting its investigation into #SushantSinghRajput's death. As a minister of the Indian government, I would not like to present any of my observations in this matter until the CBI probe is completed & a report published: GK Reddy, Union Minister https://t.co/I8BQClJDV0AIIMS has also refused to comment on this controversy as the report has now been given to the investigating agency. “The Medical Board has submitted the report directly to the Central Bureau of Investigation as required. Being a legal matter, any inputs on the report submitted by the Medical Board would have to be obtained from the CBI,” it has said.While there are claims that the AIIMS foresnic team head Dr Sudhir Gupta changed his opinion, Sushant Singh Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh has officially said “the doctor who is part of AIIMS team had told me long back that the photos sent by me indicated 200% that it’s death by strangulation and not suicide.” Singh also said he would approach the CBI to constitute a fresh forensic team. Sena leader Sanjay Raut alleged that since the beginning there has been a conspiracy to malign the Maharashtra government and the Mumbai police, which were earlier investigating Rajput’s death.“It (AIIMS report) is as per the reports of Dr Sudhir Gupta, who is the head of AIIMS Forensic Medical Board in Sushant Singh Rajput death case. He doesn’t have any political connection or any links with the Shiv Sena,” Raut said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-probe-latest-updates-what-home-ministry-and-aiims-are-saying/story-FXvUxFbWiT1UQ0j25v1B7H.html

Many electronic devices and phones were seized from them. Some of the arrested include IT professionals.The accused were identified and arrested with the help of Cyberdom (specialised wing of cyber police), Interpol and other agencies, said Abraham. Most of the seized material pertains to children between the age group of 6-15 years. Officials have code-named the operation ‘P Hunt 20.2’ and carried out intense searches at various places across the state in the last three weeks.“The biggest impact of the pandemic, besides health issues, is online crime. True, lockdown has increased digital usage and this also spiked use in pornography, especially involving minor children. Many think that darknet use will go unnoticed but they are mistaken. In many cases, it looks like sickness that requires medical treatment as many are repeat offenders,” said Abraham, a decorated specialised officer in cyber crime.During the raid, Cyberdom also found that some of the users had formatted their smart phones every three days to avoid detection. Use of malwares to activate the webcams of the victim and to steal information of children was also detected. “Many obscene pictures, videos inside homes have been uploaded in recent times, which clearly show that most of the pictures have been taken from Kerala,” he said, adding abuse of children locked up in their homes was quite evident in many cases. Last year, the Kerala police had constituted a special wing called Counter Child Sex Exploitation (CCSE) with special emphasis on preventing online child exploitation and child pornography. The team works in close contact with different agencies - Interpol, Crime Against Children unit and International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC).Watching and sharing child pornographic images, videos and literature is a crime in the country and offence can invite a five-year-jail term and maximum fine of Rs 10 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-pornography-spiked-during-lockdown-41-arrested-in-kerala-cops/story-gni3MpcT4jGdzWqnnIGlbP.html

The CBI conducted simultaneous raids at multiple locations across the country, including residences as well as business establishments, connected with Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar and his brother DK Suresh. These 14 locations that the probe agency raided include 9 in Karnataka, 4 in Delhi, one in Mumbai.Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by ED in the money laundering case and was lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail under judicial custody.

05-10-2020||India||Virtual BRICS Summit on Nov 17; PM Modi, Xi set for a face-off||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to come face-to-face during the 12th summit of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping to be held virtually on November 17 via video conference. This is also set to be the first virtual multilateral meeting to be joined by the two leaders since the border standoff in Ladakh in May. India’s foreign ministers and defence ministers have participated in other meetings that featured their Chinese counterparts in recent weeks. The BRICS Summit will focus on further strengthening cooperation among the member states amid the Covid-19 crisis, according to a formal announcement on Monday from Russia, the current chair of the grouping. The theme for the meeting will be “BRICS partnership for global stability, shared security and innovative growth”. In May, Russia postponed the BRICS Summit amid Covid-19 pandemic. The Summit was supposed to take place in St Petersburg, Russia, along with a meeting of the heads of state council of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) during July 21-23.Russia, the current chair of the BRICS, had been keen on hosting the leaders of the five countries but several members had expressed apprehensions about holding an actual summit given the risk of infections, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The Russian side formally announced on Monday that the BRICS Summit will be held virtually on November 17 with the theme of “BRICS partnership for global stability, shared security and innovative growth”.“Despite the current global situation due to the spread of the Coronavirus infection, the activities under the Russian BRICS chairmanship in 2020 are carried out in a consistent manner,” said Anton Kobyakov, adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin and executive secretary of the organising committee to prepare and support Russia’s SCO presidency in 2019-20 and BRICS chairmanship in 2020.Also read: China can’t get the better of India in any conflict, we’re fully capable - IAF chief“Since January 2020, more than 60 events have been organised, including via videoconferencing. The BRICS Summit will be the jewel-in-the-crown event of the Russian BRICS chairmanship which will provide an impetus for further strengthening cooperation with our partners to ensure the well-being of the BRICS countries,” he said.Russia has focused on multifaceted cooperation between the BRICS nations to contribute to raising living standards and quality of life, the official statement said.During 2020, the five countries in the grouping continued their close strategic partnership on three major pillars - peace and security, economy and finance, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, it added.Russia has also helped facilitate meetings between India and China, such as the foreign and defence ministers’ meetings on the sidelines of the SCO meet in Moscow last month. The meeting of external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow led to a five-point roadmap for taking forward disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). A meeting of the BRICS’ foreign ministers last month had expressed concern on violence and conflicts in different parts of the world and said such situations should be resolved peacefully through political dialogue. The joint statement issued after the virtual meeting of the foreign ministers didn’t refer to any particular conflict. The grouping has a convention of not taking up bilateral issues between its members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-summit-to-be-held-virtually-on-nov-17-cooperation-strengthening-global-stability-on-agenda/story-Io02j2Xpb81KAx03C13O1M.html

What was the haste to do it at this time? They did it because they thought the farmers won’t be able to do anything, but they don’t know the power of a farmer.”The Congress leader was addressing ‘Kisan Bachao Rally’ in Punjab’s Sangrur.Led by Gandhi, the Congress party is holding tractor rallies from October 4-6 across the state in protest against the three contentious legislations that were passed by Parliament last month and got presidential assent.Here is what Rahul Gandhi said in his rally:- For six years, this government has been attacking the poor, labourers and farmers one after another. If you look at their policies, there is not a single policy that can benefit the poor people.- They said they would do demonetisation to fight black money, but the nation had to stand in long queues outside banks. You put your money in the bank, but Modi ji waived the debt of India’s richest billionaires by taking your money.- GST brought after demonetisation, now you ask any small shopkeeper or small businessman what happened to GST. Till date, the small shopkeeper or businessman has not understood GST.- Demonetisation, GST etc. is all a way to target the small shopkeepers or small and medium businesses. You have to understand that Narendra Modi ji is making the way for Adani and Ambani.- At the time of Corona, we asked Narendra Modi to help the poor, hungry labourers walking thousands of kilometers. We said help small traders, but Modi ji still did not take any step.- This country will not be able to provide employment to its youth in the coming time because Modi ji has ruined the system of employment generation.- Everyone knows that this system needs to be changed, farmers need to be given infrastructure, markets need to be created but Narendra Modi is not even trying to strengthen this system. Narendra Modi ji is only destroying this system. While he should guarantee MSP, with these three laws he is killing farmers and labourers, slashing their throats.- Today, if a farmer has a problem in the mandi, then he can put his point across or approach another businessman, but tomorrow our farmers will have Adani on one side and Ambani on the other. The farmer will have only two options - Adani or Ambani. Now you tell whether a farmer can fight them. Can you talk to them? Not at all.- Those who think this will only harm farmers and labourers do not understand the food system of this country. If Adani and Ambani get hold of the agricultural system, every family will have to pay twice the amount of money for food.- I am not standing here just for farmers and labourers, but for all the people of India because not only the working class, the whole country is going to be hit by these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-destroying-farmers-slashing-their-throat-10-things-rahul-gandhi-said-in-punjab/story-6hws15Rj6v28ElZjcQCIuN.html

It has been described as a ‘simple, precise, reliable, scalable and frugal test.’Here’s what you need to know about it:(1.) The testing kit has been named ‘Feluda,’ after a famous character--a detective--created by legendary director Satyajit Ray, though its full name is Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) Feluda test.(2.) It has been developed by researchers at New Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and the TATA Group. It has been priced at Rs 500 and, scientists say, would give a test result in 45 minutes.(3.) Based on a gene-editing technology called Crispr, Feluda, CSIR scientists say, was tested on samples of 2,000 people, including those who had already tested positive for coronavirus. It was found to have 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity.(4.) A ‘sensitive’ test is one which detects almost everyone who has the disease. A ‘specific’ test, on the other hand, rules out almost everyone who doesn’t have a disease. The accuracy of any test is based on these two aspects.(5.) The Feluda test kit is quite similar to a pregnancy strip test in that it changes colour on detecting a virus. Having already received approvals from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for a commercial launch, it could also be the world’s first paper-based Covid-19 test kit available in market.(6.) India is currently conducting Covid-19 testing through the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and the rapid antigen test (RAT). While an RT-PCR test gives a result in 1.5 hours, a rapid antigen test takes 30 minutes.(7.) ‘Feluda’ is actually an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay.(8.) India is currently the second worst Covid-19 affected country in the world, after the United States, with a caseload of 66,23,815. This includes 55,86,703 recovered cases and 102,685 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feluda-covid-19-testing-kit-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-it/story-i54p2RFTBGCmbuGI5W8cjN.html

CM Jagan flies to Delhi to meet PM Modi amid buzz||The YSR Congress Party chief and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is set to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, sparking buzz that the party from Andhra Pradesh could join the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. Speculation has been gaining ground that such a move is in the offing.Just last week, Shiromani Akali Dal, NDA’s oldest ally, junked the alliance over its opposition to the controversial farm bills. Last year, it was the Shiv Sena, who jumped ship over the issue of chief ministership in Maharashtra.Jagan Reddy left for New Delhi on Monday evening and is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 10.30 am on Tuesday. “The Prime Minister is likely to invite the YSRCP into the NDA to strengthen his hands,” the party leader said.This is the second visit of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister in the last two weeks. On September 22, Jagan had a two-day visit to Delhi and met Union minister Amit Shah, supposedly to have preliminary discussions on the YSRCP joining the NDA, besides issues pertaining to the state. He, however, could not get the appointment of the Prime Minister then.VDP Associates, a data-analytics firm involved in election surveys, tweeted on Monday: “BJP has reportedly offered 2 cabinet and 1 Minister of State (Independent) to YSRCP. Jagan asked to rush to Delhi for exclusive talks with PM Modi.”However, the YSRCP leader quoted above said PM Modi might offer one cabinet and one minister of state post to the party in the government.With 22 MP seats, the YSRCP is the fourth largest national party. It also has six MPs in Rajya Sabha. From day one of coming into power in Andhra Pradesh in May 2019, Jagan has been maintaining friendly relations with the NDA government.The YSRCP has been supporting every decision of the Modi government both in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. While the NDA’s long-term ally Akali Dal strongly resisted the farm bills, the YSRCP voted in favour of the same. The YSRCP MPs extended support to the BJP in the election of Harivansh Narayan Singh as deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha last week. The Jagan government also accepted the option given by the Modi government for going in for additional borrowings to offset the GST compensation payment by the Centre, though more than 12 states, including Telangana, opposed the same. Jagan also accepted Modi government’s condition to implement power sector reforms as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package, including fixing of meters to the agriculture sector so as to enhance its borrowing limits.“If YSRCP joins the NDA, it will be a win-win situation for both Jagan as well as the BJP,” says political analyst from Visakhapatnam Mallu Rajesh.The BJP is looking for new political allies after the quitting of Shiv Sena and Akali Dal and the YSRC can come in handy in passage of crucial bills, particularly in the Rajya Sabha. On the other hand, the YSRCP needs the support of the Modi government at the Centre to sustain the state’s financial position. “At the same time, Jagan is still facing the CBI case in an alleged quid pro quo case, while his kin are under CBI scanner in connection with the murder of his uncle YS Vivekananda Reddy. Jagan is also keen on getting a CBI probe ordered into the alleged land scam in Amaravati involving his bete noire N Chandrababu Naidu. So, joining the NDA will make things easy for him,” Rajesh said.In an interview to HT last month, Jagan made it clear that his party would place the interests of the state above everything else.“Our support will be issue-based and will involve the betterment of our state in every aspect,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-ysr-congress-joining-nda-cm-jagan-flies-to-delhi-to-meet-pm-modi-amid-buzz/story-iiDTlDrIqtQ26FZyph1VsN.html

05-10-2020||India||Court reserves order on Kangana Ranaut’s compensation for demolition plea||The Bombay high court on Monday reserved its order in actor Kangana Ranaut’s petition seeking compensation as damages for demolition at her Mumbai bungalow by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation last month.The actor had also alleged that the demolition was a counterattack to the tweets exchanged between her and Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut after her criticism of the Maharashtra government and Mumbai police.The Mumbai civic body and Raut had refuted the actor’s claims, arguing that the demolition was carried out after 14 unauthorised additions and alterations which were not as per sanctioned plans were detected in the bungalow on September 5.On Monday, the advocates of all parties informed the division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla that they had filed written submissions in compliance with the September 25 directions of the bench. The submissions elaborated the arguments forwarded by the respective parties in the course of the hearing which started on September 9. After Kangana Ranaut approached the court, it ordered a stay on any further demolition exercise at the actor’s Pali Hill bungalow. It also allowed the actor to amend her petition as the one before it was not filed in the proper format and was incomplete. In the amended petition, she not only sought a stay on the demolition but also a compensation of Rs 2 crore for the damage caused to the bungalow. Senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf for the actor had argued that the demolition was illegal as she was given only 24 hours to respond to the stop work notice issued by the designated officer on September 8 and even though she had responded to the notice, the civic authority did not pay heed and went ahead with the demolition. Dr Saraf had submitted that the demolition was premeditated and undertaken at the behest of Raut. Dr Saraf had also submitted that the invocation of section 354 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act by the civic body was not valid as there was no ongoing work in the bungalow except for waterproofing and the alterations and additions alleged by the BMC had been completed in January. However, senior counsels Aspi Chinoy and Joel Carlos for the BMC refuted the allegations and stated that the detection on September 5 and the inspection on September 7 had revealed that there was ongoing work of finishing on the illegal alteration and addition undertaken by the actor. They also contended that since the actor had not shown any permissions for doing the same, the BMC was justified in demolishing the structure and that a 24-hour notice was served.The BMC also denied that the demolition was at the behest of Raut and stated that the detection on September 5 was made at 1 pm and the Twitter spat between the actor and Raut started at 5pm. Raut, in his affidavit filed through advocate Pradeep Thorat, refuted the actor’s allegation that he was behind the demolition. While admitting that he had referred to the actor in a TV interview he had not abused her but only meant to say that she was dishonest as she was speaking against Mumbai and Maharashtra. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for designated officer of the H West Ward of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Bhagyawant Late, had submitted that the allegation of malice made by the actor was unfounded and the claims for compensation could not be dealt with in the writ petition. He said the actor has the option of filing a suit for claims. After hearing all sides, the bench had observed that the BMC had shown exceptional swiftness in carrying out demolition and had it been so efficient in other cases Mumbai would have been very different. The court had then asked all parties to submit their arguments in writing. After receiving the written submissions on Monday, the court said that it was reserving the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-reserves-order-on-kangana-ranaut-s-compensation-for-demolition-plea/story-2iwuCxxHMn9K7RPGoV340L.html

Along with ashes brought in urns, 100 kilograms of milk was also offered by volunteers of the Delhi-based Shri Devothan Sewa Samiti, which has been organising collection of ashes of unknown people and the immersion of the same for the past two decades. Owing to Covid-19 restrictions since mid-March, the Samiti volunteers faced problems in collecting remains but after restrictions were eased, a large number of volunteers arrived and took part in the immersion rituals. On Sunday, prior to leaving for Delhi, Samiti volunteers hoped that more and more people join them in this social initiative so that no urn remains unattended. “It’s a spiritual feeling when we immerse these mortal remains collected from across the country for the past year. In Hindu Sanatan dharma, the immersion of ashes paves way for the salvation of the soul of the deceased. So, we felt these unattended urns need to be immersed in Ganga so that these people find salvation. We feel immense spiritual satisfaction by doing this and this motivates us to continue doing this in the coming years too,” said Anil Narendra, president of the Shri Devothan Sewa Samiti. Local organisations of Haridwar like Nishakam Sewa trust, Aggarwal Sewa Sadan, Kanwad Sewa Samit, Mahamai Sewa Nyas, Siddhdata Manav Sewa Samiti also assisted the Delhi-based volunteers in ash immersion rituals at Sati Ghat in Kankhal. “As per Vedic scriptures like Garuda Purana, last rites rituals are completed only after the ash immersion rituals are performed properly. Deity Ganga is the salvation provider and immersion of mortal remains in the holy river provides immediate salvation to the deceased souls,” said Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Panchayat Akhada Bada Udasin Harichetnanand Maharaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashes-of-4-896-unknown-people-from-delhi-ncr-immersed-in-ganga-in-haridwar/story-MDzSeh32SG7on6iImJuIyH.html

The ruling CPI (M) said Sangh Parivar outfits were behind the murder of P U Sanoop but local people said a clash between two groups led to the murder. Police also ruled out political angles in the latest killing. “Police can find out the motive only after investigation. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) will probe the murder,” Thrissur police commissioner A Aditya said after visiting the crime scene.Police said they identified four accused and they would be arrested soon. Three other party workers were also injured in the clash. State Local Self government minister A C Moideen, who hails from the area, was first to blame Sangh Parivar outfits but BJP and RSS leaders denied any role in the murder. “It is a political murder. Bajrang Dal activists and some members of right wing groups committed this heinous crime,” said the minister after visiting the spot.CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also said it was a political murder. But the Bajrang Dal said it did not have a unit or workers in the area where the murder took place. Local people said tension was brewing in the area between two groups and Sanoop, CPI(M) branch secretary, came there to broker peace but it fizzled out and clashes began. “It was a clash between two groups of goons. The ruling party is on the back foot after a number of corrupt deals including gold smuggling, drug seizure and Life Mission project. It wants to divert attention from these incidents so all criminal incidents are being branded as political violence by the party,” said BJP spokesman B Gopalakrishnan. On August 30 two activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the youth wing of the CPI(M), were stabbed to death in a similar incident in Venjarammoodu in Thiruvananthapuram and the party had blamed the Congress for the twin murders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-worker-stabbed-to-death-in-kerala-marxists-blame-right-wing-groups/story-Yzah57CsNjd6e44PgZY2HJ.html

05-10-2020||India||Bad Boy Billionaires: Sid Mallya says his father is a ‘political pawn who was made an example of’||Former liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s son Siddharth Mallya, appearing in the Netflix docuseries Bad Boy Billionaires has said that his father is a “political pawn” as “they (the government) need a man to make an example of”. Mallya has spoken for the first time since the bank fraud worth Rs 9,000 crore involving his father came to light. The controversial docuseries was released on Monday morning with three episodes on Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Sahara India chief Subrata Roy after a month-long legal battle. However, the fourth episode on the founder of Saytam Computer Services founder B Ramalinga Raju has not been released by the over-the-top (OTT) platform as a Hyderabad court had ordered a stay on its release. Netflix’s plea challenging the Hyderabad court’s decision is still pending. Mallya said in the docuseries “They are saying he didn’t pay his employees, he looted the banks, he fled from the authorities, he money laundered, he siphoned funds…it’s political and they need a scapegoat. They need a political pawn; they need a man to make an example of.” Also Read: Netflix releases controversial series ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’, sans episode on Ramalinga RajuMallya, who is an actor, added that his father was an easy target because of his lifestyle. “Everyone wants scandal, everyone wants a bit of spice, everyone wants a bit of controversy. You know, he was in a sexy business, making alcohol. It’s not like he was, you know, making steel somewhere or something, it’s a lifestyle brand. Therefore, it’s much easier to target him,” said Mallya. He added that his father revolutionised air travel in India and genuinely tried to save the airline. On his father’s lavish parties, Mallya said, “He (Vijay Mallya) was one of the first people in India who wasn’t afraid of spending his money.” “He was unapologetic (about it),” Mallya added. Vijay Mallya had fled to London in March 2016 and is facing extradition to India. Indian agencies have already won the case in the UK courts but Mallya is learnt to have applied for asylum, which is pending with British authorities. Canadian Indian filmmaker Dylan Mohan Gray, who has directed the opening episode on Vijay Mallya, told Hindustan Times, “I am very happy that the series has finally been released. These films are very important in many ways—both in terms of showing the legal aspect and the fact that Indians will see powerful figures whose stories can be told without them having control over it. I think it’s a very important landmark for freedom of expression in India and all kind of filmmaking in India.” Gray said the film on Vijay Mallya has been made using accounts of people who have had some connection with his life. “There was no preconceived agenda in the film and we have been able to produce an authoritative account on Mallya’s life. I think people will appreciate the film”. Netflix officially refused to comment on the release of film. Bad Boy Billionaires was set to be released originally on September 2 but it hit a legal hurdle with Mehul Choksi, whose name appears in the series; Roy and Raju approached courts seeking stay on the docuseries saying it would affect their trial. A lower court in Araria, Bihar had asked Netflix not to use the name of Subrata Roy, which was challenged by Netflix. Roy had argued that series was an attempt to tarnish his image. Choksi, currently living in Antigua and Barbuda, had approached the Delhi high court through advocate Vijay Aggarwal saying his reputation would suffer great injustice should the series be allowed to stream with references to him and the legal cases pending against him. The Delhi high court had dismissed Choksi’s plea while asking the Centre to regulate digital content. Netflix had rigorously defended the allegations saying the government does not regulate content on OTT. The company also relied on the laws of freedom of speech and expression to argue that the series is like a documentary referring to facts which are widely discussed in the public domain even otherwise and aren’t sub-judice in these circumstances. The Centre had also refused to intervene in the matter saying it does not regulate content on OTT platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bad-boy-billionaires-sid-mallya-says-his-father-is-a-political-pawn-made-an-example-of/story-LcIwPOF2ue6MULYYoEoWYL.html

He doesn’t have any political connection or any links with the Shiv Sena,” Raut said over the AIIMS report saying that the 34-year-old actor died by suicide, according to news agency ANI.“Since the very beginning, in this case, there has been a conspiracy to malign Maharashtra government and Mumbai Police. If now CBI inquiry is also not being trusted, then we’re speechless,” he added.Raut’s remarks came as Rajput’s family plans to request CBI that a new forensic team be formed as they alleged the AIIMS team’s report was inconclusive. “Highly perturbed with AIIMS report. Going to request CBI Director to constitute a fresh Forensic team. How could AIIMS team give a conclusive report in the absence of the body, that too on such shoddy post mortem done by Cooper hospital wherein time of death also not mentioned,” Vikas Singh, the lawyer of Rajput’s father KK Singh, wrote on Twitter.The lawyer had previously claimed that a doctor who part of the AIIMS panel had told him “long back” that the actor’s photos indicated that it was death by strangulation and not suicide.

05-10-2020||India||CAG slams Centre for not monitoring funds for ‘Fortified Police Stations’ in Naxal-hit states||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has slammed the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for its failure to monitor the unutilised funds lying with at least 10 states for the construction of fortified police stations or outposts in 83 districts affected by Left-wing extremist (LWE) violence. The federal auditor has said that the funds amounting to Rs 52.18 crore out of Rs 623 crore was released between 2012 and 2016 for the construction of 400 police stations or outposts in 83 LWE-hit districts of 10 states. Also read: Kanha National Park now a Maoist habitat, say policeBut the funds were still lying unused even three years after the scheme had ceased to be in operation, the CAG has said in a report. The CAG has pointed out that Madhya Pradesh (MP) spent about Rs 3.79 crore on the construction of two additional police stations, which were not part of the scheme, and has cited them as “irregular”. Under the Fortified Police Stations (FPS) scheme, the MHA was tasked to assist the state governments in the construction and strengthening of 400 police stations at a cost of Rs 2 crore each for a police station. The allocation of funds between the Centre and state governments was on a ratio of 80:20.The scheme was aimed at securing the police personnel from the Communist Party of India (Maoist) rebels. The scheme stipulated that high boundary walls, sophisticated control rooms and watchtowers were to be built in each of the 400 designated police stations or outposts in 83 LWE-hit districts of 10 states. The report stated that the MHA had released Rs 623.89 crore between 2011-12 and 2015-16 to 10 states as a part of the Centre’s share. Data showed that until August 2019, 397 police stations were constructed at a cost of Rs 751.33 crore, while the building of three more were still in progress in Bihar. The scheme had ceased to be in operation from April 2016. “The audit has noticed that the MHA while monitoring the scheme through progress reports submitted by the states had failed to recover the unutilised Central share lying with them (the states) on completion of the projects in contravention of the GFRs (General Financial Rules). On this being pointed out by the audit, the MHA sought information about the unutilised Central share from the state governments in May 2018. The status as of September 2019 revealed that in eight states, there were savings, including interests, to the tune of Rs 52.18 crore, while MP had utilised the unutilised Central assistance of Rs 3.79 crore on the construction of two additional police stations,” the report said. The MHA has recovered Rs 22.69 crore, but Rs 33.28 crore is still outstanding from at least eight states, it added.The MHA is yet to respond to HT’s queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-slams-centre-for-not-monitoring-funds-for-fortified-police-stations-in-naxal-hit-states/story-9bB7zApBVnl1pQDPZp589N.html

The party’s assessment is based on data mined from Facebook analytics, which allows monitoring of up to five pages. It shows 13.9 million engagements with Gandhi’s posts during this period. The engagements include comments, likes, and shares. The four other pages monitored as part of the exercise include that of Modi, the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), the Congress, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Also Watch | Rahul Gandhi rides tractor, addresses farmers on Day 1 of Punjab protestModi, who is among the top five most followed world leaders on social media, has 45.9 million followers compared to Gandhi’s 3.5 million on Facebook.

The Congress has 5.6 million followers on Facebook. Gandhi’s followers also grew by 3.5% and he posted 52 times during this period.Modi attended major events, addressed the UN general assembly, and posted 11 times from September 25 to October 2.A Congress functionary said the key variable is engagement. “…although Rahul Gandhi has far fewer followers than Narendra Modi, the former’s engagement levels are much higher that include likes, comments, shares, etc,” the functionary said on condition of anonymity. “It is a key indicator of how audiences are relating to the content.” The functionary added the spike has coincided with protests against the alleged gang-rape and murder of the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras. Gandhi has led Congress’s protests from the front. He managed to meet the woman’s family along with Priyanka Gandhi on Saturday after they were prevented from doing so a day earlier. “I met Hathras victim’s family and understood their pain,” Gandhi posted on Facebook. “I assured them that we will stand by them in this difficult time and help them get justice. UP [Uttar Pradesh] government will not be able to do whatever it wishes even if wants to, because now the whole country is standing to get justice for the daughter of this country.” The post had over 450,000 likes as of Monday morning.

Gandhi has also put out a series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the country’s economy. Dilip Cherian, a communications consultant, said there may be three factors for the surge. “The first is what we call the issue factor. The prime minister has not spoken on Hathras issue and engagement on the same has been very high on Facebook. The second is the ‘newbieness’ factor, which works for Rahul as we have not seen this level of activity from him before; it tends to attract a wider audience. And the third is ‘anti-establishment’ aspect, wherein people gravitate towards a discourse against the ruling dispensation,” he said. “The prime minister is very consistent in his social media posts. Perhaps, his lack of engagement on the issue has led to the surge.”HT reached out to BJP’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya for comments but did not immediately get a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-facebook-page-sees-40-more-engagement-than-narendra-modi-s/story-IJP07yRm0vor9N9UetPjAM.html
05-10-2020||India||Netflix releases controversial series ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’, sans episode on Ramalinga Raju||Netflix, the world’s world’s leading streaming entertainment service, has released its controversial docu-series, “Bad boy Billionaires,” which showcases the alleged fraud committed by business tycoons such as Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Sahara India chief Subrata Roy, after a month of legal tussle. However, the episode on Satyam Computer Services founder B Ramalinga Raju has been held by the over the top (OTT) platform. The digital platform released three episodes on Mallya, Modi and Roy after a court in Bihar’s Araria district on Saturday vacated the stay it had imposed on the release in September from airing the series. “Bad Boy Billionaires” was set to be released originally on September 2, but it had hit a legal hurdle after Mehul Choksi, whose name appears in the series, Roy and Raju approached courts seeking stay on the docu-series saying it would affect their trials. Also Watch | Henry Cavill interview: Enola Holmes star appreciates fan support for Man of SteelPeople familiar with the developments said Raju’s matter is still pending in Hyderabad court, and as a result, the episode on him has not been released.A lower court in Araria had asked Netflix not to use the name of Roy, which was challenged by Netflix. Roy had argued that the series was an attempt to tarnish his image. Choksi, who has taken the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in the Caribbean islands, had approached the Delhi high court (HC) through advocate Vijay Aggarwal saying his reputation would suffer should the series be allowed to stream with references to him and the legal cases pending against him. The Delhi HC had dismissed Choksi’s plea and had asked the Centre to regulate the digital content. Netflix had defended the allegations saying the Indian government does not regulate content on OTT platforms. The American technology and media services provider also relied on the laws of freedom of speech and expression to argue that the series is like a documentary, referring to facts, which are widely discussed in the public domain and aren’t sub-judice. The Centre also refused to intervene in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netflix-releases-controversial-series-bad-boy-billionaires-sans-episode-on-ramalinga-raju/story-5VNA6uQHGcC1f7Hv3bia8N.html
05-10-2020||India||CBI raids Congress’ DK Shivakumar, DK Suresh in alleged corruption case; party calls it political vendetta||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday conducted simultaneous raids at multiple locations across the country, including residences as well as business establishments, connected with Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar and his brother DK Suresh in alleged a corruption case, officials said.The raids by the central agency were immediately condemned by the Congress party, which called it a political vendetta and an “insidious game of intimidation”. The Karnataka government had on September 25, 2019, given sanction to CBI to probe DK Shivakumar under the prevention of corruption act. The case emanates from an ED probe and the anti-money laundering probe agency had arrested Shivakumar last year.“CBI has registered a case against then Minister of Karnataka Government and others on the allegations of acquisition of Disproportionate Assets. Searches are being conducted today at 14 locations including 9 in Karnataka, 4 in Delhi, one in Mumbai. Details will follow,” the agency said in a statement. The case against Shivakumar is for amassing disproportionate assets, it added.The raids by CBI started at 6am at their residence located in Doddallahalli village in Kanankapura constituency, which is represented by Shivakumar in the state assembly. DK Suresh represents Bengaluru Rural in the Lok Sabha. Officials familiar with the development said the locations, including the Delhi residences of Suresh, are being raided by at least 60 officials of the central agency. One of the residences being raided is that of Iqbal Hussain, a close aide of Shivakumar. Officials said CBI has recovered Rs 50 lakh from premises it has searched in the corruption case related to Shivakumar.Several leaders of the Congress party tweeted to condemn the raids.“The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar won’t deter us. CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’!” Randeep Singh Surjewala, the Congress’ national spokesperson, tweeted.“Let Modi & Yeddyurappa Govts & BJP’s frontal organizations i.e CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers & leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts. Our resolve to fight for people & expose BJP’s maladministration only becomes stronger,” he added. The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar won’t deter us.CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt.

We won’t be cowed down and will fight this,” Saleem Ahmed, the Congress state working president, said.The CBI raids were also condemned by senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah. “@BJP4India has always tried to indulge in vindictive politics & mislead public attention.

Suresh appeared on the balcony of his residence and asked the supporters with folded hands to disperse, saying that the officials should be allowed to do their job.Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by ED in the money laundering case and was lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail under judicial custody. He was released a month later after Delhi High Court granted him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-conducts-raids-at-14-locations-related-to-karnataka-congress-leader-dk-shivakumar-brother-dk-suresh/story-F98179bUbamF2KJ4zGrJMM.html
05-10-2020||India||Congress works to sustain Hathras momentum in Uttar Pradesh||The Congress might have leveraged the Hathras incident (the rape and subsequent death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman), but the party now faces the challenge of sustaining the momentum in the country’s politically important state of Uttar Pradesh where it has been relegated to the margins in the past three decades. Images of the Uttar Pradesh Police manhandling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday and his sister and party general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who were on their way to Hathras on Saturday to meet the family of the woman who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday a fortnight after she was allegedly gang-raped in her village, have been shared widely on social media. They also appear to have emboldened party leaders and workers to sharpen their attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) both in the state and Centre. Also Read: Congress to hold ‘satyagraha’ across states to demand justice for Hathras rape victim“These images are disturbing and have agitated not only Congress leaders and workers but the entire country. How can a policeman misbehave with any woman? And this happened to somebody who has Z plus security cover,” said Youth Congress president Srinivas BV. Several Congress leaders, including former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy, compared the Gandhi siblings’ Hathras visit to Indira Gandhi’s visit to Belchi in Bihar in 1977. It is said to have revived the electoral fortunes of the Congress after its humiliating defeat in the 1977 national elections. Indira Gandhi travelled by train, jeep and tractor and rode an elephant to reach Belchi village where 10 Dalits had been massacred. Three years later, the Congress stormed to power in the 1980 Lok Sabha elections. But the BJP described the Gandhi siblings’ visit to Hathras as “political tourism” and accused the Congress of politicising the issue. At the centre of the storm, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said those against development were trying to stoke caste and communal riots in the state. Congress leaders say the party plans to aggressively raise the Hathras issue in the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar and other states (including Uttar Pradesh) where by-polls are going to be held next month. Also Read: Rahul Gandhi vows to scrap contentious farm laws once Congress returns to power at CentreBut the big task for the opposition party will be to ensure that the momentum generated by the Hathras incident is sustained in the run up to the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. In the past too, the party created a buzz on a few occasions but failed to sustain it. The Gandhi siblings, especially Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, were at the forefront of the agitation against the amendment to the citizenship law late last year, visiting families of those killed in violent protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise. The Congress sought to tap the anger of the youth, especially students, against the BJP, but the drive soon fizzled out. Similarly, the party clearly stole the limelight from the Samajwadi party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on the crisis over migrant workers travelling back to Uttar Pradesh during the coronavirus disease-induced nationwide lockdown with its aggressive posturing against the BJP. While the BJP and the Congress slugged it out in the open, the two regional parties – SP and BSP – surprisingly watched the developments from a distance. But after few video messages, the Congress seemingly lost the tempo. This time, however, Congress leaders say they will not let the BJP government go unchecked in UP. “The Hathras incident has shocked India. It has highlighted the state of affairs in UP. Such incidents take place almost every day in the state and law and order has completely collapsed. The BJP government wants to brazen it out but this will not be allowed,” said senior Congress leader Jitin Prasada. “Politics is one thing and the other is actually feeling for the aggrieved. We will be doing what an opposition party has to do but this incident is heart-breaking. We will not allow the BJP government to go unchecked in UP,” he added. One of the reasons identified by political experts for the lack of momentum on any issue is the lack of organisational structure on the ground, given that the party has remained out of power for over three decades since 1989. “Over the years, Congress has ceded its political space to other parties and its traditional vote base has shifted. While its Dalit vote went to BSP, the Muslims sided with SP and the upper castes aligned themselves with the BJP. The Congress has also not taken any concrete steps to strengthen the organisation over the years,” said Allahabad-based political analyst Professor Ramkishor Shastri. “In 2009 Congress won 22 Lok Sabha seats. It could have used that opportunity to build up its organisational structure but it failed to do so,” he added. Having been decimated in UP in the 2017 assembly elections and this year’s Lok Sabha polls, the Congress is struggling to make its presence felt in the state’s political landscape. The party had dominated the politics of UP till the emergence of Mandal-Mandir issues in late 1980s. Over the years, it has been relegated to the political margins. The party even lost its traditional bastion of Amethi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with BJP’s Smriti Irani defeating Rahul Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-eye-on-up-by-polls-congress-works-to-sustain-hathras-momentum/story-b67SEj0FT3DYEdpaICA6ZM.html

Authorities said that this would be a major boost for the city’s infrastructure because the Phoolbagan metro station is located close to the Sealdah railway station which caters to more than a million passengers every day and is one of the busiest railway stations in India. Local trains connect Kolkata with the suburban areas. “Once complete, the East-West Metro will connect two of India’s busiest railway stations – Howrah and Sealdah. With the Phoolbagan station operational, the passenger count of the East-West metro corridor will rise significantly as it is located less than 2.5 km from Sealdah station, which connects Kolkata with the suburban areas and other districts,” said a metro railway official. Phoolbagan is the first underground station in the East-West metro to be commissioned. Travel time from Phoolbagan to the IT hub in Salt Lake’s Sector V will be 16 minutes. By road it takes an hour. The station has platform screen doors, ticket vending machines and toilets While the North-South metro came into being in 1984 and was India’s first metro rail, the East-West metro started running in February 2020. Phoolbagan will increase the passenger count of East-West metro and help lakhs of people in the coming days as it is located close to Sealdah station. Local train services from Sealdah haven’t resumed yet. The entire 16.5 km of the East-Westmetro is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.  After resumption of metro services from September 14, even though the North-South metro, which has become the city’s lifeline over the years is getting more than 50,000 passengers, the East-West corridor is getting less than 200 passengers per day. Authorities had said that the count would rise once Phoolbagan becomes operational and local train services resume at Sealdah. The entire 16.5 km of the East-West metro is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phoolbagan-station-of-kolkata-s-east-west-metro-starts-functioning/story-w1BLtUYHZJTe84w3x4RiOL.html

It is likely to move north-westwards towards northern Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Odisha coasts with gradual intensification into a depression, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its bulletin.Though it’s unlikely that the low-pressure area will intensify into a cyclone, there will be widespread and heavy rainfall due to it between October 11 and 13.Also read: After 61 years, India records two consecutive years of ‘above normal’ rainIMD has declared the end of monsoon season on September 30, but showers are continuing in both eastern and southern India, while north-west India is largely dry. Usually, monsoon is expected to withdraw completely from all parts of the country by October 15, but this year there is likely to be a delay due to widespread rainfall in October.The withdrawal line of monsoon continues. It is passing through latitude 28°N and longitude 82°E, which includes places such as Bahraich, Gwalior, Sawai Madhopur and Jawai dam. The conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal of monsoon from Rajasthan, some more parts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Gujarat during the next two days. The withdrawal of the monsoon is likely to slow down because widespread rainfall is also expected in central India.“As of now, it appears that the low-pressure area will move northwest wards and intensify into a depression. There will be heavy and widespread rainfall in AP and Odisha under its influence,” said Sunitha Devi, who is in-charge of cyclones at IMD.A low-pressure area is also lying over the northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Odisha coast. It is likely to persist until Monday and become less marked thereafter. However, its associated cyclonic circulation is very likely to move over to southern Chhattisgarh on Tuesday and will remain active until the following day.Under the influence of the current low-pressure area over the northwest Bay of Bengal, fairly widespread and heavy rainfall is likely over Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal during the next four days. Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over Odisha until Tuesday, in Jharkhand until Wednesday, over Bihar and Chhattisgarh on Tuesday and Wednesday. Under the influence of a fresh low-pressure area, rainfall activity is very likely to increase over Odisha and coastal AP during October 11 to 13.Fishermen are advised not to venture into the Andaman Sea, east central and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal on October 9 and 10; over central Bay of Bengal on October 10 and 11 and over northern Bay of Bengal on October 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/depression-likely-to-form-over-andaman-sea-widespread-rains-can-delay-monsoon-withdrawal/story-t7RtnLCwKllv66n0flXGhN.html

Their receptions will be held at Fatehgarh Chhana and Bahmna, before ending the day with a public meeting at Grain Market, Samana.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi vows to scrap contentious farm laws once Congress returns to power at CentreGandhi had expressed solidarity with the agrarian community on the first day of the tractor rally and called out the Centre asking if the farmers were happy why were they protesting against the legislation passed during Parliament’s monsoon session. “And if farmers are happy with these laws, then why are they agitating across the country? Why is every farmer of Punjab agitating?” he asked.The Congress leader also released a ‘kisan-mazdoor ekta’ (farmer-labourer unity) flag.He was joined by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, and a battery of senior Congress leaders. The chief minister urged Gandhi to bring the farmers from across India under one roof for an organised protest against the Centre. “The Akalis sold off the farmers’ interests as part of the Central government, with Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal being party to the decision as a minister.

He claimed the country’s 15 lakh power employees will resort to work boycott as a mark of solidarity to their UP counterparts on Monday. Accusing the management of misleading the government, Dubey appealed to chief minister Adityanath to intervene into the matter to stem the growing unrest in the industry.The UP Power Officers Association president, KB Ram and acting president, Avadhesh Kumar Verma on Monday met BJP state president, Swatantra Dev Singh, state Congress president, Ajay Kumar Lallu and BSP leader, Satish Chandra Mishra and submitted memorandum to them seeking their supports to stop privatization. “Essential services like hospitals have been exempted from the work boycott of the staff. We will be meeting the power minister in the evening,” Verma said.On the other hand, the state government has hardened its stand on the issuing and has warned of strict action against protestors if they tried to disrupt power supply. Chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari held a videoconference with divisional commissioners, district magistrates as well as senior police officers and issued directions to deal with the situation that may arise from the power staff’s proposed work boycott from Monday. He asked them to ensure hat power supply was not disrupted in the state. A government spokesman said all preparations are in place to deal with the protestors. “The government has identified critical power stations for beefing up security around them and also chalked out an action plan to hand over power transmission and distribution system to alternative staff if so warranted. Round-the-clock emergency control rooms too have been set up and activated in each district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-power-dept-staff-to-boycott-work-in-protest-against-privatization/story-k9QjXoQmYPVeS8pDXRMcMK.html

Before September 22, the country was reporting at least one million Covid-19 positive cases each day.Also read: Covid-19 recovery rate in Maharashtra improving, says health minister TopeTen states account for 77.11% of the active cases in the country. As on date, the percent contribution of active cases to the positive caseload of the country has reduced to only 14.32%.The low number of active cases mean that Covid-19 recoveries are steadily going up. Currently, the national recovery rate is around 83%. India’s total recoveries have crossed 5.5 million, and 75.44% of the newly recovered cases are recorded in 10 states, according to the government data.However, case positivity rate, which is the number of people who test positive as compared to who get tested in a day, remains a concern, with the current positivity rate standing at 8.29%. According to experts, anything above 5% is a cause for concern, and efforts should be targeted at bringing the national positivity rate below it fast. Also, despite the extended weekend, India posted high daily testing numbers, with at least one million samples tested each day for Covid-19 during past three days.“There has been an exponential rise in India’s daily testing capacities. More than 1,500,000 tests can be conducted every day. An average of 1,150,000 tests were done on a daily basis during the past ten days,” said a health ministry statement.India’s total number of Covid-19 tests has crossed 70.8 million so far. According to the health ministry very high levels of testing has led to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of Covid-19 cases in the country, and which has eventually resulted in a sustained low death date. The national case fatality rate remains around 1.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-country-s-active-case-load-remains-under-one-million/story-HU7FUwKbrmxQrpdPckAhLO.html

Adityanath, without apparently referring to the opposition build-up against his government over the Hathras shocker, said the opposition wanted to derail the state from the development agenda. “They (opposition) keep hatching new conspiracies every day and are attempting to spark caste and communal riots in UP. We have to ensure that we remain watchful so that we could ensure the state’s development,” he said while addressing a virtual meeting of BJP cadres in Naugawan Sadat assembly constituency in Amroha, which is among the seven assembly segments due for November 3 bypolls.

However, some people, who are least bothered about development, are hatching conspiracies on a daily basis. The need is to expose them,” said Adityanath. He also told the cadres that due to Covid, the bypolls would be markedly different. “There won’t be any big political rallies and there would be full focus on booth management and door-to-door campaign by small groups,” said the CM.

05-10-2020||India||Independent woman who forged own path||A retired school teacher, a devout follower of Arya Samaj, a Partition refugee, and a feminist, Kaushal Nagpal died of Covid-19 disease in June aged 78. She is survived by two sons and three grandchildren.Her journey began with a major milestone: at age eight, Nagpal was the first girl in her village to go to school. That was in Dujana, then in the district of Rohtak, Haryana, and her father, an officer in the Indian Railways, had to take special permission from the principal to get her admitted.Most of the subsequent life-shaping experiences happened while she pursued her higher studies: she got married to an advocate working at the district court in Karnal, became a mother of two boys and a caregiver to her elderly parents-in-law. Nagpal eventually became a school teacher specialising in History, Hindi and English. As a young independent working woman in the 1980s, in an otherwise conservative town, Nagpal had to combine a career with the traditional expectations from a woman of her milieu. It was no small thing.Nagpal would get up each morning at 4.30 am, prepare breakfast and lunch for the family and leave home at 6 am, first in a rickshaw to the bus stand, and from there, in a bus to the government school. She would return by 4.30 pm. After a short nap, she would take care of the domestic errands, including helping her sons with their school homework. She would sit with one of the boys, and her husband, Prithvi Raj, with another — they shared household chores. After she would leave for school in the morning, he would set the kitchen in order, make tea for his parents, and help his sons get ready for school, making it a habit to daily oil and comb their hair.In 1997, Nagpal took early retirement and moved with her husband to Faridabad’s Sector 28, in the house shared by sons Subhash and Gajendra and their families.Her life became more quiet, and more spiritual. She developed a particular interest for the writings of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, became more active in the Arya Samaj, and got a corner —the Yag Shala —especially built in the house to daily perform yagnas and havans. Each morning she would preside for two hours over the ceremony, offering ghee and scented “samagri” to the sacred fire. The comforting fragrance spreading through the air would appease her, as if the world around was getting purified.But Nagpal also remained a teacher. Every afternoon she would summon Shivani, the young daughter of the house maid Anita, to her room. The lessons would be delivered from her bed, cross-legged, her back resting on the pillow.Born in August 1942 in what is now Pakistani Punjab, Nagpal often recounted the train journey her family took to a newly independent India during Partition. Her mother wore a locket filled with poison to quickly end their lives in case their coach was attacked.As Nagpal was placed on a ventilator in Delhi’s Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, she never learnt of her husband’s demise on June 9 in a hospital in Faridabad. He, too, had died of the coronavirus. She died five days later. Their ashes were buried in an Arya Samaj park in Faridabad. Her children planted a mango and a neem tree over the spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independent-woman-who-forged-own-path/story-WhT3isffFqRT7XHZohqKcN.html
05-10-2020||India||SP Balasubrahmanyam: Prolific voice of Indian melodies||Wearing a white N95 mask, S P Balasubrahmanyam (or SPB, as he was often called) walked on to a quiet platform on July 18 and folded his gloved hands bowing down to a virtual audience before bowing down thrice to greet the orchestra surrounding him. He pulled down his mask to his chin to check the mic in what would be his swan song at a concert to raise funds for those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Corona is a curse for all our wrongdoings,” he said at the end of the concert. “We have destroyed nature. We are handing over a graveyard for our future generations. We have to undergo its consequences.” As much as SPB was revered as one of India’s iconic singers, he was also endearing to his contemporaries and fans alike for his flamboyant and cheerful disposition, his humility and philanthropic moorings. On August 5, SPB, 74, tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to MGM Healthcare in Chennai. His condition deteriorated and he was shifted to the ICU on August 13 and put on a ventilator and an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Though he tested negative on September 4, he continued to be on life support and died of cardio-respiratory failure on September 25 at 1.04 pm. During his time in hospital, long-time collaborator, friend and music director Ilaiyaraaja sent a message in Tamil that said, simply, “Get up and come soon, Balu.” A separate ICU room was created for SPB for his family to visit and his son, S P Charan played the video messages to him. Speaking to HT, Dr Deepak Subramanian, senior consultant at MGM who is among the team of doctors who treated SPB for 52 days said, “Only for Ilayaraaja’s video, he told Charan to come closer, replay the video and he kissed the phone.” Born in Konetammapeta village (present day Andhra Pradesh) in 1946, SPB had no formal training in classical music though he was musically inclined since childhood. His father, SP Sambamurthy was a Harikatha (a popular art form of storytelling in Andhra Pradesh) exponent. He was spotted by popular Telugu composer SP Kodandapani after SPB had won a singing competition in the early 60s. SPB made his debut in playback singing in 1967 in a Telugu movie Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna. That was the start of SPB’s colossal career spanning five decades, recording more than 40,000 songs in 16 languagaes (a Guinness Record) while straddling Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada films. SPB idolosied singer Mohammed Rafi, whom he often quoted. On Sonu Nigam’s show, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, on Zee TV, SPB spoke of how Rafi’s Dewaana Hua Badal (Kashmir Ki Kali, 1964) moved him to tears. “You can see that the man is coming to your ears and caressing and singing with a smile,” SPB said after rendering his version of the song. SPB won the Padma Shri in 2001 and the Padma Bhushan in 2011. He was also a popular actor, playing a single father, a doctor and even a Bharatnatyam dancer alongside choreographer Prabhu Deva. SPB was Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand’s first sponsor when he donated an amount to his chess team for their national championship in 1983. A cricket fan, SPB watched IPL matches in the hospital. SPB was homesick after his wife visited him and asked the doctors (by writing a note) if the ICU could be set up at home but understood when the doctors explained his critical situation. “But, he was never scared,” said Deepak Subramanian. The team was worried not to affect his vocal chords while they did a temporary tracheostomy under sedation and checked his voice post the procedure. “His voice was intact,” said Subramanian. “He said hello, I’m fine and things like that.” At his last virtual concert, SPB said in the future it seemed like his musical relationship with his audience will be virtual. “I’m grateful; for you have travelled along with me for all these 55 years. I’ll be there still for a while. Please bless me and be with me.” “Pedananna (uncle in Telugu) was happiest when he was immersed in music,” SPB’s nephew, SP Abhishek, a music composer and voice artist told HT. “Whether it is a 3-year-old girl or a nonagenarian singing, he will enjoy their music and he is so kind to everyone.” After Abhishek’s father (SP Jagadish) passed away in 2012, SPB offered to record all his songs in their studio. “It was his way of helping me. He was the only moral support and fatherly figure I had.” SPB was known to prefer audio notes over messaging on WhatsApp. He sang a wish for their birthdays or told them to stay safe during the pandemic in his voice chat recordings. SPB’s family organised a condolence meeting on September 30 where his songs were performed and the film fraternity eulogised him. “It was too painful to listen to his voice while I was preparing to perform.” Abhishek said. “I miss him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prolific-voice-of-indian-melodies/story-SNubp7hA5GwI7CWP88YttI.html
05-10-2020||India||What green future without the Adivasis?||Even as the world is debating how to reopen schools and conduct examinations amid a global pandemic, Covid-19 is also claiming the lives of the rarest knowledge-bearers like the indigenous people.We know about the Great Andamanese, a particularly vulnerable tribal group with a population of just over 50. They live on the tiny Strait Island, where outsiders have been banned to protect the Sentinelese way of life and avoid exposing them to infectious diseases. However, recently, 11 members of the tribe tested positive for Covid-19 while travelling to Port Blair for work. One might want to ask why such an endangered tribe must seek work? Why isn’t the community supported to live in its own territories? When we spend hundreds of thousands showcasing classical dance, why not invest in conserving an ancient culture?The tragedy is, the world isn’t nurturing indigenous populations. Even tribes in the Amazon have been hit by the virus— almost 9% might be dying. Globally, indigenous people are fighting back by wearing masks, isolating, spreading awareness. But they are vulnerable. Most of them don’t have the immunity against infectious diseases. They tend to step out of their known ecosystems for work or health care or other services, exacerbating their vulnerability.As we continue to fight the coronavirus, we must acknowledge that indigenous people around the world know how to live in complex ecosystems, with close exposure to the kind of creatures from whom the virus could have reached humans. How have they shielded themselves? We won’t know, if they continue to be marginalised and culturally wiped out like this. And without their knowledge, wisdom and skills, we will lose out on key knowledge we need to our green future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-green-future-without-the-adivasis/story-mFFBgjCQHx5gEtWq28KvOJ.html
05-10-2020||India||Key challenges faced by Covid-19 tests | Opinion||Both contestants in the US Presidential race have been tested for Covid-19 very recently. One has been hospitalised after a positive test result, despite his being protected by regular testing for himself and anyone who he meets at home, work or a rally. The other has been cautioned by experts that a negative viral test result in his case is no assurance that he is free of the virus and that he should be tested again. In the same week, the latest antibody survey in Delhi was reported to show a decline in the percentage of persons showing evidence of past infection with Covid-19, compared to the previous month! How do we explain these oddities related to the tests? Virus detection tests for the Saars-CoV2 virus are principally of two types. The molecular tests depend on nucleic acid amplification from the virus which is usually extracted from the nose or throat through a swab. The test is then performed in a qualified laboratory using the Real Time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) or an equivalent process. This takes several hours and reports are received after a day or more- sometimes with even greater delays, as reported in the US. Frustration at these delays has led to the emergence and use of the Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). These detect known antigenic fragments of the virus and can yield reports within half-an-hour. Easier to perform and earlier to report.However, neither test is perfect for detecting the virus in all the persons who are infected. RT-PCR can miss between 30-40% of cases, mainly because the sampling with a swab was done too early in the infection when the virus replication is not prolific or too late in the infection when the viral counts are dwindling. Also, the swab collection technique may have been defective. These can be problems with the RAT too. Compared to the RT-PCR, the rapid test misses even more cases. While these estimates vary, between the manufacturers who test in laboratory conditions (technical sensitivity) and those who test in real world conditions (clinical sensitivity), there is a danger of missing half the infected cases with RAT. Hence the recommendation for repeated testing if the report is negative. It is now known that the US President and the persons he met were screened only by RAT.Antibody tests are employed for random surveys of the population through sampling survey techniques, to determine what fraction of the population has already been exposed to the virus and has recovered with a detectable level of immunity in the blood. The test does not tell us if these are neutralising antibodies capable of arresting the virus nor does it give an indication of T cell immunity which is the other, and probably longer lasting, component of the immune response.Unfortunately, the antibody response to the Covid-19 virus appears to fade away in three months. Hence, persons infected during March to May may not be identified by a survey in September. The sampling design, and the participant responses, too can produce variations in the nature of persons tested. Also, every estimate (point estimate) needs to be reported with 95% confidence intervals which represent the range of probabilities which that point estimate represents in a given sample size. Unless the sample is large, the confidence intervals can be wide and overlap even for seemingly different point estimates.While the concern with virus detection tests is about false negative results, the challenge with antibody surveys lies in estimating the false positive results. Other corona viruses can present cross-reactive antibodies and recently some overlap with Dengue too has been reported. When the lab test is used for a large population survey, where prevalence of the infection is lower than the clinical setting where it has been validated, the number of false positive results get amplified. The estimated prevalence will be higher than the truly infected proportion of the population. This error band can vary from survey to survey, depending on the actual prevalence and the sample size. Population surveys can still provide a broad understanding of how the epidemic has advanced over time, if we don’t regard each point estimate as the absolute truth. One thing is for sure- don’t take anything for granted in these Covid times! (The author, a cardiologist and epidemiologist, is President, PHFI.

05-10-2020||India||Govt seeks legal status for elephant reserves||The Union environment ministry has proposed an amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 to accord legal status to elephant reserves and corridors on the lines of tiger reserves. The ministry has sought responses from 10 elephant range state governments in south, east, north-west India on the proposed amendment and measures to mitigate human-animal conflict to prepare a comprehensive national elephant action plan, said environment ministry forest department officials of multiple states. Under the Wildlife Protection Act, state forest departments have to prepare a tiger reserve management plan with an adequate number of forest staff and strategies in place to protect the big cats. The law also says that no mining or industrial activity will be allowed in the vicinity of the reserves and that their boundaries cannot be changed without approval from the National Board of Wildlife. The law also gives legal status to the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the regulatory body for around 50 tiger reserves in India. With the proposed amendment, the ministry proposes to have a similar legal framework for 30 elephant reserves across 15 states and statutory status for Project Elephant. India is home to about 30,000 elephants, or 60% of the global Asian elephant population.Meetings are taking place to prepare an elephant action plan, confirmed Soumitra Dasgupta, inspector general of forest (wildlife), under the Union ministry of environment. He added that he isn’t, however, aware of an initiative to confer legal status on elephant reserves by amending the Wildlife Protection Act. “They (elephant conservationists) have been fighting for legal status to elephant reserves for more than a decade. But no state is ready for this. Once the legal right is given, several restrictions would come into place,” said DS Srivastava, a former member of the steering committee of Project Elephant. “Then the states will not be able to allow mining and other activities in these areas, which could cause huge monetary loss to state exchequers.” In 2019, a committee was formed to prepare a National Elephant Action Plan; it held its first meeting in November last year. The committee made several suggestions including the proposed amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act. “Till date the country has no action plan, whereas countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal, which have a much smaller {elephant} population, have developed their own action plans,” said Prajna Panda, national coordinator of the union environment and forest ministry’s elephant cell. Jharkhand’s chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Vishwa Nath Shah, who participated in the 2019 meeting, said: “We are studying it (the amendment). Besides, we are also evaluating the status of elephant reserves of Jharkhand.” On the benefits that will come about by conferring legal status on elephant reserves, he said: “Actually, we still do not know in which form this legal status will be introduced. Until the legal framework is done, it will be too early to say anything.” West Bengal forest minister Rajib Banerjee said several steps have been taken to protect elephants such as fencing elephant habitats and digging trenches to restrict the movement of elephants outside their habitats in south Bengal. “We will response to the proposed changes in law when the draft is presented,” he said. Rising human-elephant conflict as elephants lose their traditional habitat and corridors is another key issue of discussion with states for the national action plan, officials said. The aim is to put in place a coordinated effort to reduce conflict through mitigation measures in elephant corridors. According to data shared with the Lok Sabha on September 23, close to 2,300 people were killed by elephants in the past five years until 2019, which was 10 times the number killed by tigers. Also, 400 elephants were killed by poachers or through poisoning by local residents. The Lok Sabha reply revealed that at least 433 people have been killed across West Bengal between April 2014 and September 2019. In Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattishgarh, the death toll was 447, 391 and 329, respectively, during the period. Raman Sukumar, an elephant expert who has backed the proposal to provide legal status to elephant reserves, said that to reduce conflict, states need to ensure that the elephants stay within the elephant reserves and do not stray outside in search of food and water. “The states also need to remove hurdles from the elephant corridors. If necessary, some elephants can be relocated to reserves having lesser elephant population,” he added. The first meeting on the action plan was held with forest officials from south zone on September 15. The latest discussion was held with forest officials from the east-central region on September 22. “Various issues related to mitigating man-elephant conflict are being discussed,” Panda said. The zones demarcated for the action plan are east-central, covering states such as Odisha, south Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, north Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh; north-east-south, which includes south Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, and north-west zone, comprising Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. India’s first elephant reserve was created in Jharkhand in 2001 under Project Elephant. Spread over 4,529 square kilometers area, the Singhbhum Elephant Reserve in Kolhan division, which comprises three districts --east Singhbhum, west Singhbhum and Saraikela-Kharswan -- has around 280 elephants, according to the 2017 elephant census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-seeks-legal-status-for-elephant-reserves/story-m7JbFZJjv9NnmqSSLncb5L.html

All those who are to be quarantined in Delhi are stamped by Delhi government’s health department.An official from the airport said it is being looked into if Yaskhi was stamped by Delhi government health department officials or by his Telangana state health department officials.At present, all international passengers arriving Delhi need to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine. However, passengers can apply for an exemption from institutional quarantine by uploading their recent Covid-19 negative report on Delhi airports portal Air Suvidha ahead of their flight. Once approved, the passengers will only require home quarantine. Passengers can also get themselves tested for Covid-19 upon their arrival at the Delhi airport and if found negative may head straight for home quarantine. Yaskhi, who had arrived at the IGI airport around 12pm on Saturday had to board a connecting flight to Hyderabad. Before he headed for his flight, he was stamped on his left arm and was to undergo home quarantine in Hyderabad.“The moment I was stamped I started feeling itchy. I thought it was normal. By 4.15pm when my flight took off, the irritation grew and I felt a burning sensation. Gradually, it turned black and it became intolerable,” he said.After reaching Hyderabad, Yaskhi said he immediately contacted one of his dermatologist friends for medical advice. “My doctor told me that gradually my skin will peel off and that complete recovery may take more than a month,” he said.Yakshi, a former MP from Nizamabad constituency in Telangana, tweeted on a picture of his hand on Sunday, tagging Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri and asking him to look into the matter.Yaskhi tweeted, “Dear @HardeepSPuri Ji, can you please look into the chemical being used at Delhi airport for stamping on passengers coming from abroad? Yesterday I was stamped at @DelhiAirport and this is how my hands look now.”Responding to his tweet, Puri wrote, “Thank you for drawing my attention to this. A have spoken to CMD AAI.”Yaskhi said he tweeted the picture to bring this to everyone’s attention and to ensure that no other passenger goes through the same experience.DIAL, the Delhi airport operator, also responded to Yakshi’s tweet. “We deeply regret the inconvenience caused. The ink used for stamping is a standard indelible ink. We’ve reported the issue to the Delhi State Authorities. Currently, this batch of ink is being kept aside for testing by the supplier and further desired action. Thank you for highlighting this issue.”Officials from the Union health ministry did not respond to calls, texts or emails. When contacted, Delhi government also did not comment on the matter.Somesh Gupta, a dermatologist at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) said such it could be a case of dermatitis. “If you apply any dye, it may react with skin. Stamping in this way is not a good practise. They must find a substitute like in AIIMS they put a paper band on the wrists for identification,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-mp-says-covid-stamp-at-airport-caused-skin-burns/story-WVVFfMLMSgJsqbfZMLjdYK.html
05-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||That the Sars-CoV-2 virus has got the most powerful man in the world is yet again proof that no one is safe. Sure, it’s not kryptonite, he’s not Kal-El, and in every possible way, US President Donald Trump has no one to blame but himself, but still, if it can get him, it can get anyone.Trump mocked his rival in the US presidential election next month, former vice president Joe Biden, for always wearing a mask in a debate last week, emphasising that there was no need to wear one in safe environments such as the one where the debate was being held — the Western Reserve University’s Health Education Campus in Cleveland, Ohio, with a live studio audience, largely the entourages of the two candidates, officials of the university, and reporters. Everyone had been tested, Trump said, and there was social distancing.NO ONE IS INVULNERABLEIn every possible way, US President Donald Trump has no one to blame but himself, but still, if it can get him, it can get anyone. Trump even mocked his rival in the US presidential election, Joe Biden, for always wearing a mask in a debate last week. Subsequent reports, and also video footage shows the first family violating the rules by taking off their masks during the debate, and keeping them off. And subsequent reports also mentioned, citing White House officials, that the President, his entourage and their guests, underwent a rapid antigen test ahead of the debate.These are the new Abbott Laboratories rapid antigen tests that perform as well as molecular tests (such as the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR) in the laboratory, but which have a false negative rate of 20% in the field, according to some studies. That is still a whole lot better than the up to 50% false negative rate of many other rapid antigen tests. Indeed, Abbott’s tests, fast (15 minutes) and cheap, were considered a breakthrough among antigen tests, all of which (including those used widely in India) were fast and inexpensive, but with a high false negative rate.A REMINDER The US President and his supporters have also made the mask a political issue in the US; Trump has encouraged large campaign rallies and meetings with utter disregard for social distancing; and he is rarely seen wearing a mask when with his inner circle. Trump’s illness is a reminder to everyone that testing, wearing masks and social distancing hold the key to staying safe from the virus. I’ve written a lot on rapid antigen tests. There is a context for their use — in a containment zone for instance, where cases are peaking; or in an airport, to test passengers before they board a flight, or test those who have just alighted from one; even ahead of a public or publicly private event (such as the debate). But to use them in any other context is downright foolish.There’s a theory doing the rounds that because rapid antigen tests recognise only moderate to high viral loads, they identify the truly infectious patients — a completely misguided and dangerous theory. There’s another theory doing the rounds that molecular tests such as RT-PCR are bad because they have a high rate of false positives. A false positive is when a test identifies an uninfected individual as infected — something that, no doubt, causes anguish to that person and also results in them being placed in some sort of quarantine. A false negative, on the contrary, identifies an infected person as uninfected, allows them to move around freely, and perhaps infect others, including those from vulnerable sections of the population who, in turn, may succumb to the disease. It’s easy to see which is more harmful.But back to the debate: media reports say that after people in the Trump camp took off their masks (the minute they were seated; no one was allowed in without masks), they were approached by a health worker from The Cleveland Clinic who offered them masks, only to be shooed away. Trump and his supporters have made the mask a political issue in the US; the President has also encouraged large campaign rallies and meetings with utter disregard for social distancing; and he is rarely seen wearing a mask when with his inner circle. This behaviour, US media reports say, extends to other White House officials.There are anti-maskers in India as well, but they are a fringe group, best known for a video posted online and pamphlets inserted in newspapers distributed in a few Mumbai neighbourhoods (and both were widely criticised).Trump’s infection — there are conflicting reports on how serious it is, although he has been hospitalised — is a reminder to everyone that testing (using the right kind of tests,ideally), wearing masks and social distancing hold the key to staying safe from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-jCkYKvdDGVzpsxfVOiFXUN.html
05-10-2020||India||LJP will go solo as 50-50 deal likely for BJP, JD(U)||After much dithering on seat-sharing, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on Sunday took a call to contest the upcoming three-phase assembly election in Bihar on its own. The decision to not contest as a partner of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was taken at a meeting of the party’s parliamentary board, which adopted a resolution that the LJP will not contest the polls under the leadership of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.The party said the differences it had were limited to the Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), and that it continues to support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as an NDA ally at the Centre. It went on to say that the party will work to “strengthen Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government”.The developements came on a day the BJP and the JD(U) agreed to contest the three-phase elections in the state as equal partners, according to a BJP functionary. The functionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the BJP was likely to contest on 121 seats and the JD(U) on 122. The leader added that the JD(U) was likely to assign five seats to the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) from its quota. There are 243 seats in the Bihar assembly.The resolution also mentioned that since it had ideological differences with the JD(U), it will contest against it at the three-phase election set for October 28, November 3 and November 7. LJP president Chirag Paswan, who chaired the party’s parliamentary board meeting, told reporters that the party will perform well in the elections and that the decision to go solo was a “happy one”. This is not the first time that the LJP has decided to contest state polls independently of the NDA. It chose not to be part of the NDA while contesting the 2017 Manipur assembly election, but later its only MLA joined the BJP government. It contested the 2014 assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and the 2019 assembly elections in Jharkhand on its own. In Bihar, the party had been threatening to break away from the NDA if its demand that it be allowed to contest 42 seats in the 243-member assembly was not met. The BJP played down the differences between the LJP and the JD(U), but Paswan trained his guns at the party and has been critical of the Bihar CM, whom he has accused of failing to meet the poll promise of ushering in economic development. On Sunday, the BJP leadership remained tight-lipped about the LJP’s decision. To a question on whether this will impact the electoral outcome, a leader said it would “have a limited impact on a few seats” as the LJP is only contesting against the JD(U). “The move will not impact the BJP or the NDA. Both the parties are going strong and will win a majority. However, BJP leadership has already announced that its workers will ensure the win of all NDA allies; so even as the LJP claims it will support and strengthen BJP’s hands, it cannot bank on support of the workers during canvassing,” a party functionary said on condition of anonymity. JD (U) questioned the “ideological differences”. News agency ANI quoted JD(U)’s state unit working president Ashok Chaudhary as questioning why these differences hadn’t come up during the Lok Sabha elections, which the LJP contested as part of the NDA. “We want to know the specific ideological difference that the LJP has with us. During Lok Sabha polls, they partner with us and request Nitish Kumar’s presence in their constituency and win the elections. Now for Bihar assembly polls, they claim ideological difference,” he said. To be sure, LJP may have never been a major force in Bihar politics, but has made its presence felt since its inception in 2000, when Ram Vilas Paswan set up the party after splitting from the Janata Dal on the issue of joining the BJP-led NDA. Its politics have revolved mostly around the Dalits, who constitute over 16% of the votes in Bihar. Though it could never win enough seats in Bihar to expand its footprint, LJP has remained a party that could not be ignored: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad once described Ram Vilas Paswan as the “mausam vigyanik” (weather scientist) for his uncanny knack of predicting the poll outcome much in advance of the polls and setting his sails accordingly. Two decades later, LJP has undergone a generational shift with Chirag taking over as its national president, and his cousin and former MP Ramchandra Paswan’s son, Prince Raj, becoming the state president. The party has also coined a new slogan: ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’. Chirag identifies himself as a ‘yuva Bihari’ (young Bihari) on Twitter to bond with the young and to break the image of the party being a family enterprise. Chirag is being seen in his party as a potential CM candidate in a state where Kumar is projected as a leader with no competition from within and outside the NDA. Chirag is apparently aware that this could well be the last innings of Kumar as the Bihar CM. Chirag’s aggressive posturing against Nitish Kumar, while maintaining a soft approach towards the Narendra Modi-led BJP, could be an indicator of his ambition and the political craft he inherited from his father, who has always gotten along well with parties with contrasting ideologies, depending on the situation. Soon after taking over the party’s reins, Chirag had said that the 2020 Bihar assembly elections would be his big test and his objective would be to “expand the footprints of the party in Bihar and even beyond in states with a sizeable support base like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh”. “Chirag is doing deft politics like his father. With age by his side, he is in for a tough bargain, but he is taking a calculated risk by not antagonising the BJP. He knows what he needs to do and it may be part of a larger strategy. He speaks against Nitish Kumar, but praises Narendra Modi. He has a plan and he is working accordingly,” said NK Choudhary, a political analyst and former head of the department of economics at Patna University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-will-go-solo-as-50-50-deal-likely-for-bjp-jd-u/story-hBz7yxbsvlNrU7jY56tKfL.html
05-10-2020||India||India-US 2 plus 2 on Oct 26-27, geospatial pact BECA to be signed||The third India-US two plus two dialogue is expected to take place here on October 26-27 with the Narendra Modi government ready to sign the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for geo-spatial cooperation. The last of four military communication foundational agreements, BECA is an important precursor to India acquiring armed drones such as the MQ-9B from the US as the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) uses spatial data for pinpointed strikes on enemy targets.The India-US interaction at the ministerial level will expand sharply this month with external affairs minister S Jaishankar meeting his US counterpart Mike Pompeo at the Quad security dialogue in Tokyo on October 6. This will be followed by the visit of US deputy secretary of state Stephen Beigun in mid-October and finally US defence secretary Mark Esper and defence minister Rajnath Singh will join the two foreign ministers in the two plus two dialogue.While the dates for the two plus two are being finalised, the signing of BECA will be a very significant development as it allows India to use global geo-spatial maps of the US for accuracy of stand-off weapons like cruise and ballistic missiles. Already the two countries have activated all the three foundational agreements with both using each other’s designated military facilities for refuelling and replenishment. The communication agreement allows both countries to share military information about threats on land and the Indo-Pacific.During the two plus two, both the US ministers will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as his National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who has a direct line to his US counterpart Robert O’Brien.While the global security environment will be addressed by the defence and foreign ministers, the Chinese aggression in Ladakh and in the South China Sea will be discussed in detail with both sides sharing their assessment. Just as the People’s Liberation Army is continuing to aggressively posture on Taiwan in the South China Sea, it is showing no intentions of drawing down from the Ladakh sector despite talking about disengagement and de-escalation.The dialogue will coincide with the Chinese Communist Party plenary on October 26-29, where the 370 Central Committee members will interact with the paramount leader Xi Jinping to review important policy decisions including the next five-year plan.The situation in Afghanistan will be discussed during the two plus two with India circumspect about peace in Kabul despite fully understanding the American decision to withdraw after 19 years. Even though India engaged the Taliban leadership at the Doha dialogue in September, it wants the Sunni conservative group to reduce violence in Afghanistan so that the country remains a republic and does not become an Islamic Emirate.Unabated cross-border terrorism from Pakistan will be also a topic of discussion, with proscribed groups like the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Tayebba continuing to target both innocent civilians and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Despite Pakistan trying to use its all-weather ally China to walk out of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list, the Islamic state continues to export terrorists and jihadists from Kashmir to Azerbaijan with the help of Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-india-us-2-2-talks-likely-on-october-26-27-pact-on-geo/story-fSBiUWocOwIZ9wfgzw8d4K.html
05-10-2020||India||BJP district leader shot dead in Bengal, Guv Jagdeep Dhankhar summons home secretary||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manish Shukla died at a private hospital on EM Bypass in Kolkata on Sunday night less than three hours after he was shot multiple times in the back and upper torso at Titagarh in North 24 Parganas. The assailants came on motorcycles and their faces were covered with masks, said BJP workers present at the spot. Two BJP workers also sustained injuries. Shukla, who defected from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) two years ago, was a popular organisational leader. The news of his death led to tension in large parts of the Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency of which Titagarh is a part. Shukla was shot not far from Titagarh police station and sophisticated weapons were used, alleged BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh, who too defected from the TMC in 2018. “We were at a programme together earlier in the evening. He was attacked after returning to his office,” Singh said. “Police were behind the attack. We saw more than eight bullet injuries on his body. I am also a target,” Singh said while making the allegations. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar took up the issue and summoned the home secretary and Director General of Police to the Raj Bhawan at 10 am on Monday. “ACS Home @MamataOfficial and DGP @WBPolice have been summoned at 10 am tomorrow in the wake of worsening law and order situation leading to dastardly killing of Manish Shukla, Councillor, Titagarh Municipality in political party office,” Dhankhar tweeted at 11.40pm. “Shukla was murdered. We demand a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the role of the police. Arjun Singh’s life is also in danger. Mamata Banerjee cannot rule the state with terror,” said BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who was in Kolkata. TMC’s Panihati legislator, Nirmal Ghosh, said the ruling party had no role in the attack. “This is a fallout of rivalry inside the BJP,” he said. BJP national secretary Arvind Menon, who was also in Kolkata, rushed to the hospital with senior leaders. Barrackpore police commissioner Manoj Verma deployed rapid action force (RAF) on the streets in view of the tension. “We cannot say anything without conducting a proper investigation,” he said. BJP workers set up a blockade on BT Road, demanding the arrest of the culprits. The party also announced a 12-hour bandh along the entire stretch from Kanchrapara to Titagarh on Monday. Shukla was also an outgoing councillor of the Titagarh municipality where the term of the elected civic body has ended. Elections are due in around 110 civic bodies in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-district-leader-shot-dead-in-bengal-guv-jagdeep-dhankhar-summons-home-secretary/story-iAEhbpfB2RHTSlOF7C6KPJ.html
05-10-2020||India||Several crops sell below MSPs amid legislation debate||A range of kharif, or summer-sown, crops are selling below federally fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), or floor rates, as record output dampens prices at a time when farmers are protesting against a set of laws enacted recently to liberalise farm trade in the country. Crops, such as soyabean, ragi, maize and cotton, are selling up to 30% below MSPs, data from Agmarknet, the agriculture ministry’s portal that tracks prices in mandis or wholesale markets, show. Poor returns from crops have been a lingering problem for farmers, especially during episodes of gluts, such as now. MSPs, which are fixed at 50% over cost for nearly two dozen crops, don’t necessarily lead to higher farm incomes as the government’s procurement at MSP rates is largely restricted to wheat and rice. For most other crops, farmers are mostly price takers, meaning they are forced to accept whatever the markets dictate. Also Read: Rahul Gandhi vows to scrap contentious farm laws once Congress returns to power at CentreOutput of kharif foodgrains this year is likely to touch a record 144.5 million tonnes, marginally higher than last year’s 143.4 million tonnes. The unprofitable sales come despite the government’s assurances of robust procurement at MSP rates. For example, the government last week announced that it would procure 1.4 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds at MSP rates. However, at just about 15% of the total production, this is too small a quantity to make a difference in prices offered by private entities. For efficient farm markets, the government recently enacted three laws, allowing farmers to bypass state-controlled market yards run by agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) and enter into five-year farming contracts with agribusinesses. The government also freed up several commonly consumed food items from strict stocking limits that discouraged private investment in cold storages. Farmers’ groups are protesting against the reforms, including the move to end the monopoly of APMCs, because they fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. They also fear the reforms may weaken the MSP mechanism. The average wholesale price for soyabean during September 16-23 in nine states worked out to Rs 3,683.02 per quintal (100 kg), against the promised MSP of Rs 3,880 per quintal, data from the ministry shows. In Madhya Pradesh, average soyabean prices during the period stood at Rs 3648.09 per quintal, while in Maharashtra it was Rs 3719.81 per quintal. Maize has seen a sharp fall in prices this year. The MSP for maize has been set at Rs 1,850 per quintal. Against this, the average wholesale price of maize in 17 states was nearly 30% below MSP at Rs 1,295 during September 16-23. In one of the biggest growers, Bihar, which abolished the regulated markets system in 2006, maize has sold for a pittance. “The average prices were 60% lower than MSP because of poor demand,” said Mintu Kushwaha, a trader from the state’s Purnea district. Also Read| Union govt to spend Rs 1 lakh crore to boost agri infrastructure: MoS KatariaRagi, a millet grown by small farmers, too is selling below its minimum price of Rs 3,295 per quintal. The average ragi wholesale price in Karnataka between September 24-30, for instance, was Rs 2,062.61 a quintal. The MSP for cotton for 2020-21 has been fixed at Rs 5,515 per quintal. In states such as Gujarat, however, in the third week of September, cotton sold at an average wholesale price of Rs 4,500 per quintal, while in Punjab, the rates ranged between Rs 4,500 and Rs 5,000. “Part of the problem is how MSPs are fixed. They are fixed by a formula based on 50% over A2 + FL ( a measure of cultivation costs). So, MSPs are cost-based and they have nothing to do with market conditions and, arguably, demand conditions,” said economist Abhijit Sen. Economists say if the government wants to ensure a price higher than private markets are willing to offer, then it has to procure sufficiently. Often, the government resorts to token purchases, such as of pulses and oilseeds, which doesn’t help. The solution to poor returns is to have a market-clearing mechanism, which is the price at which quantity demanded equals to quantity supplied, economists say. “Nudging the private sector towards triggering a market-clearing price that is closer or equal to MSP will depend on the extent of government’s procurement,” Sen said. The latest reforms, however, are no silver bullet, experts warned. “The expectation with these reforms is, once you allow markets to determine both production and prices and what to produce, it will help farmers with better price discovery. That’s the assumption but we need to see how things go from here,” said NR Bhanumurthy, the vice-chancellor of Bengaluru BR Ambedkar School of Economics. Bhanumurthy said the opening up of state-run APMC markets to private competition alone won’t work if it is not accompanied by other factors, such as an efficient crop insurance, expansion of food processing, storage infrastructure and better market information systems. Prices could further dip in October, potentially intensifying farmer protests. “We have called a general meeting on October 8-9 of major farm organisations to take our agitation forward. MSP is our main concern. The recent laws will ruin the MSP system,” said Gurnam Singh, the Haryana president of Bharatiya Kisan Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-crops-sell-below-msps-amid-legislation-debate/story-AFHH0NHbFcAGYgrXWA9B1J.html
05-10-2020||India||Govt targeting 400-500 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine by July ’21||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government plans to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, when one is ready, to induce protection against the virus in about 200-250 million people by July 2021, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said.“A list of citizen groups that will require vaccine administration on priority is being drawn up by the health ministry in association with the state governments. There is a high-level expert body going into all aspects of vaccine procurement and delivery,” Harsh Vardhan said in response to Covid-19-related queries of social media users.“For this, a format is being currently prepared in which states will submit priority population groups to receive vaccine, especially health care workers engaged in the management of Covid-19 such as testing, tracing and treating {patients}. We have placed a realistic target of end-October {2020} to complete this humongous exercise,” he added in a recorded video of him answering questions that were sent to him by people. The video was played on Sunday on his social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook as well as YouTube.The list of frontline health care workers includes doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and sanitary workers, both from the government and the private sector. It will also include accredited health activists, surveillance officers and other workers who are engaged in managing Covid-19 patients.Apart from health care workers, priority will also be given to the elderly — those who are above 65 years of age — and people who have underlying medical conditions.Currently, the states are being closely guided to also submit details about cold chain facilities and other related infrastructure that will be required down to the block level for vaccine storage and delivery as part of the government’s immunisation programme.The Centre is also working on plans for building capacities in human resource training and supervision on a massive scale, and also keeping an eye on immunity data with regard to Covid-19 while finalising these plans, the minister said.A high-level committee under the chairmanship of Dr VK Paul, member (health) at the government’s policy think tank Niti Aayog, is looking into the entire process. After various discussions, it has been decided that the vaccine will be procured centrally, and each consignment will be tracked in real-time until delivery to ensure it reaches those who need it the most.“The vaccine will be distributed based on pre-decided priority and in a programmed manner and it will be appropriately controlled to avoid any diversion or black marketing. To ensure transparency and accountability, details of the entire process will be shared in coming months,” the health minister said.He added that various committees were working on understanding the timelines of availability of various vaccines under development in the country and obtaining commitments from vaccine manufacturers to make available the maximum number of doses for inventory and supply chain management.India currently has two indigenous vaccine candidates in advanced stages of clinical trials. Bharat Biotech International Ltd is carrying out trials on Covaxin, which is being developed using a virus isolated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology, Pune; and Cadila Healthcare Ltd is testing a candidate called ZyCov-D.Harsh Vardhan also said that while clinical data on the vaccine candidates was still emerging, it wouldn’t be prudent at this stage to comment on one vaccine’s superiority over another.“… even if we have multiple vaccines available, they will all be safe and will elicit the requisite immune response against novel coronavirus”.The vaccines developed and tested outside India that have proven to be safe, immunogenic and efficacious in clinical trials would need to undergo bridging studies to prove their safety and immunogenicity in the Indian population “although these studies can be conducted with much smaller sample size and end quickly,” he added. On the Russian vaccine Sputnik V, the minister said that it was still under consideration by the government.“The matter is still under consideration, and no decision has been taken as yet on the Phase 3 trials,” he said.On the subject of conducting human challenge experiments in India, wherein participants are exposed to the virus in a laboratory controlled setting to test the vaccines, the minister raised ethical concerns.“India is not planning to venture into such trials until the method is proven to have an established benefit as per global experience.

05-10-2020||India||For Bihar polls, BJP focuses on farmers, women||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) plans to woo farmers and women voters in Bihar by reaching out to them with a long-list of policy interventions that have been announced in the past six years of the NDA government at the Centre , and the over three-year rule of the BJP-JD(U) alliance in the state.The turn-out of women voters , at 60.48% and 59.58% in the 2015 assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha elections respectively, was more than that of men. Women are considered an important vote bank in Bihar; the party also wants to take no chances in pacifying farmers in the wake of the protests over the new farm laws. According to the state government’s data 70% of the population is engaged in agricultural operations. The turn-out of male voters in the two elections were 53.32% and 57.33%.According to BJP leaders familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, the party plans to hold town halls targeted specifically at women and farmers in the run-up to the three-phase election starting October 28. These will be supplemented by more focused outreach efforts where the party will reach out to small groups of farmers -- keeping in mind the protocol for physical distancing during the campaign for the first major elections in the country behind held under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.The BJP is hoping to tap the female vote by emphasising the benefits of central schemes such as the Jan Dhan Yojana frills-free bank accounts; the Ujwala cooking gas cynlinder scheme; and the ongoing project for providing piped water supply to the households.Though the party claims that the ongoing agitation against farm laws has no resonance on the ground in Bihar, it is taking preemptive steps to woo the farmers as the opposition is sure to rake the issue.“Farmers in Bihar are not complaining. The state already abolished the APMC system in 2006, which is in line with what the new farm legislation, which also speaks about, giving farmers the choice to sell outside the mandis,” said a party functionary in Delhi.However, a second functionary in the state said the feedback from the ground indicates that there has not been enough private investment as was promised during the abolition of the APMC system, which coupled with the economic slowdown accentuated by the global pandemic is expected to be “a cause for concern”.Several critics of the farm laws have in fact held up Bihar’s poor acquisition of wheat under MSP -- according to the Food Corporation Of India data, only 0.05 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of wheat was procured from Bihar in 2020-21 against the revised target of 7 LMT -- as an indication of how the laws may actually hurt farmers. As per data from the ministry of agriculture, about 5.638 million hectares of land in the state is sown . The total number of land holdings in Bihar are 10.43 million out of which 8.65 million are held by marginal farmers; only 7.81lakh units are larger than 2 hectares.The state is the third largest producer of vegetables and fourth largest producer of fruits in the country and exports litchi, basmati rice and snow pea.With an eye on the rural vote bank the central government recently announced a spate of projects in the state worth Rs 16,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-bihar-polls-bjp-focuses-on-farmers-women/story-hvPwlNWnlvcm0j1ZCQX1ZP.html
05-10-2020||India||Hathras family against CBI probe, demands Supreme Court inquiry||Family members of the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died in a New Delhi hospital on September 29 after she was allegedly gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras and left partially paralysed said they were against a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe ordered by the Yogi Adityanath government and instead sought a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry.“We do not require a CBI probe... we want an investigation to be held under a retired Supreme Court judge,” said the brother of the woman.A Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the state government, meanwhile, continued its probe and recorded statements by family members of the woman, who was allegedly raped and left partially paralysed by four dominant-caste members on September 14 when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder.“We are open to anyone who wants to present himself before SIT and get his or her statement (recorded),” said senior Indian Police Service officer Bhagwan Swaroop, who heads the three-member team.Scores of people held a meeting Sunday outside the house of a former BJP MLA in Hathras where they defended the accused in the alleged gangrape of a Dalit woman who later died, and demanded registration of an FIR against her family members.Heavy police force was deployed in the vicinity of the residence of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan, located around 8-9 kilometres from the victim’s village.One of the organisers of the meeting and Pehalvan’s son Manveer Singh denied that the gathering comprised members from the upper castes and said they were from “different sections of society”.“We welcome the CBI inquiry ordered by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. We have faith in the investigation,” Singh said, and claimed that the victim’s family members were “changing their stand”.“The entire scenario has been created to blame the government. The accused persons are in favour of any type of inquiry. But the victims are changing their stand every now and then. They do not want a narco test or a CBI probe. Now they want other kinds of inquiries,” he claimed.On September 22, the victim of the gang rape— who died in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she had been shifted after her condition failed to improve in an Aligarh hospital where she was initially treated— recorded had her statement, claiming she had been raped and naming the four accused. Her mother’s statement echoed the claim.On Sunday, Dalit leader and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad visited the family of the Hathras woman and demanded that a high-level security cover be provided to her relatives“I demand ‘Y security’ for the family or I’ll take them to my house, they aren’t safe here. We want an inquiry to be done under the supervision of a retired Supreme Court judge”, he said.Azad’s demand came a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi visited the victim’s family and said the state government should take responsibility for the family’s safety.“If ‘Y Plus’ category security cover can be provided to actor Kangana Ranaut, then why can it not be provided to the family of the victim,” Azad said, adding that if his demand was not met, he will organise a gherao of the state assembly. Amid criticism of the government and the police’s handling of the case, CM Adityanath on Sunday asked officials to handle cases related to women, girls, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) with sensitivity.The CM said this to police and administrative officers during a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) review meeting. “The most complicated of problems could be solved through dialogue,” he said.“Attempts must be made to sort out various problems through dialogue with the affected people. The police should act promptly and deal with sensitivity in cases related to women, girls, SCs and STs,” he said.On Saturday, Adityanath had said his government was committed to ensuring justice to each and every victim. He said that efficient and sensitive policing was needed to strengthen the foundation of good governance, curb crime and maintain law and order in the country’s most populous state.The CM had also sent senior officials including additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi and director general of police HC Awasthy to the village on Saturday to meet the woman’s family. Awasthi said any group with no more than five people was allowed to meet the victim’s family, a remark that came after journalists and politicians were previously turned away from the village.Other accusations of missteps include allegations that the woman’s body was cremated by the police in the early hours of Wednesday without the family’s consent, triggering demonstrations across the country.Chaotic scenes were witnessed on Sunday in Boolgarhi village of Hathras district when a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)delegation was about to enter the village and a Samajwadi Party (SP) team was leaving. Five SP leaders had gone inside the village. Anxious SP workers soon went out of control and jumped the barricades when RLD vice president Jayant Chaudhary and his supporters arrived at the spotWhen some unidentified people started throwing stones, the police charged the crowd with batons while Chaudhary was interacting with a reporter. RLD workers rushed to rescue Chaudhary. The RLD leader downplayed the incident, but criticised the police for the lathi-charge on his delegation. “This lathi-charge on Jayant Chaudhary reflects the jungle raj in Uttar Pradesh. He had gone to condole the death of the Hathras girl and was targeted in a planned manner,” said Kaptan Singh Chahar, a former spokesperson of RLD.“Some RLD workers, including Pradeep Chaudhary, sustained major injuries,” Chahar said.Sub-district magistrate Prem Meena denied a planned lathi-charge, and said that the police had resorted to a baton-charge to bring the situation under control after SP and RLD workers threw stones at the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-family-against-cbi-probe-demands-supreme-court-inquiry/story-vWxnaYJmCiXAoZew5OgeZJ.html
05-10-2020||India||Congress-ruled states may pass legislation to override farm laws||Congress-ruled states are likely to summon a special session of their assemblies soon to pass a legislation that will override the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government’s new farm laws, people aware of the development said. While Congress-ruled Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are expected to put in place their own legislation, the union territory of Puducherry will bring in a resolution in this regard, a party leader said, requesting anonymity. No specific dates for the special sessions have been finalised yet, he added. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi has already drafted a “model bill” to help the party-ruled states override the new farm laws and ensure that no farmer gets less than the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Last week, Congress president Sonia Gandhi advised party-ruled states to explore the possibilities to pass legislation under Article 254(2) to negate the BJP-led central government’s “anti-agricultural laws” and prevent the “grave injustice” from being done to farmers. The opposition party cited the BJP government’s move in 2015 when it asked party-ruled states to bring their own laws to override the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 passed during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) or boosting infrastructure development. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pushed three bills to deregulate agricultural trade, which were passed controversially by Parliament, overriding demands by the Opposition for greater scrutiny and voting.Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, are protesting the bills, fearing deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful corporate agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.The reforms have cost the BJP one of its oldest allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which has quit the ruling alliance. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 sought to liberalise farm trade, enable modern supply chains, allow agribusinesses and farmers to enter into contracts, break interlocked markets and enable seamless commodities trading. Alll three bills have been signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind.The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 allows barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of primary agricultural commodities, bypassing notified markets under the agricultural produce market committees. The bill will enable food traders to buy farmers’ produce from any market, rather than bind them to the specific markets where they are licensed to operate. Earlier in the day, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi vowed to scrap the new farm laws if the Congress returns to power at the Centre, and alleged that the BJP-led government was acting at the behest of select corporate entities to “destroy” farmers. Leading a protest tractor rally in Punjab against the farm legislations, Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and questioned the need for bringing in the new farm laws at the time of the coronavirus pandemic. Union minister Jitendra Singh accused the Congress and other opposition parties of spreading “false propaganda” about the farm laws. “Apart from guaranteeing a fixed price for farmers, the new legislations prohibit the sale, lease or mortgage of farmland. Therefore, there is no substance in the allegation by Congress leaders that big companies will exploit farmers in the name of the contract,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ruled-states-may-pass-legislation-to-override-farm-laws/story-oNNtSklswNjfmpkgmfhuIN.html
05-10-2020||India||If farmers are happy, why are they protesting, asks Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sharpened his attack against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government over three new farm-related laws on Sunday, saying the legislation would promote corporate and not farmers’ interests, as he launched a “kheti bachao yatra” (save agriculture journey) in the heartland of Indian agriculture.“The prime minister says the laws are being framed for farmers. If the laws are being made for farmers, then why didn’t you debate in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” he said, flagging off the three-day campaign of tractor rallies in Punjab’s Moga district.“And if farmers are happy with these laws, then why are they agitating across the country? Why is every farmer of Punjab agitating?” Addressing a public meeting in Badhni Kalan in village of Moga district, Gandhi said the contentious laws would be revoked if the Congress was voted to power. He also questioned the “hurry” and the need to implement the legislations amid the coronavirus pandemic.“Their target is to end the MSP and food procurement system. They know the day that happens, farmers of Punjab and Haryana will be finished,” Gandhi said. “But the Congress will not allow this to happen, we stand firmly behind you {farmers}. We will not back down an inch,” he added.President Ram Nath Kovind has given his assent to the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which were passed by Parliament last month.Claiming that they will lead to more efficient farm markets, the government last month enacted the three laws, allowing farmers to bypass state-controlled market yards run by agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) and enter into five-year farming contracts with agribusinesses. The government also freed up several commonly consumed food items from strict stocking limits that discouraged private investment in cold storages. Farmers’ groups are protesting against the reforms, including the move to end the monopoly of APMCs, because they fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. They also fear the reforms may weaken the MSP mechanism. The central government has maintained that the MSP system will remain and has accused the Congress and other opposition parties of misleading farmers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has alleged that those opposing the bills want “middlemen” to thrive, while his government is concerned about the interests of farmers who will now be able to get a better price for their produce. It was merely “opposition for the sake of opposition”, he has said. Gandhi, the Congress MP from Kerala’s Wayanad, alleged that corporate houses were setting the agenda for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.“A couple of chosen corporate houses are issuing diktats to the central government on policy formation. Lands of farmers in states such as Punjab and Haryana that have contributed significantly to the national food security for decades are now facing the threat of acquisition by the powerful corporate houses.”“For six years, Narendra Modi has been speaking lies. When he brought demonetisation, he had then said black money will be curbed. When GST {goods and services tax} was implemented, it hit small shopkeepers, traders and the poor.,” he said.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, state Congress president Sunil Jakhar, party’s Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat and other leaders were present at the launch of the campaign. Former minister and MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu, who has stayed away from all Congress programmes since he resigned from the state cabinet last year, too addressed the gathering.The Punjab chief minister urged Gandhi to bring farmers at the national level under one roof for an organised protest against the Centre. “The Congress will fight back unless the black laws on farm sector are withdrawn,” said Singh.Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma, meanwhile, hit out at the Congress and said that the farming community has been misinformed about the new legislations. The BJP, he said, has started a campaign to explain the benefits of the laws to farm leaders. “These are the visionary rules where the existing food procurement exercise including, purchase by the government agencies and MSP will continue. Rahul Gandhi owes an explanation on an electoral promise made by the Congress in 2014 Lok Sabha and Punjab assembly in 2019 promising liberalization of the farm sector. The Congress leadership is exposed for opposing the provisions that it backed earlier,” said Sharma.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-farmers-are-happy-why-are-they-protesting-asks-rahul/story-OqirfjsAnFtSyCjFWLeBEN.html
05-10-2020||India||Active Covid-19 cases hit first-ever plateau in India||With 936,089 active cases of Covid-19, as of Sunday night, India appears to have stemmed the rise in the crucial statistic for the first time as the figure remained below the million mark for 14 consecutive days. This is the first time since the start of the pandemic that the total number of active cases in the country have seen a sustained decline for two weeks. A look at how this trend has changed, and which states are driving the trend:FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTIVE CASES STOP RISING The total number of active cases of Covid-19 in India breached the million mark for the first time on September 16. This came on the back of months of new cases outstripping the pace of those recovering from Covid-19. But this has changed through the second half of September, resulting in a much-needed plateau in active cases.The number of active cases remained above the million mark for five days, touching a peak (so far) of 1,020,813 on September 17 and have since then dropped to 936,089. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();IN DAILY TRAJECTORY, A REVERSAL The seven-day average of growth of active cases as of October 4 stands at -0.4%. In fact, active cases on average have seen a sustained negative growth for the last 14 days — the first time since the start of the pandemic that this has happened. In the past two weeks, active cases have decreased by 40,398. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();For the week ended October 4, active cases in India decreased by 4,290 per day on average. The lowest this number touched was when active cases dropped by 8,021 on average every day for the week ended September 26.WHERE THE TREND CHANGED (AND WHERE IT DIDN’T) Among the states with the most overall cases, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have seen active cases drop steadily over the past few weeks. Active cases appear to have hit a plateau in crucial states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. However, some states such as Karnataka, Kerala and Rajasthan are still seeing a rise in active cases. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-cases-hit-first-ever-plateau-in-india/story-5BEzaHBcwh4oqQ3zzyVgIP.html
05-10-2020||India||Key GST Council meet today, 9 states yet to pick borrowing option||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting on Monday to finalise modalities to compensate states for their revenue shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year is expected to be stormy as opposition-ruled states - Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal - have not yet opted either of the two borrowing options, two officials aware of the development said on Sunday.So far, 21 state governments have opted to borrow Rs. 97,000 crore to plug a shortfall in revenue from the GST rather than borrow the entire deficit of Rs. 2.35 lakh crore, the officials said requesting anonymity.The government has projected a Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in GST revenue this financial year, Rs. 97,000 crore accruing from implementation issues and the rest from the pandemic, and prompted the states to borrow from the market to cover the deficit.Also read: 400 to 500 million Covid vaccine doses by July 2021 - All you need to knowAt the 41st GST Council on August 27, the Union government gave two borrowing options to the states to meet the revenue shortfall - the states would not have to pay either the principal or the interest if they borrow only Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue gap because of implementation issues, but they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfalls due to an ‘Act of God’ - the Covid-19 pandemic.Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have so far, opted for the first borrowing option of Rs 97,000 crore, officials said.“A final decision on this matter is expected on Monday at the 42nd meeting of the GST Council. It is for the members to work out a legal and viable solution to this crisis. No outside agency can interfere in the Council’s decision-making process,” one of the officials said.The proposal to form a dispute resolution mechanism had been already rejected, he said, adding that some council members could raise this matter on Monday.A second official said, “A proposal to create a dispute settlement authority consisting of retired judges was mooted in 2011, even before the implementation of GST regime, but it was rejected by the then Parliamentary Standing Committee. Later, the then GST Empowered Committee headed by Sushil Modi also rejected the proposal arguing that any such authority would undermine the sovereignty of the GST Council which essentially consists of the Centre and states and whose recommendations are binding on state legislatures and the Parliament.”Apart from the Fitment Committee and the Law Committee, the Council can form groups of ministers (GoMs) and committees of officers (CoOs) to resolve any matter, he said. “Therefore, to say that the GST Council has not set up any dispute resolution mechanism is without any basis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/compensation-issue-to-states-likely-to-be-resolved-at-gst-council-meet-on-monday/story-6ajDi1WaF4RjBipwnZY39I.html

05-10-2020||Editorials||Unravelling the Bihar puzzle | HT Editorial||What appeared to be a predictable election in Bihar has suddenly taken a turn. National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners — the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — have arrived at a tentative seat-sharing arrangement, but the third pillar of this alliance, the Ram Vilas Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), has decided to contest separately. Intriguingly, the LJP will remain a part of the central government; it has declared that its battle is with Mr Kumar and not with the BJP; it will contest on seats where JD(U) candidates are in the fray and avoid challenging the BJP; and it has reiterated its loyalty to Narendra Modi.The key to unravelling this puzzle is understanding the state of the Opposition. With Lalu Prasad out of action, Tejaswi Prasad unable to match up, and the Congress remaining marginal, there is a sense that the Opposition is not really in a position to displace the NDA. This has shifted the locus of the competition — from one between the ruling alliance and the Opposition to one within parties of the ruling alliance to enhance the strike rate in elections and maximise their post-poll bargaining position. Within the NDA, there is simmering resentment against Nitish Kumar in the BJP, which sees itself as the natural claimant for leadership in Bihar and believes Mr Modi’s popularity is enough to see it win power. The fact that Mr Kumar is facing serious anti-incumbency has only emboldened this view — but the BJP does not want to take the risk of a repeat of 2015, when Mr Kumar tied up with Lalu Yadav, and wants to keep JD(U) locked in till the election at least. The competition is also happening with an eye towards a post-Nitish Kumar landscape. From the BJP to Chirag Paswan to Tejaswi Yadav, the aim is to capture future political space.It is important not to overestimate the LJP. It is a relatively small party; its social base is limited to the Paswan caste, found in limited pockets; and its recent electoral success is primarily due to its association with Mr Modi. But the fact that the BJP is both a part of the incumbent formation, asking for votes for the continued leadership of Nitish Kumar, and has a friendly party in the Opposition, asking for votes to displace Nitish Kumar, means that Bihar’s election — and post-election scenario — may throw up surprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/unravelling-the-bihar-puzzle-ht-editorial/story-oLWZQZXlInjrrdqBrc16iJ.html
05-10-2020||Editorials||End the conspiracy theories, now | HT Editorial||The forensic team of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has, according to media reports citing the doctor leading the team, concluded that Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide. While the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is proceeding with its own enquiries, the AIIMS finding should put an end to the unfortunate and almost absurd drama that came to accompany Rajput’s tragic death.As this newspaper has argued, Rajput’s suicide should have been a moment to have a serious conversation in this country about mental health. Instead, elaborate conspiracy theories were constructed — placing the blame on either a set of powerful Bollywood figures or on Rajput’s partner, actor Rhea Chakraborty, or both. Television channels were at the forefront of declaring that Rajput’s death was, in fact, murder. Politicians, especially in Bihar, and of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, jumped into the fray — the former with an eye on the upcoming state elections and the latter with possibly a desire to send a message to cultural and movie figures to fall in line. The Maharashtra and Bihar police fought with each other. The judiciary stepped in. Drug and money laundering investigations were kicked off. And Ms Chakraborty was arrested.All of this was premised on the belief that Rajput was either murdered — it is now clear that there was no murder — or driven to suicide, all on the basis of almost non-existent evidence and an outright ignorance of mental health issues. India’s news television channels owe their audience an apology; politicians who stepped into the fray should introspect and pull back; and investigative agencies should learn to focus on their core job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/end-the-conspiracy-theories-now-ht-editorial/story-41zv2aipEEvQLelozK0D9K.html
