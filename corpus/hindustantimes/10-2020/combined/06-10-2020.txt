This is a predictable consequence of a process of law-making that undermines India’s federal consensus. Agriculture is a state subject. The passage of national laws, on a state subject, marks a rupture in India’s federal trajectory. There is no argument that India’s agriculture markets, mandis in particular, have been stuck in a low-level equilibrium and need reform. Greater accessibility, transparency and competition are necessary goals. But even the most ardent supporters of the new laws recognise that liberalising agriculture markets requires negotiating knotty implementation issues. The Constitution assigned jurisdiction over agriculture markets to states due to the very localised nature of farm production. The first sale between the farmer and the trader is linked with the production process. This is location specific and it is states who are best placed to determine the contours of production and sale including, taxation, credit, building farmer producer organisations and physical markets.The current laws upend this. They bypass states by drawing on the Centre’s constitutional powers to regulate inter-state and intra-state trade — note that the Act dealing with Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) reform is titled The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020. But they leave a critical institutional vacuum about how state-specific implementation investments, crucial for running efficient markets, will be negotiated and managed, when states are bypassed. Moreover, they create an artificial distinction between “markets areas” (regulated by the mandi system under state governments) and “trade areas” (now under the central Acts), thus risking a regulatory maze.Beyond implementation, the choice of bypassing states in the quest to reform raises questions fundamental to the federal bargain. Our national debates on agriculture, and indeed other factor markets, have been framed by a deep disenchantment with state governments. This is not unjustified. States have routinely failed to challenge political interests. Agriculture subsidies and minimum support price (MSP) systems are intertwined with vested interests in states. Punjab, for instance, has failed to challenge this regime despite significant fiscal and environmental damage. On markets, states have done more. Karnataka experimented with electronic market integration, Madhya Pradesh with private single-licence yards, Maharashtra built infrastructure for private markets. However, the pace was uneven. State “failure” raises an important federal conundrum. What is the Centre’s role when state political economy is the binding constraint for reform? As the economy becomes more complex, there is a sound economic rationale for pursuing the goal of a common national market across factor markets. This requires consensus-building, a task that rests squarely with the Centre. But when states allow political concerns to override, should the Centre bypass states by bulldozing reforms? Our disenchantment with states has legitimised the bulldozing approach. But this undermines reforms. For instance, the artificial distinction between “markets areas” and “trade areas” in these laws, has resulted in a new battleground as states are now expanding their market territory. Punjab has declared its intent to declare the entire state a market area. Haryana stopped trade from Uttar Pradesh. Further bulldozing breaks trust. There is much more to agriculture reforms than mandis. Several elements of the production process including subsidy reforms and the vexed MSP question need untangling. As agricultural economist, Sudha Narayan, has noted, the Punjab farmers’ concerns with MSP are different from those of the Bihar farmers. Arriving at an appropriate pathway of subsidy, price support and procurement reforms will require extensive consultations. By riding roughshod over state-specific concerns, there is a real risk of foreclosing the possibility of future reforms on these issues, which are necessary to achieve the goal of infusing competition and giving farmers genuine choices. There is a delicious irony here. India’s reform successes, where reform efforts have broken ground, are entirely about state-led innovation. It is thus, worth asking whether an alternative process that focused on building trust and creating a deliberative platform, such as the proposed national council for agriculture markets, aimed at persuading states to hasten reforms and synchronise legislation, may have been better. India’s federal project has often found itself in tension with the project of economic reforms. Policy narratives have been dominated by growing impatience with consensus-building and negotiating state politics. We look for reform champions and crises to push big ideas, thus legitimising, across political parties, central government encroachment on state subjects. The new agriculture laws are symptomatic of this larger federal conundrum. However, this government’s use of its brute majority and suspension of parliamentary procedure to push these bills have taken away the only institutional check and balance against total centralisation of power — parliamentary deliberation. What was needed to reform agriculture was political statesmanship and consensus-building for genuine cooperative federalism. Instead, we got political bulldozing and have ended up with a poorly-drafted law, a broken reform process, and a weakened federal compact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/where-reforms-and-federalism-clash-opinion/story-uRvliZDJOZ2c64egQwyK5H.html

Earlier this week, the section, which is non-bailable, was added to the FIR registered at DLF Phase-2 police station after seeking legal opinion in the case, the police said on Tuesday. The juvenile driver is yet to be apprehended, said the police. The family of the victim, Alok Gupta, had been demanding that the police invoke stringent sections against the accused persons. They had also demanded that the police make the parents of the juvenile driver, and the juvenile co-passenger of the car, a party in the case. On September 26, at least 400 people including family members, friends, cyclists, carrying placards and banners, had taken out a solidarity march from DT Mega Mall to the crime spot near DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station, demanding justice and action against the alleged perpetrators. On Saturday, another silent march was taken out in Sector 50 while a day earlier, similar such protests by family, friends, acquaintances of the victim, took place in Gurugram, Delhi, Noida, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Jaipur. On August 23 around 6am, Gupta was on his way to Noida, when a Ford Eco Sport, in which two juveniles were travelling, had rammed into the divider and hit him across the carriageway. Gupta had succumbed to injuries and at the time, police had registered an FIR against the juvenile driver and owner of car, who is a friend of the driver’s father, under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of IPC. Subsequently, the police had added sections 184 (driving dangerously) and 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act against the juvenile driver and section 199 A of the MV Act against the car owner. Both had been arrested and released on bail. Maqsood Ahmed, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), east, said, “The Section 304- part 2 under IPC against the juvenile driver was added to the FIR after seeking fresh legal opinion in the case. Efforts are being made to apprehend the juvenile driver. Regarding action against the driver’s parents, we have sought legal opinion and accordingly action shall be taken. As per provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, the owner of the vehicle is liable in such incidents.” A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “A police team had gone to apprehend the juvenile driver at two locations over the past two days, but the juvenile could not be found.” Anurag Gupta, brother of the victim, said, “The investigating officer in the case informed us over the phone that Section 304 part-2 of IPC has been added to the FIR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cyber-city-accident-juvenile-driver-booked-under-non-bailable-ipc-section/story-AE2z58RQVJTpRK1ecLYmDO.html
06-10-2020||Gurugram||Renewable energy department faces a delay in acquiring solar pumps under PM-Kusum scheme||The district’s renewable energy department has been facing a delay in acquiring solar water pumps to be installed in agriculture fields under the PM-Kusum (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahabhiyan) scheme according to officials. The department’s target is to install 340 pumps by March next year. However, the department has been able to install only five pumps till now, despite the fact that 312 farmers have already deposited money to get solar pumps installed.Officials said that due to the outbreak of Covid-19, the production of solar-based water pumps has been affected. It is taking companies almost three months to supply the pump sets. Based on the work order placed by the renewable energy department, companies selected by the central government supply solar pumps to the state. “Industrial operations got affected due to Covid-19. As such, there has been a delay in receiving the pumps. It is taking more than 90 days to receive the supply of pumps for installation,” said Rameshwar Singh, district project officer. HT reached out to two private companies providing solar pumps to the state and the district. However, they remained unavailable for comment. Solar pumps were introduced by the government to replace diesel pumps used in agriculture land for the extraction of water. The district’s renewable energy department has a target of installing 340 solar pumps in agriculture fields. Solar pumps come in two varieties – surface and submersible. These are provided by the government at the subsidy of 75% under the PM-Kusum scheme introduced in 2019. The scheme, however, became functional in the district this year. “The remaining 25% is paid by the farmers. 312 farmers from different blocks of the district have already paid the required amount and are awaiting installation,” said Singh. The Gurugram block has fairly fewer number of agriculture fields. Only 40 farmers have come forward for the installation of solar pumps. In Sohna too, the same number of farmers have come forward. On the other hand, the main agriculture belt of the district falling under Farrukhnagar and Pataudi saw the maximum participation. From Farukkhnagar, 134 farmers, while in Pataudi, 108 farmers have applied for solar pumps. Since Gurugram is designated as a “dark zone” due to its depleting water table, officials said that many farmers are reluctant to opt for solar pumps. This year, the district’s water table has dipped to 36.21 metres. “Farmers have to opt for 5-horsepower(hp) solar pumps as opposed to 7.5- to 10-horsepower solar pumps, which cannot be installed in dark zone districts. A 5hp pump costs nearly ₹57,826-59,491,” said Singh, adding that some farmers have expressed interest in installing a 7.5 hp and 10hp pump for which they are ready to pay anywhere ₹88,052 to ₹109,989.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/renewable-energy-department-faces-a-delay-in-acquiring-solar-pumps-under-pm-kusum-scheme/story-Aets7obdOsc1mc3guh9x3N.html

This will be the third such exercise in Gurugram since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March this year, and will be completed before the onset of the festive season. The Navratri celebrations, one of the most important festivals of this season, will commence on October 17. This third round of sero-survey will follow the same methodology as was followed by the statewide seroprevalence study conducted in August. A total of 880 samples from each of the state’s 22 districts will be taken, of which 528 samples will be taken from rural areas and 352 from urban areas. “There will be four clusters in the rural category, and four in the urban areas. These will be selected at random by authorities at the state level,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), Gurugram. The urban clusters selected for this third sero-survey in Gurugram include Chauma village in Palam Vihar, Khandsa, Naharpur Roopa, and Rajendra Park. Each cluster itself will be once again divided into four sub-clusters, with 22 samples being taken from as many individual households. For rural areas, samples will be collected in a multistage sampling process from four localities, including Gurugram village, Garhi Harsaru, Bhondsi and Kasan PHC blocks. Samples will taken from both sub-centre (SC) villages, as well as non-SC villages. Among the villages from which samples will be taken are Dundaheri, Choma, Chandu, Budera, Rithoj, Dhani Rithoj, Nanwalki and Manesar.A senior health department official who was part of the team that conducted August’s sero-survey, seeking anonymity, said, “This third seroprevalence study is now being done just before the start of the festive season, and will be followed up with a fourth round of antibody tests after Diwali on November 14.It will give us a sense of how much the spread of Covid-19 increased between August and October, and then whether this spread accelerated during festival season, which is expected.” As per the results of Haryana’s August sero-survey, the seropositivity rate for Gururgam was 10.8 percent, meaning that approximately one in every 10 people surveyed in Gurugram had been exposed to the SARS-Cov-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19. This was higher than the state figure, at eight percent. As per the data shared by the district health department, close to 90 percent of samples from Gurugram were found to belong to asymptomatic patients. While he did not give specific numbers, Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, stated that a significant fraction of shopkeepers, migrant labourers and healthcare workers were found to be seropositive. Even earlier, a preliminary sero-survey conducted across five districts in Haryana in May revealed that 36 out of 92 people surveyed had developed antibodies against Covid-19. “However, 50 percent of that survey’s sample included people who had already been confirmed Covid-positive, to gauge the efficacy of the IgL ELISA antibody kit. That exercise wasn’t a good yardstick to measure prevalence of the disease,” explained Dr Prakash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/third-statewide-serological-survey-to-be-completed-before-the-start-of-the-festive-season/story-y108VUTimrjlaNbFC8oKGL.html
06-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG to seek help of multiple stakeholders to bolster its efforts to curb Covid-19||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will be using the help of elected representatives, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), religious institutions, non-governmental organisations, self-help groups, traders’ bodies and market associations to expand its outreach and ensure a more stringent supervision of safety protocols pertaining to the outbreak of Covid-19 in the city, said officials on Tuesday.This was among the many key decisions taken by MCG’s Covid-19 action plan team during its first meeting at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Tuesday.Under the action plan, the MCG will be initiating a “focussed awareness” campaign to combat the pandemic, said officials.On Monday, the Directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) had issued directions to all 88 urban local bodies across Haryana, made of 10 municipal corporations, 21 municipal councils, and 57 municipal committees, to formulate a Covid-19 action plan.In this regard, the MCC formed an action plan team on Tuesday to chalk out the measures that can be adopted to sensitise residents about the problems associated with Covid-19, the necessary safety protocols to be followed, and the penalties to be faced for violations.“Adhering to the directions of the ULB, an action plan against the pandemic has been formulated. In today’s meeting, various steps to counter Covid19 — such as creating awareness about the pandemic, following rules of social distancing, use of face masks, and other hygiene measures — were decided. We have chalked out a strategic plan and directions have been issued to the concerned civic officials in this regard,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG, and one of the action plan members.An MCG official privy to the matter said that the civic body is sending letters to all elected representatives, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), religious institution, NGOs, self-help groups, trade and market associations to create awareness regarding the pandemic within their focus areas and also inform the civic body if people are found to be disobeying the safety protocols. “The MCG has been undertaking various measures to prevent and contain the spread of Covid-19 since the last seven months. We realised that involving more citizen groups would further bolster our efforts to spread awareness about the virus as well as to supervise the safety measures. We are working on various strategies to curb the pandemic and ensure the maximum number of people stay safe,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Singh has appointed Surender Kumar, additional commissioner, MCG as the nodal officer for the Covid-19 action plan. Kumar would be responsible for the implementation of all safety measures, said officials.“We will be assisting the MCG and creating awareness about Covid-19 measures within our areas. Teams would be formed for both spreading the messages as well as keeping a check on residents if there are any lapses regarding safety protocols,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of Gurgaon Citizen Council, an umbrella body of RWAs in the city. Officials further decided that around 250 vehicles of EcoGreen — MCG’s waste concessionaire for door-to-door collection of waste — would be used to deliver Covid-19 related messages.“Ecogreen vehicles would be ideal in relaying messages on a mass level as they travel to practically all neighbourhoods in the city. We will be taping some pre-recorded messages and attaching them to the vehicles’ loudspeakers to spread more awareness about Covid-19,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.Further, the MCG would also install around 50 hoardings in public places such as government buildings, transport offices, public toilets, and markets bearing Covid-related messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-seek-help-of-multiple-stakeholders-to-bolster-its-efforts-to-curb-covid-19/story-kqiIVLSFsiDm0ONdr2uHiI.html

06-10-2020||City||Delhi’s largest graveyard allocates more space to accommodate Covid victims||New Delhi: An additional two acres of land has been allocated in the oldest graveyard in Delhi for burying victims of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the toll from the viral infection is growing.Till Wednesday, 5,581 people have died of Covid-19 in Delhi, according to the government’s daily bulletin. In April, as the Covid-19 toll began to rise in the capital, Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, Delhi’s oldest and largest Islamic graveyard near Delhi Gate, had allocated six acres of land -- clearing about 150 metres away from the main cemetery -- for the burial of victims.With over 700 graves that space filled up this month and the cemetery committee, which administers the graveyard, has allocated another two acres of land in the graveyard. On Tuesday, a JCB machine worked for hours to clear the overgrown land for another 400 graves. “We never thought the six acres would not be enough. If the Covid-19 crisis lasts another two months, our graveyard does not have any more space for burying Covid-19 victims,” said Haji Faiyazuddin, the secretary of the managing committee at Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam.Mohammad Shamim, the 38- year-old supervisor at the graveyard, who has overseen all the burials in the past seven months, said when the first body arrived in April, he never thought that Covid-19 would claim so many lives. “These days, we receive about 4-5 bodies on an average every day; May was the worst when we received about 10 to 15 bodies every day,” said Shamim.Shamim points out that one of the reasons why they have been fast running out of space is the fact that the graves of Covid-19 victims take up more space than others. “The grave which is dug by a JCB machine is bigger and deeper than normal hand-dug graves. We have to follow complicated space-consuming protocols for the burial of the Covid-19 victims,” says Shamim.Haji Faiyazuddin said that a lot of people who are dying in Delhi hospitals from the coronavirus disease are from the neighbouring states. “Their relatives do not want to take the dead bodies to their native places, a reason why we are receiving so many bodies here,” he said. “But no one has bothered to talk to us about how we are managing.”Dr Ashok Rawat, medical health officer (MHO), North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the nodal agency for burial grounds in Delhi, said, “We have a plan for creating additional space for burials. A 4,000 square metres land in Rohini Sector-26 is being developed into a burial ground. We will also try to carve out a cemetery from it for Christians. The land has been allotted and the boundary wall has been made. Land filling has to start to level the ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-largest-graveyard-allocates-more-space-to-accommodate-covid-victims/story-mkfzYayeLlR6ZHRxUOT3aM.html

The technical bids for the same were opened on Monday evening, but no contractor came forward. Meanwhile, the MC is managing both parking lots.After the previous contracts of parking lots expired in August, the MC has already extended the period of four other parking lots till October 30, after one of the contractors moved the high court seeking extension in the previous contract to compensate for the loss incurred during lockdown period.The four parking lots include multi-storey parking near MC Zone A office, Bhadaur House, Model Town Extension and BRS Nagar (near Orient Cinema).MC secretary Neeraj Jain said, “No contractor submitted a bid to take the Feroze Gandhi market and Sarabha Nagar bock-I parking lot. The last date to submit bids for all parking lots is now October 22 and new parking lots will be allotted from November onwards.”Following an e-auction, the Finance and Contracts Committee (F and CC) of the MC on June 9 had approved the resolution to allot Feroze Gandhi market and Sarabha Nagar Block-I market lots for Rs 1.10 crore and Rs 4.5 lakh respectively to the same contractor.In September, the MC had terminated the previous contracts of Feroze Gandhi market and Sarabha Nagar block-I parking lots after the contractor failed to take possession of the lots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-bids-for-feroze-gandhi-market-parking-contract-open-till-oct-22/story-yOr63RrkPyXh0GKLxSnYuO.html

06-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray assures no implementation of farm laws until concerns resolved||Maharashtra government has started a dialogue with farmer leaders over the implementation of controversial laws that aims to bring reforms in the agriculture marketing sector. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday assured them the state will not be implementing these legislations until their concerns are taken care of. Farmer leaders have expressed concerns over cheating and exploitation of the agrarian community in the absence of a guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for trading outside Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). They have also demanded a dedicated court on the lines of industrial and labour courts for farmers to get justice.On Tuesday, Thackeray had called a meeting with several farmer leaders to discuss the critical issue of reforms in the agriculture marketing sector, that has turned controversial as farmer organisations and many political parties including ruling allies — Congress and NCP —had opposed implementation of three legislation enacted by the Central government that aim to bring reforms in the sector.A presentation made by Anoop Kumar, principal secretary, state marketing department in relation to the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 also pointed out lacunae. It stated that the legislation said there will be no regulation for trading outside APMC jurisdiction, which is like leaving farmers at the will of private traders who can exploit them by determining the lesser price of the produce. It further stated that there will be no control to ensure farmers are paid their remuneration against the produce in time. “There is also a possibility that small and medium farmers can be exploited by middlemen and farm produce aggregators. This is because they are financially powerful and small and medium farmers may not be able to bargain while fixing prices of the produce. As a result, the model price system can be destroyed and prices will start falling,” stated the presentation.Under this law, the farmer can sell his finished produce to any merchant anywhere in the country. There will be no compulsion to sell them at the APMC.Ajit Nawale, general secretary, Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS) demanded MSP protection for the farmers. “We pressed that the farmers should get MSP if they are trading outside APMC. There should also be a protection mechanism in case a trader doesn’t pay their remuneration and makes an attempt at cheating,” Nawale said. “We have also demanded formation of agriculture or farmer courts so that they can be approached by the community if cheated or exploited by any means,” he added.Vijay Jawandhia, agriculture expert from Vidarbha demanded a guarantee for MSP for the farmers. “The Central government wants to do away with the MSP system as prices of farm produce are too low and no market in the country is in a position to provide MSP to farmers for their produce. Consequently, the Centre has to increase its procurement of farm produce beyond capacity,” he said.Following opposition by farmer organisations as well as ruling allies, the state government last week had stayed a notification issued in August for implementation of the ordinances, now converted into legislation by the Centre, and had declared to form a cabinet sub-committee to look into concerns and objections raised so far.“As per the provisions in the ordinances, the farmers are free to market their produce at field, factory, warehouse or cold storage without any hindrance and any market fee applicable under the APMC Act. Any other fee or charges applicable under the APMC Act cannot be charged now as per the provisions made in the ordinances. The law and judiciary department has vetted the ordinances and validated its applicability. Though the existence of the APMC has not been affected by the promulgation of the ordinance, the farmers will have a parallel mechanism to get fair prices for their produce. The market committees are expected to implement the provisions in the ordinances effectively,” states the notification issued on August 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-assures-no-implementation-of-farm-laws-until-concerns-resolved/story-BRLVkaxS9LHZAcVSuhIFPJ.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government has no authority to put additional restrictions on fee collection: Schools to Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC), while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by private educational institutions, was informed that the May 8, 2020 government resolution (GR) which restrained them from collecting fees for the academic year 2020-21 was not valid as the state was acting beyond its authority and the restriction put by the GR had no statutory authority or backing. The schools argued that as the Fee Regulation Act, 2011 had sufficient restrictions to deter private schools from overcharging students and parents, the government was trying to put additional restrictions through the GR which violated their constitutional rights, and hence, the GR should be set aside. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing four petitions filed by private educational institutions, was informed by senior counsel Dr Milind Sathe who represented an institution along with advocates Prateek Seksaria and Saket Mone, that they had been aggrieved by the May 8 GR and hence they had approached the HC. While making submissions, Dr Sathe submitted that the state had approached the Supreme Court (SC) after the HC had stayed the implementation of the GR, but the Apex court had directed the matter to be heard again by the HC. Dr Sathe added that private schools were regulated by a law which put reasonable restrictions on them from overcharging students as well as laid down the procedure for increasing fees which the schools had been following. However, in light of the lockdown and the pandemic situation, the state had issued the GR by invoking the Fee Regulation Act, the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Dr Sathe submitted that as the private schools were already governed by the Fee Regulation Act, the state could not supersede it through a GR which had no statutory authority or backing. “The Act has already put reasonable restrictions on private schools and any additional restrictions through a GR would violate the constitutional rights of the schools to carry out their vocation,” said Dr Sathe. After hearing the submissions, the court wanted clarity from Dr Sathe regarding the sections of the Disaster Management Act invoked by the state in the GR. The court sought to know what was the meaning of ‘disaster’ as mentioned in section 38 of the Act read with section 2 (E) of the Act and why the state could not invoke the same in the pandemic situation. The court asked Dr Sathe to respond by Thursday and said that it would complete hearing on the petitions. The GR had restrained private school from charging fees or increasing fees for the academic year 2020-21 and had also restrained the schools from forcing students and parents to pay fees for services which were not provided. The schools had petitioned the HC challenging the GR. After the HC had stayed the implementation of the GR, the state approached the SC, but the top court reverted the petition to HC. Pursuant to the SC directions, the HC has taken up the petitions for final hearing. Senior counsels advocate P Samdani and Harish Salve will also be forwarding arguments for other schools on Thursday. Senior advocate Anil Anturkar will then respond for the state justifying the restrictions in the GR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-has-no-authority-to-put-additional-restrictions-on-fee-collection-schools-to-bombay-hc/story-XQRvSa1SwyElbThhhRT4MO.html
06-10-2020||City||After leopard attack on dog in Thane, abandoned pups provided shelter by MSEDCL staff||Seven week-old puppies, abandoned by their mother following an attack by a leopard, have been adopted in Thane.A few Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) employees and animal lovers in Patlipada area of Ghodbunder Road, Thane, are taking care of these puppies. They have also built a cage to protect them from leopards and snakes as the office is near the forest.The leopard entered the MSEDCL office premises in Patlipada at around 1.00 am on Saturday night and took away the dog. The entire incident was witnessed by the watchman of the MSEDCL office. The forest officials paid a visit to the site on Tuesday. Abhilash Ulhas Dawre, 24, an animal lover and a security guard with MSEDCL’s Patlipada office, said, “I was on night duty on Saturday at the MSEB store, which is completely surrounded by forest. At around 11:30 pm, I heard the barking of stray dogs and thought a snake would have tried to attack the puppies that were delivered just a week ago. I took my snake stick and went in search of a reptile. However, I could not see any.”Dawre returned to his office. Again, he heard loud barking at 1.00 am. “I again came out and saw a leopard taking the stay dog away. It happened so fast that I could barely save the dog. There are also pugmarks where the leopard was spotted.”Dawre kept the puppies aside, safe from the wild animal. “It was not the first time such an attack on a stray dog took place. Earlier, too such instances have taken place in the area,” added Dawre.After the news of the attack spread in the adjoining MSEDCL colony, several youngsters, Nishanth Nair, Aniket Korde, Vishal Gawhale, Sushanth Rathod, Chetan Joshi and Rohit Korde, all in their 20s, came to help out Daware.“Together, we built a house for the pups so that they do not fall prey to the leopard again. We feed them from time to time using syringes as they are still young. We also installed a light in the area at night to prevent more such attacks,” he said.The youngsters have also informed the forest officials and a few NGOs to put the puppies up for adoption. However, adoption is possible only when the puppies are at least a month old.Sandeep More, Range Forest Officer, Thane, confirmed about the leopard attack on stray and said, “Since lockdown, the leopard has been frequently sighted along areas like Srinagar and Haware City. This is the same adult leopard that visits all these areas and attacks stray dogs. We have created awareness among the societies where he has been sighted. On Tuesday, we visited the MSEDCL office where there was a sighting on Saturday. The puppies are safe though the locals informed that the female dog was snatched by the leopard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-leopard-attack-on-dog-in-thane-abandoned-pups-provided-shelter-by-msedcl-staff/story-lxWz4VBIWQMbvZm46H7UFL.html
06-10-2020||City||Delhi govt urges L-G to allow cinema halls to open||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Tuesday sent a proposal to lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, urging him to allow theatres, cinema halls and multiplexes in the Capital to open from October 15 as per the central government’s guidelines, a senior government official said.The matter, the official said, was briefly discussed in Tuesday’s Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting without any conclusion.The need for a revised Covid-19 management strategy and modalities of an intensive awareness campaign in the light of the festive season ahead was also discussed in detail in Tuesday’s meeting.The DDMA is chaired by Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.“These discussions will continue in the authority’s next meeting likely to happen in another week,” the senior DDMA official quoted above said.The next DDMA meeting, the official said, is likely to see detailed discussions on Ramlila celebrations, Durga Puja and further relaxations of lockdown norms, especially regarding cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes.The government’s proposal came after the Centre on Tuesday issued guidelines on cinema halls and multiplexes that have been allowed to open under the fresh reopening guidelines from October 15, after remaining shut for more than six months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The proposal on cinema halls was only briefly discussed in the meeting of the DDMA but there was no decision. The Delhi government has already sent a proposal to the L-G, urging him to allow cinema halls to open as per rules laid down by the Centre. The same proposal includes a demand to allow all weekly markets to open in every zone,” said the government official, who did not wish to be identified.Last month, the government had sent a proposal to open all weekly markets but the L-G allowed only a small relaxation by allowing two weekly markets per day per zone instead of the one at present.On September 18, Baijal had directed the government to draft a fresh strategy for containment zones, which is yet to be finalised, several senior officials confirmed. The present strategy under discussion requires districts to have area-specific containment plans to suit planned localities, unauthorised colonies, rural areas, etc., said a senior official in the revenue department without elaborating further.After Tuesday’s meeting, Baijal tweeted: “Discussed the recent trends of Covid-19 situation in Delhi and revised strategy as suggested by experts, including prospective planning for the management of Covid-19 in the coming months.”The meeting was attended by Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, revenue and transport minister Kailash Gahlot, chief secretary Vijay Dev, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and director of the national centre for disease control, Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, said Baijal in another tweet.The chief minister’s office, however, did not comment on the developments.The senior DDMA official who did not wish to be identified said, “The Authority was informed that a total of 173 dedicated multi-organisation mobile teams have been formed in 11 districts for concerted enforcement action. Fines are being levied for violation of national directives for Covid-19 management and enforcement-related performance by each district is being monitored daily. It was decided that considering the gravity of the pandemic situation, focused attention should be on containing transmission, strengthening medical infrastructure, improving recovery of patients and reducing Covid-19 fatalities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-urges-l-g-to-allow-cinema-halls-to-open/story-MzBzxrgEe1tFRW3wnOw2EN.html

MC officials including superintending engineer Rahul Gagneja, SDO Balwinder Singh and veterinary officer Harbans Dhalla are accompanying. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “It is important to study the existing plants so that no mistake is made in executing the projects and public money is not wasted. Also, we need to study how recycled material can be used.” Meanwhile, construction and demolition waste is currently dumped at vacant sites, green belts, plots in residential areas and other locations in various parts of the city, resulting in nuisance for residents.

06-10-2020||City||Shiv Sena, BJP at loggerheads over cluster survey at Thane||Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were at loggerheads in an ongoing survey of residents for cluster development scheme in Azad Nagar in Uthalsar, Thane. Few residents with the support of Sena workers staged a protest against the survey and tried to stop it. However, BJP workers reached the spot and restarted it, claiming that merely 20% of residents were opposed to it. Few civic officials reached Uthalsar ward for the biometric survey of residents for the cluster development scheme to be implemented in Thane. The table survey of the ward is completed, though the biometric survey to make a list of beneficiaries is remaining. “We were not taken into confidence while undertaking the survey. The authorities should explain the plan for our area. We should be able to know what areas will be developed under the cluster and what the rehabilitation plan is for residents,” said one resident. Local Sena workers who added that the residents should not be kept in the dark about the scheme. Shankar Patole, assistant municipal commissioner of Uthalsar said, “We had held several meetings with the residents before undertaking the survey. The local representatives were also asked to create awareness regarding the survey. Residents were taken into confidence before the entire process began. Few residents had opposed the survey on Tuesday, however, we resolved their issues and the survey was restarted.” Local BJP corporator Krishna Patil alleged that the Sena was trying to politicise the survey process. “Cluster development scheme is important to resolve the issues of dangerous buildings in Thane. Merely 20% of residents had opposed the survey while the remaining 80% were in favour of it, thus it was re-started.” Amit Jaiswal, Shiv Sena shakha head said, “We are not opposed to cluster redevelopment, but to the way the survey is conducted. People should know how much square feet they will get, how long it will take for the formalities to complete post biometrics and the rehabilitation plans. There was no need to politicise the issue; everyone is for cluster redevelopment in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-bjp-at-loggerheads-over-cluster-survey-at-thane/story-r6jaFBpfNCLH1BCDUz4AQP.html

06-10-2020||Chandigarh||7 isolation centres closed, testing stopped at centres in Ludhiana||Besides shutting down seven government Covid Care Centres in the district, the health department on Tuesday also reduced the number of Covid-19 testing centres.The testing centres located on the premises of Government Senior Secondary Residential School for Meritorious Students and Kular College of Nursing in Khanna have been closed.Sharing this, district epidemiologist Dr Ramesh said the testing centres were closed following orders by higher authorities.Dr Puneet Juneja, in-charge of the Covid Care Centres, said these centres collected an average 100 to 125 samples a day. The isolation facilities that have been closed down include those at the meritorious school; Community Centre in Koom Kalan; Mother and Child Hospital near Vardhman Mill; Civil Hospitals of Jagraon and Khanna; Jawaddi health centre; and Kular College of Nursing, Khanna.Now, the district has only one government isolation centre at the Ludhiana civil hospital.“Currently, there are only 34 patients in the isolation facility of the civil hospital, so it was decided to cut down the number of isolation centres. However, I will urge the deputy commissioner to resume testing services at the meritorious school for the convenience of patients living in Haibowal, Civil Lines and surrounding areas,” Dr Bagga said.He added, “Samples are still being collected at 54 locations in urban Ludhiana. Besides, there are six mobile teams and two mobile labs for testing in rural areas.”PATIENTS LEFT IN THE LURCHMeanwhile, people visiting the centres for testing after having come in contact with a positive patient or having symptoms complained that two centres were closed without any prior information.Soni, a domestic help from Civil Lines, said he visited the centre at the meritorious school on Tuesday morning, only to find it closed. “I was told to either go to the civil hospital or the health centre in Jawaddi for Covid testing. When I reached the Jawaddi centre, I was told to go to the civil hospital,” said Rakesh Kumar, a driver, who also came from Civil Lines.Hari Ram, a migrant, who recently returned from Uttar Pradesh, underwent the same ordeal as Soni and Rakesh.Jawaddi centre’s in-charge Dr Surinder Kaur said samples were collected only between 10.30am and 12.30pm.“Staff can wear PPE kits only for a limited time. The patients may have visited after 12.30pm and therefore, asked to visit the civil hospital,” she added.On the other hand, the civil surgeon said he will look into why the patients visiting the centre were turned away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/7-isolation-centres-closed-testing-stopped-at-centres-in-ludhiana/story-xNRdFZaZzZeJcVPt8YxZSJ.html

The court said the CM has been not called for the offence of defamation committed pursuant to a ctriminal conspiracy; but simply defamation.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for a comment on the issue.Additional sessions judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar said that each person arrayed as an accused in the complaint has been summoned for his individual act of defamation.“The procedure which magistrate will follow is in his discretion as per the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code. It would be premature to make any comment, regarding the procedure which might be followed by the learned ACMM. Therefore, this argument of the learned counsel for the revisionist cannot be taken up appropriately at this stage,” the judge said in his order dated October 3.Tanwar had filed a criminal defamation complaint against Kejriwal, and AAP leaders Amanatullah Khan, Surender Singh and Dilip Pandey.He alleged they had levelled allegations against him in the media that he was involved in the conspiracy to murder MM Khan, an estate officer with the NDMC who was shot dead on May 16 last year. Tanwar alleged that the AAP leaders tried to “malign and ruin (his) image and political career”.It had sought prosecution of the four AAP leaders for the alleged offences of defamation and criminal conspiracy under the IPC. On July 23, 2019, the court had summoned all the accused to appear which was subsequently challenged by Kejriwal, contending that the case was politically motivated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-quashes-kejriwal-s-appeal-against-in-person-appearance-in-defamation-case/story-GERscD9KW34huYVDbhWOfK.html

Her husband, Kamlesh, filed a complaint at the Phase 3 police station on Monday.According to him, his wife was in her last month of pregnancy and was complaining of pain on Sunday night. “We took her to a clinic which is near our house only. A female doctor checked her and said that my wife would need to be admitted,” said the husband in his police complaint. Kamlesh, who works at a private company, said that the family waited outside the clinic the whole night as there were some complications during the delivery. When no one came out the next morning also, the family became worried. “When we didn’t get any information for a long time, we decided to go inside. The doctor was missing and my wife was lying dead,” he said.Following this, he immediately approached the police, and a team was rushed to the spot. According to police officials, prima facie it seems that the woman died of complications during the delivery and the baby got stuck and died along with her. Their bodies were handed over to the family after autopsy, the police said.Based on the complaint, a case was registered against the fake doctor under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code.

Transport department officials said that the number of accidents has sharply decreased from March to September this year due to the Covid-induced lockdown and other restrictions. According to the data from the district transport department, between March 1 and September 15 this year, the GB Nagar district saw over 50% decline in the road accidents as compared to that of the corresponding period last year. The district witnessed 317 mishaps during the period this year as against 653 last year, the data shows.The fatalities due to road accidents also went down this year, with the district recording 162 deaths during the period, while 278 deaths were reported during the same period last year. Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement), GB Nagar, said that due to lockdown, the number of accidents has sharply decreased this year. Meanwhile, to bring down accidents in the district, the GB Nagar transport department is observing road safety week from October 5 to 11. During the week, several awareness activities have been planned to ensure safety of commuters, officials said. Tiwari said that as per the state government’s directions, four road safety weeks are mandatory annually in the district. “We had held the first programme in June as it was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. We are organising the second road safety week from October 5 to 11. In this week, the transport department has planned a number of awareness activities aimed at bringing down road accidents and fatalities,” he said. On Monday, the transport department held online meetings with vehicle dealers, transporters and toll plaza operators, and sensitized them over road safety rules and the Motor Vehicle Act. “We informed the transporters to properly sanitize their buses and cars before engaging them for duty. The drivers and conductors were told to wear masks and also ask commuters to wear masks. They were told to adhere to Covid-19 protocols and not allow passengers in the vehicles beyond permissible limits,” the transport official said.

As part of the plan, he allegedly rented a room in a Noida hotel from where he rehearsed the plot and even made the ransom calls.Akash Singh and his mother work at a private factory in Noida. On Monday, Singh allegedly left his home at around 8am telling his mother that his friend had called him and that he would be back soon. “I kept waiting for him but he did not return till late evening and even searched for him, but could not find him. At around 11pm (on Monday) we received a call from unknown person who told my son was with him and demanded ₹2 lakh in ransom. He threatened to kill my son if I revealed the information to anyone,” Kiran Singh, Akash’s mother, said in her police complaint. “The caller also made us hear Akash’s voice over the phone and he was crying.”Akash’s parents, however, went to the police and registered the complaint under Indian penal code (IPC) sections 364a (kidnapping for ransom) and 506 (criminal intimidation) against the unidentified person. After the police initiated investigation, the caller had used the same mobile number and made four calls to the family till Tuesday afternoon. With electronic surveillance, police zeroed in on to the hotel in Noida sector-22 and busted the plot. According to police, Aakash, who had studied up to class 8, along with his friends, Ankit Kumar and Karan Kumar (allbetween 20 and 25), had planned his own kidnapping. “The prime suspect had been putting pressure on his family for a car. Ht got a bike that belonged to his elder brother, but he was not satisfied and planned the plot,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram). “From the hotel room, they had rehearsed how to mask their voice while making the ransom calls, the language to use and how to convince the family to pay up.” Both Akash and Ankit were arrested by police and added IPC section 120b (criminal conspiracy) to the ongoing investigation. The cops said that the third suspect is absconding and will be arrested soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/20-year-old-man-fakes-his-kidnapping-to-raise-2-lakh-for-car-from-parents/story-at0t2K4gBact8sR0yeAR4I.html

Unlike previous years when the force used to have a flypast of different jets with their own squadron, this time it was a mixed display of frontline fighter aircraft, including the newly inducted Rafale jets. “There was a change in the flypast to make it more interesting and to better showcase the new assets and also to show how the IAF has progressed over the years,” said an IAF officer. “This time, it was mixed, with the theme of ‘innovate, integrate and intimidate’. Since we are talking about innovation and integration, all different types of aircraft were there and working in synergy. This is the capability which few air forces in the world have.”The French made Rafale was inducted on September 10, at a time when India was facing off at the Ladakh border with China. The initial batch of five aircraft were inducted into IAF’s Ambala-based number 17 squadron, which is also known as ‘Golden Arrows.’ One of the Rafale jets was also lined up at the Hindon airbase airfield along with other frontline aircraft like Sukhoi-30 MKI, Light Combat Aircraft – Tejas, Mirage-2000, Mig-29 and Jaguar among others. The first part of the rehearsal began with IAF paratroopers jumping down with colourful parachutes, the scintillating parade by the air warriors, and flypast by vintage and transport aircraft. Apart from the frontline fighter jets, IAF’s helicopter fleet having Mi17-V5 choppers, Dhruv - advanced light helicopters, Chinook - heavy lift choppers, Mi-35 and Apache attack helicopters also made their mark during the flypast. The flypast also saw participation by heavy lift C-17 Globemasters, Dornier and Dakota aircraft. It concluded with flying display by Suryakiran aerobatic team and helicopters of the Sarang aerobatic team. The spectators at the ground were left enthralled as Rafale, Tejas and Sukhio-30 MKI jets made low-flying breath-taking manoeuvres and deployed flares to attract their attention. “We came here to witness the Rafale which is highly advanced and people were waiting it to get inducted to the IAF. I clicked selfies and pictures with friends by the side of the Rafale jet displayed at the Hindon airbase ground. The Rafale was indeed a major attraction for spectators present on the occasion and everyone wanted to have a picture with it,” said Vijay Kumar, a college student who stays at Rajendra Nagar. The IAF also released a promo video and said that it was ready to ‘Innovate, Integrate and Intimidate.’ “As we enter our 89th year, I would like to complement all air warriors for a job well done in what has turned out to be an extremely challenging year. The IAF is in midst of transformation and we are changing the way we fight, train and maintain. Our intense focus on integration, both within the service and with our sister services, needs to continue,” the Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, said in his video message. The flying display on Tuesday included Rafale flying along with Sukhoi-30 MKIs and also in formation with other frontline aircraft which took off from their respective airbases to reach above the Hindon airbase on Tuesday morning. The rifle drill sequence which is liked by all, however, was not part of the full dress rehearsal this time. “Since the flying display this time was much more elaborate and given the timeframe, the rifle drill was not there this time,” said an IAF officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/full-dress-rehearsal-at-hindon-airbase-newly-inducted-rafale-fly-alongside-front-line-fighter-jets/story-iyvFncvY9x5HvxakCWLfIK.html

The Swift car itself climbed up a pavement after hitting the bikerss. The car driver has been booked for attempt to commit culpable homicide but is yet to be arrested. “We have details of the suspect and are out to find and arrest him,” said a senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified. The crime happened around 12.30 am on Monday when Juber, 23, and his friend, 22-year-old Siraj, were out to have soft drinks at a shop in Dilshad Garden. Juber, who runs a milk shake shop and was riding his Royal Enfield motorcycle, told the police that he and his friend were having soft drinks at a shop when a Swift car taking a turn on the road hit the front tyre of his motorcycle. “The two men hopped on to their motorcycle and chased the car before bringing it to a halt. An argument ensued between them, but other people intervened and separated them,” said the police officer. While the two men began to return to the shop where it had all begun, the Swift car driver allegedly decided to chase them. “We heard continuous honking from behind. We ignored it, but the car hit our motorcycle very hard from behind. Both of us were thrown off the motorcycle. The car climbed a pavement and ended up with a broken bumper,” Juber told the police. When the car driver got off his vehicle to check his broken bumper, Juber said he saw that it was the same man with who they had an argument minutes earlier. “People gathered at the spot and the driver took advantage of the situation to slip away with his car,” Juber told the police. The car’s registration number plate had fallen at the spot, with the help of which the police identified the suspect. The police didn’t reveal his identity, pending his arrest. The two injured men were rushed to a local hospital from where they were referred to Safdarjung Hospital. “They have suffered multiple injuries and are receiving treatment,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/road-rage-man-rams-car-into-bike-after-argument-in-delhi-s-dilshad-garden/story-w8GB8Spm0pLG3f2rmXxaqN.html

During the visit, Sinha took a round of different medical units and enquired about the availability of necessary equipment and other facilities required for patient care. He directed the concerned officers to rationalise the resources and resolve the prevalent issues. He also said that ‘senior doctors should attend to Covid patients’. He also conducted a meeting with senior officers and was informed that the requisite supply of oxygen was restored, and there was no shortage of oxygen at present. During the visit, Sinha was accompanied by chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam; financial commissioner health Atal Dulloo; principal secretary to L-G Nitishwar Kumar; divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma; IGP Jammu Mukesh Singh; GMC&H principal Dr Nasib Chand Digra; administrator associated hospitals Nagendra Singh Jamwal, and other senior officers. Amid a spike in Covid deaths in Jammu, a three-member team of experts from the union health ministry visited the GMC&H on September 19 to ascertain the triggers and suggest corrective measures reverse the trend. The patient care had been severely hit at the hospital, which had become a battlefield for senior doctors and the incumbent principal Dr Nasib Chand Digra. Peeved over indiscipline and chaos, Dr Digra had recently written a two-page letter to Sinha opting for a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) because of the interference in working of the hospital by ‘extra-institutional officials’.

While Murshidabad district registered 51 incidents of rape, highest among all districts, the maximum number of kidnappings took place in East Midnapore district.

It resumed daily operations from Saturday taking tourists to Kongdori Mountain at a height of 8,530-ft. “We had decided to operate the Gondola on weekends but then the government decided to reopen the first phase everyday from Saturday,” said assistant manager of the Gulmarg Gondola Project, Fayaz Ahmad.He added that tourists from J&K and other states have started coming in scores. “On an average, around 50 people are riding the ropeway every day. During weekend, the number is at around 150. Around 30% of these visitors are from other states,” he said.The Gondola was closed after government imposed lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 in mid-March. On normal days, the cable car records a daily footfall of 2,000 to 3,000 people, generating a daily revenue of Rs 35-40 lakh. Each ticket costs Rs 740 per person for the first phase and Rs 950 for the second phase which takes the visitor to a height of 12,293-ft.Proper Covid protocol including social distancing and wearing masks is in force. Instead of six in normal days, only three tourists are being allowed to ride in each Gondola car. The cabins are being sanitised before and after boarding and de-boarding of passengers, respectively.The tourism sector nosedived in Kashmir since August 5, 2019 when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked, restrictions were imposed on movement of people, and communication was shut for months.Two days before revocation of Article 370, around 20,000 to 25,000 tourists were present in Kashmir. All of them were asked to leave the Valley along with the Amarnath pilgrims. The situation then aggravated due to the Covid-induced lockdown.Ahmad said that the Gondola project was facing a slump since August 5, 2019, and then Covid caused a complete shut down.He said that they are hoping that the number of tourists will increase in the coming days. “Gulmarg and Gondola have become synonymous and people have resumed visiting here despite Covid. Winter is approaching and travel agents have told us that bookings are being made for October-end,” he said.The tourism department has also started campaigns to woo tourists. “Tourism is reopened in Kashmir and gradually moving towards a revival,” said tourism director Nisar Ahmad Wani, during a nature walk at Dachigam National Park on Monday.“The directorate has started publicity campaigns, primarily focused on communicating a message that tourists can come here hassle-free as all Covid related SOPs are in place. The visitors can enjoy hospitality and experience nature in all its beautiful shades and manifestations,” he added.Gulmarg (the meadow of flowers), which is located in the Pir Panjal mountain range in the western Himalayas some 50km from Srinagar, is defined as a cup-shaped valley with virgin peaks, dry curry powder snow and meadows.“Our vast green meadows, enchanting valleys, majestic mountains and pristine streams and lakes are what bring joy to the visitors and fills them with awe,” the tourism director added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gulmarg-gondola-reopens-after-six-months/story-UyQZkjul9EdTL9Glqk5YcI.html

The project is to be implemented in 428 panchayats in 10 districts of the state, benefiting over 4 lakh stakeholders.One of the conditions of the agreement was that the tenure of the key staff of the project should be three years or more. However, the state government transferred the chief project director and the executive officer of the project within six months of signing the agreement.“Reference is made to the government orders to transfer both the chief project director (No FFE A(B)6-14/2020-II, dated September 5, 2020) and executive director (No FFE-A(B)6-14/2020-II, dated September 8, 2020) of the integrated project for source sustainability and climate-resilient rain-fed agriculture in HP and to the letter from the additional chief secretary (forests) of the HP government to the department of economic affairs (No FFE-B-F (5)9/2016-Pt-II, dated December 13, 2019) confirming the project’s readiness for negotiations,” reads the letter from Junaid Kamal Ahmad, World Bank’s country director in India, to state chief secretary Anil Khachi.“We note that in the referenced letter, the HP government agreed with the department of economic affairs as part of the readiness criteria of the project, that the ‘tenure of key staff should be, to the extent possible, three years or more’,” states the letter.“We also note that the project is not yet fully operational and is in a critical start-up phase. As such, we are concerned that changes in project leadership at this time may have a considerable adverse impact on the pace and efficiency of project implementation. Given the above, we would like to request that you honor the aforementioned agreement,” it added.When contacted, forest minister Rakesh Pathania said that the condition was not a must and, that the ‘government was forced to change the officers as there had been no progress in the project.’He said that any project is implemented with the consultation of public representatives and public participation but no such steps were taken by those at the helm of the affairs.“I can’t overlook and would not tolerate non-performance in my departments,” he said, adding that the World Bank will be apprised of the circumstances in which the officers were changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/world-bank-asks-hp-govt-to-honour-idp-agreement/story-Tix8rEqaxtR0tKFkjMQSiP.html

While it is disheartening to the regular audience, they hope that it will return to the place where it belongs with time.Brig Naveen Mahajan, station commander of army and the ex-officio president of the Cantonment Board, is said to have offered the co-directors of the festival, Rahul Singh and Niloufer Bilimoria, that the festival could be hosted in Kasauli this year too with appropriate social distancing.“It was most generous of the Commander to make this offer but we thought that in times such as these we would not like to take the virus to the Kasauli hills,” Rahul said.Talking about the three-day streaming of the festival, from October 9 to 11, Niloufer says: “In putting together the first digital edition of the festival, we decided to call it ‘A New Life’. The pandemic times offer us to mull over the sense of where we can go from here, so that we do not just go back to the normal.”The festival has been packaged with thought to shun callous approach to nature and ecology that have caused the pandemic and move towards a green society and green economy.The festival will open with engineer Sudha Murty’s talk on ‘The art of science and giving’ with writer Chetan Bahagat as the interlocutor. Other sessions include Pico Iyer speaking on ‘Staying at home and re-making the world’, Harsh Mander on the plight of migrants in ‘Locking down the poor’, Farid Zakaria will dwell on the 10 lessons to be learnt from the pandemic, Jono Linen on ‘Walking alone in the Himalayas’, Amitav Ghosh on ‘An Uninhibtable Earth’, and Shobha De on ‘Lockdown Des and Nites’.Motorist Kishie Singh, who has been on the organising team of the festival from its first edition, says, “We will miss the festivity but caution is better than bravado and with time, the festival will return to the hill town which was the home for Khushwant Singh’s writings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/we-did-not-wish-to-bring-the-virus-to-kasauli-hills/story-eXwbTg97vDdABEcXBaR04O.html
06-10-2020||Pune||Therapy centres in lockdown cause complications for patients in Pune||Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected all spheres of life, including healthcare for people with medical conditions. Occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, psychological counselling and behaviour management, among other methods, are necessary for those diagnosed with cerebral palsy to enhance their lifestyles. However, with the lockdown necessitated due to the pandemic, therapy centres have been closed and many children with cerebral palsy are needing immediate surgeries due to the deteriorating lifestyle, say experts. Shreesh Kulkarni, 15, had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was one-and-a-half years old. “He has been taking occupational therapy, physiotherapy since many years. “Therapy for him is as important as breathing,” says his mother Shreya Kulkarni. Due to the lockdown their visits to the centres are now restricted and hence, they have now opted for recreational therapy at home and have limited their visit to the doctors. “It has been around six months since our last visit to the therapy centre. It has been two weeks since my child started visiting a physiotherapist. It was a challenge for us to keep him active by using therapy techniques at home. We also had to ensure that he does not gain weight. It was not only us, but many parents found it a challenge to keep our children active through different activities and exercises. If we do not keep our children mobile, there are chances of complications,” added Shreya.Experts believe that they are now recording many such cases where urgent surgeries are required to avoid any further complications which were earlier under control due to therapy. Parents, too, have opined that the lockdown has hit them hard as they have not been able to take care of the kids who need special care. Therapy centres provided routine care ensuring that complications are prevented and surgeries are avoided. “For a child with cerebral palsy (CP), parents are always the primary caregiver. When therapy centres were closed, the parents have performed the role of the therapist. Because of the lack of routine care, we are seeing complications in CP children. Parents should learn some basic techniques that allow the muscle to stay elongated, that allow for strength maintenance. Parents should now avail video consultations so that they can learn these techniques,” said Dr Saloni Raje, a paediatric neurodevelopmental therapist at a private hospital However, not all parents could find such a solution for their children and had to face serious consequences. Before the lockdown, five-year-old Aayush Agashe (name changed), could walk on his feet slowly. Doctors were hopeful of his recovery with stretching therapy, Botox injection, and plastering of his feet. But during the lockdown, there was no therapy, and injection was not given. Instead, his increased height during these six months which led to stiffening of the muscle. Now, it is not injection or therapy that is of any use to him and he has to undergo surgery.Dr Sandeep Patwardhan, a paediatric orthopedic specialist at the Sancheti Institute of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, said, “We are soon planning for Aayush’s surgery. It is not just him, but there are many CP kids whose surgeries could have been avoided or complications prevented if they were able to get uninterrupted access to therapy centres. But with therapy centres remaining shut during the lockdown, we have started seeing many cases with severe complications.”World Cerebral Palsy Day is marked on October 6 every year to create more awareness it. The American Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) describes cerebral palsy (CP) as a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. Dr Patwardhan adds, “CP is a lifelong disease. The main treatment for CP is going to be muscle strengthening, loosening of the tight muscle, wearing graces, and making sure that the child does activities. Otherwise, the child may end up with deformities, and then they may require surgery. Because of the lack of access to therapy centres, this continuous treatment has stopped. We need to make sure that CP kids get access to therapy centres. At least some assessment should be done at these centres regularly. Things like video consultation should be used. In chronic illnesses like CP, if left untreated, the complication rate is going up. The need for intervention and surgery will be very high in a few days if people do not visit therapy centres or experts.”Therapists, who provide routine care at these centres are also seeing a rise in complications. Dr Sourabh Sane, physiotherapist at HealYos Physiotherapy, said, “In a seven-year-old kid, the hip joint had moved from its place. Doctors had planned to plaster it. But, there was no therapy given in all these months during the lockdown. Now, the hip has been dislocated and the kid will have to undergo a major operation to fix it. We are seeing many such cases where complications have emerged because of lack of routine care which had been provided by therapy centres. We are seeing cases where tightness of muscle has increased. Though patients have started returning now, it is still difficult for CP children from semi-urban or rural areas to approach such centres.” Though these therapy centres are reopening, many parents still do not feel safe while taking kids to these centres due to the fear of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/therapy-centres-in-lockdown-cause-complications-for-patients/story-nIBdZt5nvU7uMozx9Tpu7L.html
06-10-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: PEB to conduct recruitment tests after CM announces NRA-linked process||Madhya Pradesh government has reposed its faith in Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB), commonly known by its Hindi acronym Vyapam, within days of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announcing that recruitment for 30,000 vacant government jobs would take place through the common entrance test (CET) of National Recruitment Agency (NRA), officials said. MP government’s general administration department (GAD) wrote to all government departments last week, informing them that only MPPEB is authorised to conduct the recruitment tests for non-gazetted posts. MPPEB has also started preparations and invited several IT companies to set up, operate and maintain online test and training centres at government educational institutions in all 52 districts of the state, and issued a schedule on Monday for the recruitment tests of two departments—farmer welfare and school education in January and February 2021, an MPPEB official said, requesting anonymity. Also Read: National Recruitment Agency’s common entrance test to help 2.5 crore job seekers: Jitendra SinghMPPEB public relations officer JP Gupta said, “The board has released a new schedule on Monday to fill posts in different departments including schools, jails and farmers welfare department. We are just following the instructions of the government. We don’t know about any decision related to the NRA test-based recruitment.” After the Union cabinet approved the setting up of NRA to conduct a CET for selecting candidates for a majority of central government jobs, Chouhan tweeted on August 20 that Madhya Pradesh was the first state in the country to decide to give government jobs to the youth of the state on the basis of their NRA score. “Now you (aspirants) will not have to incur expenditure on travelling due to repeated examinations. My children! my priority is to make your life better,” he said. मध्यप्रदेश की शासकीय नौकरियों पर केवल प्रदेश के युवाओं का हक होगा, यह हमने पहले ही तय कर दिया है। अब आपको बार-बार की परीक्षाओं के कारण होने वाले निरर्थक व्यय और आवागमन से भी मुक्ति मिल जायेगी। मेरे बच्चों तुम्हारा जीवन आनंददायी और बेहतर बने, यही मेरी प्राथमिकता है।GAD secretary Rajesh Kaul, in a letter to all heads of the departments and collectors, said, “PEB has been authorised to fill all the posts under non-gazetted service recruitment rules 2013.” Kaul wrote, “All the departments have already been intimated about it. But... the departments are conducting recruitments on their own, which is against the rules. Now, all the departments and district administration have to follow this rule.” GAD minister Inder Singh Parmar said, ”It’s true that the CM made announcement about switching to NRA but we can’t wait and solely depend upon a central agency to fill all the posts. So, we have authorised PEB to conduct the recruitment tests.” “At least for now, PEB will conduct the test as we have promised to fill all the posts by the end of this financial year,” said Parmar. Earlier, the then Congress –led state government had decided to close down MPPEB due to the multi-layer rigging of recruitment and entrance exam, the Vyapam scam, busted in 2013, which led to the arrest of certain officers in key positions in the organisation. Then chief minister Kamal Nath had announced the introduction of Rajya Karamchari Ayog after closing Vyapam, but nothing happened in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-peb-to-conduct-recruitment-tests-after-cm-announces-nra-linked-process/story-2l3mFvpKL6NvdvXZADor6K.html

The 90-year-old author still writes for eight hours a day and is all set to release his fourth book next year. The soon to be nonagenarian is currently working on his next book, likely to be named ‘Writer of Obituaries’. Speaking on his upcoming book, Kanwar said, “We always see obituaries in newspapers and other platforms now after someone dies, but people barely know what an obituary is or the history behind it. I plan to put together these minute details in my next book and have been researching about it since almost six months now.” Working six days a week for eight hours every day, Kanwar says that the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 epidemic was a bliss for him. Also read: ‘Nitish Kumar is the leader’ - BJP’s harsh rebuttal to Chirag Paswan claim“The lockdown was a blessing for me as I could focus more on my writing and researching for my new book. Earlier, many people would visit me for some or the other work and a lot of my time would go in those activities as I cannot say no to people. But after the epidemic, fewer people visit me, that too only during emergencies, and I utilise all my time writing or with my family,” he said. “I have learnt so many new words, idioms, worked upon my vocabulary a lot in these past few months,” said Kanwar. However, due to age, Kanwar is not able to write himself, rather mostly dictates to his secretary who writes for him. Kanwar’s last book, ‘Dateline Dehradun, which was self-published in January this year, will also see its third revised edition by the end of this year. “After around 1,300 copies of the first two editions of ‘Dateline Dehradun’ - a collection of all the articles I wrote about my town, its schools, its culture - were sold, I decided to change it a bit and make some additions. So, I started interviewing iconic couples from Dehradun who have added value to this city. This will be added in the revised third edition under a section called, ‘Made for Each-Other’,” said the author. Kanwar who would celebrate his 90th birthday on October 8 said, “I might be 90 by age, but by heart, I am still very young and in my 20s. After 57 years of marriage, having experienced the bliss of togetherness, I still joke around with my wife. I do not want to have any grand celebrations, rather help out the needy and give back to the society as much as I can.” The author has written three books so far. His first book was ‘Upstream India’ - the official history of the ONGC published in 2006 to synchronize with its golden jubilee celebrations. Next came ‘ONGC: The Untold Story’ which was published by Bloomsbury and launched in December 2018.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank, Social Development for Communities said, “Kanwar sir, is an encyclopaedia and an institute on Dehradun in himself. He has seen the Doon Valley evolve over the years since Independence. He worked as a journalist when there were hardly 3-4 journalists in the whole of the valley, so he knows the city like the back of his palm. The same can be seen in his writings through his memories of Dehradun.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/90-and-going-strong-author-raj-kanwar-from-dehradun-all-set-to-release-his-4th-book/story-YkklLfg511UEbfWVWKEIoL.html

On the other hand, China is at our borders and our security forces are braving harsh cold to protect our borders,” Gandhi said, according to ANI.When questioned by the media over BJP’s remarks over Rahul Gandhi sitting on a cushion while sitting atop the tractor during the ongoing protests against the farm bill the Congress leader said that the brand new aircraft that has been bought for the prime minister had many comfortable luxury beds onboard.

06-10-2020||Pune||63-year-old realtor shot dead near police station in Pune||A real estate developer was shot dead by unidentified assailant near Bund garden police station in Pune on Monday afternoon. Hours after the incident, probe officials brought in two people for questioning though no arrests were made till the time going to press. The deceased has been identified as Rajesh Kanabar (63), a partner and co-founder of Ambiience Group, a real estate development company. Kanabar had left the collector’s office after his visit there and headed towards his car which was parked in the parking area of nearby State Bank of India (main branch) as there was a protest happening near the Collector’s office building, according to the police. The incident happened at 2:43pm at a spot which is barely 500-600 metre away from the Bund garden police station and in close proximity of the Pune police commissioner’s office too. Kanabar had come to the collector’s office for a hearing about a land dispute. While he was making his way towards his car, he stopped to buy fruits from a nearby vendor and turned around to enter his car when a pedestrian ran towards him, shot him, and fled the spot, police officials said. “He was fighting a long-standing land dispute which was being fought bitterly. The dispute is about a 10 acre land in Bavdhan. Prima facie it appears to be related to the land dispute,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, Pune. Kanabar, according to police, was shot down from a close range. The shooter fired multiple bullets of which at least one hit his chest. “The assailant shot him and headed towards the road that connects to the commissioner’s office on foot. That is as far as we can say right now,” said additional commissioner Sanjay Shinde. Kanabar’s driver, who was in the car and witnessed the shooting, collected him and rushed him to Jehangir hospital where he was declared dead, according to the police. His body was further sent to Sassoon General Hospital for post-mortem. “We are collecting the details of the land dispute from the collector’s office. His driver’s complaint is being recorded and after studying the complaint, a case will be registered,” said DCP Gore. Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta also visited the police station and took stock of the situation along with additional commissioners Ashok Morale and Sanjay Shinde, deputy commissioner of police Swapna Gore, and assistant commissioner of police Chandrakant Sangale. A case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code along with Arms Act is being registered at Bund garden police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/realtor-shot-dead-near-bund-garden-police-station-in-pune/story-2ygwDYezqbcTn9KImlJiHI.html
06-10-2020||Delhi||Stubble burning: Bio-decomposer spraying from October 11 in Delhi, says CM Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Delhi government will start spraying “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution from October 11 to prevent stubble burning in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital.Scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, PUSA, have found a low-cost, simple and effective way to deal with the problem of stubble burning, he said.“They have developed ‘bio-decomposer’ capsules, which are used to prepare a liquid formulation. The solution, when sprayed in the fields, can decompose crop residue and turn it into manure,” Kejriwal said after inspecting his government’s centralised bio-decomposer system set up in Kharkhari Nahar village in southwest Delhi.The solution increases soil fertility and reduces the use of fertilisers, he said.This year, the Delhi government is going to use the solution on the land where non-basmati rice is grown.“We have estimated that only Rs 20 lakh is needed to manage stubble in 800 hectares of agricultural land in Delhi through this solution. It includes the cost of preparation, transportation and spraying,” he said.Farmers have to just give their consent and the Delhi government will spray the solution in their fields free of cost, he said.It takes seven days to prepare the solution, which has jaggery and chickpea flour as ingredients. The spraying will begin on October 11, the chief minister said.If this proves to be successful in Delhi, it can be a good solution for the issue of stubble burning in the neighbouring states too, he said.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said, “We want to create a model in Delhi so that no government can make an excuse (on the issue of stubble burning).” “When there is an alternative available … all those who seriously want to reduce pollution should use this,” he said.The solution being prepared at Kharkhari Nahar will be enough for around 1,300 farmers in Delhi, Rai said.The minister said farm fires in neighbouring states contribute up to 44 per cent of Delhi’s pollution during the harvesting season.Asked if the method will be implemented in other states as well, Rai said it depended on their will to do it.“We have already appealed to them to implement it. If we can set up a centralised system for it in Delhi, they can do it too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/stubble-burning-bio-decomposer-spraying-from-october-11-in-delhi-says-cm-kejriwal/story-TCBeef5EY7tdVRs3UG0qOJ.html
06-10-2020||Chandigarh||Prime Minister Modi gave away land to China to salvage his image, says Rahul Gandhi||Keeping up his tirade against Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused the Prime Minister of being obsessed with his image for which he ignores important issues concerning India. Addressing a press conference in Patiala on the concluding day of his Kheti Bachao Yatra in Punjab in support of the farmers protesting the recent farm laws, Gandhi said, “Modi is not interested in India’s people. He is only concerned about protecting and promoting his image. China has taken over 1,200 square kilometres of Indian territory but Modi didn’t acknowledge it as it would have dented his image.” He said the media is also to blame for helping Modi promote his image. “Why don’t you question him at press conferences?” Gandhi asked the media. Rejecting the suggestion that the Modi-led government is able to take unilateral decisions because of a weak Opposition, Gandhi said: “Give me a free press and other key institutions and this (Narendra Modi) government will not last long.” “In India, that entire framework has been controlled and captured by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, the entire architecture designed for giving voice to the people has been captured,” he said. He claimed that the BJP government has captured “the soul of the country”, which is what the Congress is fighting against. “This fight will become more aggressive, going forward. The whole country is being thrashed. It’s not a big deal if they pushed me. I’ll take lathis, but I’ll keep fighting for the people,” he said on the police action while he was on the way to meet the Hathras gangrape victim’s family. “The government may have captured the institutions but it can’t control farmers, youth and small traders, whose interests it is destroying. I work among these people, who are the hardest hit by Modi’s policies. I am patient, and will wait till the people of India see the truth,” he said. “I will fight and stop them,” he declared, pointing out that if the minimum support price (MSP) goes, Punjab, Haryana, and other agricultural states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan will have no future left. Gandhi claimed that the new farm laws will destroy MSP and the public distribution system (PDS) for the poor. “The danger is real and can’t be negated just because Modi & Co are making fun of me,” he said. ‘FOOD SECURITY SYSTEM NEEDS REFORMS’ Calling the existing food security system a fortress for farmers, Gandhi said that it needed reforms, which is what the Congress manifesto had promised. In response to a question on the BJP leadership making fun of his protests in Punjab and Haryana, he shrugged it off, saying they had done that in February too when he had first warned about Covid-19. “The truth is there for all to see. Six months on, everyone will know the truth of what he is saying on farm laws, too.” Taking a dig at Modi’s statement in March-end that India aims to win the war against Covid-19 in 21 days, the Congress leader said, “You can see for yourself who talks more sense Modi or me. You (media) can decide who is joking.” In reply to the BJP’s claims that the farm laws just like demonetisation and the goods and services tax (GST) were achievements of the Modi government, Rahul said: “If the farm laws are an achievement, why are farmers not celebrating, why are they not letting off firecrackers with joy?” “If Modi was so sure that these laws were beneficial to farmers, why didn’t he face a debate in Parliament? Why did he push the laws during Covid times when farmers can’t come out on the roads? Why didn’t he hold a press conference or come and meet farmers in Punjab?” Gandhi added. Asked why he was not present in Parliament during voting on the farm bills, he said he was a son too. His mother (Sonia Gandhi) had to go for a medical check-up and since his sister could not for family reasons, it was his responsibility to do so, he said. ‘WHY IS PM SILENT ON HATHRAS?’ Gandhi accused Modi of not speaking out after the alleged gangrape of the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district in September. He said he visited the victim’s family last week because he wanted them to know that they were not alone in seeking justice for their daughter. He said he told the woman’s family that he was not only there for them and their daughter but also for “lakhs of women in the country who face unruly behaviour every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/prime-minister-modi-gave-away-land-to-china-to-salvage-his-image-says-rahul-gandhi/story-N5eakhrbOPUuOhpFZCyVVJ.html

06-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality likely to worsen due to spike in farm fires: Report||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “moderate” category on Tuesday morning, but it is likely to worsen in the coming days due to a spike in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions. The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the city’s air quality index (AQI) will remain in the “moderate” category on Wednesday and Thursday and will start deteriorating thereafter. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 177 at 10.30 am which falls in the “moderate” category. On Monday, the 24-hour average AQI was 179. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. “A sharp increase in stubble burning was observed around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions. Boundary layer wind direction is favorable for transport (of pollutants). It will start impacting Delhi in the coming days,” the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said. Also, there is a marked dip in minimum temperatures recorded in Delhi. On Tuesday, it settled at 18.2 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-likely-to-worsen-due-to-spike-in-farm-fires-report/story-8w3c7GF58btmadpzlZCTzH.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Maharashtra orders probe into ‘conspiracy to defame state’||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday announced an investigation into “the conspiracy to defame Mumbai and Maharashtra police” over actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death while blaming opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for it. He asked the BJP and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to apologise for defaming them.Deshmukh said Mumbai police’s crime branch and cyber-crime branch of the Maharashtra police will conduct the probe.Also read: Rhea Chakraborty, brother Showik’s judicial custody in drugs case extended till Oct 20HT on Tuesday reported the Mumbai’s police’s cyber unit has submitted a report to commissioner Param Bir Singh saying at least 80,000 fake social media accounts were created across nine countries as part of an “orchestrated campaign” to discredit the force and Maharashtra government over the investigation into the death.Singh said the campaign was run against Mumbai Police to demoralise them.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Mumbai home on June 14, setting off speculation about the cause of his death. Mumbai Police called several members of the film industry for questioning before the actor’s family filed a police complaint in Bihar alleging a conspiracy behind the death and blamed his friend, actor Rhea Chakraborty, for it.The Central Bureau of Investigation, the Enforcement Directorate, and the Narcotics Control Bureau are probing the case.A medical team from New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has ruled out the possibility of Rajput’s murder.Deshmukh cited a Michigan State University report on social media campaign over Rajput’s death and said it found BJP hatched the conspiracy to defame Mumbai and Maharashtra police. Deshmukh said the BJP used “a few people outside the state” as “puppets” to defame Maharashtra. “The study report has stated that SSR [Sushant Singh Rajput] case study reveals the BJP’s hand in hatching the conspiracy theory in the case.”Deshmukh said a few TV channels were at the forefront of this conspiracy. “Cyber crime cell of the Maharashtra police will investigate the fake accounts created as part of the conspiracy.”He cited the view of the AIIMS team and said it has endorsed their stand that no poisoning was involved in the death. “The Supreme Court... applauded Mumbai police’s investigation. A few BJP leaders targeted the Mumbai police for the political gain in the Bihar elections. They even crossed the limit and called the Mumbai police mafia.” He said Fadnavis also targeted the Mumbai police, doubting their competence.BJP rubbished Deshmukh’s charges. “We strongly condemn political and false allegations... The BJP or Devendra Fadnavis will never indulge in any illegal activity. Deshmukh is the most irresponsible home minister Maharashtra has had so far. He should conduct the probe. We are not against it,” said BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-maharashtra-orders-probe-into-conspiracy-to-defame-state/story-iTTMO0I1bORaShvpqTBrKI.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Sisters petition to quash FIR against them adjourned to October 13||The Bombay high court on Tuesday posted the petition filed by Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, the sisters of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, for quashing of the first information report (FIR) registered against them by Bandra police, for further hearing on October 13.The bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik adjourned the hearing as no one appeared for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the counsel for Rhea Chakraborty, the actor on whose complaint the FIR was registered on September 7, 2020, sought time to respond to the petition.In her complaint, Chakraborty has accused Priyanka Singh and one Dr Tarun Kumar of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi of prescribing medicines for Rajput which were prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput death: Sisters move Bombay high court to quash FIR based on Rhea Chakraborty’s complaintThe 28-year-old actor alleged that the doctor prescribed a banned medicine, Clonazepam, to Rajput, which might have resulted in chronic anxiety and ultimately led Rajput to kill himself. She has blamed Priyanka Singh and other members of Rajput’s family for his untimely death.In the petition filed through advocate Madhav Thorat, Rajput’s sisters, however, claimed that the medicine was not banned and the guidelines issued by the Medical Council of India on April 11, 2020 for telemedicine “allows the medicine to be prescribed to a patient even at the first consultation.”“A bare perusal of the complaint along with the FIR shows that the statements made therein do not make out any cognisable offence,” states the petition. It adds that the lodging of Chakraborty’s complaint was nothing but a feeble attempt on her part to scuttle the investigation against herself and blame Rajput’s family members for his suicide, as she was on the verge of being arrested by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput death: Mumbai Police registers two FIRs against trolls who tried to discredit the forceIt adds that no criminality could be attributed to the petitioners, especially when the complaint was solely based on medicines prescribed by a doctor. In support of their contention, they relied on a 2005 Supreme Court judgment in Jacob Matthew’s case, in which the apex court held that no offence against a medical practitioner can be investigated without first obtaining the opinion of experts in medical field.The petition also highlighted that there was an inordinate delay of 90 days in lodging the police complaint—the medicines were prescribed on June 8, 2020, the day Rajput asked Chakraborty to leave his house, and the complaint was lodged on September 7, 2020.A day after the FIR was registered, NCB arrested Chakraborty after interrogating her for three consecutive days in connection with the drug trail that came to the fore following Rajput’s death.Meanwhile, Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde issued a statement which read: “It is disturbing to learn that the family of SSR and its lawyers are interfering and tampering with the investigations by bringing pressure on the AIIMS team of doctors by speaking to them during investigations and releasing purported audio recoded conversations and information to the media in order to bring pressure and tamper with potential witnesses. The SSR family lawyer is supposed to have said that he is going to meet the CBI director to get the family’s pre-determined path of investigations in SSR death. It is very disturbing to read such information in the media as attempts are being made to get a pre-determined result in the case. Any further attempts to interfere and tampering in the investigations would be brought to the notice of the appropriate courts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-sisters-petition-to-quash-fir-against-them-adjourned-to-october-13/story-gKhPfaLJDsvVSlky9bnmdJ.html
06-10-2020||Lucknow||RLD’s mahapanchayat on Thursday; may trigger farmers’ agitation in western UP||Speculation is rife that the Rashtriya Lok Dal’s (RLD) proposed mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on Thursday against the controversial farm bills may trigger farmers’ agitation in western Uttar Pradesh (UP). Besides, UP Police’s assault on RLD leader Jayant Choudhary and his supporters in Hathras district on Sunday triggered an uproar among the followers of late Prime Minister and Jat leader Charan Singh. Jayant is the grandson of Charan Singh and also the son of former Union minister Ajit Singh. RLD and Samajwadi Party (SP) workers in Hathras were assaulted by the UP Police on Sunday after they had allegedly breached barricades in their bid to reach Boolgarhi village in the district, which is in the eye of a raging political controversy. Trouble had erupted after a Dalit teenager (19) was allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men and the grievous injuries led to her death last week.The UP Police’s action against Jayant has enraged the Jat community, which is largely engaged in agriculture and also a dominant caste group in western UP. A video of the assault went viral, where Jayant can be seen interacting with media persons, when the police resorted to lathi charge and beat up RLD leaders and their supporters. However, the video clip did not show RLD supporters trying to breach police barricades to enter into Boolgarhi village. Sunday’s incident ahead of the mahapanchayat has angered the public and RLD leaders are expecting a massive turnout at the event in support of Jayant. “The party has a rural base and farmers are associated with it in large numbers. Majority of them still admire Charan Singh. The assault on Jayant has angered the public and they are expected to turn up at the mahapanchayat in large numbers to show their solidarity with Jayant and his family in a bid to send a message to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),” said Rahul Deo, Meerut district president, RLD.Rajkumar Sangwan, RLD’s organisational general secretary, said the mahapanchayat was announced to oppose the controversial farm laws and the Muzaffarnagar district administration’s decision to register cases against party leaders, who had protested against these legislations and staged a dharna last week. “UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath wants to govern the state with batons. FIRs (first information reports) are being routinely filed against opposition parties to suppress our voices of dissent,” said Sangwan. RLD workers and leaders staged a protest outside the office of the divisional commissioner in Meerut on Monday. They raised slogans and burnt an effigy of the UP CM to oppose the assault on Jayant and RLD supporters in Hathras on Sunday. “We demand arrest of the police personnel who had assaulted our leader and supporters and condemn the ‘jungle raj’ under Yogi’s rule in UP,” said Narendra Khajuri, a RLD leader. RLD leaders have been busy mobilising farmers and party supporters in villages to ensure their participation in the mahapanchayat in large numbers, said Sunil Rohta, a spokesperson of the RLD. “We have been receiving an overwhelming response from the public and expecting a good turnout at the mahapanchayat on Thursday,” said Rohta.He claimed that the event would trigger a movement against the farm bills and the “excesses of the ruling party”. Dharmendra Malik, UP spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a farmers’ organisation linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP, said farmers from western UP were against the farm laws and a movement was building up against the recent legislations. He said the BKU had called for a warning protest on October 22, where farmers would stage a protest at district and tehsil headquarters across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rld-s-mahapanchayat-on-thursday-may-trigger-farmers-agitation-in-western-up/story-y3VC8OdNt43lh9TnnvAOML.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Actress gets Y plus security, while Hathras victim’s family left at mercy of God, says Saamana||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Tuesday hit out at the Centre over the rape and murder of the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, saying her family has been left to the “mercy of God”. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena warned of a Dalit backlash if injustice against the community continues.The editorial said the woman’s family is living under fear as they are getting threats. “The Centre provides Y plus security to an actress from Mumbai but leaves the family of the Hathras victim to the mercy of God. This is not an element of equal law for all that Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar provided in the Constitution,” it said.The Centre last month granted actor Kangana Ranaut Y-plus category security, which involves deployment of around a dozen guards, amid her war of words with the Shiv Sena. The verbal duel began after Ranaut likened Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and said she feared Mumbai Police.The editorial called Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad’s demand for 50% subsidy for the Dalits to buy guns for self-protection the “first spark” of Dalit backlash. It added former Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Rajveer Singh Pahalwan held a rally in support of the Hathras accused. “All this adds to the terror in which the victim’s family is living. Besides that, it adds to the communal discord... The government should not add fuel to the fire.”The editorial said Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath government handed over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) even as the family did not seek it. It added instead the family sought a judicial probe. “Using the force of police, the voice of the victim’s family was muzzled. The dead body of the victim was burned in the night. Lathis were rained down on the political leaders who went to meet the family of the victim. When the public opinion started shifting, the Yogi government... handed over the case to CBI. Handing over the probe to CBI proves that Yogi Adityanath does not trust his police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/actress-gets-y-plus-security-while-hathras-victim-s-family-left-at-mercy-of-god-says-saamana/story-wk08TkmZjDxC1uzBt9pMuM.html
06-10-2020||Lucknow||Kanpur’s Bikru ambush was planned; women helped in carnage, says chargesheet||The July 3 ambush of a raiding police team in Bikru village of Kanpur Dehat, Uttar Pradesh, was well planned, says the 1,700-page police charge sheet. Filed by the Kanput police in Kanpur Dehat court, the charge sheet also says that information about the raid on gangster Vikas Dubey’s house was leaked by local police and women helped in the ambush, allowing the assailants to kill police personnel and escape. Eight policemen, including a deputy SP and three sub-inspectors, were killed in the ambush. The police have charged 36 persons in the case. Six of the assailants, including gangster Vikas Dubey, were killed in encounters and two others are yet to be arrested. Among the accused are also four females-- Kshama Agnihotri, Rekha Agnihotri, Shanti Dubey, and a minor. Their husbands are also accused in the case. Also read: Supreme Court rejects plea to reconstitute Vikas Dubey probe panelSP rural Brijesh Shrivastava said police have enough evidences against the accused women. They even provided bullets to the men firing at the police team from three sides, he said. “We will prove all this in the court,” he said. The police, however, did not charge Manu Pandey, whose purported audio clips talked about the role these women may have played in the ambush. Also it did not make Vikas’s elusive brother Deepu Dubey or his wife Richa accused in the case. According to police, Vikas Dubey planned the ambush after he was tipped off by local police about the raid. He instructed them that they would also have to loot police weapons. The meeting took place at his house, which the police later razed to the ground. Sub-inspector KK Sharma of the local police spoke to Dubey and his men 13 times that night. The last conversation was with one of accused, Ram Singh, at 11.44 pm — 11 minutes before the police left for the raid. Sharma spoke about the raid to Ram Singh, who passed on the information to Hiru Dubey who then shared it with Vikas Dubey. The women named in the charge sheet were part of plan, police said, including the minor who was married just three days before the ambush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kanpur-s-bikru-ambush-was-planned-women-helped-in-carnage-says-chargesheet/story-mBzjbCmDPq0CMRtk8TyGOP.html

06-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to prepare bio-decomposer for crop stubble: All you need to know||Beginning Tuesday, Delhi government is set to start preparation of a biochemical solution—a new technology that decomposes crop stubble so that it doesn’t need to be burnt. The technology could prove to be a solution for farmers who otherwise end up burning paddy stubble causing fumes that add to air pollution during winter. As per government figures, at least 800 hectares of farmland in the rural belt of Delhi is under cultivation where crop stubble burning is practised. Here are five things you need to know about the technology and what it aims to doWhat is a bio-decomposer?The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, Delhi has developed a decomposer capsule, which could be converted into a liquid solution and sprayed on fields with crop stubble. The solution, once sprayed on the fields, will decompose the stubble, which can be used by farmers to treat the fields.How and where does the Delhi government plan to prepare the biochemical solution?The liquid biochemical solution can be formulated by mixing the capsules with jaggery and several other ingredients. The mixture needs to be fermented over three or four days before it’s ready to be sprayed. The Delhi government has set up a centralised plant for large-scale production of the solution at Najafgarh’s Kharkhari Nahar village. From Tuesday, operations will begin at 400 different camps here under the supervision of IARI scientists.How much time does it take for the stubble to decompose after the chemical has been sprayed?IARI scientists said that it takes over 20 days for the stubble to decompose into compost.How can farmers use this scheme?Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had said that the chemical will be sprayed in the fields free of cost. Agricultural development officers at all districts will lead the task of filling up forms for farmers with details of their village and area under cultivation, among others. Once the forms are submitted, officials will be deployed to spray the chemical at the designated location. The district officials will also be creating awareness about the same.How much will it cost the government?From preparing the mixture to spraying it across 800 hectares of farmland, the entire process will cost the government Rs 20 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-prepare-bio-decomposer-for-crop-stubble-all-you-need-to-know/story-kec0HffMCCDz5sZ4wlOZbI.html

The port trust, which owns the island, is looking for a consultant to prepare a site management plan on the ancient remains of the island, located 20 km south of Mumbai. According to MbPT documents accessed by HT, the island has a peripheral dry stone masonry wall that has collapsed at many places. A prominent structure on the island is the 22-feet lighthouse, built by the British in 1867. The fort also has old metal cannons, the tomb of local saint Daud Pir, a temple of Sri Betal, where local fishermen from the nearby villages perform rituals, and four wells. The whole island has an area of about 16 acres. The island is named after the great Maratha navy commander Kanhoji Angre who fought and won many a battles against the Portuguese and the British. A senior planner from MbPT said, “The idea is to undertake restoration work since many parts of the fort wall have collapsed. We are also on the lookout for a firm to maintain the place once we open it as a tourist spot.” MbPT is looking at transforming the island by developing camp sites, gazebos, amphitheatre, cafeteria, pathways, food courts and light and sound shows there. It is also planning to build a resort on the island to facilitate overnight stays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-port-trust-to-prepare-conservation-plan-for-kanhoji-angre-island/story-QUgiRpNGEMr4VtRH1HuAKM.html

At least 80,000 fake social media accounts were created across nine countries as part of the orchestrated campaign, according to a report by Mumbai Police’s cyber unit. “The Mumbai Police commissioner is being trolled on various social media platforms and abusive languages are being used against him and the Mumbai Police. An FIR has been filed against social media account holders under section 67 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000.

At present, the case is being probed by several central agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Chakraborty, her brother Showik and some other associates are in judicial custody for their alleged involvement in consumption of banned narcotic substances and NCB authorities claimed are related to Rajput’s death.The cyber unit’s revelation came days after a medical team from New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has ruled out the possibility of murder in Rajput’s death. The Maharashtra government has claimed that the AIIMS report is a vindication of its stand in the high-profile case. “We had investigated this case professionally. CBI had set up a panel of AIIMS doctors, who have justified our investigation, the findings of Cooper Hospital and the forensic laboratory. Except for a few people, nobody else was aware of our investigation, but still, many have criticised it,” Singh had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-mumbai-police-registers-two-firs-against-trolls-who-tried-to-discredit-the-force/story-QOnTFgBZrP6bWMIRAB7o4M.html

Farmers from across the state plan to gherao the houses of Dushyant and Ranjit Chautala as they are part of the BJP-led government in the state and support the Centre’s farm laws that look to liberalise agriculture. Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, Independent Meham MLA Balraj Kundu, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) state chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni will also take part in the protest at Sirsa. DUSHYANT URGED TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT TO BJP Kundu said he along with farmers from his constituency will visit Sirsa to extend support to the agitating farmers. “Everyone knows the consequences these laws will have on the farming community but Dushyant has closed his eyes to this issue. His great grandfather Devi Lal had struggled for farmers and labourers during his entire political career but he is still sitting in the BJP’s lap. I urge Dushyant and other legislators belonging to the agriculture community, who are supporting the BJP government in Haryana to withdraw their support. If the Shiromani Akali Dal can snap 23-year-old ties with the BJP, why can’t Dushyant?” he said. Yadav wrote an open letter to Dushyant, seeking his resignation for the sake of farmers. “Those supporting these anti-farmer laws will have to face public protests and black flags,” he said. FACING THE BRUNT OF THE AGITATION According to political observers, Dushyant and Ranjit Chautala are facing the brunt of the farmer agitation’s heat in Haryana because they were backed by farmers, mostly from the Jat community. Ranjit had won the election after 32 years from Rania assembly seat in Sirsa. After snapping ties with his estranged uncle Abhay Singh Chautala and grandfather, OP Chautala of the INLD, Dushyant formed his own outfit, the Jannayak Janata Party, and won 10 seats in the state assembly election in 2019. His party won eight of the 10 seats, where Jats from the agrarian community are dominant. SIMMERING ANGER AMONG FARMERS Last week, farmers had shown black flags to Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal at Odhan village in Sirsa, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini and former state minister Karan Dev Kamboj during their visit to Yamunanagar. Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal and Sonepat MP Ramesh Kaushik were also greeted with black flags during their visits to Chhichhrana and Madina villages in Sonepat’s Baroda constituency that goes to the polls on November 3. The agitators had also gheraoed the offices of Dushyant and Jannayak Janta Party MLA Devinder Babli in Uchana and Fatehabad, respectively. Protesters showed black flags to Dushyant in Kaithal, too. BJP’s Indri MLA Ram Kumar Kashyap also faced the farmers’ ire when they confronted him, leaving him with no option but to flee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/security-up-outside-dushyant-ranjit-chautala-s-houses-in-sirsa-after-farmers-call-for-gherao/story-110l1vhLxW5FHZlYYnK2uM.html

06-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Sisters move Bombay high court to quash FIR based on Rhea Chakraborty’s complaint||Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, the sisters of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput have moved the Bombay high court to quash the first information report (FIR) registered against them by Bandra police on September 7, 2020.The FIR was registered based on a complaint lodged by actor Rhea Chakraborty, who has been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) after WhatsApp chats revealing the alleged sale and purchase of drugs surfaced during the investigation into Rajput’s untimely death.In her complaint, Chakraborty accused Priyanka Singh and one Dr Tarun Kumar of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi of prescribing Rajput medicines that were prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput death: Rhea Chakraborty, others’ judicial custody likely to be extendedIn the petition filed through advocate Madhav Thorat, Rajput’s sisters have contended that no criminality could be attributed to them since the complaint was solely based on medicines prescribed by a doctor, and therefore liable to be struck down in view of a particular Supreme Court judgment.They have also contended that the complaint was fraught with material irregularities and discrepancies and there was an inordinate delay of 90 days in lodging the complaint—the medicines were prescribed on June 8, 2020, the day Rajput asked Chakraborty to leave his house, and the complaint was lodged on September 7, 2020.Advocate Madhav Thorat said the sisters have also sought interim orders to restrain the Central Bureau of Investigation, to whom the case has been handed over by the Maharashtra government, from taking any coercive steps against them.The petition will come up for hearing before a bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik on October 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-sisters-move-bombay-high-court-to-quash-fir-based-on-rhea-chakraborty-s-complaint/story-Im5bAWuVZXK8Ynng3Y1aPI.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Rhea Chakraborty, others’ judicial custody likely to be extended||The judicial custody of actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakaborty, and 18 others arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), in connection with its probe into the drug angle to late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, ends Tuesday. Their judicial custody is most likely to be extended for another 14 days considering their bail pleas before the Bombay High Court have been heard, and a single bench has reserved its order. Chakraborty and her brother were arrested by NCB after WhatsApp chats regarding the alleged use of drugs surfaced during the investigation into Rajput’s untimely death. Chakraborty was arrested after being interrogated by an NCB team for three consecutive days, on September 6, 7 and 8. According to NCB, the actor was “involved in illicit trafficking of drug and she financed drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput.” Similar allegations were levelled against Showik Chakraborty and stringent conditions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 were slapped against the two.Also Read: End the conspiracy theories, now | HT EditorialTheir bail applications were turned down by a special NDPS court on September 11, 2020. Following this, Chakraborty and her brother had moved the Bombay high court for bail and had refuted the allegation of “financing” narcotic drugs for the consumption of the deceased actor. Arguing their bail applications before the Bombay high court, advocate Satish Maneshinde said Rajput was in no dearth of funds. His house manager Samuel Miranda used to take care of “all” household expenses, and there was no question of Chakraborty financing drug purchases for the deceased actor. Responding to NCB’s accusation that Chakraborty was part of a drug syndicate, Maneshinde said the allegations was merely on the basis of a solitary incident of March 17, 2020 when she gave her credit card to Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, who withdrew Rs 10,000 using the card and purchased some contraband material for the deceased actor. Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister demands probe into AIIMS Dr Sudhir Gupta, cites ‘flip-flop’ as he rules out murderHe maintained that no amount was paid directly using Chakraborty’s card to any of the alleged peddlers for procuring drugs and therefore she can’t be said to be associated with any drug ring. It was an admitted fact that Rajput was consuming drugs even before Chakraborty became acquainted with him in April 2019, and two of Rajput’s co-stars, Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor, have reportedly told NCB that he was consuming drugs for quite a while. Maneshinde said Showik Chakraborty too was accused of being part of a drug syndicate for allegedly paying petty amounts on three occasions in April 2020 to purchase minuscule amounts of hashish and marijuana. The lawyer had added that stringent provisions contained in 27A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 for financing illicit trafficking of drugs or harbouring offenders were not at all applicable to Rhea Chakraborty or Showik Chakraborty, even if one went by the allegations levelled by NCB. NCB also alleged that Rhea Chakraborty had harboured Rajput. Maneshinde had argued that during the relevant period, Chakraborty was residing with Rajput in his house and questioned how she could have harboured the late actor in his own house. Advocate Taraq Sayed, who had argued the bail plea of another man accused in the case, Abdel Basit Parihar, submitted that NCB has been claiming to have busted a major drug ring by arresting 18/19 college students. He claimed that almost all the persons arrested by NCB in this case come from well-to-do families and cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed as drug peddlers or suppliers. Sayed submitted that the arrests were made only on the basis of statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, especially when there was hardly any recovery from most of them. He said the statements under Section 67 can at the most be used to corroborate recovery from an accused, and not otherwise. Sayed said Parihar is a final-year student of architecture and had missed his examination as he had been arrested by NCB. He added that though a moralistic argument was being advanced by NCB as to how society, especially the younger generation, was affected by the menace of narcotic drugs, in India, more people die due to smoking than by drug abuse. Maintaining that all alleged transactions involve small quantities of drugs and therefore were bailable, Sayed said all five applicants before the high court—Rhea Chakraborty, Showik Chakraborty, Miranda, other Rajput staffers Dipesh Sawant and Parihar—were entitled to bail as a matter of right. In support of his submission that the offences alleged were bailable, he relied on a 2010 judgment of Bombay high court holding that all offences under NDPS Act involving small quantities were bailable. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who opposed the bail applications on behalf of NCB, however submitted that the applicants were under a wrong assumption that all offences under the NDPS Act involving small quantity of drugs were bailable. Singh submitted that NDPS Act nowhere states that certain offences were bailable and claimed that all offences under the Act were non-bailable. Justice Sarang Kotwal had agreed with his submission. The judge referred to a 1999 judgement of a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, observing that all offences under the NDPS Act were non-bailable, and no other court was therefore authorised to take a different view of the issue. The judge had then reserved the order on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-rhea-chakraborty-others-judicial-custody-likely-to-be-extended/story-Gx5ceiYyPL2KTKnIRx4IWN.html

06-10-2020||Kolkata||Darjeeling parties surprised as Centre changes Delhi meet’s agenda from Gorkhaland to GTA||Political parties in the Darjeeling hills were taken by surprise on Monday when the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) sent a letter to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s (GJM) founder Bimal Gurung-led faction and stated that the agenda of the meeting convened in Delhi on Wednesday (October 7) had been changed from “issues related to Gorkhaland” to “issues related to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration” (GTA). GTA is the local autonomous body in the Darjeeling hills, which is headed by the Binoy Tamang-led faction of the GJM that supports the TMC. The meeting has been convened by G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state (MoS) for MHA at the ministry’s North Block office in the national capital. Also Read: Centre calls meeting on Gorkhaland at short notice; election move, says TMCHK Dwivedi, the newly appointed Bengal home secretary, and Darjeeling district magistrate (DM) S Ponnambalam have been asked to attend the meeting. The first letter was issued on October 3 and another was sent two days later. Both the letters are marked “most immediate”. Significantly, both the letters are marked to the “President, GJM” and the address mentioned is that of party’s founder Bimal Gurung’s office at Singamari in North Point, Darjeeling. Gurung had signed the GTA accord on behalf of the undivided GJM in July 2011.Gurung, who had founded the GJM and clamped a 104-day shutdown in the Darjeeling hills in 2017 in demand for a separate state, is on the run ever since he was charged by the state under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.In November 2017, Gurung’s erstwhile lieutenant Tamang suspended him and his aides in their absence. Anit Thapa, a leader of the GJM’s Tamang faction and the chairman of the board of administrators of the GTA, on Sunday said, “The Centre is making a fool of the Gorkhas. It has called a meeting because the Bengal assembly polls will be held next year. A court order had said both Gurung and Tamang are presidents of the GJM. How can Gurung be invited alone for the tripartite talks?” On Monday, Thapa was not available for comment. GJM leaders, who belong to the Tamang faction, said they were surprised that the Centre changed the agenda of the meeting. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 by forging an alliance with the GJM. In 2019, the BJP had an alliance with the GJM’s Gurung faction, the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and other smaller hill parties. Since 2009, the BJP has been promising to find a permanent political solution to the long-pending demands of people of Darjeeling, Siliguri, the Terai and the Dooars region. The promises were made in the BJP’s election manifestos in 2014 and 2019 as well. Though not invited to the meeting, Ajoy Edwards, president of the GNLF Darjeeling branch committee, had earlier welcomed the Centre’s move.He had said the GNLF is also an alliance partner of the BJP. Reacting to the second letter, Edwards said, “We will hold our own meeting in Darjeeling on the same day and take a call.” TMC spokesperson and Dum Dum Lok Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Saugata Roy said the Centre has called the meeting to create disturbance because assembly elections are due in around six months. “There is no official reason for convening the meeting. The Centre simply wants to create disturbance in the Darjeeling hills. Also, the letter is directly addressed to state government officials. We had told the Centre time and again that it should not be done and instead communications should be sent to the state government,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/darjeeling-parties-surprised-as-centre-changes-delhi-meet-s-agenda-from-gorkhaland-to-gta/story-CDfSiAh5Pfz1zDzQAiIEFM.html
06-10-2020||City||Covid-19: Experts, parents urge Maharashtra government to amend fee regulation Act||After parents raising concern over fee being charged by private schools in Maharashtra even amid Covid-19 pandemic, now experts have also sought government intervention in the matter. In a second letter written on Monday, Pune-based think-tank, SYSCOM, has requested the state government to amend the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011. “During the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, parents across the state are facing financial issues due to pay cuts and job losses. While the current law allows private schools to set their own fees, it needs to be strengthened, especially in the present context to ensure that schools are not run as profit making institutes,” states the letter issued by SYSCOM. Also read: Many pre-schools shut down, leave teachers jobless in LudhianaA government resolution (GR) released on May 8 had stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and must allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners.The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.In the absence of strict norms, say parents, they have nowhere to go. “The department has promised to audit schools against which there are complaints but the process is so long and schools are not going to wait until then,” said the parent of a South Mumbai-based school. An official from the education department said that action is being initiated against schools that have been found flouting norms. Meanwhile, several parents from Mumbai are planning to join the nationwide protest against unjust fees charged by private schools on October 10. The protest is organised by the Forum for Fairness in Education (FFE), a city-based NGO. “We hope the government takes strict action against schools charging capitation fees. Parents also demand a reduction in tuition fees because the school is saving on several expenses, such as electricity, water, and laboratory charges,” said FFE president Jayant Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-experts-parents-urge-maharashtra-government-to-amend-fee-regulation-act/story-ybJxZz6FA8E3EuanFrq4LI.html

06-10-2020||Mumbai||Most Maharashtra Covid-19 cases from 30-40 age group||At 21.34%, the 31-40 age group accounts for the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, data from the state government’s Medical Education and Drugs Department shows. The percentage of cases from the category was 20.54% on June 4, which increased to 20.74% a month later and then to 21.14%, the same day in August, after the lockdown measures were eased. Maharashtra reported 1,443,409 Covid-19 cases and 38,084 fatalities until Sunday evening. The 31-40 age group is followed by 41-50 (17.9% cases), 21-30 (16.98% cases), and 51-60 (15.95%). “Major activities, including inter-district movement, a rise in office workforce and reopening of commercial activities from the first week of September, have led to a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 patients from the age group of 31 to 40 years over the past couple of months. The common perception is that youngsters can be allowed to step out, while senior citizens must stay at home,” said an official from the health department. The percentage of cases among the 41-50 and 51-60 age groups has declined gradually. The 41-50 age group contributed to 18.03% cases on June 4, which dropped to 17.9% four months later. Similarly, for the 51-60 age group, the percentage of patients came down to 15.95% from 16.69%. The 21-30 age category, too, has seen a drop – 19.55% on June 4 to 16.98% four months later. State health officials attributed the dip in the infection rate to closure of schools, colleges and high awareness among youngsters. However, the spread among 61-70 and 71-80 age groups has increased during the corresponding period – June 4 to October 4 – from 9.72% to 10.63% and from 4.19% to 5.02%, respectively. “The rise in the percentage of cases in the 31-40 age group is because of their mobility after lockdown restrictions were gradually eased. The positive aspect of this age group is that they have a higher recovery rate. It also helps to develop herd immunity and increase the percentage of people with positive antibodies. Besides, the mortality rate is low,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital, said carelessness among people in the age group is the major reason. “Most of them are without any comorbidity and it brings the feeling of surety that they would not get infected. If due precautions are taken, like by those in the 40-60 age group, the number of cases can drop further,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/most-maharashtra-covid-19-cases-from-30-40-age-group/story-2WaiK2jOuafs65ohhrhmdP.html
06-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi launches plan for war on pollution||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced a “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virudh” (war against pollution) campaign, with a seven-point action plan ranging from measures to control dust and mitigate hot spots, to a mobile application for complaints to a “war room” for monitoring.Addressing a digital press conference, Arvind Kejriwal said the activities under this programme will continue through winter months, when pollution peaks and plunges Delhi into a public health emergency every year.He said keeping pollution levels low was even more crucial than usual this year because Covid-19 directly affects the lungs of those infected by it, and pollution could make the situation worse.“October has started, and we know that every year, the level of pollution rises in the months of October, November, and December in the Capital. One of the biggest reasons for this rise in pollution is the burning of crop stubble in Delhi and the nearby areas, due to which farmers and their families have to bear the maximum brunt of the pollution caused by stubble burning,” he said, reiterating the state government’s position that farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were the biggest components to spike in bad air in Delhi. The chief minister did not mention the odd-even road rationing scheme, which was one of the biggest innovations by the government to attempt to control vehicular emissions, and which is part of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) enforced under certain conditions by the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca).When asked if Delhi will see another odd-even drive, a Delhi government spokesperson said, “We have stringently followed Grap in the past and will continue enforcing it in the future too.”Also Read | Mercury drops, Delhi’s air begins to worsenExperts said that while the steps taken by the government were welcome, the real test would lie in their implementation.Unveiling the components of the anti-pollution campaign, Kejriwal said the first action point of the campaign was to control stubble burning within Delhi.“This year, Pusa Agricultural Research Institute has devised a very cheap and simple solution. They have formulated a fermented liquid solution which is to be sprayed on the fields to soften the stubble and prevent its burning. This year, the Delhi government will spray the solution on the basmati rice farm fields for free. If this technique is successful in Delhi, we can tell the other states to implement the same to prevent stubble burning. The Delhi government is preparing the mixture in Delhi on a large scale, and the process will start tomorrow under the guidance of the Pusa Research Institute,” Kejriwal said.The second point is an anti-dust drive in which construction sites will be strictly and regularly monitored, municipal corporations will carry out mechanical sweeping of roads, smog guns will be used, and road-owning agencies will be asked to fill potholes to prevent road dust. The government has identified 13 major hot spots where Kejriwal said an “area-specific” action plan will be executed. The areas are Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri — all classified as hot spots by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board last year based on high particulate matter concentration. “We will be launching the Green Delhi App this month. If you witness a source of pollution, including vehicular and industrial emissions, click a photo, and post it on the app. We have specified a deadline for each type of complaint. I will personally monitor the grievance redressal. We are also creating a ‘war room’ against pollution for monitoring of various measures that are implemented and have to be implemented in the coming days. I will get the daily report of the frequency, impact and success of these activities,” the chief minister said, adding that more activities will be added under the campaign in the coming months.He also talked about two policies which the Delhi government has been working on for more than a year now -- the Delhi tree transplantation policy, and the Delhi electric vehicle policy. “The tree transplantation policy will be passed in about 10 days. Under the policy, if an agency cuts a tree for, say, construction purposes, they have to ensure scientific transplantation of a minimum of 80% of affected trees, over and above the compensatory afforestation of planting of 10 saplings. Also, the subsidies under the notified EV policy will also be soon rolled out,” Kejriwal said.Also Read | With Delhi’s pollution going up, watchdog begins to crack whipThe head of the SC-appointed Epca, Bhure Lal, said several measures announced under the campaign were steps which authorities anyway have to carry out during the winter months under the Grap every year. “What is important is the enforcement — be it burning of waste, use of unapproved fuels by industries or construction companies adhering to dust -control norms. The agencies, including municipal corporations have to ensure strict enforcement of all measures given in the action plan, especially during the prevailing Covid pandemic. Polluted air affects lungs, which can further complicate the situation with Covid-19 also affecting the lungs,” Bhure Lal added.

06-10-2020||Delhi||JNU spending on security up, research budget down||The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has seen a substantial decrease in its academic expenses over the past three financial years, affecting the organisation of seminars and workshops; subscription to journals and publications; and sponsorship of fellowships and research activities. The matter was raised by members of the executive council (EC), the university’s top decision-making body, after the annual financial report for 2019-20 was presented before the council on Monday.The financial reports of the last three years show that annual academic expenses decreased by 26.38% from Rs 38.36 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 28.24 crore in 2018-19, and by another 30% to Rs 19.74 crore in 2019-20. Academic expenses include important components such as spends on seminars and workshops, journals and publications, and teaching aids and research activities. HT has seen the financial reports. While the annual financial reports for 2017-18 and 2018-19 are available on the university website, the report for 2019-20 was tabled in the EC meeting on Monday as an agenda item. In the same period, legal and security expenses have increased in the university. Legal expenses increased from Rs 2.72 lakh in 2017-18 to Rs 17.7 lakh in 2018-19. An additional fund of Rs 30 lakh was approved for legal expenses this year in the EC meeting held on September 7, in additional to the already sanctioned budget of Rs 9 lakh. Also Read | Over 50% JNU research scholars may drop out if ‘roadblocks’ not removed: SurveySecurity spends increased from Rs 17.37 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 18.54 crore in 2018-19. For 2019-20, the security budget was Rs 15.34 crore. JNU has seen significant strife on campus since 2016 — including flashpoints such as a protest against the hanging of 2001 Parliament attack accused Afzal Guru and a 2019 protest against a new fee structure. An EC member, who asked not to be named , said that the reduction in academic expenses has been consistently questioned by some of the members. “At the same time, the cost incurred on legal and security expenses have witnessed a drastic increase during these years. The centres have been witnessing major issues in organising seminars and workshops for students since we do not get enough funds for them. We are not being able to invite speakers due to the issue. The expenses on seminars and workshops have decreased to Rs 45 lakh in 2019-20 from Rs 1.48 crore in 2018-19,” the member added.JNU VC Jagadesh Kumar did not respond to several calls and texts seeking a comment. Specifically, expenses on journals and publications decreased by 33.8% from Rs 4.18 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 2.76 crore in 2018-19, and by another 58.37% in 2019-20 to Rs 1.15 crore. Similarly, the expenses on research activities -- this includes costs of research projects and teachers’ trips to international or national seminars among others -- reduced by around 98% from Rs 1.13 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 1,72,853 in 2018-19, and then inched up marginally to Rs 2,39,144 in 2019-20. The students’ fellowships/stipends -- also part of academic expenses -- decreased by at least 84% in 2018-19 to Rs 2.57 crore from Rs 18.22 crore in 2017-18. It fell further to Rs 2.39 crore in 2019-20. Registrar Pramod Kumar said that the university offers fellowships and stipends under various heads. “There are numerous sponsored fellowships in JNU. Besides there are UGC-net fellowships/stipends. These are non-net fellowships. The university is providing all fellowships/stipends to our students.”There are also reports of fellowship payments being delayed. JNU students’ union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh said that the union has been raising the issue of the decrease in academic funds for the past few years. “Students have been struggling due to the delay in the release of fellowships and stipends. I myself have not received my fellowship for past one year. Similarly, the expenses on work travel of teachers have been reduced drastically over the years,” she said. In 2018, the JNUSU alleged that the administration cut library funds by over Rs 6 crore. The University, however, denied the charges.Surajit Mazumdar, secretary of JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) said that the teachers’ body has also constantly been raising the matter of reduction in academic expenses. “The immediate implications of these are the disruptive effects on academic activities by cutbacks on important expenditure -- lab material, fieldwork, journals, conferences and seminars, etc. This is also initiating a long-term process of erosion of academic standards and establishment of a new normal where the best is no longer expected. The irony is that increased expenditure on things like security has produced the opposite of a more secure campus,” he said. Also Read | Inquiry committee set up after objections raised over four faculty appointments in JNUJNU registrar Pramod Kumar confirmed that the matter was raised by some EC members on Monday. He, however, said that reduction in academic expenses has not affected the academic performance of the University. “The University has been constantly on the top of all national rankings. The administration has in fact regularised the expenditure. We are encouraging our own faculty to conduct seminars and workshops instead of inviting people from outside. We are also encouraging our faculty members to get financiers for their research activities and we are getting it in a significant way. Besides, the Covid-19 lockdown has also affected our expenses in 2019-20 since we could not organise any seminar and workshop after March,” he said.The university follows an April to March financial year. “How can the university include seminars or workshops conducted after March in the annual report of 2019-20? There is no question of the annual account of 2019-20 being affected by the imposition of lockdown,” an associate professor said on condition of anonymity. Explaining the reason behind the increase in legal and security expenses, the registrar said: “The increase in legal cost is because of the rise in the number of cases being filed against the administration by the students and teachers. It’s not us who have moved the court.”A senior university official, who wished not to be named, said, “In the last few years, there have been many incidents of violence and disruption at the campus leading to the increase in the security cost. It includes everything from hiring guards to installing CCTV cameras to video recorders. It is for the safety of students and faculty members living at the campus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-spending-on-security-up-research-budget-down/story-XYRxiddp16Ma24phZHuCPL.html

06-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee to begin digital issuance of consent certificates in a week||In a bid to improve ease of doing business in the city and bring in more transparency, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) has decided to begin issuing no-objection certificates (consent) digitally.The applicants will be able to receive consent from the committee through their registered email ids. The current practice of manually issuing hard copies of the certificate will be reserved only for cases where the applicant specifically asks for them.Before an industry is established and begins operations, it requires the consent of the CPCC to discharge any effluent (sewage or trade effluent) into a stream or well or sewer or on land, and/or emit air pollutants into the atmosphere.The consent issued by the CPCC under Section 25/26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is known as ‘water consent’ and under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is known as ‘air consent’.Confirming the development, Debendra Dalai, member-secretary, CPCC, said, “Even though our internal processes are online, the consent is issued manually. We plan to start the process of issuing it online to all applicants within this week.”The manual process takes time as the applicant file moves up for approval and then down the hierarchy after approval. “Now, after the competent authority approves, the consent will be immediately sent to the applicant through their registered email. There will be no lag between grant of approval and receipt of consent certificate,” said Dalai.The National Informatics Centre (NIC) was roped in to digitise the process. “While the applicants could apply online earlier, too, they were not getting online issuance of consent. So, three months back we started the work on digitising the last step in the process. This will make the entire process transparent,” added Dalai.The applicants can also track their files as their application moves through the committee’s approval process.Welcoming the move, Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association of Chandigarh, said, “The online issuance of consent form will save a lot of time, energy, and will go a long way to help the beleaguered industry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cpcc-to-digitise-issuing-of-consent-certificates-to-industrialists/story-oLqTW4z3v7VCD9LfiLgsxN.html

Protesting outside the local DC office, where many party workers and farmers reached on tractors, Nirmal said, “States like Haryana and Punjab where agricultural produce market committee (APMC) system is strong and flourishing, farmers are also thriving. Today, farmers from states like Bihar and UP who own enough land prefer to come to Punjab and Haryana and work as labourers. If the new laws related to contract farming and others are implemented, then the farmers here will have to face a bleak future.” Meanwhile, his daughter and party leader Chitra Sarwara said the farmers have been protesting since months against these ‘anti-farm laws’. The manner in which they were passed in the parliament was also undemocratic, she added. Later, a memorandum in the name of the President was submitted at the DC office. Kundu calls off dharnaIndependent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, on Monday evening called off his sit-in against the recently enacted three farm legislations.Kundu said the dharna which commenced on October 2 was called off after a discussion with farmer unions’ heads, khap representatives and leaders. “The next dharna will begin in Sonepat’s Gohana from October 8. We will kick-off a yatra from November 1 against these laws and apprise people of the consequences these laws will have on farmers,” he added. SAD leaders extend supportSenior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Prem Singh Chandumajra, Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder along with others visited the dharna site in Meham and extended his support to Kundu.Chandumajra said these legislations were introduced to destroy the farming sector, especially in Haryana and Punjab. “The farmers of both the states are agitating against these laws. We came here to extend our support to Kundu, who is fighting against the BJP-JJP government for the sake of farmers’ interest in Haryana. Badal sahab has assured him of help whenever required,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/if-govt-doesn-t-scrap-anti-farmer-laws-farmers-will-change-this-govt/story-UJs89RRZ0uvBuPFbizyDtM.html

Even the Supreme Court has ruled on SYL, but Rahul is only trying to mislead the farmers by opposing farm laws,” he added.Reiterating the statements of his counterpart in Ambala Cantonment and those of Haryana home minister Anil Vij, Goyal said, “He (Rahul) won’t be allowed to enter the state at any cost if he intends to disturb the law and order situation here.”Haryana Congress treasurer Rohit Jain, in turn, hit out at Goyal, saying, “Aseem Goyal is no one to dictate anybody on entry in the state. If the comment or order comes from the chief minister, the home minister or some senior official, it is a separate issue, but Goyal is just an MLA and is not liable to decide on this.”Former Congress president and current MP, Wayanad, Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to begin his two-day tractor rally in Haryana on October 6, entering from the Devigarh border at around 10am, to protest against the recently-passed farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-welcome-rahul-if-he-brings-haryana-s-syl-share-from-punjab-says-ambala-city-mla/story-KWROxQHjPqc3NTbCnchsiI.html
06-10-2020||City||No permanent medical emergency services available at Chandigarh International Airport||After its contract with Fortis Hospital, Mohali, ended on September 25 this year, the Chandigarh International Airport is now without any permanent provisions in place to cater to medical emergencies on the premises.Post lockdown, the Airport hosts more than 3,000 passengers daily and employs around 1,000 staffers, but does not even have a permanent ambulance service.What’s more, it has been five years since the Airport was declared ‘international’, and yet, the post of airport health officer (APHO), mandatory at a structure of this magnitude, is still lying vacant.In October last year, Fortis Hospital, Mohali, had discontinued their services citing “high rent”, but after a few days, they were allowed to continue rent-free. The hospital had deputed a doctor, paramedical staff, technicians, a highly-equipped ambulance and driver for 24X7 services.At present, however, there are two state-sponsored doctors at the Airport who scan the temperatures of the incoming passengers. But they do not have any emergency medical equipment or medicines.When contacted, Ajay Bhardwaj, CEO of the Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHIAL), said, “For a permanent medical facility, we have floated tenders and hopefully, some permanent doctors will be stationed here soon.”Dr Manjit Singh, Mohali civil surgeon, said, “Our doctors go to the airport just for the screening of the passengers whenever a flight arrives. For permanent medical emergency services, it is the duty of the airport authorities to make provisions.”The domestic flight operations resumed at the Airport on May 25 after a gap of nearly three months. Before the lockdown, the airport saw at least 12,000 passengers, both at arrivals and departures, daily. The number has since come down. While 44 domestic and two international flights (Sharjah and Dubai) used to arrive and depart from here before March 23, only six to eight flights operate daily these days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-permanent-medical-emergency-services-available-at-chandigarh-international-airport/story-4DaFJCCR80wXw2mzMeFyiO.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally rises to 1,453,653, as state sees lowest spike in 49 days||Maharashtra on Monday reported 10,244 Covid-19 infections, its lowest spike in 49 days, taking the case count to 1,453,653. On August 17, 8,493 cases were reported. Active cases also went down to 252,277, accounting for 17.35% of the total. The state’s Monday low, in terms of cases, could, however, be attributed to testing numbers. Maharashtra conducted only 58,683 tests on Monday, 75,908 on Sunday and 75,093 on Saturday — all lower than the usual range of 80,000 to 90,000 tests.According to the state’s latest data, the toll climbed up to 38,347 after 263 casualties were reported, of which, 133 were in the past 48 hours, another 58 were from the past week, while the remaining 72 deaths were from the period before that.Fresh infections across the state have continued to be on a comparative decline. In the past five days, 70,361 cases have been recorded, down from the 91,010 cases in the corresponding period last month. In the past week, the state has recorded 103,654 cases, lowest of the previous four weeks. In the first week of September, cases reported were 130,789, second week saw 153,972 cases, third week had 148,365 cases and fourth week saw 126,773 cases, according to state data.Meanwhile, after a gap of over six months, hotels, restaurants and bars started their operations from Monday, at 50% capacity. All industrial and manufacturing units of non-essential units have also started their operations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The state had also declared trains originating and ending their journey within the state can operate. Officials are wary that this may change the current picture.“Cases are declining in the state, a good sign. This is because areas such as Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, which were contributing most cases, are now seeing fewer infections. In Mumbai, the situation is yet to come under control and if that happens, then improvement will be significant,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.“A rise in cases has been observed soon after fresh relaxations come into effect. There is a chance that cases will rise again, but we are working on keeping the same in mind and are hoping that this time there won’t be any rise,” he added.Mumbai continues to report the highest number of cases across the state as it recorded 1,836 on Monday, pushing its tally to 215,488. Of them, active cases were 26,392. It has also recorded 47 deaths.The scenario in Mumbai has changed from September, when the cases went up and have yet to come down. Nashik city contributed the second-highest infections to the daily caseload as it recorded 654 cases, taking its tally to 56,660 while Satara district became the third-highest contributor with 486 cases pushing its count to 39,755. Pune city, which was contributing highest cases in the state at one point of time, on Monday recorded only 395 cases.A total of 7,169,887 tests have been conducted till date and the positivity rate recorded is 20.27%.Despite a decline in cases, casualties are not reducing Maharashtra still has the highest number of casualties across the country. Tamil Nadu has reported the second-highest number of deaths — 9,784.“There needs to be more awareness among people as still patients are found not keen on doing Covid tests. They admit to a hospital only when conditions worsen, which makes it difficult for doctors to save lives,” said another official from the health department.On Saturday, state’s CFR was recorded at 2.64%, which comes at second position after Punjab. The CFR of Punjab was 3.05% (with 3,603 deaths) till Sunday, according to information shared by the state medical education department.The number of recovered patients also reached 1,162,585 as 12,982 patients recovered in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-rises-to-1-453-653-as-state-sees-lowest-spike-in-49-days/story-K06lw1buLzTTMor26zjLaK.html

Vice-chancellor Solanki was chairing the interview, along with three external experts. As a dean academic, I was also a part of the selection committee. When the registrar and vice-chancellor asked me to sign on the final list of the candidates, I refused to do so because they selected the candidates by ignoring the norms,” Berwal said. “The committee ignored a candidate who appeared from Jammu and Kashmir for the post of an assistant professor and another candidate who has been teaching at a varsity in Sonepat for the post of associate professor. When I asked them to show the documents of selected candidates, the duo refused to do so. Registrar Punia asked me to sign on the final list and told me not to interfere as the selection process was being done by the subject experts,” he added.Berwal further alleged that a varsity employee also abused him and tried to beat him up.Reacting to Berwal’s allegations, registrar Rajesh Punia said the selections were made in a transparent manner and Berwal had raised questions after one of his “friends” did not make it to the final list. “He himself had signed on every page of the list ,except the final list. He told the selection committee that he would only sign on the final list if they recruit his friend for the post of associate professor. Berwal was suspended after he called his people and relatives, who tried to intervene in our work. An inquiry committee has been formed which will look into the conduct of Berwal,” he added.He said all the selected candidates have joined their services from Monday.Congress’ Safidon MLA Subhash Gangoli also reached the varsity and demanded a fair inquiry into the selection process from a sitting judge of the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blame-game-erupts-after-jind-varsity-dean-s-suspension/story-sROgi92cHksD8f0OK5GAHN.html
06-10-2020||City||Rahul can enter Haryana but without Cong crowd: Khattar||Asking Congress to refrain from creating a law and order problem during Rahul Gandhi’s Haryana visit, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said the state government doesn’t have any reservation if the former Congress president holds tractor rallies and road shows with ‘people of Haryana’. Rahul will be in the state on a one-day tour on Tuesday to protest against the Centre’s newly enacted farm laws. “Rahul Gandhi will now be on a one-day tour instead of two,” Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja announced on Twitter on Monday evening.  He will step inside the state territory from Punjab via Devigarh border of Patiala from where he will lead a tractor rally up to Pehowa in Kurukshetra. As there are apprehensions of possible law and order situation emerging in case Congress leader is accompanied by a huge Punjab crowd while entering Haryana, Khattar clearly expressed reservations over large number of people coming from Punjab to Haryana along with Rahul. “Not acceptable if he comes to Haryana along with a big procession from Punjab. We have no problem with his visit if he holds his yatra along with the people of Haryana as this is his own tour,” the chief minister said, when asked about home minister Anil Vij previous statement that Congress leader will not be allowed to enter Haryana. Stating that in a democratic set up, everybody had the right to air views, Khattar said the state government was not opposed to the upcoming visit of the Congress leader. “They should not vitiate the atmosphere and must not take law and order in their hands,” Khattar said as the opposition Congress set into motion a flurry of activities to give a rousing reception to Rahul on his arrival in Haryana on Tuesday. Top government officials also said there was no plan to stop Rahul Gandhi from entering the state. However, Congress supporters from Punjab will not be allowed to enter Haryana with the procession, they added. The officials further said the permission to hold processions will be subject to the Union ministry of home affairs’ cap of gathering of up to 100 persons outside containment zones. At Pehowa, the state Congress has planned a show of strength where the party leader will address the farmers. After the Pehowa rally, Rahul will travel to Kurukshetra. He was earlier supposed to embark on a road show from Pipli grain market on Wednesday, but his plan has been curtailed. Party Supporters Swing into ActionThe Congress had on Sunday swung into action and held meetings to mobilise support and ensure a huge gathering. As per the reports, police have been deployed on the Haryana-Punjab border from where Rahul Gandhi will enter the state. Kurukshetra SP Rajesh Duggal refused to divulge details, but it has been learnt that Haryana government has decided that tractors from Punjab will not be allowed to enter the state. Meanwhile, Selja convened a meeting in Kurukshetra and urged party workers to bring their tractors and ensure huge gatherings at the road shows. “Why are the BJP leaders scared of Rahul’s visit....why are they saying that they will not allow him to enter the state?” Selja questioned, reacting to the reported remarks of home minister Anil Vij. “He is a grandson of Indira Gandhi and son of Rajiv Gandhi. We will see how this government will stop him,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rahul-can-enter-haryana-but-without-cong-crowd-khattar/story-mqA8dINIc1lEtQ22nTzToJ.html

06-10-2020||Mumbai||Rare weather phenomenon: Water-tornado seen off Mumbai’s coast||Malabar Hill resident Darshan Khatau was pleasantly surprised to spot a rare weather phenomenon on Monday morning. He saw a waterspout or water-tornado — a rotating vertical column or funnel shaped cloud formation as an intense vortex over water —around 3 km off the coast of Mumbai from Malabar Hill, near Prongs Lighthouse at 9.15am.“I saw it when I had stepped out on my balcony to take photographs of birds like I do daily. The phenomenon lasted for about 20 seconds and I managed to take two short videos. The location of the waterspout may not have been more than 1 km off Colaba early this morning. Owing to cloud cover and haze, the photos were not very clear,” said Khatau, an avian and wildlife enthusiast who has documented several bird species.A similar image of the waterspout was shared on social media by Seju Nair on Twitter. The posts stated that it was spotted near Marine Drive on Monday morning.Some isolated spells of light rain were recorded in different parts of the city and suburbs on Monday.HT shared Khatau’s videos with the weather bureau, Union earth sciences ministry and independent meteorologists.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD), called it a ‘rare occurrence especially close to the coast’. “This does not happen frequently. Whenever there is any convective activity (vertical transport of heat and moisture in the atmosphere from warmer surface area and lifted to cooler zone) followed by thunderstorms, this kind of weather phenomenon is witnessed,” he said adding, “This phenomenon is a tornado when it occurs over land, and over sea it is termed as a waterspout. It can happen over a river, large pond, and over the ocean. During the monsoon season, whenever there are convective clouds, it can occur in coastal areas.”M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences said, “This is an atmospheric phenomenon. It is a rotation of the cloud that comes down and pulls up water. Owing to convective currents, there is a down-drop effect which pulls up the water in a rotational manner for a small time frame.”Mohapatra said the phenomenon was also reported off Vishakhapatnam coast earlier this monsoon. Even during the landfall of severe cyclone Nisarga during the first week of June this year, it was observed by the fishing community off Shrivardhan coast in Sindhudurg. “The coverage area is less than one kilometre where there is intense downpour of water within that column. In some cases, it lifts water from the water bodies and falls less than 500 metre away dropping fish or other aquatic life at a distance from the emergence of the system,” said Mohapatra.Unfortunately, it is very difficult to detect through radars and only eye witness records have been relied on, said Rajeevan. “We do not have a good record or statistics of such events. Only this kind of qualitative record is there. However, we have to check our radar data for convective clouds for that period on Monday morning. The whole thunderstorm activity is short-lived (one or two hours) and convective clouds die off quickly. Thus, such a phenomenon is also short-lived,” he said.IMD’s Mumbai regional meteorological department in Colaba confirmed the presence of convective clouds over south Mumbai and off the coast on Monday from 9am onwards.Independent meteorologists said these events generally happen at least 20 miles off the coast and are common in deep oceans. However, it is rare to have happened closer to the coast, said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian of department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. “There is an active circulation in the Arabian Sea off Mumbai coast. Mumbai has also been witnessing thunderstorms since October 3. The active circulation could have led to the formation of this super cell thundercloud where intense convective activity in that area led to this abrupt vertical abrupt phenomenon and formation of a large cumulonimbus (dense tall vertical) cloud followed by this funnel shaped formation. If it happens over land (tornado), it is rare. In the ocean, it is possible due to the presence of strong vertical currents,” he said.Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said, “From the photograph and observed meteorological conditions, it appears that this was a fair weather waterspout. Satellite images show the presence of developing cumulus clouds off south Mumbai coast at the time of the event. Fair weather waterspouts form along such cloud bases.”What are waterspouts or water-tornadoesWaterspouts are generally classified into two categories: tornadic and fair weather. Fair weather waterspouts are more frequent and less destructive than tornadic waterspouts and they usually form during morning hours. An interaction of warm air near the water surface with cooler air creates atmospheric instability, which forces the moist air to rise and then condense. If there is sufficient wind shear (change in wind velocity with height), the air column starts spinning and a waterspout forms.(Source: Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rare-weather-phenomenon-water-tornado-seen-off-mumbai-s-coast/story-h1hXKUUcbKWpvGEvGmkKeO.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government ‘unwillingly’ accepts option of borrowing ₹97,000 crore to make up for GST losses||Maharashtra, which had initially opposed both the options of borrowing to make up for the goods and services tax (GST) losses, has now intimated the Centre that it will “unwillingly” go for the first option of raising loans equivalent to the actual losses, as officials said the state has no other alternative. Under the first option, the Centre had allowed states to borrow a collective amount of Rs97,000 crore, which is equivalent to the losses in revenue owing to the GST transition. During the 42nd meeting of the GST Council headed by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday, the Centre increased the borrowing limit to Rs1.1 lakh crore from the earlier Rs97,000 crore, in the wake of the drop of about 3% in the growth rate. During the meeting, the Maharashtra government informed the Centre that it will go for the first option. “We are not in favour of any of the options, and want the Centre to borrow on behalf of the states. But as no alternative is given to us, we will unwillingly go for the first option,” said an official from the finance department. The state is expected to borrow more than Rs12,000 crore to make up to the compensation due from the Centre in the current fiscal. During the 41st meeting of the Council on August 27, the Centre had proposed that the states could borrow Rs97,000 crore, which is equivalent to the revenue losses owing to the GST transition, or they could borrow Rs2.35 crore – equivalent to the revenue losses due to the GST transition and the Covid-19 pandemic situation. In the first option, the principal and interest would be paid from the cess fund, while in the second the states would bear the interest. Most of the states have opted for the first option. The outstanding compensation expected from the Centre to Maharashtra has mounted to Rs30,000 crore between April and September. Maharashtra accounts for at least 11-12% of the total compensation paid to states and received the highest (Rs19,233 crore) compensation in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-unwillingly-accepts-option-of-borrowing-97-000-crore-to-make-up-for-gst-losses/story-GtPsmlefYra5m3Srdmh3TP.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||As cases surge, FDA increases daily oxygen production to 1,100 metric tonnes in Maharashtra for Covid-19 patients||Amid the growing Covid-19 cases, the demand for oxygen has increased across Maharashtra. As per data provided by the state Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), the state requires around 900 metric tonnes of oxygen everyday for Covid-19 patients who develop difficulties in breathing. To address the growing demand for oxygen, FDA has increased its daily production to more than 1,100 metric tonnes. Patients with oxygen saturation levels lower than 94% are put on oxygen support. Currently, there are more than 2.50 lakh active Covid-19 cases in the state, of which 14,437 patients are on oxygen support, while 9,857 patients are in serious condition and are undergoing treatment at intensive care units (ICUs).Everyday, the FDA gets over 25 calls from hospitals in the state seeking oxygen supply. “The collectors of districts inform us about the need for oxygen. Most requirements are from rural areas, especially in western Maharashtra, where cases are increasing gradually,” said a senior FDA official. “At the beginning of the pandemic, there were only two suppliers. Now, there are six suppliers which are providing enough amount of oxygen needed for patients. We have asked the manufacturers to increase the production further but there is no crisis of oxygen in the state.,” said the official. Last month, health officers alleged that hospitals were often found using unregulated amount of oxygen on patients. To control daily expenditures, the state government had issued a notification, asking hospitals to restrict oxygen use to 12 litres per minute in ICUs and 7 litres per minute in wards. The notification had drawn severe criticism from doctors. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, state president of Indian Medical Association, said, “The government should not restrict the usage of oxygen. A doctor’s judgement should be final. The government should believe that doctors work ethically in the interest of patients.” After facing criticism, the state on September 21 withdrew the circular. Recently, the Maharashtra government issued new guidelines for the medical usage of oxygen, based on the recommendations of a central government-appointed expert committee. Private and public hospitals have been advised to restrict oxygen supply to 40 litres per minute in ICUs and 15 litres per minute in wards, depending on the patient’s condition. Dr Jalil Parkar, a pulmonologist at Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, said there is no shortage of oxygen in city hospitals at present, but medical centres at rural Maharashtra are still facing a problem. Welcoming the FDA move to increase production, Parker said the move will help relax the regulation over oxygen usage. “If a patient needs more amount of oxygen, I can’t deny it because it can be fatal for the patient. The government needs to understand that hoarding oxygen unlike other drugs isn’t very feasible, as it starts leaking gradually. So they should focus on the production and leave its clinical usage on doctors,” said Dr Parkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-cases-surge-fda-increases-daily-oxygen-production-to-1-100-metric-tonnes-in-maharashtra-for-covid-19-patients/story-wECpOSwGIP4NH28d4GBhAL.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Flap gates installed at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to facilitate screening of passengers||Central Railway (CR) has installed flap gates on the entry and exit points of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to screen outstation passengers and study commuters’ movements. This is the first time that flap gates have been installed at any station on Mumbai’s suburban railway network. The gates, which will be activated later this week, will have the quick response (QR) code scanner and thermal scanning facilities. Passengers will have to place the QR code generated on their e-tickets at the entry points of the station for the validation of their tickets. The QR code will be generated from the tickets booked through the Indian Rail Catering Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website. Passengers who have booked their tickets from the booking windows will receive a message on their mobile phones with the QR codes. Access inside the railway station will be permitted only after temperature screening of passengers. “The flap gates will facilitate safe commuting during coronavirus and promote social distancing between passengers. It will also help railway staff in detecting unauthorised access to station premises,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. The gates have been installed on pilot basis. Based on the success, the gates will be introduced at other railway stations in the city. The Western Railway will also be soon installing flap gates on Churchgate railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/flap-gates-installed-at-mumbai-s-chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-terminus-to-facilitate-screening-of-passengers/story-2nOl3xAF6iThsokvEph1OP.html

According to police, the health workers had gone Gulshan Nagar society in Oshiwara for door-to-door survey programme initiated by the state government when the accused Nasir Khan, 45 and Alam Ali Shaikh, 30, stopped them from conducting check-ups. “They even told other members of the society that the health workers were child thieves and tore the government survey book,” said an officer. The complainant Anita Khadtare, 35, a health worker at BMC’s K-West ward and her colleague Meena D’Souza, 40, visited the building at Gulshan Nagar. “A woman on the second floor refused to share details asked by them and also told their neighbours to not share any details, said Khadtare in her complaint. Meanwhile, Khan, the husband of the woman, came out and started yelling at them stating that they were child thieves and to remove their mask to check their faces, said an officer. Khadtare and D’Souza told them that they were from the BMC and that they were doing their duty to check people, but Khan refused to listen and snatched the survey book and tore it. More than 20 people gathered at the spot and each one of them started shouting. A team of Oshiwara police reached the spot and arrested the accused under section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-stop-bmc-workers-from-conducting-health-check-ups-in-mumbai-s-oshiwara-area-arrested/story-1zZiSbxmjRQmhpr7qdJxbL.html
06-10-2020||Chandigarh||Residents encroach upon park in Chandigarh’s Sector 27||A few residents have encroached upon a park opposite Arya Samaj Mandir in Sector 27 by making illegal entrances from their houses to get a direct access. The park with a functional open-air gym is also being used by them to dry clothes.Shubham Sharma, a local, said that people come to the park to dry their clothes almost every day. “We had written to the authorities regarding this and were told that notices had been sent about a month back but nothing has changed even now.”Another resident on the condition of anonymity said that before the lockdown some residents had also been using the park’s entrance as makeshift shops. Some residents also park their vehicles which is not allowed.Area councillor Devinder Singh Babla said, “These are government quarters and the practice has been going on for a long while. The residents here had told me that they have no other alternative but to dry their clothes in the park. The area is plagued with monkeys who steal clothes from the roofs of houses, so residents hang them in the park to keep a vigil.”Babla added that although it wasn’t allowed, there was no alternative available and he has not received any complaint regarding this.UT deputy conservator of forests (DCF) Abdul Qayum said, “We need to check whether the trees in the park have been harmed to hook up the clothing lines. Such a practice should be discouraged.” Officials of the horticulture wing of the MC said that they would investigate into the matter and action would be taken if anyone is found encroaching upon the park.Officials of the UT estate department said that they will have to visit the spot to see if there is any violation, “Government houses are made as per plans by the engineering department and we will have to check with them if the entrances made into the park are allowed are not,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-encroach-upon-park-in-chandigarh-s-sector-27/story-nctM3DJ36r4wxxYcLFPgmK.html

Police suspect the accused managed to hack her net banking login to make digital transactions.According to the Nerul police, the complainant Nadira Khan’s father had opened a savings account for her marriage expenses in 2015. Until late June, her family had managed to save ₹5.03 lakh in the account.In her complaint, Khan stated that she did not make any transaction from her account during the lockdown period. In September, when Khan had gone to the ATM to withdraw ₹200, she realised that the account had only ₹1.03 lakh left.“Khan and her brother approached the bank and got the statement of her account during which they found that ₹4.01 lakh was fraudulently spent from the account in 32 transactions. The transactions were made between July 15 and September 1,” said an officer of the Nerul police station.After Khan submitted a complaint to the police, a case of cheating was registered against an unidentified person under the Indian Penal Code and IT Act.The police have approached the bank and are also taking assistance from the Navi Mumbai cybercrime cell to establish how exactly the accused managed to withdraw such large amounts without the complainant learning about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-lakh-stolen-from-nerul-woman-s-bank-account-through-32-transactions/story-ojIECqmVYMd7nF6CAf3arL.html
06-10-2020||Chandigarh||JEE Advanced: Dhvanit Beniwal is Chandigarh tricity topper with AIR 10||Dhvanit Beniwal, 18, has topped from the tricity in the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Advanced conducted for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology.The results announced by the National Testing Agency on Monday morning brought a welcome news for his school Bhavan Vidyalaya, Sector 15, Panchkula, too, as all five students from the tricity who have made it to the top 100 have completed their Class 12 from there. The results this year are also an improvement for the tricity, as in 2019, only one student (Yatin Jindal, AIR 94) was in the top 100.Giving credit to his school, Dhvanit said: “Attending the classes regularly was very important as it helped me gain insight into practical applications of concepts in order to understand them better.”This year, the Panchkula school had also produced five tied tricity toppers in the CBSE Class 10 examinations, and a tricity topper in Class 12 humanities. A similar trend was seen in 2019 and 2018 when the school produced two national toppers and three tricity toppers in Class 10.Speaking about the recent string of toppers, principal Gulshan Kaur said it is the result of overall development of students. “The preparation is not just for two years, but begins in earlier classes. Instead of targeting competitive exams, we focus on making students develop the right attitude to crack the exams. We make them competitive to the right degree, which is why they score well,” she said.Dhvanit’s elder brother Devang also cleared the JEE Advanced in 2019 and is currently pursuing electrical engineering from IIT Roorkee. His father, Dharampal Singh Beniwal, retired as a chief engineer from the public health department in Haryana, while mother, Sangeeta Beniwal, is a government schoolteacher. He had secured 97.6% marks in his CBSE Class 12 exams.The other four toppers are Gurpreet Singh Wadhwa (AIR 23), Hemank Bajaj (AIR 71), Kartik Sharma (AIR 87) and Tanish Tuteja (AIR 96). Besides their schooling, the five have another thing in common between them: all want to pursue computer science engineering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jee-advanced-dhvanit-beniwal-is-chandigarh-tricity-topper-with-air-10/story-8dwUAPiVzCmRlDChF9kmcJ.html
06-10-2020||Chandigarh||As fresh cases go down, has Covid curve flattened in Chandigarh tricity?||A day after the number of fresh Covid-19 cases in the tricity dropped below 200 for the first time since mid-August, there was a marginal rise as 239 people tested positive for the virus.However, the figures in the first five days of this month are quite promising, as only 1,512 people have tested positive, as compared to 18,584 throughout September. The last month witnessed a major surge in infections, with the peak reached on September 13, when 865 people tested positive.The month had also accounted for 65% of the total deaths recorded in the tricity till September 30. Even the daily toll has come down, with five recorded on Monday. Three men, aged 34, 54, and 56, from Sectors 47, Sector 25, and Sector 19, respectively, died in Chandigarh, while a 48-year-old man from Sector 15 and a 62-year-old woman from Bitna succumbed in Panchkula district. Mohali recorded zero casualty for the second time in three days. In Chandigarh, 133 people tested positive on Monday, a day after the number had come down to double digits (85) for the first time since August 19. With 199 people being discharged, the number of active cases came down to 1,604, reaching the pre-September level. For the third consecutive day, Mohali district too witnessed positive cases in just double figures. On Monday, 63 people tested positive while 169 patients were discharged. In Panchkula, which too has been reporting fresh infections in double digits, only 43 people tested positive.The tricity’s tally is inching towards 30,000, with 29,805 people tested positive so far, of whom 3,663 (12.3%) are still not discharged. As many as 472 patients have died while 25,670 have been cured.“The pattern seen in the past two weeks in the region, including Chandigarh, shows the Covid trajectory is on the downturn after witnessing a spike in the month of September,” said Dr KK Talwar, former director of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. “The infection spread has been contained to an extent and things are settling down with the number of fresh cases lesser than the number of people recovering. It is a positive sign, but we need to be vigilant and keep taking the Covid threat seriously.” TESTING NUMBERS DROP TOOIn Chandigarh, there has been a significant drop in Covid-19 testing and cases in the past one week. Data of the last 15 days shows testing almost halving from 11,271 (conducted between September 21 to September 28) to 5,110 last week. This corelated with a drop in the number of cases from 1,380 to 767 in the same period. In Panchkula, too, the numbers are on the decline. Except on Sunday, when 1,120 tests were conducted, the authorities have conducted less than 300 tests daily in the past four days. On Monday, only 275 were conducted.While some health experts claimed infection spread appeared to have been contained because fewer contacts of infected persons were being tested, Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head, department of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER, said people should come forward for tests even for mild symptoms, which in turn can stop infection spread and fatalities.“The dip is on the expected lines, just as the rise in late July. Around 1% population has been infected in Chandigarh, which has been detected through diagnostic tests. There will be more or less an equal number that would have been infected as they remained asymptomatic or had mild symptoms,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Meanwhile, Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali, while giving a note of caution to residents, said: “Though the number of cases has gone down in the past few days, if we adopt a careless attitude and do not take precautions, the virus can strike us again in no time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-fresh-cases-go-down-has-covid-curve-flattened-in-chandigarh-tricity/story-EHzYGLFtis7b4KkTlzfoxJ.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||Pune teen is all-India JEE-Advanced topper||With a score of 352 out of 396, Pune resident Chirag Falor, 18, from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) zone, emerged the all-India topper in the Joint Entrance Examination Advanced (JEE-Adv) exams, results for which were announced on Monday. However, unlike many other candidates vying for seats in popular courses in top IITs, Falor plans to skip the race. “I have already secured admission at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States and plan to pursue my undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Science) from the institute,” said Falor, adding that his application was accepted by MIT in March. “I consider JEE a test of skills. As I had already spent four years preparing for the exam, I chose to appear for the papers, despite already confirming admission with MIT,” he added. Elaborating on the efforts that went into it, he said, “I started my preparation in Class 9 and completed my syllabus for Class 11 and 12 before I could pass out of Class 11. Throughout Class 12, I gave daily mock tests for JEE-Advanced.” His parents hail from Rajasthan and he came to Pune when he was in Class 2. He completed his Class 10 from Saint Arnold’s School in Kalyaninagar in Pune. For Class 11 and 12, he enrolled himself at Pragati School, New Delhi. His father works as a software development manager, while his mother is a homemaker, who takes tuitions. On getting into MIT, the Pune boy said it was “super tough than IIT”. “Less than five students from India make it to MIT. I aspire to become either an astrophysicist or an astronaut and plan to take up physics as a subject from second year at MIT,” he said. For the last one month, Falor has spent almost 11 hours, from 5.30pm to 4.30am, six days a week, attending his regular classes online for MIT, and then spent a few hours preparing for the JEE. “My son’s body clock is working differently, but he didn’t let anything affect his JEE preparation,” said Pawan Kumar Falor, his father. “Chirag has been passionate about planets and skygazing since childhood. We supported his interests and his dreams. He was always interested in research. He does things from heart and concentrates on the tasks. We are proud of him.” Seventeen-year-old Swayam Chube from Mumbai bagged the eighth all-India rank, becoming the Mumbai topper. Last month, Chube was among 24 students across the country to score a 100 percentile in the JEE Mains exam held in the first week of September.“I’ve been working very hard to prepare for both JEE Mains and Advanced for the past two years. During the lockdown, I took a break from the preparation and again in the last one month, I spent a lot of time studying and solving papers,” said Chube, who wants to get a seat in the computer science department at IIT-B. Toppers from the Scheduled Caste (SC) and SC (persons with disability) categories – Avi Uday and Yash Patil – too are from the IIT-B zone. While Chirag is the male topper for JEE-Adv 2020, female topper Kanishka Mittal with the same rank (17) belongs to the IIT-Roorkee zone. The zone-wise female topper from the IIT-B zone is Niyati Mehta from Ahmedabad, with a common rank of 62. As per information shared by the organising institute IIT-Delhi on Monday, 24 of the top 100 toppers of JEE-Adv 2020 belong to the IIT-B zone, including four of the top 10 scorers. Twenty-two toppers belong to the IIT-Delhi zone. The Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) has announced that eligible students can start the form filling process for admissions to IITs, NITs, IITs and other GFTIs on josaa.nic.in on October 6, starting 10am. The total intake capacity across 23 IITs this year has gone up by almost 2,500 seats. From 13,583 last year, the intake capacity stands at 16,053 this year. This year JoSAA will conduct six rounds of seat allotment as opposed to seven rounds last year. The first seat allotment list will be released on October 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pune-teen-is-all-india-jee-advanced-topper/story-DYQ28eMHx7FqyNjvVqdVzI.html
06-10-2020||City||Navi Mumbai civic body collects ₹35 lakh fine for Covid-19 violations||Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has collected ₹35 lakh in fine from those violating Covid-19 norms like social distancing and wearing of masks, among other from April 29 till date. Special ward level squads have been formed to levy fine and ensure the guidelines are followed. Those violating the norms are also given a rose and an appeal is made to henceforth follow the rules. The corporation collects fine of ₹1,000 for spitting in public place, ₹500 for not wearing a mask, ₹200 for flouting social distancing norms and ₹2,000 for shopkeepers and traders flouting the social distancing norms. NMMC civic chief Abhijit Bangar, said, “Under the circumstances, to prevent the spread of the Covid pandemic, regular use of masks, washing of hands and maintaining adequate distance are of utmost importance. However, some residents continue to violate the norms.” He further said that the NMMC’s intention is not to harass anyone or earn from this drive. It is being done to control the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-civic-body-collects-35-lakh-fine-for-covid-19-violations/story-j8YbZp7xfIYFlhrnQi6NZK.html
06-10-2020||Mumbai||30% restaurants, hotels reopen in Maharashtra on Monday; shortage of staff and monetary issues plaguing the sector||Approximately 30% of hotels and restaurants in Maharashtra reopened on Monday after being shut since the lockdown was announced at the end of March. On Saturday, the state-issued Covid-related guidelines for hotels and restaurants to reopen. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an apex body of hoteliers, said approximately 1.20 lakh hotels of the total 4 lakh in the state opened on Monday. “Majority of the hotels are facing an acute shortage of staff as the migrant workers have not been able to reach their workplaces till date. Besides, issues like the renegotiation of rents with landlords are taking place. Some hoteliers want to be fully compliant with the new rules before opening their establishments,” said Sherry Bhatia, president, HRAWI. Those who opened their establishments said there were few customers. “We hardly had 10 % consumers on the first day,” said Narayan Poojari, managing director of restaurant chain Shiv Sagar, which has 15 outlets across Mumbai. He said they are facing acute shortage with only 150 of their 800 staff on duty. Fountain Hospitality Private Limited (FHPL), which runs four restaurants including Flamboyante and Fountain Sizzlers, said there was some interest in dining out. “There is happiness among the patrons who came to dine on the first day. We are taking all precautions to ensure their safety and also requesting them for prior reservation so that we can plan better,” said Amrish Arora, managing director, FHPL. However, FHPL has restricted its menu to 110 items from the pre-Covid 200 items. “It is just the first day and it is a matter of time before business picks up,” said Arora. “Most of the hoteliers are facing monetary crises as they have been closed for more than six months with hardly any income. Also, most landlords did not waive rent, which has impacted their finances very badly. They are raising funds,” said Savio D’sa, a consultant for several hotels and restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-restaurants-hotels-reopen-in-maharashtra-on-monday-shortage-of-staff-and-monetary-issues-plaguing-the-sector/story-LMSH4PfpwFe1G08lAgh5JL.html

Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has asked the cyber cell to investigate the matter, and register cases under the Information Technology (IT) Act.Mumbai Police’s cyber unit has submitted a report citing that posts were uploaded on social media platforms from different countries like Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Romania and France. “We identified the posts in foreign languages because of the hashtags used like #justiceforsushant #sushantsinghrajput and #SSR, and are in the process of verifying more accounts,” said a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. “The campaign was run against Mumbai Police to demoralise us at a time when 84 personnel had died due to the pandemic and over 6,000 were infected with Covid-19. This was a motivated campaign with a vested interest to malign the image of Mumbai Police and derail our line of investigation. Multiple fake accounts on social media were created to target Mumbai Police in abusive tones. Our cyber cell is conducting a thorough investigation into this matter and all those found violating the law will be prosecuted under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act,” Singh told HT on Monday.  Also Watch | Sushant case: Mumbai top cop ‘not surprised’; Sena sees plot after AIIMS reportReacting to reports of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) having ruled out the possibility of murder in the case, Singh said, “We had investigated this case very professionally.

06-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Shiv Sena retains hold of BMC with help of allies Congress, NCP||The Shiv Sena has retained control of the crucial civic standing committee as its nominee Yashwant Jadhav was elected as chairman. The Congress withdrew its candidate and abstained from voting. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) voted in favour of Sena against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sena’s Sandhya Doshi also won the election for the education committee that supervises primary and secondary education in Mumbai. Sena insiders said the party would offer chairmanship of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) to the Congress in exchange for support in BMC.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) voted for Sena, citing that they wanted to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of the race due to ideological differences. Rais Shaikh, SP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Bhiwandi and BMC corporator, said, “Our votes went to Sena, and it was purely to keep the BJP out of the race.” The Congress, on the other hand, stayed neutral in the voting on Monday by withdrawing candidatures for both committees, citing insufficient numbers. It also alleged that the BJP tried to bribe its corporators for cross-voting. The Congress added that it did not want to support the BJP on grounds of principles, and hence withdrew candidates.Ravi Raja, leader of opposition of the Congress, said, “We withdrew our candidatures to keep the BJP out of BMC as they were somehow contacting our corporators to cross vote by offering money. We will continue to remain in opposition and will withdraw candidatures for all the remaining committees like the improvement committee and BEST (Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport), for which elections are on Tuesday.”Cross voting was possible in both committees where Sena has a majority followed by BJP having the second-largest majority, Congress, NCP and SP. In this case, if somehow the Congress corporators would have voted for BJP or BJP corporators voted for Congress, Sena’s chances to win would have been in danger.Eknath Gaikwad, Mumbai Congress president said, “We withdrew as we had no numbers and we did not want support from the BJP. We will continue to remain in the opposition in the BMC.” BJP rubbished all allegations by the Congress of trying to buy votes. Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and standing committee member, said, “We are the true opposition party in the BMC, considering Congress and Sena are together in the state government. By the withdrawal of candidatures, it is very clear that Congress is Sena-sponsored opposition. We did not offer any money to Congress corporators.”In the civic house of 227, the Sena has 97 elected representatives. It is short of 17 for a simple majority of 114 but has managed to remain in power as the opposition is divided. The BJP is the second largest party with 83 seats but it has decided to play the role of an opposition party. The Congress (29) is also in the opposition, and so is the NCP (8). Though these two parties are Sena’s allies in the state government, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party has avoided any sharing of power with them in the BMC. Other smaller parties include Samajwadi Party (6), AIMIM (2) and MNS (1).Significantly, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) members Sena, Congress and NCP, along with SP have been discussing the possibility of contesting the Mumbai civic polls in 2022, together. “We are together in the state but not in the BMC. About BMC, I cannot comment now, it all will depend on the situation at that time,” said Gaikwad.However, a senior Congress leader said that an understanding was struck between the Sena and Congress, over giving the latter the chairmanship position in the Mumbai Board of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) and chairmanship of the Maulana Azad Minorities Financial Development Corporation Limited (MAMFDCL) in exchange for withdrawing candidates from the BMC.The members of every statutory committee are elected from among elected corporators (except BEST), and the members then elect a chairman. In the 27-member standing committee, 26 members were eligible for voting. Sena’s Jadhav got 14 votes, and BJP’s Makrand Narvekar got nine votes. In the 26-member education committee, Sena’s Doshi got 13 votes and BJP’s Surekha Patil got seven votes. The representation for each party to these committees is given based on the strength of the party’s elected corporators. The members have tenure of two years, and the chairmanship is for one year. On Monday, elections for the education and standing committee were held, and elections for improvement and BEST committees will be conducted today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-shiva-sena-retains-hold-of-bmc-with-help-of-allies-congress-ncp/story-grOgky5jgvPKBv4EKr3L8O.html

The varsity administration said that it would begin distribution of around 30-40 tablets to needy students this week.On Thursday, students had also staged a sit-in protest outside the vice chancellor’s office demanding restoration of the old reservation policy, allowing fee waiver, providing tablets to needy students, and increasing the internet reimbursements already being offered by the university to marginalized students.On Thursday, following a meeting with vice chancellor Anu Singh Later, registrar Nitin Malik, proctor Satyaketu Sankrit, dean of students Santosh Singh, and other administrative officials, the varsity’s elected students body said they were “largely satisfied with the outcome.”“Though we have not been able to secure a reduction of fees, the meeting was largely successful since the administration has done everything on their end. The university administration said they will help students in getting required SC/ST certificates to facilitate their admissions. The varsity has also assured of increasing the reimbursement being given for Internet packages and extending the facility to research scholars as well,” said Shubhojeet Dey, treasurer, AUD students’ council.Students had also demanded a reduction in semester fee, extension of fee deadline, and removal of fee components like “Extra Mural Fee” for certain courses. “Since we were not having offline classes, these components should not be charged,” said Dey.The students’ body had alleged that the university had revised its reservation policy by tweaking the domicile criterion — an allegation rejected by the university. Registrar Nitin Malik said, “We explained to the students that the reservation policy being followed is as per the norms of the Delhi government.”The registrar said that the tablets could only be distributed after the procurement procedure had concluded. “We will start with the distribution of tablets this week,” he said.The administration has also extended the deadline to submit the semester fee by one month — till November 18. The late fee component has also been removed. “Even those wishing for a fee waiver can apply to us and we will take the decision on a case to case basis. Once the reopening directives are in place, we can also open our computer labs for students who need to use it, while maintaining social distancing norms,” said Malik.Postgraduate student Riti Choudhari, currently in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, said that attending the online classes has been difficult for her and it was affecting her education. “Due to financial challenges, I haven’t been able to get a new laptop to work on. We have one working smartphone and that belongs to my father. I will only be able to either pay my fee or secure a device for my learning. This is why I was looking forward to getting some assistance from the university,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ambedkar-university-agrees-to-provide-tablets-to-students-increase-reimbursement-for-internet/story-G9zimfEZsB2rFrv7eEvPCJ.html

The man had gotten engaged to be married three months ago and was to have the nuptials before December. Police have registered a case of death due to negligence to probe the incident.According to the police, they received a call at the Hazrat Nizamuddin police station around 11.50pm reporting that a man has died of electrocution after he came in contact with a pole at a park near Nizamuddin Basti. A police team reached the spot rushed the injured man to AIIMS, where he was pronounced dead.Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena said the police were later able to identify the man as Jubair, a resident of Nizamuddin Basti, who worked at a car accessories shop in Lajpat Nagar. He hailed from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh. His body was sent for a postmortem examination and the family members were informed, the DCP said.Meena said the spot where he got electrocuted was inspected and a case of causing death due to negligence was registered against unknown persons to probe the matter. “A team from power discom BSES also visited the spot and cut the supply to the pole,” he said.A BSES official said the stretch and the pole in question are not maintained by BSES.When contacted, PWD officials did not comment on the matter.According to Jubair’s cousin Rehman, he had just returned home from work and was talking to his mother over the phone, when the incident took place. “His mother is visually challenged and lives with Jubair’s three brothers and father in Amroha.

06-10-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar again over salaries of dengue workers||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday criticised the BJP-ruled municipal corporations (MCDs) for not complying with the court’s order to pay a salary of Rs 32,000 per month to dengue-malaria warriors of Delhi instead of the present Rs 14,000. The party also said AAP had moved the Delhi high court against the north MCD’s decision to suspend 30 of its councillors last week after which the court on Monday ‘rejected the civic body’s last two sessions’ and served notice over the suspension orders.Addressing a press conference, AAP leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the fight against dengue and malaria cannot happen without the people who spray anti-dengue and malaria medicines across the Capital. “These people are also known as dengue-malaria warriors. They check the breeding of larvae, go door to door and spray the medicine. There are around 3,500 such people who work as dengue-malaria warriors. But it is unfortunate that the BJP-ruled MCD is showing a step-motherly attitude towards these people. From 2002, the BJP-ruled MCD has not confirmed their jobs but kept them as contractual employees. These people protested many times. The BJP leaders repeatedly assured them of justice but always denied it,” he said.“These people had no other way than moving court and in 2019, they got rights after the court’s verdict. The court ruled that these employees should get a Rs 32,000 salary instead of Rs 14,000. The verdict also observed that the BJP-ruled MCD should clear their arrears and bonus from 2012. The court issued a timeline of March 31, 2020, to finish these works. But none of it was complied with,” Pathak said. He also said, “Some days back when the AAP raised the issue of salaries, then the councillors were suspended for 15 days. The North MCD called the house two times within a span of 15 days. AAP then moved the Delhi HC against the suspension order. Today, the Delhi HC rejected these two sessions and served notice to the MCD over the suspension orders.”North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash said salary up to the month of August had been released to domestic breeding checkers (DBC). Asking Pathak to “first clarify his facts” and then make allegations, he said. “The North Delhi Municipal Corporation will soon release outstanding salaries to DBC employees. The Delhi government wants to create an atmosphere of anarchy in Delhi by stopping funds due to the corporation.”Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the Kejriwal government owed crores of rupees to the three municipal corporations.“But the Kejriwal government will never discuss those dues due to which the economic condition of the MCDs is deteriorating. It is due to sheer political malice that the Delhi government has neither released the entire funds allocated to the MCDs and whatever is given, it is not given on time,” he said. “The result of all this is that the Delhi government had to release stalled funds of about Rs 18,000 crore by March 31, 2020, to all the three municipal corporations. Half of the current financial year 2020-21 had gone but even 25% of the total fund had not been released yet,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-spar-again-over-salaries-of-dengue-workers/story-8NEETiTNqVp4GmW5Y0TNcM.html
06-10-2020||Delhi||Focus on on-ground implementation, Epca tells Delhi govt||The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (Epca) on Monday said that the action plan launched by the Delhi government to combat winter pollution was welcome. The focus, however, needs to be on strict implementation of the proposed measures on the ground. Epca chief Bhure Lal said that any step to reduce pollution is welcome at a time when the city is also grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic. Both air pollution and the Covid infection affect the lungs, which could complicate the situation for those infected. Hence, extra effort was required to keep pollution levels from spiking this winter.The Epca is tasked by the Supreme Court with enforcing the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) that was formulated in 2017. Grap essentially entails measures to deal with different levels of pollution and usually comes into effect from October 15. It comprises measures such as sprinkling of water and mechanical sweeping of roads, ban on construction activities as well as on operation of diesel generator sets in Delhi-NCR, among others. “The state government’s action plan is welcome. Even with Grap, it is the states have to ensure the implementation. This year with the pandemic, extra vigil is required on part of government agencies. What is important is the enforcement on the ground — be it curbing dust pollution or taking action against industries using unapproved fuels. It has to be ensured that citizens are also roped in the drives so that they feel responsible and comply with green norms,” said Lal.He added that the Epca will meet representatives from the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan on Thursday to discuss implementation of Grap.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a mega campaign against pollution. The action plan involves 10 government agencies — including municipal corporations — that will work on reducing the sources of pollution. The CM said that a war room will be created to monitor the action on the ground. Besides, an app — Green Delhi — will be launched to address pollution-related complaints on a daily basis.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said that this year the state government must change its implementation strategy. “It is good that a plan is being discussed. It shows the government’s intent and seriousness on tackling the issue. The new steps, such as the creation of a war room and launching of a citizen app, will be successful only if it’s linked with implementation on the ground, which has been lacking in several sectors over the past years,” she said. The government this year also plans to launch site-specific action plans to contain pollution at the city’s 13 major hotspots. In Delhi, 13 areas — Okhla phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri—were identified as hotspots by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last year based on particulate matter (PM) concentrations. Pollution levels in these areas were found to be higher than the city’s average.In an inspection of the hotspots carried out by the EPCA last month, it was found that dumping and burning of waste as well as dust pollution at several sites were rampant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/focus-on-on-ground-implementation-epca-tells-delhi-govt/story-AVzAiyLYZox6WpSncLH3xL.html
06-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi to begin production of stubble decomposing solution today||Beginning Tuesday, Delhi is set to start large-scale preparation of a biochemical solution, a new technology that decomposes crop stubble so that it doesn’t need to be burnt. It could prove to be a solution for farmers who otherwise end up burning paddy stubble and causing air pollution during the winter. The solution will be ready within 3-4 days and the first set of trials could be expected over the weekend, said government officials.As per Delhi government, at least 800 hectares of farmland in Delhi’s is under cultivation where crop stubble is burnt every year. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday while launching a mega campaign against pollution said that a centralised system to produce anti-stubble burning bio-chemicals has been set up at Najafgarh’s Kharkhari Nahar village, under the supervision of scientists from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, Delhi. The plant will become operational on Tuesday and will be inspected by the CM.“Production of chemicals will start from October 6 at 400 different camps here under the supervision of IARI scientists, who have developed the technology. Within a few days of starting production, the first round of chemicals will be ready. Based on the demand, we will spray the chemical through tractors at the farm fields,” said Kejriwal during a press conference.If the experiment is successful this year, the CM said, he will request neighbouring states like Haryana and Punjab to also adopt this strategy. Air pollution in Delhi spikes every winter, starting October when calmer winds and stagnant weather conditions do not allow dispersion of pollutants. This, coupled with stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, contributes to up to 40% of pollutants according to government data.Also Read | Farm fires growing in Punjab, plumes of smoke seen over Delhi in satellite imagesLast week Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had said that once the solution is sprayed over the stubble, it will take at least 15 days for it to decompose and convert into manure after which farmers can treat the fields with it. An IARI scientist, who did not wish to be named, said that the solution decomposes into fertiliser over 20 days of being sprayed and can be used by farmers in the fields.However, farmers in the city said that the government has so far not started any awareness campaign about the new technology. Many of them also raised concerns over the long window of the chemical decomposing into manure, which may delay sowing. The window between the harvest of paddy and sowing of rabi crop is just about a week, the farmers said.“I have a 35-acre farm where I grow both paddy and rabi crops. The varieties grown in Delhi are harvested around the second week of November, after which there is just one week left for us to sow rabi crop. If we use the solution, it will delay the sowing while the long gap will also take away the moisture from the field. I don’t know how feasible this technology will be,” said Sukhbir Dagar, a farmer from Delhi’s Dhansa village.Also Read | EPCA writes to Punjab and Haryana to act against stubble burningAccording to Bhupender Bazad, member, Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, approximately 1 lakh acre farmland is under cultivation in Delhi. At least 165 of the total 360 villages in the city still practise farming. “The government should have started an awareness campaign by now to make farmers familiar with the benefits of the technology. There is just about 10% stubble that is burnt every winter in Delhi. It is an experiment that we are yet to see. If it’s beneficial for the crops and the fields, we will support the initiative,” said Bazad.Rai had earlier said that last year there was zero stubble burning inside Delhi. But in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Western UP, massive stubble burning took place which contributed to 45% of overall pollution levels in Delhi. He also said that district officials will reach out to farmers to help them fill up forms to apply for the chemical to be sprayed in their fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-to-begin-production-of-stubble-decomposing-solution-today/story-YniaGlcHsJuo9sy7MNKzYL.html

In the first incident, a 78-year-old woman, a resident of an independent house in Karvenagar, was robbed of her gold necklace by two men travelling on a motorbike. The necklace is estimated to be worth Rs 63,000. The woman was opening the main gate of her house around 7:30pm on Sunday when the two men arrived on a bike, yanked at the necklace and fled. A case under Sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Alankar police station against the two. In another incident which happened 24 hours before the first one, a bag with Rs 11,700 cash was stolen from a senior citizen after throwing chilli powder in his eyes by four men travelling on two-motorbikes. The complainant was identified as Sabjan Bhojani (62), a resident of Meet Rivera society located near Max Mueller Bhawan, Pune. The incident happened at 7:30pm on Saturday when the man was returning home from work. “He has a vegetable stall in Market Yard.

06-10-2020||Pune||Former BJP MLA among others held for ransacking PMC office||Though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is ruling in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the party’s former MLA Yogesh Tilekar and some elected members staged agitation at Swargate water depot and ransacked the office. Police arrested Tilekar and his supporters after PMC filed a complaint. The police complaint filed by PMC water department engineer Aashish Jadhav states, “Tilekar called me when I was in office and wanted to discuss the water issue in Katraj area. As he was accompanied by many supporters, I requested them to talk on the water issue in the presence of three or four persons because of the Covid situation. They started shouting slogans and staged agitation at Swargate water station office and threw files from my table before breaking windows, throw chairs and damaging cupboard and office furniture. Later, they forcefully brought me in front of agitators and felicitated me and junior engineer Rahul Sorte and shouted slogans against PMC administration.” Police arrested Tilekar and other protestors for obstructing government work in the evening. The incident happened at 12.30 on Monday afternoon.” Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “I am aware about the agitation at Swargate water station, but will be able to comment only after knowing the details.” Former mayor and Nationalist Congress Party leader Datta Dhankawade who also represents Katraj area said, “The incident shows the party in poor light.

06-10-2020||Delhi||Schools in Delhi to stay shut till end of October, says Manish Sisodia||All schools in the national capital will remain closed for the rest of the month, the Delhi government said on Sunday, days after the Centre’s guidelines to ease nationwide restrictions necessitated by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic announced that states and Union territories were free to open such educational facilities in a graded manner beginning October 15.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said that while all schools – both government and private – will remain closed till October 31, online classes will continue as usual, with teachers being told to mandatorily educate schoolchildren on mask etiquette and hand hygiene at the beginning of every session.Educational institutes have remained closed since March this year, when a nationwide lockdown was put in place to control the spread of the infectious disease that has infected millions across the globe and claimed more than one million lives so far.More than six months after the Centre imposed the hard lockdown, the Union home ministry on Wednesday moved closer to unlocking almost all activities by allowing a graded restart of schools, partial reopening of movie theatres, and large gatherings.The home ministry’s guidelines on unlocking activity said that the decision for opening schools and coaching institutions in a graded manner could be taken by the states/UT after October 15 “in consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation”. However, if students preferred to attend online classes, they would be permitted to do so. The guidelines said attendance must not be enforced, and must depend entirely on parental consent. Following the announcement, officials of the Delhi government’s education department held meetings to discuss the rules issued by the Centre.The previous order of the Delhi government on the status of physical classes at schools, issued on September 18, said the institutes would remain closed till October 5.“All schools in Delhi will remain closed till October 31 due to Covid. Chief minister @ArvindKejriwal has said that as a parent, he understands the seriousness of the situation. At this time it will not be appropriate to take any risk regarding the health of children (sic),” Sisodia tweeted in Hindi on Sunday.Following Sisodia’s instructions, the directorate of education issued an order which also said: “...Online classes and teaching learning activities will continue as usual and heads of schools are authorised to call teachers/staff (as per requirement) for smooth conduct of online classes, teaching learning activities and any other work.”Teachers were also asked to educate students on wearing masks, following physical distancing, and maintaining hand hygiene before beginning online classes. “Teachers to motivate students to convey the message to parents and relatives, Banners/Posters should also be displayed in the school premises to promote the awareness campaign in this regard,” read the order signed by Saroj Sain, additional director (school).The decision to keep schools shut comes after an assessment of the Covid-19 situation in the Capital. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, the city reported 3,037, 2,920 and 2,258 cases, respectively. Overall, Delhi has reported 290,613 cases and 5,510 deaths due to the virus till Sunday.Some school administrators, however, expressed apprehensions over how the fresh order will affect the academic prospects of students.Sarita Batra, principal of a government school in Shalimar Bagh, said: “This will affect the academic calendar and the students. But the life of children is more important. We are hoping that the Central Board of Secondary Education reduces the syllabus further since the closure of schools is being extended.” In July, the board revised the curriculum for students of classes 9 to 12 and rationalised 30% syllabus to reduce the course load for students.Madhulika Sen, Education Advisor at Tagore International Schools, said that while the health of children was of paramount importance, not reopening schools could also take a toll on their emotional and mental well-being.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales, Pusa Road, pointed out that the closure of schools till October-end would not make much of a difference. “Schools were already slated to remain closed till October 15 followed by the Dussehra break between October 21 and 26. So, the closure of schools till October 31 doesn’t make much of a difference. We hope that there are fewer Covid-19 cases by November, giving parents confidence to send their children to school,” she said.Ashok Agarwal, national president of the All India Parents Association, said: “The extension of school closures is being done in instalments, giving rise to confusion and stress among parents and students. If the Covid-19 situation is the same till March next year, they will keep announcing such repeated extensions till then. CBSE had reduced 30% syllabus, but now the closure of schools has gone on for far too long. Why not assure parents and children that they won’t be failed in this academic year considering the unprecedented circumstances and announce a zero year,” said Agarwal.According to the Centre’s guidelines, for higher education, the ministry of education will decide on the timing of the opening of colleges based on the assessment of the situation. “However, higher education institutions only for research scholars (Ph.D) and post-graduate students in science and technology stream requiring laboratory/experimental works will be permitted to open from October 15,” the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/schools-in-delhi-to-stay-shut-till-end-of-october-says-manish-sisodia/story-Kir9RxSNwjHlUMTBi4OIzJ.html
06-10-2020||Noida||Rs 10 crore projects inaugurated in Noida||The Noida authority on Sunday started work on six projects estimated to cost Rs 10 crore. These include resurfacing roads and repairing drains and footpath in different sectors.Gautam Budh Nagar Member of Parliament Mahesh Sharma, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and the Noida authority general manager Rajiv Tyagi inaugurated these projects.“Resurfacing of roads, repair work of footpath, pavement and drains will benefit the general public. Residents have been demanding for these issues of road resurfacing and repair of drains addressed,” said Pankaj Singh MLA, Noida.The work include internal road resurfacing in sector 52 with a budget of Rs 2.4 crore, pavement repair in sector 22 with a budget of Rs 1 crore, drain repair in sector 22 to cost Rs 1 crore, internal road resurfacing in sector 70 with a budget of Rs 2.5 crore, plaster of the flats built by the authority in sector 66 on a budget Rs 1.7 crore and internal road resurfacing along with culvert with a budget of Rs 1 crore.The authority aims to finish these works in next two months.The authority decided to carry out these works after residents in all of these sectors demanded road resurfacing and other works to be done on priority basis.“We have started the work on these projects right after the inauguration so that the residents do not face any inconvenience in future. We aim to finish these works in next two months time. We will put these projects on fast-track,” said Tyagi.Residents of sector 70 said that broken internal roads were an issue in their locality.“We had demanded that the internal roads and other maintenance works should be looked into without further delay. And we are happy that the work will be completed in next two months,” said Manoj Goyal, a resident of sector 70.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/10-crore-projects-inaugurated-in-noida/story-ze20omMVY12QpX7VGFTzRO.html
06-10-2020||Delhi||For students, teachers, it is a choice between health or education||Delhi government’s Sunday announcement that schools in the city will stay shut till the end of October has triggered ripples of concern among teachers over the fallout the move may have on the prospects of students set to appear for their Class 10 and 12 board exams next year.Though most of school administrations said that rationalization of syllabus by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), which was announced in July, will help in mitigating the academic losses arising out of the Covid-19 lockdown, conducting practical lessons for students of class 10 and 12 is the challenge.Madhulika Sen, Education Advisor at Tagore International Schools, said, “While digital classes have helped in achieving desired learning outcomes, if schools aren’t reopened in November, science practical lessons will definitely be impacted. Our first priority will be to conduct practical classes for students of classes 10 and 12, as soon as schools reopen. We will also conduct doubt-clearing sessions for them since the syllabus will be covered in most schools by mid-November.”Sen also emphasized on the importance of maintaining mental well-being of these students. “Classrooms allow peer-based learning and interaction which these students have been missing out on since March. We hope that November onwards, small groups of students can come to schools while maintaining all safety norms,” she said.Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to Delhi government’s director (education), said, “We have decided on maintaining the status quo with regards to reopening of schools for all classes due to the current Covid-19 situation in the capital. Any decision regarding students of any class, including students those of classes 10 and 12, visiting schools will be taken only when parents are confident of sending their wards back to school.”Following the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown imposed in March, schools have been conducting online classes through video conferencing and WhatsApp to ensure the learning process continues for students. Teachers of Delhi government schools have also been sending worksheets to students who do not have unlimited access to internet or to devices like smartphones and laptops.Schools have also resorted to recording videos of teachers conducting experiments in science labs and sending it to students for some exposure. “While teachers have explained some of the practical experiments during online classes through videos, the lack of hands-on learning cannot be ignored. For instance, in the vocational subject of travel and tourism, students earlier went for industrial visits to various places like banks or post-offices and submitted reports. We haven’t been able to conduct such practicals so far,” said Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar.Sharma also recommended that children could be made aware of the necessity of safety and hygiene protocols during Covid-19 crisis and allowed to attend such practical lessons in smaller groups from November. On Sunday, the Directorate of Education, while announcing closure of schools till October 31, asked teachers to emphasize on educating students on wearing masks and maintaining hand hygiene before the start of every online session.Sharma also cautioned against asking for a further reduction of CBSE syllabus for class 10 and 12 students. “The 30% rationalization of syllabus has helped schools but any further reduction may affect their future prospects, as important topics may be skipped. If schools are closed in November as well, we have to look at other alternatives like increasing the number of online classes to cover the syllabus,” he said.The situation seems to be far more challenging for those government school students who cleared their class 9 and 11 exams only after retests in August and were promoted to classes 10 and 12 the same month. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector-8, said, “There is still fear among parents and teachers of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. So it is better to keep schools closed till October. However, students who recently cleared their retests and joined these classes have a tough road ahead as they have not attended any class 10 and 12 online classes before August. Though we have created smaller groups consisting of these students to do a targeted intervention by teachers, physical classes from November, after a discussion with parents and staff while following all safety protocols, would help more.”Students, on the other hand, said that the current situation has put them in a spot — where they need to choose either their health or their education.Kunal Singh, a class 12 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Nand Nagri said, “When schools in the USA reopened, students there started getting Covid-19. But, we are also concerned about underperforming during our practical board exams.”Several students like Kunal said that while the theoretical portion of their subjects was covered in their schools, they were yet to attend any practicals, even after six months of the academic session having begun. “Teachers are doing their best but online classes are not enough. If we are allowed to go to schools in November, I would like to go at least once and see how safety protocols are implemented and get my doubts cleared,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/for-students-teachers-it-is-a-choice-between-health-or-education/story-srX7ED2j7cKEF48LDPUxfI.html
06-10-2020||World||China’s unpopularity hits historic highs in many countries, says Pew Research poll||Unfavorable views of China have soared to historic highs in many countries in a new global poll by Pew Research Center, with the highest in Australia.A majority of those polled in each of the 14 advanced economies had negative views of China. But in nine of them, China’s unpopularity was at the highest Pew had recorded since it started tracking this subject more than a decade ago-- in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, Sweden and South Korea.A median of 73% of those polled in 14 countries (Belgium, Japan, Italy, Denmark and France in addition to the nine named above) had unfavorable views of China.Australians had soured the most, with 81%, going up by 24 points over 2019; the last year has seen a sharp deterioration in ties between the two countries. Negatives views of China went up by double digits in the last one year in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the US, South Korea and Spain.And China’s handling of the Coronavirus epidemic appeared to be central to its record unpopularity. A median of 61% of the respondents across all 14 countries polled said China had done a bad job dealing with the epidemic, worse in every case than their own country and global bodies such as WHO.China’s Covid-19 failure reflected in the way people in these countries perceived President Xi Jinping. A median of 78% had no confidence in Xi’s ability to do the right thing in world affairs’ seven-in-10 in every country.But Xi’s unpopularity was overtaken by President Donald Trump in some countries. While 78% of the Germans, for instance, had no faith in Xi, 80% said the same for Trump, who was more distrusted than Xi, Germany’s Angela Merkel, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Boris Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-unpopularity-hits-historic-highs-in-many-countries-says-pew-research-poll/story-mL4XR8iXIcZvZbYIgwXs0K.html

And so the allocation within the U.S., and between the U.S. and other countries will be a very top point of contention.”The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford University are two of the leading candidates in the race for the first jab to get regulatory approval in the West to prevent Covid-19.Gates added that in the United States people should be thinking about ways to reduce hesitancy about having a Covid-19 vaccine when one is ready. Asked about Russian and Chinese vaccines, he said the Western companies were further ahead on Phase III studies.“The one Russian construct and six of the Chinese constructs are perfectly valid constructs actually with some similarities to what the Western companies are doing, but the Western companies are further ahead on doing these phase three studies,” Gates said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-world-could-be-close-to-normal-by-late-2021-if-vaccine-works-bill-gates/story-FjByZHTNoblJv5c9PqrNGO.html

06-10-2020||World||Michelle Obama slams Donald Trump; calls him ‘racist’, ‘not up to the job’||Former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday launched a scathing attack at President Donald Trump, accusing him of being a “racist” and not being “up to the job” and urged fellow Americans to make informed and engaged choice in the presidential election to regain stability in the country.Pitching for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, she made an impassioned plea through a 24-minute video, saying that the country is in chaos and the voters should know what is at stake.Titled ‘Closing Argument’, the video was released on social media platforms and also by the Biden campaign.“Believe it or not, the election is right around the corner. Votes are already being cast. And if you’re still deciding who to vote for, or whether to vote at all, I wanted to take a moment to remind you what’s at stake and to urge you to make a plan to vote today. Because let’s be honest right now, our country is in chaos because of a president who isn’t up to the job,” she said in the video.While the presidential elections are scheduled for November 3, early-voting and mail-in-voting has already started in states across the country.Alleging that the president, already hit by the coronavirus, continues to “gaslight the American people by acting like this pandemic is not a real threat,” Michelle said, “so what the president is doing is once again, patently false. It’s morally wrong, and yes, it is racist. But that doesn’t mean it won’t work because this is a difficult time, a confusing time. And when people hear these lies and crazy conspiracies repeated over and over and over again, they don’t know what to think with everything going on in their lives.” She said that to regain any kind of stability, “we’ve got to ensure that every eligible voter is informed and engaged in the selection. Because the stakes are on display every day, not just in the headlines, but in our families.” “If you are a parent like me, you’re feeling the consequences of this president’s failure to take this pandemic seriously from his constant downplaying of the importance of mask and social distancing to his relentless pressure on schools to open with offering a clean plan or meaningful support to keep students and teachers safe,” she said.Trump returned to the White House on Monday night after spending four days at a military hospital where he was treated for coronavirus.Urging people to vote for Biden, the former first lady said that Americans have the chance to elect a president who can meet this moment, a leader who has the character and the experience to put an end to this chaos, start solving these problems and help lighten the load for families all across the country.“The one thing this president is really, really good at is using fear and confusion and spreading lies to win,” she alleged.Former president Barack Obama and Michelle have not campaigned much in person this election season. But they have been issuing videos in support of Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris. Obama has also attended a number of fundraisers for Biden and Harris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michelle-obama-slams-donald-trump-calls-him-racist-not-up-to-the-job/story-1PVXdRRx4jgghhyksHIxhI.html

Trump, who returned late on Monday after nearly four days at Walter Reed Medical Center outside Washington, was due to receive a fifth transfusion of the antiviral drug remdesivir while being treated with the steroid dexamethasone, normally used only in the most severe cases.The Republican president, who is running against Democrat Joe Biden in an election four weeks away, has repeatedly played down the disease, which has killed more than 1 million people worldwide. The United States has the world’s highest death toll from the pandemic, with more than 209,000 deaths.“Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. About 22,000 people are estimated to die from influenza in the 2019-2020 season, according to U.S. government statistics. Even before he contracted Covid-19, Trump acknowledged in taped conversations with a journalist that the disease was deadlier than the flu. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley has also stressed Trump would have world-class medical care available around the clock, something many health experts have noted is unavailable to millions of other Americans.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a video after his return on Monday night.“I’m better, and maybe I’m immune - I don’t know,” he added, flanked by American flags and with the Washington Monument in the background. “Get out there. Be careful.” He returned to the White House in a made-for-television spectacle, descending from his Marine One helicopter wearing a white surgical mask, only to remove it as he posed, saluting and waving, on the mansion’s South Portico.Trump has repeatedly flouted social-distancing guidelines meant to curb the virus’ spread and ignored his own medical advisers. He mocked Biden at last Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing a mask when campaigning.“I was aghast when he said Covid should not be feared,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.“This is a disease that is killing around a thousand people a day, has torpedoed the economy, put people out of work. This is a virus that should be both respected and feared.”Democrats also weighed in. “This is a tragic failure of leadership,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons tweeted.But Trump depicted himself as a man who vanquished the disease and emerged stronger.“If the President bounces back onto the campaign trail, he will be an invincible hero, who not only survived every dirty trick the Democrats threw at him, but the Chinese virus as well,” he wrote on Twitter.A Twitter post by Biden showed images of himself donning a mask and Trump removing his. “Masks Matter. They save lives,” the caption read.White House spokesman Judd Deere said every precaution was being taken to protect the president and his family. Physical access to Trump would be limited and appropriate protective equipment would be worn by those near him. Questions swirled around the true state of Trump’s health after a weekend when his doctors offered contradictory or opaque assessments of his condition.His oxygen saturation dipped enough to require supplemental oxygen on Friday and Saturday, his doctors said, but have not answered key questions about his lung function, his blood work, or when he lasted tested negative. SETBACK POSSIBLEMany aides and confidants have been diagnosed with the disease since his announcement last week that he had tested positive for it, intensifying scrutiny and criticism of the administration’s handling of the pandemic. Trump had no public events listed for Tuesday and it was unclear when he would be able to resume a full schedule.“I’m sure he’ll rest the next two days. And he’ll get going as soon as they say it’s OK to get going,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday, adding that Trump would still do light work like making phone calls.“You never know with this disease, but it seems like he is making a very rapid recovery and a strong one. And certainly his spirit is back. He’s raring to go,” Giuliani said. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who also tested positive for Covid-19 after a Sept. 26 White House visit, said on Twitter that Trump called him Monday night and said he was “feeling great and working hard.”After recent opinion polls showed Trump slipping further behind Biden, early voting data indicated that nearly 4 million Americans have already cast ballots four week before election day, suggesting there may be a record turnout.The severity of Trump’s illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a high risk category.#GaspingForAir began trending on Twitter after video showed Trump appearing to take several deep breaths while standing on the White House balcony.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Trump looked good when he came out of the hospital, but noted that patients sometimes have a setback five days after they get sick.“Sometimes when you’re five days in you’re going to have a reversal ... It’s unlikely that it will happen, but they need to be heads-up (alert) for it,” Fauci said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-critics-donald-trump-says-americans-are-learning-to-live-with-covid-19/story-LqNfjOsgOnic99grqLYRII.html

It commemorates the slaughter of six million Jews by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime.The visit by Sheikh Abdullah to the Holocaust Memorial is a highly symbolic step, marking the shift in attitudes in the Arab world towards Israel and Jews.Political conflicts have led to fierce tensions between Islam and Judaism and Holocaust denial is rampant in many Arab countries.Maas called it “a great honour that the Israeli and Emirati foreign ministers picked Berlin as the site for their historic first meeting.“The most important currency in diplomacy is trust and I am personally thankful to both my colleagues that they are placing this trust in Germany.”Bahrain and the UAE became the first Arab nations to establish relations with Israel since Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.For the Mideast, the deals dubbed the Abraham Accords mark a distinct shift in a decades-old status quo where Arab countries have tried to maintain unity against Israel over its treatment of the stateless Palestinians.Maas called the agreement between Israel and the UAE as the “first good news in the Middle East for a long time -- and a chance for new movement in the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians”.“This opportunity must be seized,” he said, voicing the readiness of the European Union to help.hmn/dlc/pma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-uae-ministers-visit-holocaust-memorial-during-historic-meet/story-7cW7WMCQYeC2N3RWHHar1L.html
06-10-2020||World||Joe Biden regrets calling Donald Trump a ‘clown’ during debate||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that he regrets calling President Donald Trump a “clown” during the first presidential debate, which was marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations.“I should have said, this is a clownish undertaking, instead of calling him a clown,” Biden said in response to a question at a town hall organised by NBC News in Miami, Florida.During the first of the three presidential debates in Cleveland last week, Biden termed Trump a “liar” and a “clown” as the two candidates fiercely clashed over a number of issues, including racism, economy and climate. “It was an ugly debate. And it hit some lows. You called him a clown, a fool. You told him to shut up. I think most people believe that the president was interrupting you. But it seemed to go against some of the language you have said about not being divisive. Do you regret any on your part?” Biden was asked Monday night in Miami.“It did,” Biden responded. “I was trying to figure out how I could possibly have him respect the debate, respect the evening, respect the moderator, and get us an opportunity to speak. The one thing that became absolutely clear, he didn’t want to answer any questions. He did not want to talk about substance,” Biden said explaining the reasons for using the word clown for Trump.“If you notice, not one single time that I can recall did he offer a substantive answer or criticism related to a policy matter. It was all invective. It was all personal. It was all things that had nothing to do with whether you’re going to change these people’s lives for the better. And I did get very frustrated,” Biden said, adding that he used the word out of frustration.“But the fact is,… I will be very honest with you. I think it was embarrassing for the nation to see the president of the United States just hectoring like he did, and everything was about a personal attack,” Biden said. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off two more presidential debates later this month.Top Republican leaders had slammed Biden for calling Trump a clown. “The real concern I had -- when you watched Joe Biden -- I mean, just the way he handled - to refer to, shut up man and clown. He was more concerned about cheap shots than even talking about the concerns we have with China, with the virus, with really putting the business and the economy back on track,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox Business in an interview. Biden said during the Miami townhall that “it was just very difficult.” “I didn’t want to further demean the process of the debate by getting in a shouting match with him, on the one hand. And I tried very hard, if you noticed, to look in the camera and answer the questions directly, but they kept getting banged,” he said.“I hope this next meeting we’re going to have, it’s called a debate, but a town meeting we’re going to have supposedly coming up, but I hope we at least have an opportunity to hear the question and answer the question directly, before there’s an interruption. But, as I said to the president, not here, not tonight, not me. I’m not putting up with it,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-regrets-calling-donald-trump-a-clown-during-debate/story-BRlsXV7cnibmJ5JxEJqEzH.html

She calls on Black and all young voters not to “waste” their votes.In the video, released Tuesday by Joe Biden’s campaign, Mrs. Obama notes that more Americans have died from Covid-19 than died in the Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korean wars combined. She charges that with respect to the virus, “our commander in chief, sadly, has been missing in action.”Mrs. Obama accuses Trump of being “racist” when he and other Republicans are “lying about how minorities will destroy the suburbs,” which she says is meant to “distract from his breathtaking failures.”She also calls on undecided voters “to think about all those folks like me and my ancestors” and have some empathy for what it’s like “to walk around your own country scared that someone’s unjustified fear of you could put you in harm’s way.”And to Black and brown voters, and all young voters, who are considering sitting out the election, Mrs. Obama urges them to make a plan to vote, because “we don’t have the luxury to assume that things are going to turn out okay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michelle-obama-accuses-donald-trump-of-willful-mismanagement-of-covid-19-crisis/story-n4DkcmlYL91QFlk8m3vfQN.html

Let’s see what happens.”The case was registered on Monday by the Lahore police against Nawaz Sharif and members of his PML-N party including his daughter Maryam Nawaz, former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, and three retired generals of the Pakistan Army. Late on Monday, the Lahore Capital City Police issued a press release saying, “various speculations were being made in the media regarding the case”. “In fact, the case was registered on the request of a citizen, Badar Rasheed, on which Shahdara police registered a case under the applicate section of the law,” it said.The FIR against Nawaz Sharif came a day after his son-in-law Muhammad Safdar was booked under sedition charges for “provoking the people against the state and its institutions.” The FIR against Sharif alleged that the former premier had conspired against Pakistan’s prestigious institutions by making provocative speeches while being in London. The complainant claimed that in speeches made on September 20 and October 1, Sharif supported the policies of India so that Pakistan would continue to remain on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) ‘grey list’ over non-compliance on terror financing and money laundering.The complainant said that the main purpose of Nawaz’s speeches was to isolate Pakistan in front of the international community and to declare it a rogue state. He added that Nawaz was trying to turn the people against the democratically elected government.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-govt-tries-to-distance-itself-from-sedition-case-against-nawaz-sharif/story-EHjYIoWQ5viZ5CKaJkomFO.html

The firm’s apparel and footwear arms are also listed to be worth more than $50 million each. Last year, Bank of America Corp. valued just the sneaker side of Yeezy at as much as $3 billion, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg.The value of his stakes in Adidas AG and Nike Inc. are worth as much as $50 million and $25 million, respectively, the filing shows. West also lists liabilities of up to $100 million, the bulk of which are made up of various mortgages.West announced his run for president via Twitter in July, though he hasn’t secured a spot on the ballot in many states. He has qualified to appear in at least 12 states, including Mississippi and Vermont. West’s platform calls for a culture of life, restoration of faith and police reform. Democrats have accused Republicans of helping the campaign to act as a spoiler to siphon votes from Joe Biden.At the same time as his run, West has also been vocal about getting a board seat at the companies that have increasingly staked their brands on partnerships with him.“I don’t have a board seat at Gap, I don’t have a board seat at Adidas,” West posted on Twitter last month. “Black board seats matter.”Earlier this year, his personal accountant, David Choi, provided an unaudited balance sheet that pegs the rapper’s net worth at $3.15 billion, with the bulk of his fortune tied to Bank of America’s Yeezy valuation, which was done before the pandemic shook up the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kanye-west-reports-financials-in-filing-for-presidential-run/story-AoodKE86OF1tVa60GJdCLK.html
06-10-2020||World||Second deadline for India to appoint counsel for Kulbhushan Jadhav expires||The second deadline for India to appoint a legal representative for Indian death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav expired on Tuesday, with sources in legal circles saying the Islamabad High Court (IHC) itself may now appoint a counsel after two senior Pakistani lawyers excused themselves.Lawyers Abid Hassan Manto and Makhdoom Ali Khan excused from appearing for Jadhav, citing medical and professional grounds, respectively. IHC had heard the case for the second time on September 3 and directed the federal government to give India “another opportunity” to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. Attorney general for Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan informed the IHC’s larger bench that Pakistan government had not yet received a reply from India on the matter till date.Jadhav has maintained that he does not want to take the benefit of the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, 2020, for an effective review of the case and requested that his mercy plea, already pending before the Pakistan Army chief, be considered instead. The Pakistan parliament in September had extended by four months the ordinance, which allowed Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in the IHC against his conviction, as required by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ordinance was set to expire on September 17. Prior to this, the Pakistan government had approached the IHC to appoint a defence lawyer to represent Jadhav.Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016, in Balochistan on charges of alleged espionage, and sentenced to death by a military court the following year.In August, the IHC formed a three-member larger bench at the government’s request to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav for his appeal against the death penalty.Last month, Pakistan rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial. Queen’s Counsel is a barrister or advocate, appointed Counsel to the UK Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor.“We have repeatedly told them that only those lawyers can represent Commander Jadhav in the Court who have the license to practice law in Pakistan. This is in accordance with legal practice in other jurisdictions as well,” Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri had said at the time. He further said that the Indian Supreme Court, in one of its judgments, had ruled that foreign lawyers cannot practice law within the country.India maintains that Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit. “It has not yet addressed the core issues, which include provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said last month. In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a “farcical” approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-deadline-for-india-to-appoint-counsel-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-expires/story-SYWZJiXyh3HFaVDvNEKcPJ.html

We are scared for our future and my daughter’s future,” said Kabul resident Katayoun Ahmadi, a 26-year-old mother.She recalled seeing severed hands and fingers on Kabul’s streets following amputations for petty crimes under the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Sharia law.The 2001 invasion heralded some enduring improvements for young Afghans -- particularly girls -- and ushered in a constitution guaranteeing certain freedoms including the right to an education.But so far in peace talks in Doha, which started last month, the Taliban have said little about issues such as women’s rights or freedom of expression.- ‘Afghan-owned’ deal -Ahmadi’s husband Farzad Farnood, 35, a researcher for the Afghanistan Institute for Strategic Studies, said a rise in Taliban violence since a deal was signed between the hardline group and Washington shows the militants have not changed. “Is this creating hope for Afghans? No, it is not,” he said. As a teenager, he witnessed the Taliban stoning a woman to death and public executions and floggings in Kabul’s football stadium. His family had to hide their black-and-white television’s antenna in a tree when the Taliban banned music and entertainment.“All the achievements we have made in the last 18 years did not exist in the Taliban era,” he said.In a statement released Tuesday, the Taliban claimed the US “arrogantly rejected” their appeals for diplomacy in 2001, instead launching a “brutal invasion”.“America, its allies and coalitions would have... been spared from infamy and war crimes along with great human and material losses,” they said, adding they welcomed an opportunity to usher in a “sovereign Islamic government”.Zia-ul-Rahman, a former insurgent who battled foreign troops and Afghan government forces for four years, told AFP the Taliban were pushing for “the establishment of an Islamic system”, even though the country’s constitution already gives primacy to the religion.“We have no problem with girls getting an education or women working, but they have to wear a hijab,” he added.US involvement in Afghanistan has proven painfully difficult for the superpower, draining more than $1 trillion from its coffers and resulting in about 2,400 troop deaths in a war the Pentagon has characterised as a stalemate.In Doha, the Taliban and the Afghan government are struggling to agree common language on a range of issues before they can even establish an agenda, in talks that could continue for years.Some US lawmakers have said they would oppose any deal that fails to protect women and minorities, but President Donald Trump’s administration has stressed it wants little to do with the outcome which he said will be “Afghan-owned”.Jawed Rahmani, a 38-year-old security worker in Kabul, said US disengagement would inevitably lead to a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.“These are not peace talks but a deal to hand over the next government to the Taliban,” he said.“People are happier with whatever we have right now, compared to the darkest era of the Taliban.” mam-wat/ecl/wat/mtp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troop-withdrawal-deal-two-decades-later-afghans-fear-resurrection-of-the-taliban/story-XANdaJKbUl6PwBpGJAPbfI.html
06-10-2020||World||Covid-19 downturn not as bad as feared; crisis not over: IMF chief||Amid a flood of government spending, the global downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic will not be as bad as originally feared, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said Tuesday, but she warned that the crisis is far from over.“The picture today is less dire ... allowing for a small upward revision to our global forecast for 2020,” she said in a speech ahead of IMF-World Bank autumn meetings next week, when the IMF is due to present its updated forecasts.In June, the Washington-based crisis lender projected a nearly five percent contraction of global GDP, but results in the second and third quarters were better than expected.Georgieva credited the “extraordinary policy measures that put a floor under the world economy” which amounted to $12 trillion in fiscal support to households and firms.But she warned governments not to prematurely withdraw the help they have provided, since the outlook for next year is mixed and rife with uncertainties and risks.After more than a million deaths, “this calamity is far from over. All countries are now facing what I would call ‘The Long Ascent’ -- a difficult climb that will be long, uneven, and uncertain,” Georgieva said. In the United States and Europe the downturn, though painful, was not as bad as economists feared at the outset, and China is seeing “a faster-than-expected recovery.” But the news elsewhere is bad: “In low-income countries, the shocks are so profound that we face the risk of a ‘lost generation,’“ she said.“There is also now the risk of severe economic scarring from job losses, bankruptcies, and the disruption of education.”Low-income countries have not had the resources to spend as much to support jobs and businesses, and also will need help to deal with their debt burden, including through more grants and debt restructuring.She likened the crisis to World War II when leaders “forged a better world in the worst possible moment,” and called for governments to continue support for workers as long as it is needed, while spending to create a better, more equitable, economic system.“Where the pandemic persists, it is critical to maintain lifelines across the economy, to firms and workers,” she said. “Cut the lifelines too soon, and the Long Ascent becomes a precipitous fall.”But, Georgieva said, “We cannot afford simply to rebuild the old economy, with its low growth, low productivity, high inequality, and worsening climate crisis,” and she called for more spending on green jobs which can generate more employment.“This will require both stimuli for job creation, especially in green investment, and cushioning the impact on workers,” she said. “Safeguarding social spending will be critical for a just transition to new jobs.”She referred to an IMF report released Monday showing that increasing spending by just one percent of GDP could create 33 million new jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-downturn-not-as-bad-as-feared-crisis-not-over-imf-chief/story-Jjcsj3MiSlHXcoEPSV0P0I.html
06-10-2020||World||Donald Trump faces backlash for removing mask on return to White House||US President Donald Trump faced a backlash on Tuesday for removing his mask when he returned to the White House and urging Americans not to fear the Covid-19 disease that has killed more than 209,000 people in the country and put him in hospital.Trump arrived at the White House on Monday in a made-for-television spectacle in which he descended from his Marine One helicopter wearing a white surgical mask, only to remove it as he posed, saluting and waving, on the mansion’s South Portico.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a video after his return from the Walter Reed Medical Center military hospital outside Washington where he was admitted on Friday for the disease caused by the coronavirus.“I’m better, and maybe I’m immune - I don’t know,” he added, flanked by American flags and with the Washington Monument in the background. “Get out there. Be careful.”Trump, who received experimental treatment, has repeatedly played down the disease, which has killed more than 1 million people worldwide. The United States has the world’s highest death toll from the pandemic.White House physician Dr. Sean. P. Conley, stressed that the Republican president, who is running for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, would have world-class medical care available around the clock.Trump has repeatedly flouted social-distancing guidelines meant to curb the virus’ spread and ignored his own medical advisers. He mocked Biden at last Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing a mask when campaigning.“I was aghast when he said Covid should not be feared,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.“This is a disease that is killing around a thousand people a day, has torpedoed the economy, put people out of work. This is a virus that should be both respected and feared.”Democrats also weighed in. “This is a tragic failure of leadership,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons tweeted.But Trump depicted himself as a man who vanquished the disease and emerged stronger.“If the President bounces back onto the campaign trail, he will be an invincible hero, who not only survived every dirty trick the Democrats threw at him, but the Chinese virus as well,” he wrote on Twitter.A Twitter post by Biden showed images of himself donning a mask and Trump removing his. “Masks Matter. They save lives,” the caption read.White House spokesman Judd Deere said every precaution was being taken to protect the president and his family. Physical access to Trump would be limited and appropriate protective equipment would be worn by those near him.Questions continue to swirl about the true state of Trump’s health after a weekend in which his doctors offered contradictory or opaque assessments of his condition.His oxygen saturation dipped enough to require supplemental oxygen on Friday and Saturday and he will receive his last intravenous dose of the antiviral drug, remdesivir, at the White House on Tuesday, his doctors said.Trump was tweeting early on Tuesday.SETBACK POSSIBLEMany aides and confidants have been diagnosed with the disease since his announcement last week that he had tested positive for it, intensifying scrutiny and criticism of the administration’s handling of the pandemic.Trump has no public events listed for Tuesday and it is not clear when he will be able to resume a full schedule.“I’m sure he’ll rest the next two days. And he’ll get going as soon as they say it’s OK to get going,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday, adding that Trump would still do light work like making phone calls.“You never know with this disease, but it seems like he is making a very rapid recovery and a strong one. And certainly his spirit is back. He’s raring to go,” Giuliani said.Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who also tested positive for Covid-19 after a Sept. 26 White House visit, said on Twitter that Trump called him Monday night and said he was “feeling great and working hard.”After recent polls showed Trump slipping further behind Biden, early voting data indicated that nearly 4 million Americans have already cast ballots four week before election day, suggesting there may be a record turnout.The severity of Trump’s illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a high risk category.#GaspingForAir began trending on Twitter after video showed Trump appearing to take several deep breaths while standing on the White House balcony.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Trump looked good when he came out of the hospital, but noted that patients sometimes have a setback five days after they get sick.“Sometimes when you’re five days in you’re going to have a reversal ... It’s unlikely that it will happen, but they need to be heads-up (alert) for it,” Fauci said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-backlash-for-removing-mask-on-return-to-white-house/story-Xiu3RSneDdfgPUHauBVfIO.html
06-10-2020||World||At QUAD meet, Pompeo discusses China’s ‘malign activity’ with Australian counterpart||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Tuesday of Beijing’s “malign activity in the region” as he met with key Asia-Pacific allies in Tokyo, presenting a united front against an increasingly assertive China.The top US diplomat is meeting his Japanese, Australian and Indian counterparts on a trip that was scaled back after President Donald Trump and a raft of staff and advisors contracted coronavirus.His first meeting was with Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, in which they “discussed their shared concerns regarding the People’s Republic of China’s malign activity in the region,” a US State Department official said.The talks in Tokyo come with the United States, Australia and India all at loggerheads with Beijing -- leaving Japan in the delicate position of standing alongside its allies while attempting to preserve gradually improving ties with China.Pompeo is the first senior US official to visit Japan since Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga took office last month, and he said he was confident Tokyo and Washington were on the same page.“In his first statement after assuming office, Prime Minister Suga described the free and open Indo-Pacific as ‘the foundation of regional peace and stability’. I could not agree more,” he said at the start of talks with his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi.Speaking later, Suga said the spread of the coronavirus had shown “exactly why right now is the time that we must further deepen coordination with as many countries as possible that share our vision and build our efforts to enhance cooperation.”Pompeo is a vociferous critic of China on issues from security to human rights to the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump’s administration has sought to blame squarely on Beijing ahead of the US election on November 3.He has led an international campaign for other nations to shun China, including its technology.‘Closed, exclusive cliques’But Japan has insisted the talks are not directed at any one country, and the foreign ministry offered a broad summary of bilateral talks, saying they touched on “the situation in the East China Sea, the South China Sea and North Korea”.Despite Pompeo’s promise of “significant announcements”, no joint statement or press conference is expected after the four-way talks later Tuesday.The “Quad” grouping was heavily promoted by Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe as a way for the region’s major democracies to step up cooperation in the face of military and other threats posed by China.Suga told reporters on Monday he would seek to “promote a free and open Indo-Pacific” but also “build stable relations with neighbouring countries including China and Russia”.Beijing has made no secret of its view on the Quad grouping, with the foreign ministry last week urging countries to avoid “closed and exclusive ‘cliques’“.“We hope the relevant countries can proceed from the common interests of countries in the region, and do more things that are conducive to regional peace, stability and development, not the other way around,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said.The first Quad meeting took place in New York last year, and there are moves to make the gathering an annual event.Pompeo heads back to Washington in the late evening. Planned stops in South Korea and Mongolia have been scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-quad-meet-pompeo-discusses-china-s-malign-activity-with-australian-counterpart/story-7KR18vXSfeX5d0vVXpBNtK.html

We can’t now define the mission of this country as merely to restore normality.

Some local politicians have been jailed there for corruption.After he was arrested, McAfee’s official Instagram account posted a “Free McAfee” message with a photo of him. The person running the account did not return a message seeking comment.No other representatives were immediately contactable. U.S. federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment on Monday against McAfee over charges that he evaded taxes and wilfully failed to file returns.That came shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed it had brought civil charges against McAfee, alleging he made over $23.1 million in undisclosed compensation from false and misleading cryptocurrency recommendations. He is alleged to have earned millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, as well as through consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-virus-software-creator-john-mcafee-jailed-in-spain-reports/story-fSeiidiKnWST1SnUZAmZDO.html
06-10-2020||World||Germany’s Covid-19 cases rise the most since mid-April||Germany’s new coronavirus cases increased at the highest pace since mid-April, the latest sign of Europe’s struggle to keep the pandemic under control.The country registered 3,100 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, taking the total to 304,673, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That’s the highest daily increase since April 18, but still well below peak levels of almost 7,000.There were 21 new fatalities, lifting the overall number of deaths to 9,554German cases have ticked up since August, similar to trends across the region. Initially, returning vacationers sparked increased infections, but now family and work gatherings are fuelling flare-ups.Officials have warned that containment measures will continue to affect daily life into next year, even if a vaccine becomes available. Health Minister Jens Spahn bemoaned the lack of adherence to existing rules, especially in Berlin where images circulated over the weekend of people mingling without face masks.The country’s reproduction factor -- the average number of people infected by one person with the virus -- inched lower to 1.21 on Monday from 1.23 the day before, according to the latest estimate from the country’s RKI public health institute. A reading above 1.0 indicates that the disease is spreading.The president of the German institute responsible for vaccines said Tuesday he is hopeful that several will be available in early 2021 to help stem the pandemic.“But we have to remember that initially there will only be a limited amount” and distribution will have to be prioritized, Klaus Cichutek, head of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, said in an interview with ZDF television. “And we mustn’t forget that there will also be certain logistical problems” such as having to transport and store vaccines at extremely low temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-s-covid-19-cases-rise-the-most-since-mid-april/story-uh3mVfXxv3WcZzvFk8ewjN.html
06-10-2020||World||New testing method can diagnose Covid-19 in just 30 minutes, study finds||Scientists have developed a new method that allows anyone to easily and quickly detect Covid-19 in just 30 minutes, and is as accurate as the current PCR diagnostic test. The SENSR technology developed by researchers at Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea diagnosis Covid-19 based on the RNA sequence of the virus, reducing the stress on one single testing location and avoiding contact with infected patients as much as possible. RNA is a nucleic acid that mediates genetic information or is involved in controlling the expression of genes. The biggest benefit is that a diagnostic kit can be developed within a week even if a new infectious disease appears other than Covid-19, according to the research published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The researchers noted that PCR molecular test currently used for Covid-19 diagnosis has very high accuracy but entails a complex preparation process to extract or refine the virus. The test is not suitable for use in small farming or fishing villages, or airport or drive-thru screening clinics as it requires expensive equipment as well as skilled experts, they said. The researchers designed the test kit to produce nucleic acid binding reaction to show fluorescence only when Covid-19 RNA is present. The virus can be detected immediately without any preparation process with high sensitivity in a short time. And it is as accurate as the current PCR diagnostic method. Using the new technology, they found the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, the cause of Covid-19, from an actual patient sample in about 30 minutes. In addition, five pathogenic viruses and bacterial RNAs were detected which proved the kit’s usability in detecting pathogens other than Covid-19, according to the researchers. Another great advantage of the SENSR technology is the ease of creating the diagnostic device that can be developed into a simple portable and easy-to-use form, the researchers said. The method not only allows onsite diagnosis before going to the screening clinic or being hospitalised, but also allows for a more proactive response to Covid-19 by supplementing the current centralized diagnostic system. “This method is a fast and simple diagnostic technology which can accurately analyse the RNA without having to treat a patient’s sample,” said POSTECH Professor Jeong Wook Lee. “We can better prepare for future epidemics as we can design and produce a diagnostic kit for new infectious diseases within a week,” Lee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-testing-method-can-diagnose-covid-19-in-just-30-minutes-study-finds/story-Xs7TnzX84EfomjchCLJ1XN.html

The prison sentence, which will be shortened by one year because he served time after a previous conviction on the same charges, also covered charges of corruption and possession of an unlicensed firearm.Adeeb was a protege to former President Yameen Abdul Gayoom during the early years of his presidency between 2013 and 2018.He had been sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2016 for several counts including masterminding a blast in a presidential speedboat in which Yameen’s wife was wounded. He was freed from all charges after Yameen lost reelection in 2018.Under the new President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, many cases perceived to be politically motivated were revisited.After his release, Adeeb testified against Yameen in court saying he was party to his former boss’ corrupt dealings and did not worry about being sent to jail again. Charges were refiled, and Adeeb pleaded guilty to all charges, including money laundering, embezzlement and using his prominent position to gain undue advantage.Yameen is serving a five-year prison term for having facilitated Adeeb to launder $1 million obtained through corrupt deals.Maldives is a tiny archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean known for its luxury tourist resorts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-ex-vice-president-jailed-again-for-money-laundering/story-XUb1l1y60DMsKYoTyGKwTL.html
06-10-2020||World||White House cancels updated FDA guidelines on Covid-19 vaccine approval: What it means||The White House has blocked new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines on bringing potential vaccines for Covid-19 to market.News agency Associated Press quoted a senior Trump administration official as saying that the White House believed there was no “clinical or medical reason” for the additional requirement.What the move means?The intervention by Trump officials is the latest example of the administration undercutting its own medical experts working to combat the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that a vaccine could be authorised before election day, even though top government scientists working on the administration’s vaccine effort have stated that the timeline is very unlikely.Last week, seven former FDA commissioners blasted the administration for “undermining the credibility” of the FDA in a Washington Post op-ed and called for the release of the pending vaccine guidelines. The former FDA chiefs warned that public perceptions that a vaccine was rushed out for political reasons could derail efforts to vaccinate millions of Americans.Drugmaker Pfizer has suggested it could have data on the safety and effectiveness of its vaccine before Election Day and a number of variables would still have to align for the company to submit, and the FDA to review and approve, a vaccine application before November 3.Additionally, FDA scientists have been discussing the contents of the guidelines publicly for weeks and have made clear that the recommendations have already been shared with each of the vaccine developers.The FDA released its initial expectations for Covid-19 vaccines in June. Among other metrics, the agency said any vaccine would have to be at least 50% protective against the virus. But the guidelines didn’t spell out the conditions under which the FDA would use its emergency authorization powers to speed up the availability of a vaccine. Under emergency review, medical products face a lower standard that merely requires that their expected benefits outweigh their risks for use during a public health crisis.The lack of specifics around using the emergency authorisation for a vaccine became a flashpoint for outside experts, physicians and even politicians. FDA officials then began drafting a second guidance document with additional details.The FDA has faced criticism for allowing emergency use of some Covid-19 treatments backed by little evidence, but FDA officials have made clear that vaccines would face additional standards.But Donald Trump made clear last month that he was skeptical of any regulatory changes that might delay a vaccine’s authorisation, even if those changes are aimed at increasing public trust.“I think that was a political move more than anything else,” he said then, arguing that that the companies testing the vaccines, such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, are capable of determining whether they work. “I have tremendous trust in these massive companies,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-cancels-updated-fda-guidelines-on-covid-19-vaccine-approval-what-it-means/story-t9unBLFPfY5lFP4UyK2eaL.html

This helps assist the WHO’s member states and UN procurement agencies to determine the acceptability of the vaccines.“Potentially through this emergency use listing the quality and safety of these vaccines and efficacy could be assessed. ..and then this could be made available for our licensees,” Escalante said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-talks-with-who-over-assessing-its-covid-19-vaccines-for-global-use/story-zO9DjWEu9pi2DE8W58UFiO.html

They were arrested over rioting that took place in the region after a man and his son were reportedly killed by police while demanding compensation after they lost their homes due to flooding and landslide on the Hunza river.Sher Ullah Baig and his son Sher Afzal, who were reportedly killed by police, were residents of Shishkat in Gojal Valley.Following protests over their deaths, police had arrested Baba Jan and several others from the area. While most were let off, 14 activists were singled out, say supporters, and were given multiple life sentences. All the accused deny the charges and call the decision a political ploy to stifle dissent in the region.Baba Jan is a popular leader in the area. If he is allowed to contest in mid-November’s legislative assembly elections in GB, as planned by the Pakistan government, he is likely to win a seat.The Indian government has firmly rejected Islamabad’s recent plans to hold legislative assembly elections in GB on November 15 and then turn the region into a Pakistani province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-seek-release-of-14-activists-in-gilgit-baltistan-jailed-since-2011/story-iIMiFGvUyWgRc1AVe0N7zH.html

Also, one injured person has died,” the spokesman said.On Monday, about 2,000 supporters of parties that did not make it to the republic’s Parliament in Bishkek gathered on the central Ala-Too square. They demanded that election results be canceled and a repeat vote be held. In the evening, clashes between protesters and security officials began.Overnight to Tuesday, protesters broke into the White House building, which hosts the parliament and presidential office. Then they moved towards the State Committee for National Security, where the former leader of the country, Almazbek Atambayev, was in custody, and freed him.Elections to the Kyrgyz parliament were held on October 4. The turnout was 56.5 percent. According to the preliminary voting results, after processing ballots from 98 percent of polling stations, four parties make it to the parliament: Birimdik (Unity, pro-government party) with 24.52% of the vote, Mekenim Kyrgyzstan (Native Kyrgyzstan, pro-government party) with 23.89%, Kyrgyzstan (centrist party) with 8.73% and Butun Kyrgyzstan (United Kyrgyzstan, centrist party) with 7.11%.The remaining parties did not overcome the 7 percent threshold.

06-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: Pence takes lead role in campaign with Trump travel stopped||With President Donald Trump ill with Covid-19, Vice President Mike Pence took the lead role in campaigning on Monday, starting a swing through key states to bolster the president’s chance for reelection.Trump left Walter Reed Military Medical Centre and returned to the White House on Monday evening, but it’s unclear when he’ll be able to travel.“I spoke to the president a little while back. He sounded great,” Pence told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before heading west to Utah for this week’s vice presidential debate.“When the president told me that he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah. And we’re looking very much forward to the vice presidential debate,” he said. “The stakes in this election have never been higher and the choice has never been clearer.” Pence wants to keep the president’s supporters energised and deflect criticism of the administration’s handling of a virus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans. Trump’s positive diagnosis on Friday has intensified scrutiny of the administration’s cavalier approach to the pandemic.The spotlight on Pence will be especially bright Wednesday when he participates in the vice presidential debate with California Senator Kamala Harris. Pence will almost certainly be pressed to explain shifting accounts of the president’s health over the weekend and justify Trump’s decision to hold large in-person campaign rallies during a pandemic — events that often flouted public health guidelines by congregating thousands of mostly mask-less supporters.“Normally, the vice presidential debate is inconsequential. That is not the case in 2020,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Florida Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential bid. “The public has so many questions about how we got here and it’s an opportunity for Pence to answer some of those.” Pence has often been called upon to smooth over fallout from Trump’s messy decision making and divisive policies. Since the 2016 campaign, he has served as a bridge of sorts between a brash, thrice-married former reality television star who long bragged about womanizing and the more traditional branch of the Republican Party, particularly conservative evangelicals.The smooth diction and humble demeanor Pence brings to the role was honed in the 1990s as a conservative talk-radio host in Indiana, when he referred to himself as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.” His approach hasn’t always been successful. As Indiana’s governor from 2013 to 2017, he was so relentlessly on-message that he sometimes struggled to contain fallout from fast-moving crises.That includes his handling of backlash over a 2015 law he signed that allowed business owners to deny service to gay people for religious reasons, which was later amended as a result of the uproar. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC when he was governor, Pence grew flustered after failing to answer direct questions about whether discrimination against gay people should be legal.“George!” Pence protested before letting out an audible sigh. “C’mon.” The debate with Harris will be a major test. The former California prosecutor’s political rise was fuelled by searing exchanges with political rivals during major congressional hearings. And she is certain to press the issue of the virus and Trump’s diagnoses when the two meet in Salt Lake City.“That will be his challenge. But it is one he is well-suited for,” said Cam Savage, a veteran Republican strategist from Indiana who has closely observed Pence’s political career. “With Pence you get a very disciplined leader who is not likely to make mistakes.” One major uncertainty is what sort of condition Trump will be in during the weeks ahead. His administration has offered rosy assessments of his health, but Trump’s blood oxygen level abruptly dropped twice in recent days and he was given supplemental oxygen before his hospitalisation.There are also concerns that Pence could himself could catch the virus while campaigning, a troubling scenario that raises serious questions about national security and the transfer of power if either he or Trump took a turn for the worse.After the debate, Pence says, it’s back to “business as usual” and the campaign has appearances planned for him, as well as Trump’s children and other top surrogates, in an effort billed as “Operation MAGA.” Pence is slated to visit Arizona and Florida and will return to Indiana on Friday to vote early.“We’ve got a campaign to run,” Pence said Saturday on a call with staff. “I promise you, this president, as soon as his doctors say so, he’s going to be back out there.” Pence often evokes faith when describing his approach to public office, citing the biblical concept of “servant leadership.” He has been a faithful servant to Trump since he was plucked from a difficult bid for reelection as governor to join the presidential ticket in 2016.Though Pence has long-held presidential ambitions, his own political career was on the ropes.The former congressman turned governor had a dismal approval rating. His enthusiastic support for religious conservative cultural issues alienated moderate Republicans and drew threats of boycott of the state. And he faced a difficult reelection battle against the same Democrat that he narrowly beat in 2012.

06-10-2020||World||External affairs minister Jaishankar to attend second ministerial Quad meeting today||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will on Tuesday participate in the second ministerial meeting of the Quad that will focus on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour across the region. Jaishankar and his counterparts from Australia, Japan and the US are expected to discuss issues such as plans for manufacturing and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine, connectivity, development of 5G technology, maritime cooperation, counter-terrorism, cyber security, and development of critical infrastructure and supply chains, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The issue of Australia’s inclusion in the Malabar naval exercise to be conducted by India, Japan and the US at the end of this year is also expected to figure in the discussions of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which was upgraded to the ministerial level in September last year. The people pointed out that it was rare for four foreign ministers to gather physically for a meeting amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and this highlighted the importance attached to the Quad by the four members. Ahead of the Quad meeting, Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in Tokyo, the people said. He is also expected to hold separate meetings with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi. The external affairs ministry said last week that the foreign ministers of the Quad will discuss the “post-Covid-19 international order and the need for a coordinated response to the various challenges emerging from the pandemic”. They will also discuss regional issues and “collectively affirm the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”, it said. The Quad meeting is expected to make an assessment of China’s aggressive actions, including the border standoff with China, its confrontation with Taiwan and its activities in the South China Sea, the people cited above said. All four members of the grouping have serious differences with China – India is engaged in a border standoff in Ladakh, the Australian government has pledged to halt projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan is worried about Chinese intrusions near the Senkaku Islands, and the US is engaged in a trade war. The members of the Quad, especially India, Japan and Australia, have stepped up work on forging partnerships with like-minded countries in the region, or those with interests in the Indian Ocean, with an eye on China’s increasing assertiveness. Jaishankar recently said India and Japan were looking at cooperating on projects in Bangladesh and Myanmar as part of their efforts to work together in third countries. On September 9, India, Australia and France held their maiden senior officials’ trilateral dialogue, with the focus on building convergences in the Indo-Pacific. On the same day, India and Japan signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), a pact for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-to-attend-quad-meeting-today/story-uBlRztc9aa1sFs3uFULgCK.html

A senior Indian official said that India is likely to join the conversation on multilateral cooperation when the next monthly meeting takes place later this month. “This is an opportunity to coordinate on issues with several countries, and another piece in the coordination with Canada,” the official said.Among the countries that have joined the MCGC are the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, South Africa, Morocco, Brazil, Peru and Australia. Two nations conspicuous by their absence from this grouping are the US and China.In a statement after a monthly meeting in April, Champagne had said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is a global challenge. Maintaining strong coordination with our international partners is critical to mitigate the repercussions of the ongoing challenges we face. Keeping people, goods and services moving is key in both addressing these issues and ensuring the transition to a strong recovery.”The ministers provided an update on their response to the coronavirus pandemic. Among its objectives are focusing on the “importance of multilateral vaccine research and development and ensuring equitable vaccine access to developing countries and vulnerable health systems” as well as “the ongoing need for coordination and multilateralism in response to the economic effects of Covid-19.”In a release, Global Affairs Canada said the MCGC was “proving to be a valuable forum to discuss, coordinate and act together on global challenges related to Covid-19 and beyond” in a “world increasingly characterised by interdependence, speed and complexity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-join-canada-led-multilateral-group-tackling-covid-19-pandemic/story-GKal3JUnuxUdxF200UojvI.html
06-10-2020||World||Nobel Prize for Physics to be announced today; Only 3 women have received it so far||The Nobel Prize for Physics for this year will be announced on Tuesday by the Stockholm-based Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Alfred Nobel, known for his invention of dynamite, signed off his fortunes to a series of five prizes in his last will in 1985 that came to be recognised as the Nobel Prizes. The awards were first given out in 1901. Here are some facts about the Nobel Prize for Physics: Since 1901, the award has been given out 113 times to 212 individuals, including John Bardeen, who has received the award twice for his invention of a transistor and for his work in superconductivity. Each Nobel Prize can be shared by a maximum of three laureates for two separate works. The first person to receive the prize in 1901 was German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen, who is known for his discovery of X-rays. There have been six years when the Nobel Prize for Physics was not awarded, including 1916, 1931, 1934, and 1940 through 1942 because of the prevailing World War-I and II.This was done keeping in mind the statute of Nobel Foundation that said: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.” As per this statute, the awards were withheld and given out the next year on eight occasions, including the Nobel Prize in 1922 awarded to Albert Einstein, and in 1919 to German physicist Max Plank, who had laid the foundations for quantum theory. One of the delayed awards was also presented to the American-German physicist Otto Stern, who is known to be the second-most nominated persons for a Nobel Prize. Stern was nominated 82 times and had won the coveted prize in 1943.Women’s suffrage activist Jane Addams, who had received a record 91 nominations, had received the Nobel Price for Peace in 1931. Details of nominations are not released until after 50 years. The only Indian to have received the Nobel Prize for Physics was Professor CV Raman in 1930 for his discovery of the Raman effect. The highest number of the Nobel Prize in this category has been received by scientists from the United States of America (94), followed by Germany (26), and the United Kingdom (24). Three women have won the Nobel Prize in this category, including Marie Curie in 1903, Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), and Donna Strickland (2018), to date. Curie had also won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. She is the only woman and one of the four persons to have received two Nobel Prizes in two separate categories. Lawrence Bragg was the youngest to win the Nobel Prize for Physics at the age of 25 in 1915 along with his father for studying crystal structures using X-rays. The oldest person to receive the award was Arthur Ashkin at the age of 96 in 2018 for his work on optical tweezers. Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously. Family of Nobel LaureatesMarie Curie and Pierre Curie became the first family members to win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903. Their daughter Irène Joliot-Curie followed her illustrious parents’ footsteps and bagged the prestigious award with her husband Frédéric Joliot in 1935. Four pairs of fathers and sons have received the prize, including Neils Bohr for his understanding of atomic structure in 1922 and his son Aage N Bohr for his work on motion in atomic nuclei. Of the 113 Noble Prizes for Physics that have been awarded since 1901, 47 were given to only one laureate, 32 and 34 to two and three laureates, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-for-physics-to-be-announced-today-only-3-women-have-received-it-so-far/story-WVxlSxNvlm900iVd6v53WL.html
06-10-2020||World||‘Don’t be afraid,’ US President Donald Trump tells Americans upon return to White House||US President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Monday evening three days into his treatment for Covid-19 at a military hospital, and urged Americans not to be afraid of the disease.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a recorded video message. Critics saw it as an insensitive remark, given the damage inflicted by the deadly virus on Americans so far: 210,000 dead, more than 7 million infected, and several millions left jobless.Trump gave thumbs-up to reporters as he left the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. At the White House, a 10-minute helicopter ride later, he took off his mask and posed for cameras from one of the stately balconies. He stood there for a while, gave a long salute to the departing presidential helicopter Marine One, and went inside.The US president returned to a White House that has turned into a “hot spot” of coronavirus cases, with a growing number of infections being reported among aides, officials, Trump’s allies and reporters. First lady Melania Trump, who had tested positive for the virus along with the US president, was recovering in the residential wing of the White House. Others infected included Trump’s close adviser Hope Hicks, former adviser Kellyanne Conway, former governor Chris Christie and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.Trump had announced his intention to leave the hospital in a tweet earlier on Monday, saying he was feeling better than he did “20 years ago”. In a video message he tweeted from the White House, Trump suggested that he was feeling better because “maybe I am immune”.Eager to project strength, the US president said in an earlier tweet that he intended to return to campaigning soon. He did not say when, though. Trump’s medical team hasn’t been forthcoming about certain key details of Trump’s illness, and has given confusing and conflicting information. Sean Conley, the US president’s physician who has admitted to lending an “upbeat” twist to his updates on Trump’s health, said on Monday that though Trump was “not out of the woods yet”, he met all the requirements for discharge.“The president has continued to improve,” he told reporters. “He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge.”The team had planned to discharge Trump later after administering the fourth dose of remdesivir, an antiviral drug known to cut recovery time for Covid-19 patients. They did not say if he will continue to get dexamethasone, a steroid he was given earlier to prevent his oxygen levels from dropping.The medical team had said on Sunday that they had expected to discharge the US president on Monday because had been doing well. Trump was airlifted to the Walter Reed hospital on Friday after he showed severe symptoms of Covid-19, high fever and a rapid drop in blood oxygen levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-be-afraid-us-president-donald-trump-tells-americans-upon-return-to-white-house/story-cvLNeJsVgxKNhumcjuJiDJ.html
06-10-2020||World||6 feet distance not enough to prevent Covid-19 spread, says US CDC||The novel coronavirus can spread through the air to people who are more than 6 feet away from an infectious person, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday, in guidance that could raise new challenges for safely re-opening businesses and schools.In an update to its website, the CDC said the coronavirus can sometimes be spread through small particles that can linger in the air and infect people separated by distances previously considered safe. Many social-distancing guidelines adopted by workplaces, restaurants and stores advise people to stand at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart to avoid transmitting the pathogen that causes Covid-19.“Today’s update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with Covid-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after the Covid-19-positive person left an area,” the agency said in a news release.The change follows months of mounting scientific evidence that Sars-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the air at greater distances than understood in earlier stages of the pandemic.There have been indications the CDC was moving toward updating its guidance. Last month, it posted and then removed a guideline on airborne transmission, later describing it as a draft posted in error.The new guidance arrives as the pandemic appears to be shifting into a more intense phase in the U.S. In 34 states, the seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was a month ago, and an outbreak of the virus at the White House appears to be widening. At the same time, schools are reopening, states such as Florida have lifted restrictions on restaurants and other businesses, and the approach of cooler weather and holidays is expected to push more people indoors to socialize.Ventilation IssuesA recent archived version of the CDC’s web page made no mention of airborne transmission, emphasizing that the main way the virus spreads is through close contact among people who are within six feet of each other, through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing, sneezing, and speaking. It acknowledged that the virus may spread in other ways, including on contaminated surfaces.The CDC’s updated site includes a section acknowledging that virus particles also sometimes spread through the air, particularly in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Scientists believe that in these cases, airborne virus particles emitted “became concentrated enough to spread the virus to other people,” including sometimes shortly after the infectious person left.The transmissions sometimes occurred when the infected person was breathing heavily, while singing or exercising, the agency said.Linsey Marr, an expert on the airborne transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech, in a tweet called the update “an accurate, sorely-needed update acknowledging airborne spread and importance of masks at all times around others and of ventilation.”In an open letter in July, 239 scientists urged the World Health Organization to recognize the potential for airborne spread. One study of a meat plant suggested that under certain conditions the virus can travel 26 feet.Recommendations UnchangedThe CDC reiterated that it’s more common for the virus to spread through close contact with an infected person. The update Monday doesn’t change the CDC’s recommendations for how to protect against infection by wearing masks, staying 6 feet apart, washing hands, cleaning surfaces, and staying home when sick.“CDC’s recommendations remain the same based on existing science and after a thorough technical review of the guidance,” the agency said in news release sent to reporters Monday.It’s unusual for the CDC to alert the media to changes in its guidelines, with updates frequently published to the agency’s website with little fanfare.The agency didn’t immediately respond to an emailed question about whether the acknowledgment would lead to changes in guidance for restaurants, businesses, and other settings.(Corrects spelling of name in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-feet-distance-not-enough-to-prevent-covid-19-spread-says-us-cdc/story-HMtKf7CjXETUig3q7nqD8M.html
06-10-2020||World||Pompeo and his Japanese counterpart to lead initiative to counter China’s growing power||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, said they will lead a regional initiative called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” aimed at countering China’s growing assertiveness, a main issue they will discuss on Tuesday with the top envoys from Australia and India.The first in-person talks among the foreign ministers since the coronavirus pandemic began also brings together Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.Motegi, opening his working lunch with Pompeo ahead of the so-called Quad talks, said, “I hope Japan and the US will lead the international society to achieve the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” He also said the Japan-US alliance continues to be “the cornerstone of peace and stability in the region” under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga who took office on September 16, vowing to carry on his predecessor Shinzo Abe’s hawkish security and diplomatic stance.Pompeo welcomed Suga’s recent description of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific as the foundation of regional peace and stability and that “I could not agree him more.” On his way to Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters that the four countries hope to have some “significant achievements” at the meeting, but did not elaborate.Also Read: PM Modi, Xi to come ‘face-to-face’ at virtual Brics Summit next monthJapanese officials say they will discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that Japan and the US have been pushing to bring together “like-minded” countries that share concerns about China’s growing assertiveness and influence.The talks come weeks ahead of the US presidential election and amid tensions between the US and China over the virus, trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. Pompeo is attending the Quad meeting, though he cancelled subsequent planned visits to South Korea and Mongolia after President Donald Trump was hospitalized with Covid-19. The president was released on Monday and returned to the White House.The talks follow a recent flareup in tensions between China and India over their border issue. Relations between Australia and China have also deteriorated in recent months.Japan, meanwhile, is concerned about China’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. Japan also considers China’s growing military activity to be a security threat. Japan’s annual defence policy paper in July accused China of unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea, where it has built and militarised manmade islands and is assertively pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea’s key fisheries and waterways.Suga, who had been chief Cabinet secretary under Abe, will make his in-person diplomatic debut as prime minister when he meets the Quad ministers. He will also hold separate talks with Pompeo on deepening the Japan-US alliance and the FOIP.“The world is possibly becoming even more unpredictable and uncontrollable due to heightening selfish nationalism and growing tension between the US and China,” Suga told Japanese media on Monday. He said he will pursue diplomacy that is based on the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone and “strategically promote the FOIP,” while establishing stable relations with neighbours including China and Russia.Also Read: Uncertainty looms large over India-China trade through Nathu La in SikkimHe said he also plans to promote the FOIP during a planned visit to Southeast Asia later this month.Japan sees the FOIP as crucial to have access to sea lanes all the way to Middle East, a key source of oil for the resource-poor island nation.Suga has little experience in diplomacy. Balancing between the US, Japan’s main security ally, and China, its top trading partner, will be tough, analysts say.Japan hopes to regularize the Quad foreign ministers’ talks and broaden their cooperation with other countries. But each Quad member has its own political stance toward China and it would be difficult to agree on concrete steps even though they share perception of China as a common threat, analysts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-australia-india-japan-to-discuss-china-s-growing-power/story-4y736TtXOX66OYV3EEHQ6O.html
06-10-2020||World||Mike Pompeo seeks to show united front on China despite Covid-19 pandemic||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo began meetings with counterparts from three other democratic countries in Tokyo, in a bid to keep up the pressure on China amid the coronavirus crisis rocking Washington.The so-called Quad -- also including Australia, India and Japan -- is slated to hold its second ministerial-level meeting later Tuesday, an event expected to help firm up New Delhi’s participation in the group. The first international gathering of ministers in Japan in almost a year demonstrates solidarity at a time when China is feuding with at least three of its members: Australia, US and India.For the host, newly installed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the meeting signals a willingness to continue some of his predecessor Shinzo Abe’s more hawkish security projects. China has expressed concerns that the “Quadrilateral Initiative,” which Abe first helped promote more than a decade ago, is an attempt to form “exclusive cliques” and stoke a “new Cold War.”“What they’re doing is sending a message to the Chinese side that engagement is more important than assertiveness,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former diplomat and visiting professor at Japan’s Ritsumeikan University. “It doesn’t mean that this is something to contain China. Nobody can contain China.”Pompeo’s VisitThe Quad has gained momentum as President Donald Trump pursues a more confrontational approach to Beijing, while India grows increasingly wary of Chinese economic and military influence in South Asia. The U.S. has since 2017 sought to draw India, which has traditionally protected its non-aligned status, into the fold with a re-branded “Indo-Pacific Strategy.”That the meeting is happening at all, as Trump battles a Covid-19 infection in Washington, illustrates its importance to the US Pompeo -- one of the Trump administration’s most vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party -- canceled subsequent stops in Mongolia and South Korea initially planned for later this week.Pompeo was set to hold bilateral meetings with counterparts Marise Payne of Australia and Toshimitsu Motegi of Japan and Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India as well as with Suga ahead of the four-way discussions.Australia and China have been locked in an diplomatic tit-for-tat over Canberra’s support for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus while Indian and Chinese troops are staring each other down after the deadliest clashes in more than four decades on their disputed Himalayan border.The meeting will also be the first big diplomatic event for Suga, after coming to the premier’s job less than three weeks ago with little foreign policy experience. Suga must strike a balance between Japan’s biggest trading partner, China, and its only military ally, the US. He also agreed to work closely with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a recent phone call.Pompeo praised Suga as a “powerful force for good” in his previous role as chief cabinet secretary, adding that: “The United States has every reason to believe he will strengthen our enduring alliance in his new role.”United FrontThe four ministers are expected to discuss the pandemic and the regional situation, as well as the importance of cooperation with other countries in realizing a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” With no joint statement expected from the meeting, its value could be more symbolic than concrete, although Japan is seeking to make it an annual event.“We hope the relevant countries can think more of the regional countries’ common interests and contribute to regional peace, stability and development rather than doing the opposite,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.India is also expected to invite Australia to take part in an annual naval drill, expanding what has been a trilateral event with the US and Japan, Bloomberg News reported in July. The Quad held its first formal ministerial-level gathering about a year ago in New York, which was seen as a sign of growing unease over Xi’s more assertive foreign policy.Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, said he doesn’t think a strategic alliance aimed at Beijing is useful or productive. “China is a large trading partner for those nations and has regular collaboration with those nations,” Wang said.The elevation last year of the discussion from official-level talks suggests the previously informal framework was being strengthened to improve intelligence-gathering and present a united front on regional security issues. Tuesday’s meeting comes after the trade ministers of Australia, India and Japan agreed last month to work toward achieving supply-chain resilience in the region, following reports that the three nations were looking to work together to counter the trade dominance of the People’s Republic.“The Quad seeks to establish, promote, and secure Indo-Pacific principles, especially as PRC tactics, aggression, and coercion increase in the region,” Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell, of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told reporters Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-seeks-to-show-united-front-on-china-despite-covid-19-pandemic/story-uATHsAUbIZwBjYQGnG40iL.html

Still, the percentage of tests in the Northeast that were coming back positive for the novel coronavirus remains very low, mostly in the 1%-2% range.The Midwest continues to deal with the highest number of new cases per capita, with North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin reporting the largest number of new cases per 100,000 residents in the past two weeks.Health officials have long said they were worried that colder weather -- which is now hitting the Midwest and Northeast -- would increase outbreaks as more activities move indoors. Nationally, more than 300,000 Americans tested positive for the novel coronavirus last week, down 4% from the prior week, as total cases in the country approach 7.5 million. Some of the national decrease was due to Texas, which two weeks ago reported thousands of backlogged cases.New cases have risen for at least two weeks in a row in 21 states, though deaths from Covid-19 have generally declined for the past seven weeks. Still, more than 5,000 lives were lost last week, and deaths are a lagging indicator that generally rises weeks after a surge in cases.For a second week in a row, testing set a record high, with on average 935,000 tests conducted each day last week, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak.For the first time since mid-June, the percentage of tests that came back positive for the virus was under the 5% threshold that the World Health Organization has said is concerning.Four states had positive rates over 20%: Idaho, Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-surge-in-us-midwest-and-northeast-10-000-cases-in-new-york-last-week/story-7W5a6TCJxwmSYryycUy3sM.html

The meeting comes during a difficult year for North Korea as the coronavirus pandemic puts more pressure on a economy hurt by recent storms and flooding.“We have performed historical feats with our costly efforts, boldly overcoming unprecedentedly grave trials and difficulties this year, but we should not rest on our laurels,” KCNA said.“We still face the challenges that cannot be overlooked and there are many goals we have to attain within this year.”In August, Kim had announced that the ruling party will hold a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan, with a party meeting noting serious delays in improving the national economy.Last year, Kim vowed to make a “frontal breakthrough” in the country’s campaign to build a self-reliant economy in the face of tightening sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear and missile programmes.Security officials were watching for signs that North Korea may use an upcoming holiday to unveil new weapons or test fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) on Oct. 10, the 75th anniversary of the ruling workers party.

06-10-2020||World||No ban on Nawaz Sharif’s speeches, rules Islamabad High Court||The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday dismissed a petition seeking a ban on Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif’s speeches, reported The Dawn.The petition stated that Sharif has started actively participating in politics and has initiated a smear campaign against state institutions, after going abroad on the pretext of availing medical treatment.It urged the court to order that Sharif’s recent “hate speeches” be taken down from the internet and that he should be prohibited from delivering speeches in future. The plea was heard by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah.The high court in its verdict said that it was not in the public interest to invoke the “constitutional jurisdiction of a high court in matters involving political content”, especially in cases where the law provides “alternative remedies”.“The people of Pakistan, through their chosen representatives, have the will and resolve to safeguard the security of Pakistan. The security of Pakistan is surely not dependent on the issuance of a writ by this court,” the verdict read.The IHC verdict, which was reserved earlier on Monday, said that the petitioner argued that the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had banned speeches delivered by individuals who were declared as absconders in a case.“Taking this argument into account, the court said that the petitioner “could not give a plausible explanation for invoking the jurisdiction of this court when an alternate remedy was available” to them,” said the article on The Dawn.The petitioner had also expressed concern that the country’s security was being “threatened”, the five-page verdict noted. The court, however, dismissed this argument in its ruling, saying that “the security of Pakistan is not frail nor can be threatened by mere political rhetoric”. According to the verdict, the petitioner’s concerns about the country’s security were “misconceived”.A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered against Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the case of criminal conspiracy for the “provocative speeches” he made in London to “defame Pakistan’s institutions”The FIR was lodged against Sharif on October 1 by a local in the Shahdra Police Station’s jurisdiction.Earlier this month, Pakistan failed to execute a non-bailable arrest warrant against Sharif, who was granted permission to fly abroad to get medical treatment in November last year.For nearly one month, the Pakistan government made several attempts to get Sharif’s arrest warrant signed.Last week, the IHC had slammed Sharif over his failure to appear before the court after he was granted permission to fly abroad for medical treatment.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan had tasked relevant authorities to bring back Sharif at the earliest. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister also issued the directive to pursue the matter vigorously.A cabinet member had told Dawn the government had already sent a request to the British government for the repatriation of Nawaz but it would now send a fresh application.Last month, the IHC came down heavily on the Imran Khan-led government for allowing Sharif to go abroad without informing the court and it was up to the dispensation to take steps for ensuring the latter’s return to the country.

06-10-2020||World||Joe Biden aims to expand map as Donald Trump recovers from Covid-19||As President Donald Trump recovers from the coronavirus, Joe Biden is capitalizing on having the campaign trail largely to himself by hitting critical swing states and investing in longtime Republican bastions that he hopes might expand his path to victory.The Democratic presidential nominee made his second trip to Florida in a little over two weeks on Monday. His visit to Miami was designed to encroach on some of Trump’s turf, even swinging through Little Havana, a typically conservative area known for its staunch opposition to the communist government that Fidel Castro installed in Cuba.He’ll follow up with a trip later this week to Arizona, which hasn’t backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996. Even Biden’s former primary rival, Bernie Sanders, has resumed in-person campaigning for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak in March. The progressive Vermont senator held socially distanced rallies in the swing states of New Hampshire and Michigan and proclaimed, “We need Joe Biden as our president.”Biden is complementing the expanded campaign travel with a late-stage ad push, reserving more than $6 million in television airtime in Texas — for decades deeply red — through the end of October, according to an Associated Press analysis of CMAG data. He also plans to spend $4 million on advertising in Georgia, another Republican-leaning state that Democrats are feeling bullish about.Trump, meanwhile, has scaled back advertising in both states and has begun doing the same in Ohio, which he also won in 2016.Also Read: Over 200,000 in US have died from Covid-19. Now Trump says he ‘gets it’Sitting on a massive pile of campaign cash less than a month before Election Day, Biden is trying to put Trump on defense across the country and build an advantage in the Electoral College so large that the president might struggle to contest it. That’s especially important since Trump, who lost the popular vote in 2016, has said he may not accept the election results this year and has raised unfounded allegations that the increased use of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic could lead to fraud.“2020 is not 2016. The ‘Dems in disarray,’ fretting that we’re going to go too far, that’s not the reality this time,” said Kelly Dietrich, founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which has worked with around 1,500 of the party’s candidates for offices nationwide this cycle. “They are running a solid race focused on the swing states we need to win but now have excess resources to expand the map.”As Election Day nears, Democrats are still stung by the 2016 campaign, when Hillary Clinton focused on Republican-leaning states like North Carolina and Arizona in the final weeks, only to lose ones that long supported Democrats, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said, “It would be a mistake for Biden to take his foot off the pedal,” but added, “I wouldn’t want Biden to make the same mistake Clinton did.”“I’d be careful, if I was Biden, about expanding the map too much,” Bannon said.Biden’s advisers say they have been confident for months they can expand the electoral map while never wavering from their promise to have their candidate travel only when local health guidelines allowed for it. Adhering to that plan has allowed them to expand into other parts of the country at the most critical of moments.Speaking Monday in Little Havana, Biden was careful to continue to wish Trump a speedy recovery but also criticized his administration’s response to the pandemic.“I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,” Biden said. “Now that’s he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I’d encourage him to do this: Listen to the scientists.”Biden also diverted from his usual campaign speech about rebuilding the economy after the pandemic to add, “The richness and beauty of Miami is built with the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America.”Trump left the hospital Monday night. Although it’s not clear when he’ll be well enough for a full travel schedule, he’s already thinking about one.“Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!!” the president tweeted.Biden advisers say they never considered dialing back his campaigning even while the president was hospitalized, especially with Vice President Mike Pence having taken on a larger role, including at Wednesday’s debate with Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, in Salt Lake City, Utah.Also Read: Joe Biden urges Donald Trump to support nationwide mask mandate“The Trump campaign continues to run their presidential campaign, and we are going to continue to run our presidential campaign,” said Biden campaign senior strategist Anita Dunn. “Clearly, both campaigns are continuing to move forward.”Still, Biden faces lingering questions about whether he was exposed to the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends quarantining for two weeks after a person’s exposure to the virus. Biden shared a stage with the president for 90 minutes during last week’s first presidential primary debate.Biden says he’s since been tested three times, all with negative results. His campaign has promised he will be tested regularly and has committed to releasing all results, but they’ve refused to comment on whether quarantine was considered after the debate and they haven’t said how often Biden will undergo tests.During an MSNBC town hall later Monday evening, Biden said presidents should be transparent about their health, though he also “can understand that, in certain circumstances related to national security, where every detail would not be made available in the middle of a particular crisis.”But Biden said withholding such information was only appropriately rarely and for short periods of time, saying it should be done “only on the margins and only for the moment.”Since the president tested positive for the virus, Biden’s campaign has been even more disciplined about minimizing its candidate’s risk. The former vice president has begun keeping on his face mask even when giving speeches. And when he stopped to answer questions before boarding his plane to Miami, Biden’s wife, Jill, physically pulled him back to prevent him from moving too close to reporters, despite everyone wearing masks.“We are not going to put people’s health at risk for a political campaign,” Dunn said, “but we are going to campaign as vigorously as we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-aims-to-expand-map-as-donald-trump-recovers-from-covid-19/story-hjukHS0pujiSyV4YZvLXJO.html
06-10-2020||World||Over 200,000 in US have died from Covid-19. Now Trump says he ‘gets it’||Now that he has contracted Covid-19, President Donald Trump says he does “get it.” That revelation, seven months into the pandemic and after almost 210,000 American deaths, is not the first time he has relied on personal experience to shape his views.He said he now “understands” the virus. But because of his own experience, as a patient at one of the nation’s finest medical facilities with treatment options available to very few, the president also reinforced that he has struggled to relate with everyday Americans, millions of whom have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus.Instead, as he has in relationships with other countries, he has prioritized his own personal experience over that of experts. He has been reluctant, for instance, to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin over interference in American elections in the face of clear evidence from the US intelligence community that it has occurred.Also Read: Donald Trump returns to White House after 4-day stay at hospitalHe has also drawn frequently on his experience with the business world or his own family to set the White House agenda. He cited his business acumen as helping him land a deal for the US Embassy in Jerusalem, and he said he understands the airline industry because of his time running the failed Trump Shuttle.Despite months of briefings from the nation’s leading infectious disease experts, it was the onset of his own symptoms, as he was brought low by a lethal virus, that he said gave him a greater understanding.That understanding, however, seemed very much in conflict with expert public health guidance about how the virus behaves and the precautions that people infected, particularly those in a higher risk group like the president, need to take.“It’s been a very interesting journey,” Trump said in a video released Sunday night. “I learned a lot about Covid. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. And I get it, and I understand it, and it’s a very interesting thing, and I’m going to be letting you know about it.”Also Read| Donald Trump intends to participate in next US presidential debate: OfficialBut it soon became clear that he did not, in fact, get it.Trump took a surprise ride in a motorcade to pay tribute to his supporters, potentially exposing the Secret Service agents who rode in the vehicle with him. The next day, when announcing that he would be returning to the White House, he took a tone that suggested he was out of touch with suffering Americans who could not receive the same level of presidential care.“Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life,” Trump tweeted. “We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”At no point since he tested positive for the virus has Trump acknowledged others afflicted with the deadly disease. His general election foe, Democrat Joe Biden, on Monday urged him to fundamentally change how he manages the pandemic.“I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,” Biden said in Miami. “Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.”Even when the virus struck longtime friends, like Stanley Chera, a New Jersey developer who died of the disease in April, Trump did not change his approach and continued to talk about the virus as though it would soon be a thing of the past.“We’ve always said that he has no capacity for empathy. His sense of self-regard is so overwhelming, he views everything that passes through the world through the lens of what it does for him,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American Studies at Princeton University.“Even though more than 200,000 Americans are dead, the nature of the crisis doesn’t come home unless it actually touches him,” Glaude said. “Could he ever represent anyone other than himself?”Trump has said he could deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un because he had established a personal rapport with the authoritarian figure in ways that his predecessors could not.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“I was being really tough and so was he. And then we would go back and forth,” Trump said at a 2018 rally. “And then we fell in love. No really. He wrote me beautiful letters.”Since Trump has in effect declared his battle with the disease successful — an assessment that available medical evidence suggests is premature — it remains doubtful that Trump would take his personal experience battling Covid-19 and rethink his administration’s policies or attitudes toward the pandemic, especially given the competing imperative of continuing his presidential campaign.Trump often has had difficulty embracing a central role of the American presidency: consoling people dealing with intense grief, regardless of their political affiliation or support for the White House’s agenda. It’s a quality rarely debated or analyzed during a campaign, yet one that can shape the way people view the success of their president.But in 2020, it has become a central issue. The president has rarely mentioned the toll of the virus on the nation, instead focusing on an economic recovery or a rise in the stock market.He has largely eschewed wearing a mask and mocked those who have. And he has ignored his own federal government’s guidelines when holding rallies and large-scale White House events.Trump may draw lessons from his own experiences but will rarely ever acknowledge a misstep, said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg.“He once said, ‘It is what it is’ about the impact of Covid. His video (Sunday night) was better than that, it was probably the closest he is going to get to an apology,” said Nunberg. “That’s not who he is.”The White House sees it differently.“He has experience now fighting the coronavirus as an individual,” said Erin Perrine, a campaign spokeswoman. “Joe Biden doesn’t have that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-200-000-in-us-have-died-from-covid-19-now-trump-says-he-gets-it/story-3kjTajh5LhAWWbW0z5L9QO.html
06-10-2020||World||‘Don’t be afraid’ of Covid-19, says Donald Trump on return to White House||President Donald Trump told Americans “to get out there” and not fear Covid-19 as he returned to the White House on Monday after a three-night hospital stay to be treated for the virus and removed his white surgical mask to pose for pictures.Asked how he felt on arrival at the White House, where his staff has been hit by infections and his re-election campaign shadowed by the pandemic, Trump said: “Real good,” according to a pool report by a journalist covering his return on behalf of other media.Trump wore a mask as he walked out of the helicopter that flew him back from a military hospital outside Washington and climbed the stairs of the White House South Portico, where he removed it and posed for pictures, waving, saluting and giving thumbs-up signs.He then turned to walk into the White House, his mask still in his pocket, TV footage showed.The Republican president, running for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 US election, was admitted to the Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday after being diagnosed with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a recorded video message. “We’re going back, we’re going back to work. We’re going to be out front. ... Don’t let it dominate your lives. Get out there, be careful.”The disease has killed more than 1 million people worldwide and more than 209,000 in the United States alone - the highest death toll of any country.Trump, 74, has not had a fever in more than 72 hours and his oxygen levels are normal, his medical team told reporters in front of the hospital. The doctors declined, however, to discuss any toll the disease could have on the president’s lungs or disclose when Trump last tested negative for the coronavirus.The team added that the president had received supplemental oxygen twice in recent days.“He may not entirely be out of the woods yet,” Dr. Sean. P. Conley, the White House physician, said. “If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief.”But Conley said the medical team believed Trump was ready to leave the hospital, stressing he would have world-class medical care around the clock at the White House.Conley said doctors were in “uncharted territory” because Trump had received certain therapies so early in the course of the illness.The severity of Trump’s illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some medical experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a category more likely to develop severe complications or die from the disease.Doctors also have been treating him with a steroid, dexmethasone, that is normally used only in the most severe cases.Trump has frequently downplayed the threat of the pandemic. In recent days, he released a series of videos to reassure the public he was recovering from COVID-19.He was reluctant to go to the hospital last week and was eager to get out, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier on Monday.U.S. House of Representatives Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped Trump’s decision to return to the White House was not politically motivated and she expressed concern that he could become a “long hauler,” a term that refers to those who suffer COVID-19 complications over an extended period.Trump’s medical team said he had not placed any pressure on the doctors treating him.Even being discharged, Trump will need to continue treatment as he is still undergoing a five-day course of an intravenous antiviral drug, remdesivir, and will have to isolate himself for a certain period of time.The coronavirus outbreak around Trump widened on Monday when White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she had tested positive for the virus.McEnany, who is at the forefront of the White House’s often combative dealings with the media, held a briefing for reporters on Thursday in which she did not wear a face mask.Chad Gilmartin and Karoline Leavitt, who work in the White House’s press office, also have tested positive, a source confirmed to Reuters.TRAILING IN POLLSA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday showed Trump trailing Biden, 77, nationally by 10 percentage points. About 65% of Americans said Trump would not have been infected had he taken the virus more seriously.Trump has repeatedly flouted social-distancing guidelines meant to curb its spread. He also mocked Biden at last Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing a mask at events, even when he is far from other people.Biden, who has tested negative for the disease several times since the debate, said on Monday he was willing to participate in the next presidential debate scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami if health experts deemed it safe.Trump intends to take part in the debate, his campaign said.A return to the White House might help Trump project a sense of normalcy. Before falling ill, he tried to pivot the campaign toward the U.S. economic recovery and the upcoming confirmation hearings for his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.But the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the White House as well as in Congress - three Republican senators have tested positive for the virus in the past week - threatens to draw further attention to Trump’s pandemic response.Major U.S. stock markets closed higher on Monday before Trump’s departure from the hospital and amid signs of progress with a new fiscal stimulus bill in Congress. Wall Street’s main indexes slumped on Friday after Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis.(Reporting by Steve Holland and Alexandra Alper; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Andy Sullivan, Andrea Shalal, Susan Heavey, Lisa Lambert, Patricia Zengerle, Susan Cornwell, and Tim Ahmann; Writing by Paul Simao; Editing by Scott Malone, Howard Goller and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-be-afraid-of-covid-19-says-donald-trump-on-return-to-white-house/story-c1mrfPb91xLrHGH6p12WBN.html

06-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, still infectious, back at White House without mask||President Donald Trump staged a dramatic return to the White House Monday night after leaving the military hospital where he was receiving an unprecedented level of care for Covid-19. He immediately ignited a new controversy by declaring that despite his illness the nation should not fear the virus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans — and then he entered the White House without a protective mask.Trump’s message alarmed infectious disease experts and suggested the president’s own illness had not caused him to rethink his often-cavalier attitude toward the disease, which has also infected the first lady and several White House aides, including new cases revealed on Monday.Landing at the White House on Marine One, Trump gingerly climbed the South Portico steps, removed his mask and declared, “I feel good.” He gave a double thumbs-up to the departing helicopter from the portico terrace, where aides had arranged American flags for the sunset occasion. He entered the White House, where aides were visible milling about the Blue Room, without wearing a face covering.The president left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where his doctor, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, said earlier Monday that the president remains contagious and would not be fully “out of the woods” for another week but that Trump had met or exceeded standards for discharge from the hospital. Trump is expected to continue his recovery at the White House, where the reach of the outbreak that has infected the highest levels of the US government is still being uncovered.Still, just a month before the election and anxious to project strength, Trump tweeted before leaving the hospital, “Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!!” And in case anyone missed his don’t-worry message earlier, he rushed out a new video from the White House.“Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said of the virus. “You’re going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines.” His remarks were strong, but he was taking deeper breaths than usual as he delivered them.Trump’s nonchalant message about not fearing the virus comes as his own administration has encouraged Americans to be very careful and take precautions to avoid contracting and spreading the disease as cases continue to spike across the country. For more than eight months, Trump’s efforts to play down the threat of the virus in hopes of propping up the economy ahead of the election have drawn bipartisan criticism.“We have to be realistic in this: COVID is a complete threat to the American population,” Dr. David Nace of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said of Trump’s comment.“Most of the people aren’t so lucky as the president,” with an in-house medical unit and access to experimental treatments, added Nace, an expert on infections in older adults.“It’s an unconscionable message,” agreed Dr. Sadiya Khan of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “I would go so far as to say that it may precipitate or worsen spread.”Likewise, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who spent more than 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump last week, said during an NBC town hall Monday night that he was glad Trump seemed to be recovering well, “but there’s a lot to be concerned about -- 210,000 people have died. I hope no one walks away with the message that it’s not a problem.”Biden, who tested negative for the virus on Sunday, said in an interview with WPLG Local 10 News in Miami: “I saw a tweet he did, they showed me, he said ‘Don’t let COVID control your life.’” Tell that to all the “families that lost someone.”There was pushback from a prominent Trump political supporter as well.Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told the Houston Chronicle editorial board that Trump had “let his guard down” in his effort to show that the country was moving beyond the virus and had created “confusion” about how to stay safe.Dr. Conley said that because of Trump’s unusual level of treatment so early after discovery of his illness he was in “uncharted territory.” But the doctor also was upbeat at an afternoon briefing and said the president could resume his normal schedule once “there is no evidence of live virus still present.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 can be contagious for as many — and should isolate for at least — 10 days.Trump’s arrival back at the White House raised new questions about how the administration was going to protect other officials from a disease that remains rampant in the president’s body. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had tested positive for the virus Monday morning and was entering quarantine.There were also lingering questions about potential long term effects to the president — and even when he first came down with the virusConley repeatedly declined to share results of medical scans of Trump’s lungs, saying he was not at liberty to discuss the information because Trump did not waive doctor-patient confidentiality on the subject. Covid-19 has been known to cause significant damage to the lungs of some patients. Conley also declined to share the date of Trump’s most recent negative test for the virus — a critical point for contact tracing and understanding where Trump was in the course of the disease.Only a day earlier, Trump suggested he had finally grasped the true nature of the virus, saying in a video, “I get it.” But then on Sunday afternoon, he ventured out of the hospital while contagious to salute cheering supporters by motorcade — an outing that disregarded precautions meant to contain the virus.At the hospital, doctors revealed that his blood oxygen level had dropped suddenly twice in recent days and that they gave him a steroid typically only recommended for the very sick.Trump’s experience with the disease has been dramatically different from most Americans, who do not have access to the same kind of monitoring and care. While most must cope with their symptoms — and fear of whether they’ll take a turn for the worse — at home and alone, Trump has been staying in the presidential suite of one of the nation’s best hospitals and has been given experimental drugs not readily available to the public. He returns to the White House where there is a team of doctors on call with 24-hour monitoring.Trump was leaving the hospital after receiving a fourth dose of the antiviral drug remdesivir Monday evening, Conley said. He will receive the fifth and final dose Tuesday at the White House.Vice President Mike Pence returned to the campaign trail moments after Trump announced he would soon leave the hospital. The vice president boarded Air Force Two to fly to Salt Lake City, where he is to face off against Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday.Trump, in his new video, defended his decision to repeatedly flout his own administration’s guidelines to slow the spread of the virus, including by holding rallies with thousands of largely maskless supporters.Apparently referring to any potential danger to himself rather than others, he said, “I stood out front. I led. Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did.” He added, “And I know there’s a risk, there’s a danger. But that’s OK. And now I’m better. And maybe I’m immune, I don’t know.”Even before Trump’s motorcade outing on Sunday, some Secret Service agents had expressed concern about the lackadaisical attitude toward masks and social distancing inside the White House, but there isn’t much they can do, according to agents and officials who spoke to The Associated Press.Trump’s aggressive course of treatment included the steroid dexamethasone and the single dose he was given Friday of an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that supplies antibodies to help the immune system fight the virus. Trump on Friday also began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways — the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus, and remdesivir curbs the virus’ ability to multiply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-still-infectious-back-at-white-house-without-mask/story-O2iB2UuhUqiV2VcGoKnykM.html
06-10-2020||World||Joe Biden urges Donald Trump to support nationwide mask mandate||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Monday urged President Donald Trump to support a nationwide mask mandate to effectively launch a fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “My prayers continue to be with the president and the First Lady for their health and safety as they are like so many American families who are dealing with Covid-19,” Biden said at a campaign event in the swing state of Florida. Last Thursday, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19. The president was admitted to a military hospital for necessary treatment. “I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this listen to scientists. Support masks,” Biden said hours before Trump is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital. Requesting Trump to support a nationwide mandate that requires masks in every federal building and facility, Biden said, “Urge every governor and mayor to do the same. We know it saves lives.” “His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. I believe that was wrong and not very rational,” the former vice president added. Biden, who as per latest polls, has widened his lead over Trump by double digits, has been an ardent advocate of making masks mandatory nationwide. This he argues will save a lot of lives. Experts say that universal masking could have saved 100000 lives between now and January, he said. “You know I backed that mandate months ago; he should back it now,” Biden said. “Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, more than 100,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID and this week at least 5,000 more will die in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful but our nation’s COVID-19 crisis is far far from over,” he added. Nearly 210,000 Americans have died due to the virus so far with about 7.5 million contracting the infection. This pandemic and the economic collapse have hit the Hispanic communities hard, Biden said. Biden said some economists are calling this a K-shaped recovery. It means essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic who have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic, are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in the modern American history, Biden said. While workers are struggling, it’s true the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well, making an additional USD300 billion since the Covid-19 broke out, said the former vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-donald-trump-to-support-nationwide-mask-mandate/story-cbdRzO8FsK2a35bAIEyofO.html
06-10-2020||World||Mike Pence, Kamala Harris all set for vice-presidential debate on Wednesday||Vice President Mike Pence and his Democratic challenger Senator Kamala Harris are all set for a debate in the Sal Lake City of Utah on Wednesday. This will be for the first time in the American history that an Indian origin person will be taking up the podium for a vice presidential debate. Political analysts believe that an aggressive Harris, 55, will easily prevail over Pence, 61, during the only vice-presidential debate and help her running mate Joe Biden, 77, to widen his lead over Trump, 74. Biden, in the last few days, has widened his lead over Trump by double digit. However, the Trump Campaign believes that Pence could come out with a stellar performance during the debate. The debate gains added significance, given the Covid-19 infecting Trump, triggering speculations that Pence may be taking over the reigns of the country temporarily. Also, many believe that Harris will be the real force in a Biden administration. Both Pence and Harris has said that they are well prepared for the debate, which would be moderated by journalist Susan Page, Washington Bureau Chief, USA Today. According to media reports, plexiglass will be installed between Pence and Harris on the debate stage. “The debates are a crucial part of making our democracy work and I am honored to participate,” Page said in a statement. The debate will be divided into nine segments of approximately 10 minutes each, said the Commission on Presidential Debate. The moderator will ask an opening question after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic, it said. “We’re looking very much forward to the vice-presidential debate,” Pence told reporters at the Andrews Joint Air Force Base here. “The stakes in this election have never been higher, the choice has never been clearer, and I look forward to the opportunity to take our case to the American people for four more years for President Donald Trump in the White House,” he said. Pence spoke over the phone with Trump before boarding Air Force Two. “I spoke to the President a little while back and he sounded great. As the American people learned just a little while ago, President Trump is going home tonight. So, we’re headed to Utah for the vice presidential debate,” Pence said. According to his aides, Pence has some debate preparations. Harris is already in Utah. On Sunday Harris toured This Is The Place Monument, the location marking the end of the 1,300-mile trek to Utah by the early Mormons. Harris was led by former Utah State Senator Scott Howell on the tour of the monument, which was erected in 1847 and also honors the Native Americans, Mountain Men and Spanish Catholic priests who explored the land before the settlement was established. “Vice-presidential debates can often be afterthoughts in a presidential race. But with President Trump in the hospital, Mike Pence and Kamala Harris will now face an unusual amount of scrutiny and a tricky balancing act,” The New York Times wrote. Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said it would be a real mistake to underestimate the skills of Pence. Buttigieg is apparently helping Harris in debate preparations. “He was very effective in 2016. And also in his debates, if you look in 2012, when he was running for governor, it would be a real mistake to underestimate. Largely because he doesn’t seem to have any qualms about defending what many of us would consider indefensible, even if it flies in the face of his own professed values,” he told Indianapolis Monthly in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-kamala-harris-all-set-for-vice-presidential-debate-on-wednesday/story-sNOBaLzITx9L7wyK4wHMtJ.html
06-10-2020||World||Donald Trump returns to White House after 4-day stay at hospital||US President Donald Trump returned to the White House Monday night after spending four days at a military hospital where he was treated for coronavirus.Trump, 77, looked healthy. Showing his fitness, Trump in an unusual decision climbed up the South Portico stairs, instead of the elevators, to go to his residence. He waived at reporters.The president, after taking off his mask, stood up in the portico facing South Lawns for a few minutes and saluted Marine One.Earlier, he was discharged from the Walter Reed National Medical Center after doctors treating him found that he was fit enough to go back home.“Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!! The Fake News only shows the Fake Polls,” Trump said in a tweet moments before leaving Walter Reed National Medical Center in Bethesda, a Maryland suburb of Washington DC.His former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president was strong and upbeat. “He’s a fighter and will not quit battling this virus or surrender to the liberal mob and forces out to destroy our country,” Sanders said in a tweet.Before boarding Marine One at Walter Reed, Trump told reporters that he was feeling good.White House physician Dr Sean Conley told reporters at the Walter Reed National Military Center, Trump has exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria and has received another dose of remdesivir drug in his treatment of Covid-19.“Over the past 24 hours, the president has continued to improve. He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria. He has received another dose of remdesivir you’re here today, and then we plan to get him home,” he said. “It’s been more than 72 hours since his last fever. Oxygen levels, including ambulatory saturations and his work of breathing or all normal though. He may not entirely be out of the woods, yet the team and I agree that all our evaluations and most importantly, his clinical status support the president’s safe return home, where he’ll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24 seven,” Dr Conley said.Dr Sean Dooley, a pulmonary critical care physician, told reporters that the president continues to do very well.His vital signs this morning, temperature was 98.1, his blood pressure 134 and 78 and respiratory rate 17 per minute. His heart rate was 68 beats per minute and his last Oxo hemoglobin saturation was 97 per cent on room air, he said.He currently does not endorse any respiratory complaints, the physician said.According to Dr Brian Garibaldi, director of Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit, on Sunday evening, the president received his third dose of remdesivir and he tolerated that infusion without difficulty.His kidney and liver function continued to be normal, he said.“Our plan is to give the fourth dose of remdesivir this evening, before he goes back to the White House, and we’ve made arrangements to deliver the fifth and final dose of his treatment course at the White House tomorrow evening,” Garibaldi added.“He continues on dexamethazone and again. The plan for today is to continue to be up and out of bed, eat, and drink and work as he is able,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-leaves-hospital-to-return-to-white-house/story-4ny26vIEC3LvMetVpxEnXM.html

Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”“The President has continued to improve,” Sean Conley, the president’s physician told reporters, “He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria and (will) receive another dose of Remdesivir here today. And then we plan to get him home.”“He is back,” he added.The team planned to discharge him later after administering the fourth dose of Remdesivir, the anti-viral drug that is known to cut recovery time for Covid-19 patients. They did not say if he will continue to also get Dexamethasone, a steroid he was given earlier to prevent oxygen levels from dropping.Asked how safe was it for the president to return to the White House when he was still not out of the 7 to 10 days period, Conley said the team was being “cautiously optimistic, and on guard, because we’re in a bit of uncharted territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course”.“So, we’re looking to this weekend. If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief.”The medical team had said Sunday that they had expected to discharge the president on Monday because had been doing well. Trump was airlifted to the Walter Reed Medical Hospital Center on Friday after he showed symptoms of severe Covid-19, high fever and a rapid drop in blood oxygen levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-feel-better-than-i-did-20-years-ago-says-donald-trump-to-leave-hospital-later-in-the-day/story-1VMdB89z5TfNflpCRh0xfL.html

Claims of Indian-origin candidates such as Sundip Meghani were ignored in favour of Webbe, who went on to win in the Labour stronghold with a smaller margin.Jenny Hopkins of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: “The CPS has today decided that Claudia Webbe, MP for Leicester East, should be charged with an offence of harassment against one female”.“The CPS made the decision after receiving a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police”.“Criminal proceedings against Ms Webbe are now active and she has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings,” she added.The identity of the woman who was allegedly harassed by Webbe was not disclosed.Webbe, who was suspended by Labour after the CPS statement, said: “I am innocent of any wrongdoing and look forward to proving this in court. I will be vigorously defending myself against these claims.”Meghani, who resigned from Labour in August after 20 years in the party, was among several Indian-origin candidates who were ignored by Labour in the 2019 election, including Navin Shah and Kailash Chand. It was another point of ennui for the Indian community that was already upset with the party’s pro-interventionist resolution on Jammu and Kashmir.Labour Friends of India, a prominent lobby group within the party, had expressed its dismay over candidate selection and warned the leadership under Corbyn not to take the support of the 1.5 million-strong Indian community for granted.“We express regret that the Labour party has selected just one candidate of Indian heritage in 39 safe seats, and no Indian heritage candidate in 100 target seats…Despite shortlisting or selecting candidates in areas with a large Indian community such as Leicester, Ealing, Ilford, West Bromwich and Derby, no Indian-heritage candidates were selected”, the group had said.“There is a risk this failure to increase representation of Indians in parliament could hit Labour further…The Labour party must ensure it is never seen to take the support of the Indian community for granted”, it added.Keir Starmer, who replaced Corbyn as the party leader earlier this year, has promised a new leadership style that draws a line under the conflicts triggered during his predecessor’s tenure. He has since made pro-India and pro-Indian community overtures since taking over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-mp-of-uk-s-little-india-faces-criminal-charge-for-harassment/story-iHN3FU2lw9EHObD6AC7kQO.html
06-10-2020||World||Manali Desai first Indian-origin woman to head a Cambridge dept||Sociologist Manali Desai has been appointed head of the department of sociology at the University of Cambridge, making her not only the first Indian-origin woman to head a department in the 811-year-old university but also the first woman of colour to hold such a role. Desai, who calls herself a “hybrid child of three different cultures”, said she was born in the US but moved early to India and studied in Modern School, Delhi. She later moved to London and completed her last two years of school there. She then moved to the US and studied Economics at the University of Michigan and completed a PhD in Sociology at the University of California Los Angeles. She previously taught in the US and at the London School of Economics before joining Cambridge in 2013. The department said: “Manali Desai takes up the chair in Sociology this year, and in doing so becomes the first woman of colour, to our knowledge, to lead a Cambridge department in the University’s 811-year history”. Much of her research has focused on Indian politics and social movements, including the transformation of identities and interests during the long transition from the colonial to post-colonial periods. Her books include a focus on India-linked themes such as gender and violence, state formation and radical democracy. Desai was awarded the 2019 Pilkington Teaching Prize, in recognition of her commitment to and impact on teaching at Cambridge. A fellow of Newnham College, she is among several Indian-origin scholars who have taught in Cambridge over the centuries. Desai said on being appointed to the new role: “We are living through a period of ferment and we are at a crucial juncture when fundamental questions about our very existence are at stake. The discipline of sociology has always tackled the big questions, be it climate change, war, poverty, and intersectional social inequalities. “We have witnessed dramatic transformations and ruptures in recent years, with the global pandemic and movements for social change such as Black Lives Matter coming on the heels of austerity and the rise of global populism, to name a few”. “Sociology gives us the tools to be able to investigate and understand the world around us and so I think the department is a good place to be during periods of such upheaval,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manali-desai-first-indian-origin-woman-to-head-a-cambridge-dept/story-qXBXkcjBQ99LzlHJKHtujN.html
06-10-2020||World||UK crime officials seize £300,000 from Indian-origin couple||Britain’s crime prevention officials and Scotland Yard have recovered from an Indian-origin couple more than £300,000 (around 2.8 crore rupees) in cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said on Tuesday that searches of a house belonging to husband and wife Sailesh and Harkit Singara in Edgware in north-west London revealed a total of more than £200,000, around half of it neatly stacked on a bed. Another £100,000 was found in a suitcase on the floor. The total amount seized was £306,805.Nearby, officers found a further £100,000 in a bag which was in the possession of Sailesh Mandalia, a business associate of Singara. Believing the money to be the proceeds of crime, investigators applied for a forfeiture order, which is a civil process intended to recover illicit cash where there has been no proven criminal offence.Mandalia and the couple, who own two money service companies, appealed against the forfeiture, asserting that the cash was intended for legitimate business accounts, and that poor accounting over several years was responsible for any confusion.But on September 10, the Southwark Crown Court dismissed their appeal, instructing the three respondents to pay costs of a combined £4,350, the NCA said.Detective chief inspector Tony O’Sullivan said: “While the three individuals are not accused, and have not been convicted of any crime in relation to these events, the £300,000 recovered will now go into the public purse where it can positively impact on communities.”“Money is at the heart of organised crime, and it is vital that those in possession of huge sums of cash can account for it legitimately”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-crime-officials-seize-300-000-from-indian-origin-couple/story-Qg8zVCfG5h72tiCTN1BjvN.html

US-born and UK-educated Doshi’s novel has received rave reviews.Margaret Busby, chair of the 2020 judges, said: “The shortlist of six came together unexpectedly, voices and characters resonating with us all even when very different. We are delighted to help disseminate these chronicles of creative humanity to a global audience.”“The novels on this year’s shortlist range in setting from an unusual child growing up in working-class Glasgow in the 1980s, to a woman coping with a post-colonial nightmare in Zimbabwe”. “Along the way we meet a man struggling with racism on a university campus, join a trek in the wilderness after an environmental disaster, eavesdrop on a woman coping with her ageing mother as they travel across India and in an exploration of female power discover how ordinary people rose up in 1930s Ethiopia to defend their country against invading Italians”. Gaby Wood of the Booker Prize Foundation added: “Every year, judging the Booker Prize is an act of discovery. What’s out there, how can we widen the net, how do these books seem when compared to one another, how do they fare when re-read? These are questions judges always ask themselves, and each other”.The 2020 winner will be announced on November 17 in an event broadcast from London’s Roundhouse in collaboration with BBC Arts.

06-10-2020||World||Indian-origin politician dropped from London mayor candidate list for anti-semitism||Britain’s Liberal Democrats have dropped Geeta Sidhu-Robb as one of their candidates for London mayor and suspended her from the party after a video emerged of her making anti-semitic remarks during the 1997 general election.The lawyer and businesswoman, who has roots in Punjab, was the Conservative candidate in Blackburn, Lancashire in the 1997 election. Her opponent was senior Labour leader Jack Straw.Footage from that election campaign, revealed by PoliticsHome website, shows Sidhu-Robb saying she planned to inform voters about Straw’s faith, adding, “how is a Muslim going to vote for someone who is Jewish?” She is then seen going around in a car in Blackburn, appealing to voters on a loudspeaker in Urdu.“Don’t vote for a Jew, Jack Straw is a Jew,” she is seen as saying about her rival candidate, who held various cabinet positions in the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments, including as foreign secretary.Straw is a Christian, but has some Jewish ancestry. The Blackburn constituency has a large Muslim minority, around 25% of the population.The video sparked an investigation by Liberal Democrats, the third largest party in UK after Labour and Conservatives. A Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: “Geeta Sidhu-Robb has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats and will not be on the ballot paper to be the Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London”.Sidhu-Robb apologised after the footage emerged. “I am deeply ashamed of the ignorant and abusive language I used on one occasion in the 1997 General Election campaign. As shown in the footage, I instantly regretted my appalling behaviour, which I continue to do,” she tweeted. “Those words are entirely inconsistent with my views and values, and though there are no excuses for my actions, there is some context; that is, that I was under a great deal of strain and retaliated to the racial abuse I was receiving in Blackburn ‘like for like’.”“Two wrongs never make a right. I made a mistake and I take responsibility for my abhorrent actions 23 years ago, they were never repeated. I urge you to judge me on who I am today, a campaigner committed to eradicating inequality and discrimination in all its forms,” she added.The London mayoral election was due in May, but has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Sidhu-Robb was shortlisted for the mayoral candidacy alongside Liberal Democrats councillor Luisa Porrit, with the contest due to run until October 13. The party, which formed a coalition government with the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2010 to 2015, is finalising its candidate after Siobhan Benita, who was to contest against mayor Sadiq Khan, withdrew recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-politician-dropped-from-london-mayor-candidate-list-for-anti-semitism/story-vmscOCiUTW2FyKFxWdCigL.html

Of them, four were active in Gangaloor area committee of Maoists, which was being headed by Vijja while Santosh was active in Pamed area committee, the IG said, adding that more details on the killings are being collected.Vijja, a ‘divisional committee member’ cadre who was involved in killing of villagers in Bijapur, was shot dead on October 1, Sundarraj said.“Police had been receiving information about differences between senior and lower-rung cadres with regard to the brutal approach adopted by top ultras towards local villagers from a couple of months.“The recent killings of villagers by naxals in Bijapur after branding them as police informers further escalated the tension,” the IG said. He said the killing of six naxals, including Vijja, seems like eruption of a gang war between different groups within the banned outfit.Terming it as a “crucial” development, the senior police officer said security forces have been keeping a close watch on happenings within the Maoist organisation and are taking strategic action accordingly.Since the beginning of this year, 43 civilians have been killed in naxal-related incidents in Bastar division, including 11 in four districts in September, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-kill-five-of-their-own-members-in-chhattisgarh/story-PcvmSpkFFAUNSYyQcycysO.html

This was the first face-to-face meeting between Jaishankar and Pompeo since the Covid-19 outbreak snapped foreign travel by world leaders, though they have spoken on several occasions and participated in virtual multilateral meetings in the past few months. During their meeting on the margins of the consultations of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, Pompeo and Jaishankar discussed ongoing bilateral and multilateral cooperation on topics of international concern, said US state department spokesperson Cale Brown. “They reaffirmed the strength of the US-India relationship, reviewed our efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, and asserted the need to work together to advance peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,” Brown said. Jaishankar and Pompeo also agreed to continue close cooperation on a range of regional and international issues and looked forward to the 2+2 dialogue of the foreign and defence ministers of the two sides later this year, he added. “Began my Tokyo visit with a bilateral meeting with @SecPompeo. Pleased to see the progress of our partnership in so many fields. Will work together for stability and prosperity in the Indo- Pacific,” Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting. Jaishankar is also set to hold bilateral meetings with his Australian counterpart Marise Payne and his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi. Pompeo, Payne and Jaishankar also met Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga before the Quad consultations. Suga outlined the challenges facing the world community following the Covid-19 outbreak and said it was “all the more necessary to further deepen ties with many more countries which share the vision of a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ and build concrete cooperation with them, according to Japan’s foreign ministry. The visiting foreign ministers agreed on the importance of “reinforcing a rules-based, free and open international order through cooperation among Japan, Australia, India and the US”. They also confirmed further collaboration among the four countries for the peace and stability of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mike-pompeo-jaishankar-meet-in-tokyo-review-bilateral-ties-and-plans-to-tackle-covid-19/story-IcMvuBhc7GZKrtkMZXCJeI.html
06-10-2020||India||Odisha dithers over its farming ordinances as monsoon session ends||Having opposed the farm bills on opening of agricultural sale and marketing outside the APMC mandis for farmers, as well as allowing contract farming last month, the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha may have quietly shelved two of its own farm ordinances with similar provisions from being converted to laws.Though the Naveen Patnaik government had listed Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, and Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, among the 10 ordinances, in the monsoon session of the Assembly for converting them into bills, it has now quietly shelved the idea.The two ordinances promulgated in May this year aimed at registration farmers with contract farming companies for improving production and productivity and amendment of Odisha Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1957, for geographically restriction-free trade and transaction of agricultural produce including livestock across the state and country. With the monsoon session of the Assembly adjourned today, a day ahead of the schedule, the chance of the twin ordinances becoming law may be a remote possibility now.Also read: NDA seat-sharing pact sealed, Nitish Kumar jabs ex-ally Chirag PaswanSenior Congress leader Narasingha Mishra said by shelving the twin ordinances, the government may be hoping to get some breathing time as there is anger brewing against the twin farm laws - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act - passed by the Parliament last month.“The Naveen Patnaik government brought two of its farm ordinances in May this year ahead of the central ordinances. There is not much difference between the central ordinances as well as state ordinances. During the all-party meeting last month, I had raised the issue with the parliamentary affairs minister but I did not get a satisfactory reply. Now, it is clear that the BJD government does not want to confront the farming community of the state by converting the ordinances into laws during the pandemic. It would have been better had they been forthcoming about it. But it’s unfortunate that they are hush about the whole thing,” said Mishra.Last month, the BJD had opposed the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of the Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, alleging that they had little provision for small and marginal farmers as well as sharecroppers. “We can’t support the bill till we are sure that farmers’ interest will be protected,” said BJD leader and Rajya Sabha member Prasanna Acharya.However, the Odisha cooperation department, which had piloted the twin farm ordinances in a comparative analysis done in July, had admitted that there is not much difference between the central ordinance (now enacted into law) and state ordinances. As per the comparative analysis, the Odisha ordinance allows a farmer to enter into a written farming agreement for any farming produce which is same as per the central Act. The Odisha ordinance has only provisions of state government collecting a facilitation fee of maximum 4 percent from the corporate houses that come for contract farming while there are no such features in the central law.Similarly, the period of agreement for contract farming in the central Act is minimum of one crop season/one production cycle (for livestock) to maximum of 5 years, while in the state ordinance the minimum agreement period is of one crop season.Parliamentary affairs minister Bikram Keshari Arukh said the two ordinances were supposed to have been introduced as bills in the monsoon session but for some reasons, they could not be introduced in the Assembly session. “We may introduce the bill in the winter session. But nothing has been decided as yet,” he said. Minister and secretary of cooperation department, however, did not respond when asked why the two ordinances were not brought in as bills despite the initial announcement.BJP leader Bhrugu Buxipatra said the BJD’s rethinking on the two ordinances may have been a ploy to hoodwink the people of the state. “The BJD would have supported the farm bills in the Parliament but for the CBI raids in the chit fund scam. The similarity of state government’s ordinances on farming with the central laws speaks much about the BJD’s confusion,” he said.However, BJD MP Amar Patnaik said Odisha ordinance on farming was different from central laws. “Our ordinance takes care of small and marginal farmers which is lacking in the central law. There is still time for the state ordinances to get passed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-dithers-over-its-farming-ordinances-as-monsoon-session-ends/story-KHbqhVJI3xKgthCzAib1HL.html
06-10-2020||India||DCGI nod to Phase-1 human trials of ‘antisera’ with potential to treat Covid-19||The Drugs Controller General of India has given permission for conducting Phase-1 human clinical trial for an “antisera” that was developed by injecting inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in horses and can be a potential treatment for Covid-19, ICMR officials said on Tuesday.The ‘antisera’ has been developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in collaboration with a Hyderabad-based bio-pharmaceutical firm. “With Biological E Limited we have developed an horse ‘antisera’ and we have just got clearance for conducting clinical trials for that,” ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bhargava said at press briefing on Tuesday.The ‘antisera’ is yet to undergo human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy.Antisera are blood serum high in antibodies against specific antigens and are injected in humans to help kickstart the immune system to fight specific infections. “The ICMR and Biological E Limited, Hyderabad, have developed highly purified antisera (raised in animals) for prophylaxis and treatment of Covid-19,” the apex health research body had earlier said in a tweet.   The pre-print version of the study regarding the development of the equine antisera has been posted on the Research Square platform.“The study provides evidence of the potential of generating highly purified F(ab’)2 from equines against SARS-CoV-2 that can demonstrate consistent and high neutralisation activity,” the study paper said.  “Further, in-vivo testing for efficacy of this indigenously developed, cost effective product will pave the way to clinical evaluation. Additionally, being a donor independent method, this may prove as an efficient alternative to convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19 patients,” it said.   Earlier such measures were used for controlling several viral and bacterial infections.   “Although, plasma recovered from patients experiencing Covid-19 could serve similar purpose, the profile of antibodies, their efficacy and concentration keep varying from one patient to another and therefore, make it an unreliable clinical tool for patient management,” the ICMR had said in a tweet.“Standardisation achievable through equine sera based treatment modality thus stands out as yet another remarkable public health initiative supported by ICMR in the time of Covid-19,” it said.As part of the study, 10 healthy horses were immunised with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and after 21 days of immunisation, plasma samples were tested.The results of the plasma samples indicated presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies as detected in ELISA with neutralising capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-nod-to-phase-1-human-trials-of-antisera-with-potential-to-treat-covid-19/story-rWJg4y02cjXBXxE1630MyN.html

I come from a hardcore theatre background and am habitual of performing in front of live audience while for TV, web or films we have to emote for camera. I took time to adjust with the change but now I enjoy every bit of it. After a few projects now, I’m all game performing for the camera,” he said.Abhishek started his digital career with the series ‘Cubicles’. Talking about his early days, he said, “Since my school and college days in Delhi, I knew my calling was acting. So, I relocated to Mumbai and did one-year theatre course and then I was all set to kick-start my career. I auditioned for several projects and after few months I got a call for a web series. And that’s how ‘Undekhi’ happened. I’m glad that my character Rishi earned so much love and recognition. Both my series proved to be a turning point in my career. I miss not being part of the further seasons.” Currently, Abhishek is enjoying the success of his recently released Varanasi-based film ‘Bahut Hua Samman’ and is busy shooting for his next series. “All my previous work has been very close to what I wanted to do as a beginner and at present whatever projects I am doing or being offered have a strong storyline and well-carved characters. So, let’s wait and watch,” he shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-enjoy-every-bit-of-being-in-front-of-the-camera/story-UvjSJ8IugIKNBvDBD8aPMP.html

Earlier, the unit was quarantined and rapid tests were also done. ‘Ab bhagwan ka naam lekar kaam karna hai’ because self-safety is the key. Due to the pandemic everything has gone haywire. One of the actors got stuck so we had to replace him and now have to re-shoot some portions.” Before this he shot for a government commercial in Delhi. “I stayed there for a few days and then headed for Vrindavan for a day to meet my mother.

06-10-2020||India||BJP releases list of candidates for Madhya Pradesh, Telangana bypolls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday released a list of candidates for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh and Telangana bypolls.The BJP named 28 candidates for Madhya Pradesh bypolls and one candidate for by-election in Telangana.Voting on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh bypolls will take place on November 3 and the results will be declared on November 10, the Election Commission of India had announced.Out of the 28 seats, 27 were won by the Congress in the 2018 state elections. The last date for filing the nomination papers is October 16. Scrutiny of nomination papers will take place the next day, while nomination papers can be withdrawn by October 19, according to the bypoll schedule.The bypolls were necessitated on three of the seats Joura, Agar and Biora due to death of the MLAs - two from the Congress and one from BJP - and on the remaining seats due to resignation of the then Congress MLAs. Out of the 25 Congress MLAs, 22 resigned in March this year in an act of rebellion against the then chief minister Kamal Nath. The remaining three resigned later. All of these leaders who resigned from the state assembly subsequently joined the BJP.In the 230-member assembly, the BJP has 107 MLAs and the Congress 88.

06-10-2020||India||Chief secretaries of Delhi, NCR states to appear in SC over stubble burning||Concerns over stubble burning turning out to be a potent killer in times of Covid-19 pandemic echoed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday with a concerned bench moving swiftly to post two applications and a separate petition on the issue for October 16 and asking chief secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh to remain present on that day.The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde sensed the urgency of the situation as it said, “It is an important issue or else the whole air will go bad.”The Court was hearing a petition filed by two young environmental activists – a Class 12 student, who under his initiative ‘Plant a Million Trees’, has planted 1.5 lakh trees in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), and a third-year law student who is an active campaigner against the use of single-use plastic. The petition demanded the Court to bring a stop to stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana which pose a threat to the health of citizens in Delhi-NCR.Along with the petition, the Court heard two applications as part of the MC Mehta case which deals with environmental pollution in Delhi-NCR. Vikrant Tongad, member of the Zila Samiti on the issue of crop burning for Gautam Buddh Nagar district, UP, demanded ‘Happy Seeder’ machines, meant to mechanically remove the stubble, to be mandatorily issued to farmers either for free or on subsidized rates. For preventing crop fires, he suggested satellite-based geospatial technology that is already in use by the Centre for mapping and preventing forest fires. Also read: Lockdown hit food security of children, says rights bodyAlthough in the past, the Supreme Court had ordered the states of Punjab, UP and Haryana to provide cash incentives to farmers who do not resort to crop burning, Tongad suggested that the Court may consider making payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers subject to verification that they have not resorted to stubble burning. The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “Let Union of India file reply… Let the chief secretaries of the States viz., Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, be present before this Court on the next date of hearing.” The second application was filed by a Supreme Court lawyer Manali Singhal who, through her plea, sought immediate curbs on stubble burning. She produced international research which showed how air pollution can “exacerbate” spread of Covid-19 infection, posing high risk to senior citizens, children and people with respiratory illness. The application suggested the appointment of an officer or Commissioner to enforce the Court’s past orders to end stubble burning. Such powers are available to an officer appointed under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the application stated. The bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta if such an officer has been appointed. Mehta said he will seek instructions and inform the Court. Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, who is assisting the Court as Amicus Curiae (friend of the Court), responded by saying that over the past years, the Court is getting assistance on stubble burning and related environmental issues from a statutory authority called the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), which has been submitting regular reports to the Court. Just before Tuesday’s hearing, the EPCA filed a report showing how the state governments had assured the Supreme Court in November 2019 that all measures are in place. This assurance was recorded by the Court in its order of July 30 and August 24 this year. “The chief secretaries of the neighbouring states are present here. The Court must ask them as to why despite repeated assurances in the past, stubble burning continues to happen?” The Court was of the view that the issue required an expert to deal with the situation. “Suggest impartial people who can examine this issue. How can courts go into this,” the bench remarked. One of the applicants suggested appointing former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur. Amicus curiae informed the Court that the EPCA is the expert body constituted under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act. Delhi government, represented by advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, informed the Court that the issue need not require a separate agency to supervise as the Court has been “hand-holding” the issue over the past many years. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the separate petition by the two young environmental activists, told the Court that he will suggest names of few independent experts. In his petition, Singh argued, “The consequence of allowing any stubble burning to take place in the times of this pandemic will be catastrophic… enhanced pollution level can offer “direct pathway for airborne transmission” of Covid-19 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chief-secretaries-of-delhi-ncr-states-to-appear-in-sc-over-stubble-burning/story-aLbN6xnf67nI3aCXJ3l2PM.html

06-10-2020||India||India’s wildlife, biodiversity equally imperative as its developmental needs: PM Modi||India’s developmental needs are paramount but wildlife and biodiversity are equally imperative, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday. In his message to the nation to mark the celebration of the ongoing Wildlife Week, the prime minister said India’s commitment to wildlife protection and conservation is strong. “Wildlife conservation is ingrained in our ethos and has always been an integral part of our tradition and culture. Our holy Constitution also enshrines this philosophy by including conservation of forest and wildlife as one of the fundamental duties of every Indian. “India harbours 17 per cent of world population within 2.4 per cent land area of the world. Developmental needs of the country are paramount. However, we believe wildlife and biodiversity conservation are equally imperative,” Modi said in a written message. He said that with a robust and wide network of protected areas, the country’s commitment to words wildlife protection is as strong as ever. “Eco-sensitive zones provide a peripheral support and act as a buffer around national parks and sanctuaries. Taking great strides in this direction, several such zones have been notified to enhance the space availability for thriving wildlife,” Modi said. He said India remains a natural home to a variety of migratory species and for this reason, Gandhinagar declaration, which was adopted during the 13th Conference of Parties to Convention on Migratory Species in February this year, prioritised the integration of the concept of ecological connectivity into the ‘Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’.  “We are emphasising on the conservation of migratory birds and marine species,” he said. Prime Minister Modi also took pride in India being home to wild Asiatic lions and tigers, saying the result of the concerted efforts of the nation in conserving wildlife are showing. “Our country hosts the last wild population of Asiatic lions. It also possesses the distinction of having the highest number of tigers in the world. The result of the concerted efforts of the nation towards conserving our wildlife are showing. The resolve of doubling tiger numbers has been fulfilled. We have achieved this target well in advance. “Encouraged by the success stories of Project Tiger and Project Elephant, we are now making efforts to conserve other endangered species through Project Lion and Project Dolphin. Contribution from people from all walks of life will help attain the desired goals of these projects,” he said. He also said that India gives a special attention to plastic waste management.  “We are resolute in our efforts to reduce single use plastic and micro plastic pollution for sustainable development along with a prospering biodiversity,” he said. Lastly, he said that “coinciding with the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of peace and nonviolence, the celebration of ‘Wildlife Week’ is an ideal location to reaffirm our commitment towards conservation of wildlife and harmonious coexistence of all living beings”.  Wildlife Week is organised from October 2-8 every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-wildlife-biodiversity-equally-imperative-as-its-developmental-needs-pm-modi/story-JRFJNzsVyrAHhNPm3ap1mK.html

Besides Khandelwal, the agency also arrested Naresh Jain, the group’s internal auditor. The arrests have been made under section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). Both the accused were produced before the Special Judge (PMLA) and were granted seven days of ED custody. The ED had claimed that the firm defaulted on loan payments worth Rs 3,642 crore. During the seven-day custody, ED officials intend to grill the two in relation with the irregularities and collect more evidence. Earlier this year, the ED conducted raids at premises belonging to the senior management of Cox and Kings Group (CKG) in connection with the money laundering probe.On March 8, the agency arrested the bank’s former chairman and managing director Rana Kapoor. The travel company was sent to bankruptcy court last year in October after defaulting on payments to the bank. The ED had been scanning its transactions to its borrowers.Also read: Days after meeting Amit Shah, Jagan Reddy meets PM Modi; seeks Centre’s help for 3 capitalsPMLA investigation in the Yes Bank case revealed that the CKG forged it’s consolidated financials by manipulating the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries. Besides, some board resolutions submitted to banks for sanctioning the loans were also found to be forged. “Further investigation revealed that the loan sanction from Yes bank was driven by Kapoor and was given bypassing the norms. The ED gathered the evidence regarding Kapoor’s direction to the concerned bank officials to get the said loan continued and not to take efforts to recover it,” the agency statement noted. As per the investigation, sales worth Rs 3,908 crore was made to 15 non-existent/fictitious customers during the financial years (FY) 2015 to 2019. Majority of collection shown in ledgers from Ezeego (another group entity of CKG ) was not found in the bank statements.

The group was found to have diverted Rs 1,100 crore to another company without any approval of the board. It was also found that Khandelwal and Jain acquired the mortgaged property amounting to Rs 63 crore in their owned business entity named M/s Reward Business Solutions without paying a penny from their pocket. The agency stated that the duo had also purchased various immovable properties from the funds diverted from the group. “Investigation conducted so far has revealed that the bank transactions of Cox and King Group are not matching with the books of accounts and Anil Khandelwal and Naresh Jain creating disparities between the books of accounts and the bank statements to camouflage the fraud.

06-10-2020||India||Days after meeting Amit Shah, Jagan Reddy meets PM Modi; seeks Centre’s help for 3 capitals||Andhra Pradesh chief minister and YSR Congress party president Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday sought the cooperation of the Centre in the formation of three capital cities for Andhra to facilitate a decentralised administration. In a 40-minute meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, the chief minister is believed to have explained in detail why the state government had to take the decision to form three capitals for the state and how it would help the state achieve all round development. Jagan was accompanied by YSRC parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy and another MP P Mithun Reddy. Though it was widely speculated in the media that the discussion on YSRC joining the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would come up at the meeting between Jagan and Modi, there was no confirmation from either YSRC or the BJP. “The chief minister explained to PM Modi on the prevailing political atmosphere in the state and the legal hurdles being faced by his government in implementing various decisions including the decentralisation of administration and distribution of house sites to the poor,” a YSRC functionary familiar with the development said. An official in the CMO said Jagan had sought liberal financial assistance from the Centre in the decentralised development of the state. He also brought to the notice of the Prime Minister that several issues had been pending unresolved with the Centre since YSRC came to power in May 2019. “Apart from the promises made to the state as per the AP Reorganization Act, including funds due to the state to offset the revenue deficit, the chief minister took up several other issues with the Prime Minister. The meeting took place in a completely cordial atmosphere and the response from the PM was quite encouraging,” the CMO official said. It was the second time Jagan had met Modi this year. The last time the chief minister met the Prime Minister was on February 12, with a long wish list of demands including special category status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-after-meeting-amit-shah-jagan-reddy-meets-pm-modi-seeks-centre-s-help-for-3-capitals/story-mZHNO6IqSK4hShDXdgtBvN.html
06-10-2020||India||‘If Andhra does not stop...’: KCR during meet on Krishna water sharing||The Telangana government on Tuesday threatened to construct a new project across the Krishna river on the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir if Andhra Pradesh goes ahead with the construction of Rayalaseema lift irrigation project on the river. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao made it clear at the apex council meeting convened by Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat through video conference in which Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy participated. KCR accused the Andhra Pradesh government of unilaterally deciding to construct Rayalaseema lift irrigation project on Srisailam reservoir to draw an additional three tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water from Krishna river. “If Andhra Pradesh does not stop the Rayalaseema lift scheme, we, too, will be compelled to construct a new barrage between Alampur-Pedda Marur in Jogulamba Gadwal district to lift three tmc of water from Krishna river,” KCR told the Union minister at the meeting. He said during the combined Andhra Pradesh regime, great injustice was done to Telangana in river water sharing. “Even after bifurcation, if Andhra Pradesh behaves irresponsibly and tries to loot Krishna waters according to its whims and fancies, we will not tolerate. We can also go to any extent to protect the interests of our state,” KCR said. He said the Telangana government had written to the Centre in 2014 itself seeking constitution of a fresh tribunal to decide water sharing between Telangana and Andhra in the wake of bifurcation. “Since there was no response from the Centre, we had to approach the Supreme Court seeking legitimate share to the state in Krishna waters,” he pointed out. While agreeing to the demand of Telangana for a fresh tribunal, Shekawat, however, said no decision could be taken as the issue was before the Supreme Court. KCR said if the Centre agreed to constitute the tribunal, his government would withdraw the petition in the SC. The Telangana chief minister demanded that the Centre allocate river water to the two states project-wise and opposed Andhra Pradesh government’s move to divert Krishna water to Pennar basin. “Even the Krishna river management board also agreed to this principle,” he said. Meanwhile, Shekawat told the reporters in New Delhi that both the Telugu states had agreed to submit to the union government the detailed project reports (DPRs) of all the new irrigation projects they had taken up in the last six years after bifurcation of states. He said the two states had also agreed to shift the Krishna River Management Board’s office to Vijayawada from Hyderabad. The Centre will soon decide the purview of the two river boards, he said.

06-10-2020||India||Supreme Court judgment on scope of right to protest in public places tomorrow||The Supreme Court will pronounce its judgment on Wednesday regarding the scope of right to protest in public places and whether or not there can be limitations to such right.The verdict will be delivered by a 3-judge bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul in a batch of petitions concerning road blockade at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi by protestors who were opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).While the issue concerning Shaheen Bagh itself was rendered infructuous (pointless) since the protests ended after the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and lockdown was imposed, the court heard the parties on the larger issue of right to protest in public places and to what extent it can be regulated and balanced with the right of general public to move without hindrance.“The right to protest should be balanced with the right to movement of public. In a parliamentary democracy, there is a right to protest. But can a public road be blocked for a long time? When and where can protests be held? We will think about how it can be balanced,” the bench which also comprised Justices Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari had remarked during the hearing of the case on September 21.The petition before the Supreme Court was filed by advocate Amit Sahni in February seeking the lifting of the road blockade in the Shaheen Bagh–Kalindi Kunj stretch.The protestors at Shaheen Bagh were opposing the CAA, which was passed on December 12, 2019. The CAA amended Section 2 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 in a manner which made any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan eligible to apply for Indian citizenship by naturalization even if they were illegal migrants.However, the Muslim community did not find a place in the amendment thereby excluding Muslim illegal migrants from availing the opportunity to apply for Indian citizenship, a benefit which was extended to illegal migrants from the other six communities by this amendment. The exclusion of Muslim triggered widespread protests across the country, as did the linking of citizenship with religion.Shaheen Bagh was the epicenter of such protests in the national capital. The protests at Shaheen Bagh started on December 15, 2019 and continued for more than 3 months.The Supreme Court had tasked senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran, on February 17, to mediate with the protestors and come to a constructive solution to resolve the issue but no solution could be arrived at.Most of the protestors, however, left the site by March 23 due to the lockdown imposed in Delhi due to the Coronavirus threat.But the stage and other structures which had been put in place during the protests were retained and a few men and women remained at the site as a symbolic continuation of the protests. Later, the police had dismantled the same.Sahni stated that while people have the right to protest, the same is subject to reasonable restrictions and protestors cannot be allowed to occupy public roads indefinitely. He contended that the right to protest should not inconvenience the public at large.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta representing the Central government also concurred with the petitioner stating that the right to protest cannot be absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions.“Every right is qualified,” Mehta had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-judgment-on-scope-of-right-to-protest-in-public-places-tomorrow/story-sqedcjrNsJ61teNNDpYgHI.html

The police had cane-charged RLD and Samajwadi Party workers in Hathras on Sunday after they allegedly broke the police barricade to reach the Hathras gangrape victim’s village in large numbers. Video footage showed cops raining lathis as RLD cadre formed a protective ring around Jayant Chaudhary. In the first FIR, cases have been filed against RLD district president Rahul Deo, SC/ST cell president Narendra Khajuri and 40 others under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 353 of the IPC and violation of Section 144 of the CrPC at Pallavpuram police station. Party leaders and workers had staged a dharna on National Highway 58 and blocked movement of traffic to protest against the assault on Jayant Choudhary and party supporters in Hathras on Sunday. The protesters also tried to burn the effigy of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. SP (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said the protesters hurled a fireball towards the SHO of Pallavpuram, which caused burn injuries on his neck. They also blocked traffic and therefore a case was registered under Section 307 of the IPC. RLD leader Narendra Khajuri and district president Rahul Deo rejected the allegations of the police, saying: “They have registered cases on serious charges to suppress the voice of dissent. But their misuse of power to please political bosses will not pressurise us to sit quiet.” They claimed that there was a scuffle between protesters and cops over burning effigy, but no one intended to hurt anyone. Meanwhile, another case was registered against RLD leaders Sachin Choudhary, Kanhaiya and 150 unknown protesters in the Civil Lines police station. These people had staged a protest outside the divisional commissioner’s office in Meerut on Sunday and burnt an effigy of the chief minister. They demanded the arrest of cops who assaulted Jayant Choudhary and his supporters in Hathras. Suraj Rai, circle officer of Civil Lines area, said a case had been registered on various charges after identifying protesters through video clips. “A few of them have been named,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-rld-leaders-booked-for-protest-against-lathi-charge-on-jayant-chaudhary/story-Bz0f7E4Dqjr6Z7tQUyQ62L.html

Later, Union minister of state for social justice Ram Dass Athawale reached the village with workers of the Republican Party of India and offered Rs 5 lakh as monetary help to the family. He assured to talk with chief minister Yogi Adityanath on the issue. Earlier in the day, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) also reached the village and returned after investigating more facts. The SIT visited the site where the body of the victim was cremated in the dead of the night. It also went to the crime spot and interacted with people in the village. Athawale justified the CBI probe ordered by the UP chief minister. Also read: Affidavit copy-paste job in bid to cover-up Hathras gangrape, says CongTaking a dig at the Opposition, Athawale said that the Opposition would have sought a CBI probe if the CM had ordered a judicial probe. He consoled the family members and assured to take up the issue with the CM. On September 14, a 19-year-old woman from the Hathras village was gang-raped by four accused who are now in custody. She was and admitted to JN Medical College in Aligarh and was later moved Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Monday last week as her condition deteriorated. She died a week ago. There was much controversy after her body was cremated at 3 am on Wednesday despite family members saying no to the cremation at night and wanting to take her body to their house. Meanwhile, the state government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by senior IPS officer Bhagwan Swaroop who is posted as secretary of home department. Two other members of the SIT are deputy IG Chandra Prakash and Poonam, the commandant of 15th Battalion PAC Agra.

06-10-2020||India||Lockdown hit food security of children, says rights body||The Covid-19 pandemic has likely exacerbated hunger and malnutrition among communities most vulnerable to food insecurity, especially children, an experts’ committee set up by the National Human Rights Commission has said. In an advisory, the rights watchdog has asked the Union ministries of food and public distribution, women and child development and education to urgently restore and expand coverage under various food handout programmes. The human rights commission, which had set up an experts’ panel to study the impact of the lockdown on food security among vulnerable sections, said poor data made it difficult to assess how effective ration services were during the lockdown. Essential nutritional programmes, such as mid-day meals and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), ground to a halt during the lockdown, the rights body said, increasing risks for already vulnerable communities. According to the 2019 Global Hunger Index, India ranked 102nd out of 117 countries, with a score of 30.3. That correlates to a “serious” level of hunger. India’s poor record on nutrition comes despite several key interventions, such as the public distribution (PDS) system under the National food Security Act, ICDS services, anganwadi (child and maternal health) centres and the world’s largest school-meal programme. The ICDS, a federal programme, provides food and primary healthcare to children under 6 years and their mothers. According to the National Family Health Survey-4, 38% of the country’s children under five were stunted (had low height for age) and around 20% children were wasted (low weight for height). More than half of the country’s children are anaemic. “A range of social safety net adaptations went into play after the lockdown, which was good. However, a key challenge right now is a lack of data on the extent to which these efforts have reached poor households, and a lack of data on the current depth and breadth of the food insecurity,” said Purnima Menon, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, New Delhi. In March, the Supreme Court had ordered that mid-day meals in schools and supplementary nutrition under ICDS for children, pregnant and lactating women must be continued during the lockdown through home delivery of dry rations or cash transfers. “In most states, these have not been provided as schools and anganwadi centres remain closed,” the rights body said. Citing a June 2020 report, the rights body said “14 most populous states did not conduct community management of acutely malnourished children and eight states were unable to measure growth parameters of children under six years”. “While 80 crore (800 million) people are covered under the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA), the official projected population for 2019-20 is about 134.1 crore (1.34 billion). The coverage of 81 crore (810 million) persons means that only around 60% of the population is covered by priority ration cards, whereas the NFSA entitles 67% of the population to have priority cards.” Simply put, this means that when the food security law was rolled out in 2013, 67% of the population was covered. The PDS system has since not been expanded to account for an increase in population. This means currently only about 60% of the population benefits from food handouts. The rights body has advised the government to expand PDS coverage across states to be “compliant with the NFSA norms”, recognise ICDS as an essential service and reopen anganwadi centres. It has also called for a village-based mechanism to maintain data of migrant families and children between 3 and 18 years, returning from cities due to loss of employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-hit-food-security-of-children-rights-body-tells-ministries/story-pzQYgrpgwX39WRPOO3jxbL.html

It issued several guidelines on how to regulate movement of crowds in venues, ensuring crowd control through pre-planning and route planning ahead of immersion dates in view of Diwali, Durga Puja and Navratra. As the festival season comes nearer, the health ministry has asked festival committees to ensure that they have adequate amounts of face masks, hand sanitisers, thermal guns and stickers to paste on the floor to ensure social distancing. Health ministry has also asked organisers to devise a plan to regulate the number of visitors. The health ministry has also asked all stakeholders to conduct meetings and ensure CCTVs are installed in festival venues to keep check if devotees are following Covid-19 prevention rules. The guidelines also have requested people who are currently residing in containment zones to participate in festivities while remaining indoors. People from contaminant zones will be barred from entering the festivities. The health ministry has also asked committees, which will be overseeing preparations, to prominently display a chart of Dos and Don’ts in the venue. They have also been asked to ensure that multimedia and audio-video tools will be used to spread awareness regarding Covid-19 and for issuing continuous reminders to devotees to adhere Covid-19 preventative measures. Committees have also been asked to reserve a room which can be used as a designated isolation room for any person who is exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-festive-season-health-ministry-allows-celebrations-outside-containment-zones-issues-sops-for-venue-management/story-ZRJv21T53jfeDAUw8hapRO.html

Other countries, Pompeo told Nikkei Asia in an interview, could become part of this framework at “the appropriate time.”Tuesday’s meeting was the first face-to-face interaction between the foreign ministers of the four Indo-Pacific countries - the US, India, Japan and Australia - since the coronavirus pandemic broke out in China’s Wuhan in December last.The foreign ministers had taken the first step to revive the security dialogue and upgrade it to a ministerial level in September last year when they met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. In his initial comments at the Quad meet, foreign minister S Jaishankar underlined that the world had “profoundly transformed” since then.India, which had been preparing to host Chinese President Xi Jinping, has spent the last 150 days engaged in a bitter standoff with China’s People’s Liberation Army that has led to deaths on both sides.Also Read: At Quad meet, Pompeo discusses China’s ‘malign activity’ with Australian counterpartChina’s relations with the three other Quad members have also nosedived over the last one year after Beijing, blamed for the spread of coronavirus disease that has infected 35 million and killed more than 1 million, adopted a hawkish approach elsewhere too.“This is the Chinese using coercive power. This isn’t how great nations operate. So our mission is to reduce that,” Pompeo told Nikkei Asia.Pompeo was particularly unsparing of China in his public comments ahead of the Quad meeting as well.“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s (Chinese communist party) exploitation, corruption and coercion,” Pompeo said.“We see it in the South and East China Seas, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Strait.”Stephen Biegun, the US deputy secretary of state, had hinted what a formalised Quad could look like last month when he noted at an online seminar that the Indo-Pacific region didn’t have “strong multilateral structures”.“They don’t have anything of the fortitude of NATO, or the European Union… There is certainly an invitation there at some point to formalise a structure like this,” he said.In a statement issued after Tuesday’s Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a statement by the Indian external affairs ministry said the foreign ministers would hold the consultations “regularly”.Also Read: Eye on China, Canada formulates new Indo-Pacific policy“The Foreign Ministers exchanged views about regional issues of mutual interest, and issues related to connectivity; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; maritime safety and security; health security, and counter terrorism.

06-10-2020||India||Three scientists share Nobel Physics Prize 2020 for their work on black holes||This year’s Nobel Prize for Physics was jointly awarded to two American and a German Researcher for their work on one of the most mysterious objects in the Universe – a black hole. This comes just a year after the world saw the first image of a supermassive black hole imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope, a global network of telescopes to create one the size of the Earth. One half of the award went to the American mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose who had in 1965 shown that Einstein’s theory of relativity led to the formation of black holes that engulf everything, including light because of the massive gravitational pull. Not even Albert Einstein thought that black holes could actually exist. To prove that black hole formation is a stable process, Penrose needed to expand the methods used to study the theory of relativity with new mathematical concepts. It is still regarded as the most important contribution to the general theory of relativity since Einstein. Earlier this year, researchers from Glasgow University used a ring of speakers and a sound-absorbing disk to practically demonstrate how energy can be obtained from a black hole as predicted by Penrose in 1969. The other half of the prize was shared by the German astrophysicist Reinhard Genzel and American astronomer Andrea M Ghez whose groups have been focussing at a region called Sagittarius A* at the centre of Milky Way galaxy. With this, Ghez became the fourth woman to have received the award since 1901 when it was first given out. The other three are Donna Strickland who got it in 2018, Maria Geopperts-Mayer in 1963, and Marie Curie in 1903. Curie is also the only woman and one of four people to have received a second Nobel Prize; she received the Chemistry prize in 1911. By mapping the orbits of the brightest stars in the region, both the groups observed that there was something both invisible and heavy forcing the stars to swirl around. This object has a mass of four million suns squeezed in a region not larger than our solar system. According to the current theory of gravity, there is only one candidate fitting the description – a supermassive black hole. “The discoveries of this year’s Laureates have broken new ground in the study of compact and supermassive objects. But these exotic objects still pose many questions that beg for answers and motivate future research. Not only questions about their inner structure, but also questions about how to test our theory of gravity under the extreme conditions in the immediate vicinity of a black hole”, said David Haviland, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-scientists-share-nobel-physics-prize-2020-for-their-work-on-black-holes/story-WNtxMPNujIS2ICKtz2XQZP.html

The opposition party also claimed that the affidavit appeared to be a “copy paste” job given that it has references about New York Police Department (NYPD), ‘Black Lives Matter’ and cities such as San Diego and Phoenix, which are in the US. WATCH| ‘State govt targeted Hathras victim’s kin, PM Modi stayed silent’: Rahul GandhiAddressing a joint press conference, Congress leaders Sushmita Dev, Rajani Patil and Supriya Shrinate said the entire country has seen the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh government has handled the Hathras incident, and done injustice to the victim again and again. They demanded that all officers, including the Hathras district magistrate, be dismissed, alleging they are part of a conspiracy for a cover-up of the case. “Every step taken by the Uttar Pradesh government was to cover up the Hathras incident. Today, this has been exposed in the affidavit. Its purpose is not for a court-monitored CBI probe but to cover up the incident that started on September 14,” Dev told reporters at the Congress headquarters in Delhi. “Stop the cover up. Congress party stands by its demand that Yogi Adityanath should be dismissed immediately. The district magistrate and every officer who is part of this conspiracy to hush up such a brutal case of rape should be dismissed and not given any other responsibility pending investigation,” she said. Patil alleged the Uttar Pradesh government’s act of a cover-up of the incident is “shameful” and urged the people to not allow any atrocities against women and pack up the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state. Shrinate said there is no official notification for a CBI inquiry into the Hathras incident as announced by the government while the SIT probe is on. “The manner in which victim-shaming is being done as part of a conspiracy and she is being trolled by BJP and the government and police, there should be a probe into this,” she said. Shrinate also cited the change in rape laws done by the UPA government that “presence of semen or penetration is not necessary now” and even an attempt is considered as rape. She alleged that the state government is trying to make it a case of international conspiracy through “fabricated evidence” and perpetrate caste violence. Shrinate read out certain parts of the affidavit that mentions about black people and cities such as San Diego and Phoenix, which are in the United States. There also mentions of the NYPD and ‘Black Lives Matter’ in it, she added. Shrinate said the same evidence attached as annexures in the affidavit has been “fabricated” by the Uttar Pradesh government and has been copied from the ‘Black Lives Movement in the US’. “It is happening as the entire media and opposition are asking questions and the government is talking of a cover up and international conspiracy. Stop those FIRs based on these concoctions,” she said. Dev asked the Uttar Pradesh government to prove to the victim’s family that the body cremated in a hurry by the police at 2.30 am actually is of their daughter’s. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi should immediately dismiss Yogi Adityanath,” she demanded. The Mahila Congress chief alleged that it is “shameful” that the state government is claiming that no rape took place and that her last rites were done in front of the family with proper rituals. “This is a clear case of contempt of court,” she said. Dev said the government has cited reports saying there is no sign suggesting rape but the teenager in her dying declaration stated that she was gang-raped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/affidavit-a-copy-paste-job-in-bid-to-cover-up-hathras-rape-incident-says-congress/story-qdgr5Np2SaGQpWwhaFo87H.html

They are from the Lashkar, led by a Pakistani terrorist named Saifullah. We are on the job and they will be neutralised soon,” Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir Zone Vijay Kumar said.He was speaking to reporters after the wreath-laying ceremony for the two Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans, who were killed in the attack.“Two terrorists came on a scooter, most probably from the Pampore side, and opened indiscriminate firing from an AK rifle,” the IGP said.He admitted that the module of the Pakistan-based militant outfit had carried out an attack earlier in the Chadoora area of Budgam district as well, in which an assistant sub-inspector of the CRPF was killed.“We are conducting operations and soon, they will be neutralised,” the officer said.Responding to a question on terrorists using two-wheelers to carry out attacks, Kumar said it is easy for the ultras to move around on motorbikes on roads where the vehicle movement is heavy.“We cannot check every vehicle, vehicles are checked based on information mostly. Checking every vehicle will cause traffic jams,” he said.The IGP sought to assure people, saying there is no need to panic and “the situation is under control”.On the use of virtual phone numbers by terrorists, he said this technology is a cause of concern but it has been used for subversive activities for years now.“Virtual numbers have remained challenging since the beginning. It is challenging across the world.

This part is a result of 4-5 months of research activity on some of the antipyretic, antifungal, antibacterial and other medicines in Ayurveda that have been reviewed and backed by experts from the modern system of medicine. The protocol is thoroughly backed by scientific evidence,” said Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, secretary, Ayush. The mainstay of the Ayush protocol is to build body’s immune system to fight off the infection. “The current understanding of Covid-19 indicates that good immune status is vital to prevention and to safeguard from disease progression. Ayurveda and Yoga can certainly play a pivotal role to augment preventive measures…” the protocol says. Apart from general measures such as drinking herb-infused warm water or turmeric milk, steam inhalation, gargling and moderate exercise in the form of several yogic postures, the protocol also recommends a set of medicines to be used for prophylaxis and treatment. “It is a culmination of one of the various interdisciplinary efforts, and a part of new paradigm where Ayush ministry has collaborated with other ministries and experts of modern medicine,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, health. Two herbs— guduchi a(Tinospora cordifolia or heart-leaved moonseed) and ashwagandha (Withania somnifera or Indian ginseng) form the base of most medicines advised in the protocol, in different forms and formulations. The medication is prescribed for different section of people—those who are taking as prophylaxis (high risk population or primary contacts), asymptomatic positives (for prevention of disease progression to symptomatic and severe form and to improve recovery rate); and mild positive cases (for symptomatic management of fever, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat, nasal congestion etc). “We can call it fusion mode where benefits of traditional medicines are made use of with modern medicine. It will be a good idea to have a meeting with authorities of all states to promote it on ground,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog. The medicines are also prescribed for post Covid-19 care in cases of people experiencing lung-related complications, fatigue and mental health issues. As part of mild to moderate exercise regimen, yoga postures have been prescribed to improve respiratory and cardiac efficiency, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance immunity. “None of the treatments prescribed is to be taken without proper medical supervision. It is definitely not meant for self-medicating,” said Kotecha.

06-10-2020||India||GST Council cannot stop 21 states from borrowing against future cess receipts||Dissenting Goods and Services Tax Council members cannot stop 21 states from borrowing against their respective future compensation cess proceeds, and their borrowing plan will kick-off even if there is no unanimity at the council’s meeting on October 12, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.According to the Attorney General of India’s legal opinion on this matter, a state can borrow even on the strength of future receipts from the compensation fund. As the GST Council on Monday extended the levy of compensation cess beyond June 2022 for such period as may be required to meet the revenue gap, individual states can now monetise it with the help of the Reserve Bank of India and the department of expenditure (DoE), even without the Council’s approval, they said, requesting anonymity.The GST Council meeting on Monday deferred a decision on compensating states for the shortfall in their share of the indirect tax revenue by a week after states governed by opposition parties insisted that the Centre must borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore deficit and reimburse them.Also Read: States should stand firm, reject Centre’s options on GST compensation cess: ChidambaramThe Centre had placed two options before the states—borrow Rs 97,000 crore (the amount was raised to Rs 1.10 lakh crore on Monday) to bridge the shortfall in revenue from GST, equal to the shortfall resulting from issues related to its implementation, without repaying either principal or interest, or alternatively, borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore (the remaining deficit caused by the Covid-19 pandemic) and bear significant interest costs.While 21 state governments opted to borrow Rs 1.10 lakh crore to repay the funds that would come out of the cess, states like Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal, rejected both the options. They instead proposed a third option—the Centre should borrow the entire shortfall, compensate states in full and retire the debt from the compensation cess fund.“It is unlikely that the ten [dissenting] states will agree to the Centre’s preposition at the GST Council’s meeting on October 12 unless the central government comes forward and share the burden,” said the finance minister of a state ruled by a non-BJP party who did not wish to be named.West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said the Centre’s arguments that borrowing would have adverse macro-economic consequences is untenable. “Why, borrowing by cash-strapped states would not have macro-economic consequences?” he said.“The Centre must understand that rating agencies consider the aggregate borrowing [by both the Centre and states] to downgrade... its arguments are erroneous,” he said, adding that states are facing acute financial crunch and the Centre should help them to come out of this difficult situation.Also Read: Maharashtra government ‘unwillingly’ accepts option of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore to make up for GST lossesIn fact, the third option is more practical as the Centre is better position to borrow, he said. “Centre has an institutional mechanism with RBI, we don’t have; it gets loans about 2% cheaper than the market rate and RBI will be saved from dealing with 31 entities [states] rather than one [the Centre],” he added.The state finance minister quoted above said the 10 states opposing the Centre’s move to thrust huge loan burden on them would be constrained to seek division of vote on October 12 if the Central government insists on its two options.One of the persons mentioned above said, “The GST Council has jurisdiction to extend the levy of cess to compensate for the shortfall in the compensation. It has done that. Now the ball rests in the court of individual states, not with the GST Council.” “When something which is not under the jurisdiction of the GST council, how can any voting or division be permitted on the subject. Voting can occur in GST council only on those matters which are under the express jurisdiction of the GST council,” the person added.Ayush Mehrotra, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, said, “In terms of the Constitutional framework, the Union government’s intervention is required for borrowings from Consolidated Fund of India and not from the market. However, to ensure that the union government stands firm on its commitment pertaining to this market linked borrowing option, the states may require this to be blessed by the GST Council and approved by the union government.”Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY India, said it is the Constitutional obligation to compensate states for a period of five years and to ensure that the GST Council extended the levy beyond June 2020. “For deficits and other unforeseen situations impacting such collections, various avenues would need to be explored for meeting immediate requirements/handling short term requirements,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-cannot-stop-21-states-from-borrowing-against-future-cess-receipts/story-EkRh9iwENpXAAmcDJKpX0M.html

The resolution demanded that central and state governments should stop the “brutal way of amending labour laws, desist from indulging in ‘ordinance raj’ in labour sector and respect the views expressed by social organisations.”A third resolution urged the government to call a roundtable of stakeholders and formulate a national employment policy. “The imported predatory economic and labour reforms and defective policies of the capitalist paradigm are responsible for landing our job generation in a sorry state of affairs,” the resolution said. In the fourth resolution, the demand for review of all pension schemes in favour of employees, including pension schemes under CCS Rules, NPS, financial sector schemes, EPS, unorganised sector was made. The BMS has demanded pension, not less than 50% of salary linked to cost of living index and medical scheme and minimum pension of Rs 5,000 for the unorganised sector.In view of the hardships faced by the migrant workers, the fifth resolution demanded effective changes in the law on migrant workers, national level registration, social security and other facilities for them.The sixth resolution demanded that the government should change the western GDP-based progress scale and opt for an Indian model.At the national conference inaugurated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, a new team of 31 office bearers was also announced.Hiranmaya Pandya has been elected as the national president of BMS and Binay Kumar Sinha as national general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-to-protest-against-anti-worker-provisions-in-new-labour-codes/story-U0bSImpAhkLgsakZ5jEUNO.html

He said 50 years ago, a scheme of organic manure was dumped by the Centre because it was developed by indigenous brains but there is no alternative before the world today.  “The entire world is returning to the basic elements of Indian thought process to practice developmental ways while being environment friendly after being battered by coronavirus during the last six months,” said Bhagwat at an event in Kota. He was addressing a function on the 100th birth anniversary of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh leader Dattopant Thengadi.  Praising Thengadi’s foresight and his works, Bhagwat said the agriculture was never a subject of trade in India but the world sees it as agriculture economics. “We have seen this as a means of worshipping Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of glory, not as a means of conducting trade,” he said. He said the agriculture’s economics aspect is not bad but people fail to see that a section of people seeks to exploit others for the business. He said Thengadi’s birth anniversary celebration is for showing gratitude to the work done by him. He said there is a need to create an agriculture that nourishes the whole world. “We have to adopt ideal agricultural practices based on experience and proven evidence. India has ten thousand years of agricultural experience, so it is not necessary to take anti-environment practices from the West,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-looking-up-to-indian-ways-of-life-amid-covid-pandemic-mohan-bhagwat/story-11cPslHIhPVtMkzwb68bbN.html

The campaign, ‘Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’, will be run by a mobile application through which citizens will be able to lodge complaints about the pollution level in their area.Every year in the month of October, Delhi witnesses a steep increase in pollution level due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, rise in vehicular activity ahead of Dussehra and Diwali, and crackers bursting in Delhi.“From today we are starting a campaign against pollution, “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh” to reduce pollution levels in the national capital. As a part of the campaign, we will be using technology developed by PUSA Agriculture Institute, to curb the menace of stubble burning,” Kejriwal added.Here are the points you should know about the campaign:1. A photo-based complaint lodging mobile application ‘Green Delhi App’ will be launched before the end of October for the redressal of pollution complaints by citizens in their area.2. On the pattern of battling the coronavirus disease, 13 pollution hotspots have been identified. Customized actions will be taken in each hotspot according to the requirement and the cause of pollution in the area.3. The Delhi government has also initiated an ‘anti-dust campaign’ to settle dust, especially at construction sites.4. As a part of the anti-dust campaign, agencies that cut down the tree will be asked to plant 80% of trees that have been brought down.5. The Aam Aadmi Party-led government will pay heed to air-pollution hotspots like Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, RK Puram, among other areas, to boost air quality.6.

06-10-2020||India||States should stand firm, reject Centre’s options on GST compensation cess: Chidambaram||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday complimented the states that rejected the two options given by the Centre to bridge the gap in the GST compensation cess and asked them to stand firm at the next meeting of the GST council on October 12.The former finance minister said the states should not borrow as the liability to provide Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation as well as the onus to find resources fall on the Centre.“I compliment the 9-10 states that stood firm and rejected the two options given by the central government to bridge the gap in the GST compensation cess.“The liability to provide the GST compensation to the full extent falls on the central government, as reluctantly admitted by the FM yesterday. Naturally, the onus of finding the resources also falls on the central government,” he said in a series of tweets.“It is unfair and unjust to ask state governments to borrow the money. States must stand firm at the next meeting on 12th October,” Chidambaram said.At its meeting on Monday, the GST Council failed to reach a consensus on ways to compensate the states for the loss of tax revenue.The panel will meet again on October 12 to thrash out the state compensation issue, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said after a marathon eight-hour meeting.The council was divided on political lines, with 10 states ruled by non-BJP parties opposing the Centre’s proposal of states borrowing to meet the shortfall in receipts.The state compensation issue appears headed for voting in the council, with the option chosen by the majority being implemented.Sitharaman said 21 states accepted one of the two borrowing options suggested by the Centre but 10 did not agree.When the GST was introduced in July 2017, the states were promised a 14-per cent incremental revenue over their last tax receipts in the first five years. This was to be done through a levy of a cess or surcharge on luxury and sin goods, but the collections on this count have fallen short with the slowdown of the economy since the last fiscal.To make up for this, the Centre has suggested that the states can borrow against future compensation receipts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-should-stand-firm-reject-centre-s-options-on-gst-compensation-cess-chidambaram/story-tzXGZ3MJCBAdMB1bA6beUJ.html

It’s the tea||India has extended a standing invitation to Myanmar Army Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing to travel to Darjeeling on his next visit to India. The invite was extended by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla during his informal conversations during his 24-hour visit to Myanmar capital Naypyidaw with Army chief Gen MM Naravane.It started with a pack of tea from Seeyok Estate in Darjeeling’s Mirik Valley that Shringla and Gen Naravane had brought as a gift for Myanmar’s most powerful man. Shringla told him that it was from his hometown, Darjeeling.Senior General Hlaing told the visitors that he loved Darjeeling Tea and had always wanted to visit the hill station that sits in the shadow of the snow-covered Kanchenjunga peak. The military commander’s guests immediately told him that Darjeeling would be included in his itinerary next time when he visits India.The senior general was also presented a statue of Vitarka Buddha hand carved by Tamil Nadu artisans. The Vitarka Buddha signifies the discussion and transmission of Buddha’s teachings and is depicted by joining the tips of the thumb and index fingers together while keeping the other fingers straight.State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was also presented with a pack of award-winning tea from the Makaibari Tea estate in Darjeeling. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has lived in India for years, is no stranger to Darjeeling. As this conversation too veered around tea and her preferences, Suu Kyi said she preferred Lopchu, a 90-year-old tea brand that is famous for its aroma and smoky taste. It is grown in a tea estate situated between Darjeeling and Teesta at an altitude of 4,800 feet and is a gift of choice by Indian dignitaries such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi.For the people of Myanmar, the two top Indian officials handed over a consignment of 3,000 vials of the drug Remdesivir and promised more, should the need arise. This was Shringla’s first visit to Myanmar after his elevation as foreign secretary in January this year.The high-powered visit was designed as India’s outreach to countries in the neighbourhood and cement the ties between the two countries in areas ranging from security to connectivity.A statement by the Myanmar government later said the two sides had during this visit also discussed the possibility of joint production of Covid-19 vaccine being developed by India, operationalisation of the Sittwe Port in the early part of 2021, conducting vocational training programmes for youths in Rakhine State and exchange of visits of parliamentarians and the youths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-next-india-trip-myanmar-senior-general-to-visit-darjeeling-it-s-the-tea/story-9ts64N2VaXPAfBKD3CHV6J.html

The total donations above Rs 20,000 declared by 11 political parties in their contribution reports analysed by the Association for Democratic Rights (ADR), a not-for-profit organisation that works for electoral and political reforms, between 2014-15 and 2018-19 was Rs 2777.97-crore.The lack of transparency in political funding assumes significance ahead of the three-phase Bihar elections, which start on October 28.Also read: Outgoing Bihar assembly has 136 MLAs facing criminal charges, says reportThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accounted for 80.12% of the total donations by collecting Rs 2225.66 crore, followed by its rival Congress at 13.64%, or Rs 379.02 crore, of the gross contributions.The latest ADR report cited that only three of the 11 mainstream parties analysed had submitted their reports of donations to the Election Commission of India (ECI) within the stipulated time frame.There were donations worth Rs 325.23 crore that were deposited without any Permanent Account Number (PAN), which is issued by the Income Tax (I-T) Department. The BJP accounted for the lion’s share of unaccounted source of donations at Rs 237.22 crore, or 72.94%, followed by the Congress (Rs 81.87 crore) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) (Rs 5.04-crore).Besides, Rs 15.75 crore was donated to the parties via incorrect PAN numbers. The maximum number of instances of donations without or incorrect PAN numbers was reported in the assessment year of 2014-15, when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister for the first time.There were also instances of undeclared donor names and addresses, missing mode of payment details etc.The Congress, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are the only three political outfits that have submitted their contribution reports to the ECI within the stipulated time frame. Eight parties were found to have delayed their submission at least once during the five-year period. The BJP delayed the submission each year between 17 and 30 days, the ADR report pointed out. The Rashtriya Lok Samata Party’s (RLSP) contributions are not available on the ECI website, and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) submitted its report after the due date four times during the past five years, the ADR stated.The ADR report published in January 2017, which analysed sources of funding of national and regional parties in the country between 2004-05 to 2014-15, had also underlined that the sources of income of big parties was largely unknown.It had found that the lack of transparency was more acute with national parties, as compared to regional outfits.At least 71% of the income of national parties during the analysed period was from unknown sources, while the corresponding figure for regional parties was 58%, the ADR data showed.The income for all political parties for the 11-year period was estimated at Rs 11,367.34 crore, including national and regional outfits at Rs 9,278.30 crore and Rs 2,089.04 crore, respectively.The ADR report showed that Rs.1405.19 crore was declared by six national parties through known sources of donation worth above Rs 20,000. The ADR cited a Supreme Court (SC) order of September 13, 2013, which had stated that “no part of a candidate’s affidavit and political parties’ disclosure of donations above Rs 20,000 should be left blank”.The not-for-profit organisation has proposed that ECI should upload the detailed status of the donations on its website and take action against the defaulting parties.Under section 29(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, all political parties are required to report on contributions in excess of Rs 20,000 in a financial year and submit it to the ECI by September 30 in a bid to avail 100% tax exemption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-funding-from-unknown-source-still-rampant-adr-report/story-8WGmh6dwWRNFsTaoleVmSP.html

06-10-2020||India||Quad: India committed to a rules-based world order, says MEA Jaishankar||Against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said New Delhi remains committed to a rules-based world order, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes. Jaishankar made the remarks in his opening speech at the second ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad in Tokyo without naming China. The meeting focused on the issue of ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour across the region. He also said the events of this year have demonstrated how “imperative it is for like-minded countries to coordinate responses to the various challenges that the pandemic has brought to the fore”. “As vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values, our nations have collectively affirmed the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific,” Jaishankar told the meeting, which was also attended by Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Also Read: Mike Pompeo seeks to show united front on China despite Covid-19 pandemic“We remain committed to upholding the rules-based international order, underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes,” he added. With India set to begin a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council next year, Jaishankar said the country looks forward to “seeking collective solutions to global challenges, including global recovery from the pandemic and reform of multilateral institutions”. Since May, tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a tense standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed on June 15 in a brutal clash at Galwan Valley, which also resulted in unspecified Chinese casualties. All four members of the Quad have serious differences with China – the Australian government has pledged to halt projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan is worried about Chinese intrusions near the Senkaku Islands, and the US is engaged in a trade war and has opposed China’s aggressive activities in South China Sea. Jaishankar noted that the fact that the four foreign ministers were meeting in person, despite the global pandemic, is “testimony to the importance that these consultations have gained, particularly in recent times”. He added, “Our world is significantly different today than what it was when we last met in New York in September 2019.” India’s objective remains advancing the security and economic interests of all countries having legitimate and vital interests in the region, he said. “It is a matter of satisfaction that the Indo-Pacific concept has gained increasingly wider acceptance,” he said. Also Read: Eye on China, Canada formulates new Indo-Pacific policyJaishankar and his counterparts from Australia, Japan and the US were expected to discuss issues such as plans for manufacturing and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine, connectivity, development of 5G technology, maritime cooperation, counter-terrorism, cyber security, and development of critical infrastructure and supply chains, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The issue of Australia’s inclusion in the Malabar naval exercise to be conducted by India, Japan and the US at the end of this year is also expected to figure in the discussions of the Quad, which was upgraded to the ministerial level in September last year. Ahead of the Quad meeting, Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in Tokyo. “Pleased to see the progress of our partnership in so many fields. Will work together for stability and prosperity in the Indo- Pacific,” he tweeted after the meeting. The Quad foreign ministers also called on Japan’s new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. Jaishankar is set to hold separate meetings with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi. The external affairs ministry said last week that the foreign ministers of the Quad will discuss the “post-Covid-19 international order and the need for a coordinated response to the various challenges emerging from the pandemic”. They will also discuss regional issues and “collectively affirm the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-india-committed-to-a-rules-based-world-order-says-mea-jaishankar/story-Iel9FI1oQT8TgZRdZ5wopI.html

06-10-2020||India||Alwar gang rape generated political heat and led to an important decision||The gang rape of a Dalit woman in front of her husband in Thanagazi in Alwar on April 26, 2019, when the couple was going on a motorcycle for shopping, generated political heat during the 2019 Lok Sabha election and also led to an important decision in Rajasthan. It was after this case that the state government announced that a deputy superintendent of police (DySP) in every district would monitor cases related to violence against women, and said FIRs could be lodged in the offices of superintendents of police (SP) if police stations did not register them. The Ashok Gehlot government had faced flak for the delay in the registration of FIR in the Thanagazi case because the local police station did not lodge the case for five days. It took them another five days to arrest the accused. According to the family of the gang rape survivor, the woman went to the Alwar SP’s office with a complaint on April 30, 2019, after the local police station did not entertain her. The FIR was registered on May 2, 2019. The arrests took place on May 7, 2019. The family said video of the sexual violence began circulating on May 4, 2019, but police swung into action only on May 7. The family said the local police told them they would be able to act on the case only after the Lok Sabha election. Alwar went to the polls on May 6 in the fifth phase of the general election last year. The Rajasthan government also came under fire from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati during the election campaign, forcing the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi to visit the family on May 11, 2019, with Gehlot and the then PCC chief Sachin Pilot. Gehlot announced a government job to the survivor and compensation to the family. The survivor became a police constable on June 26, 2019. Bharatiya Janata Party Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Dr Kirodi Lal Meena courted arrest to demand resignation of the chief minister and action against Alwar superintendent of police and Thanagazi SHO. The Gehlot government ordered police and administrative inquiry against the police officers of the district over their alleged laxity. The then Alwar SP Rajeev Pachar was removed and Thanagazi SHO Sardar Singh was suspended on May 7. The police took the case under the ‘case officer’ scheme, a special programme of Rajasthan police to monitor prosecution to take it to its logical conclusion. On June 7 last year, the state government ordered FIR against the SHO under section 166A(C) of the IPC, which covers a public servant failing to record any information given to him in relation to cognizable offence. Circle officer Jagmohan Sharma was transferred out of the district after presenting the charge sheet. Other staff of the police station was sent out of Jaipur police range. The administrative inquiry by Jaipur divisional commissioner KC Verma held Pachar guilty of negligence as he did not visit the spot within 24 hours of the incident after a police inquiry had given him a clean chit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alwar-gang-rape-generated-political-heat-and-led-to-an-important-decision/story-UzBOA0utr4JlNFndl5PytJ.html

06-10-2020||India||Indian services sector activity broadly stabilised in Sept, but job losses widen: PMI||Indian service sector output broadly stabilised in September but remained in the contraction zone as incoming new business fell moderately due to the damaging impact of the pandemic on demand, leading to more job losses, a monthly survey said on Tuesday. The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index rose for the fifth straight month in September to 49.8 from 41.8 in August. However, the Indian services sector activity contracted for the seventh successive month in September. A print above 50 means expansion and a score below that denotes contraction, as per the IHS Markit India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). “The relaxation of lockdown rules in India helped the service sector move towards a recovery in September. Participants of the PMI survey signalled broadly stable business activity and a much softer decline in new work intakes,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. Monitored companies that observed growth commented on the reopening of business units amid the loosening of lockdown rules. While, firms that reported a contraction mentioned the damaging impact of the pandemic on demand, the survey said. On the job front, the services sector witnessed decline in employment for the seventh month in a row, as per the survey. “Payroll numbers decreased further, but several firms reported that attempts to take on extra workers were hampered by a lack of available labour,” Lima said. “Backlogs data suggest that hiring efforts will continue in the near term, however, so we could see a better employment trend in coming months provided that people are willing to leave their hometown in search for vacancies,” she added. On the prices front, input prices rose in September, with monitored companies citing higher fuel, meat and vegetable costs. The overall rate of inflation was at a seven-month high. Going ahead, firms are optimistic regarding growth prospects. “In line with hopes that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be rolled out, companies were optimistic about the year-ahead outlook for business activity. September marked the first month since April in which service providers were confident towards growth prospects,” the survey said. Meanwhile, the Composite PMI Output Index, which measures combined services and manufacturing output rose from 46.0 in August to 54.6 in September, signaling a marked rate of activity growth across the private sector economy. “Taking into account the performance of the manufacturing industry, a better picture of the Indian economy is painted. Private sector output expanded for the first time in six months during September, and at an abovetrend rate, while the increase in sales was the first since February,” Lima said. Lima further said the news will be welcomed by policymakers, particularly following the pandemic related 23.9 per cent contraction in GDP in the opening quarter of fiscal year 2020/21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-services-sector-activity-broadly-stabilised-in-sept-but-job-losses-widen-pmi/story-6FCemb4qSATMzQogiluc4M.html

The fifth person was given a jail term of five years for circulating a video of the crime, said the court. The verdict was pronounced by a special court under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Special public prosecutor Kuldeep Jain said judge Brajesh Kumar Sharma held the five guilty of charges pressed against them and announced the sentence an hour later. “Four men have been pronounced guilty of gang rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. The fifth man, charged under IT Act, for circulating video of the crime, has been sentenced for five years,” he said.The Rajasthan government had received flak from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati during the Lok Sabha election campaign for delay in filing the FIR in the case and not taking action until the purported video of the sexual assault began circulating on social media. According to the FIR lodged on May 2, 2019, four men and a juvenile took turns to rape the woman near Duhar Chaugan between Thanagazi and Talvrikash for three hours after beating her husband. The accused demanded Rs 10,000 from the victim for not putting the video of the gang rape on social media. The FIR was registered on the day the video of the ghastly crime appeared on social media. Police presented a charge sheet against the accused on May 18, 2019, 16 days after the FIR. Chhote Lal (22), Hansraj Gurjar (20), Ashok Kumar Gurjar (20) and Indraj Singh Gurjar (22) were charged under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 327 (Voluntarily causing hurt to extort property, or to constrain to an illegal act), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354B (outraging the modesty of a woman), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 376D (gang rape), 384 (extortion), 395 (dacoity) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code; different section of the SC/ST Act and the IT Act.

06-10-2020||India||Former Union Minister Dilip Ray convicted in 1999 Jharkhand coal scam||Former Union minister of state for coal Dilip Ray was convicted on Tuesday by a special CBI court in New Delhi for his role in the irregularities of allocation of a coal block in Jharkhand in more than 20 years ago in 1999.Special CBI judge Bharat Parashar convicted Ray, who was minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1999, of criminal conspiracy and other offences. The court also convicted two former officials of Coal ministry Pradip Kumar Banerjee and Nitya Nand Gautam and director of Castron Technologies Ltd (CTL) Mahendra Kumar Agarwalla.“There was a concerted effort by way of criminal conspiracy to facilitate misappropriation of the important nationalised natural resources of the country,” the court said.“While discussing the role of Dilip Ray for the offence under section 13 (1) of PC Act, it has already been concluded that he acted with a dishonest and malafide intention and that too in clear violation of the unambiguous provisions of law. It clear that Dilip Ray dishonestly facilitated allocation of the abandoned non-nationalised coal mining area in favour of company CTL and that too in violation of the direction of law,” the court said.The judge convicted the four persons and two firms for the alleged offences under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and 409 (Criminal breach of trust) of IPC and under the relevant provisions of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. The court will hear arguments on the quantum of sentence on October 14. The case pertains to the alleged irregularities in allocation of Brahmadiha coal block in Giridih in Jharkhand to Castron Technologies Ltd in 1999. Ray is the first minister of the erstwhile NDA government who has been convicted in the coal scam case.In its charge sheet, CBI had said that CTL had applied in May 1998 to the coal ministry for allotment of Brahmadiha coal block, but Coal India Limited told the ministry that mining it could be dangerous as the coal block was an abandoned mine area and was full of water. The file was again sent to Ray’s office on April 23, 1999 and on May 12, 1999, CTL submitted a fresh representation to the minister saying that their application may be considered expeditiously.When the file came to the then union coal secretary from Ray’s office for re-examination on May 13, 1999 it was sent to additional secretary Nitya Nand Gautam’s desk. The CBI alleged that Gautam then made a complete u-turn from his previous observation after which the screening committee recommended CTL for allocation of the coal block subject to relaxation of guidelines by coal ministry. On the basis of the approval accorded by Ray, a letter of allotment of Brahmadiha coal block in favour of CTL was issued on September 1, 1999 by the coal ministry. It alleged that after allocation of the block, CTL started extracting coal illegally even without grant of any mine opening permission by the concerned authorities.Ray did not respond to messages seeking his response to the judgement.Sixty-six-year-old Ray, a hotel tycoon and one of the founding members of the Biju Janata Dal in the 1990s had parted ways with the regional party in 2002. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha that year as an independent candidate with the support of some BJP MLAs of Odisha. He then joined the Congress in 2004 but quit it in 2008. In 2009, he joined the BJP and was elected as an MLA from Rourkela assembly constituency in 2014.He, however, left the party in November 2018 after the Central Bureau of Investigation chargesheeted him in 2016 in the Brahmadiha coal scam case.

The opposition Congress and BJP have asked the government to act against the academy chairperson and secretary under the provisions of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Police recovered a note purportedly written by the dancer in which he said that he was denied the opportunity because he belonged to a lower caste. Kerala’s culture minister AK Balan has sought a report from the academy.“It is sad it happened under Left rulers who often speak about renaissance and cultural reform. We all know he is a committed dancer devoted his whole life to the dance. He was insulted by denying an opportunity to perform. The government is answerable for this grave injustice,” said Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan in a Facebook post. Congress leader Pandalam Sudhakaran also sought action against academy office-bearers. “They talk big about Dalits but treat them like outcasts,” he said. The dancer’s family members said the academy had rejected his application saying that male members can’t perform ‘Mohiniyattam,’ a classical dance form from of Kerala usually performed by women. But they said male dancers had performed the dance earlier and he was denied an opportunity due to his caste. But academy secretary Radhakrishnan Nair denied reports the academy rejected his application. “The academy has so far scheduled items like Thullal, Kathakali, Chenda and Mizhavu performances. Its experts in each field select dance forms and they are yet to take a call on other dance forms ,” he said. Academy chairperson K P A C Lalitha, a film and theatre actor, was not available for her comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-art-body-under-fire-after-dalit-dancer-s-suicide-bid-over-alleged-discrimination/story-sTDkH92nhFyeKp2UrmGQBN.html

Abdullah’s visit is part of an outreach to key countries in the region for support for the negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban at Doha in Qatar, people familiar with developments said. He will meet Modi at the prime minister’s official residence on Thursday and Jaishankar on Friday. Abdullah will also participate in an interaction at the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) on Thursday. Abdullah is also expected to have interactions with key members of India’s security setup, including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, though details could not immediately be ascertained. Interactions with the Afghan community in New Delhi are also on the cards. The chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation in Afghanistan is travelling to India after a three-day visit to Pakistan last week. In Islamabad, he had met Prime Minister Imran Khan, foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa. Also Read: Where India stands on peace in Afghanistan | OpinionAbdullah told the Pakistani leadership that a message about reducing violence and showing greater flexibility in negotiations should be communicated to the Taliban leadership participating in the negotiations in Doha. This is Abdullah’s first visit to India after the formation of a new government in Kabul following last year’s troubled election. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Abdullah is expected to seek the Indian leadership’s support for the intra-Afghan negotiations. India had sent an official delegation to Doha to attend the event marking the launch of negotiations. The event was also addressed via video conference by Jaishankar, who said any new dispensation which emerges from the intra-Afghan dialogue process must ensure that Afghanistan’s soil is never used for anti-India activities. Senior Afghan leader Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum visited India on September 25 and held talks on the peace process with Jaishankar, who told him New Delhi remains committed to Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled negotiations. India, the region’s largest provider of development aid to Afghanistan, has expressed concern at a recent spike in violence by the Taliban and terror attacks on minorities such as Sikhs. It has said the intra-Afghan negotiations must ensure the interests of minorities, women and vulnerable sections of society and reduce violence across Afghanistan and its neighbourhood. Since 2001, India has undertaken projects worth $3 billion in Afghanistan, including $1 billion pledged in 2016 under the “new development partnership” scheme for five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-afghan-peace-negotiator-set-to-meet-pm-narendra-modi-eam-jaishankar/story-OBncKTvBYenAMcm1JUXv6H.html
06-10-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty, brother Showik’s judicial custody in drugs case extended till Oct 20||The judicial custody of Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik in a drugs case related to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was extended till October 20 by a Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act court (NDPS) in Mumbai on Tuesday. Apart from the Chakraborty siblings, the custody of 18 others arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the case has also been extended.After WhatsApp chats regarding the use of drugs surfaced, Rhea Chakraborty and her brother were arrested by NCB for procuring and financing drugs for Rajput on his instructions. “The actor was involved in the illicit trafficking of drugs and she financed drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput,” NCB has stated. With similar allegations against her brother, they were slapped with stringent conditions of the NDPS act.The bail applications were earlier rejected on September 11 by the NDPS court citing the possibility that the actor may alert others if released on bail and that might lead to contamination of evidence. However, Chakraborty maintains that she is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case with the NCB coercing her into making “self-incriminatory” confessions.The verdict of the 28-year-old actor and her brother’s bail plea has been reserved but the date on which it will be pronounced isn’t known yet. The central agency, which is probing the drugs angle in Rajput’s death, does not want Rhea and her brother to be released in order to send out a strong message to the youth against the consumption of drugs.Chakrabortys’ lawyer advocate Satish Maneshinde has told the court that Rajput was in no dearth of funds. His house manager Samuel Miranda used to take care of “all” household expenses which is why Rhea has no role financing drug purchases for the deceased actor.The 34-year-old actor was found dead at his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14. Apart from NCB, Rajput’s death case is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) whereas the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing the alleged money laundering angle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judicial-custody-of-rhea-chakraborty-her-brother-showik-and-other-accused-in-drugs-case-related-to-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-extended-till-oct-20/story-aaXIAWN30hVadwMuLlE6DM.html

06-10-2020||India||Goa to file contempt plea against Karnataka in Mahadayi water dispute||The Goa government will file a fresh contempt plea against Karnataka for diverting waters of the River Mahadayi even as the matter is pending before the Supreme Court, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday. Sawant, who said that the issue of Mahadayi was “close to his heart”, accused previous regimes - both BJP and Congress - of having neglected the issue but assured that there was ample photographic and video evidence, which he said would be placed before the top court. “A contempt petition is being filed before the Supreme Court either tomorrow or the day after along with all photographic evidence, pursuant to reports of diversion being carried out by the State of Karnataka. This contempt is in addition to an earlier contempt filed in the Apex court in the Month of August 2018, when the state of Karnataka had engaged in a similar mischief,” Sawant told reporters at a special press conference. Photographs published in local media showed that Karnataka has already dug trenches to divert the flow of the River Mahadayi, which begins as a stream in the upper reaches of the western Ghats in North Karnataka before flowing into Goa via a brief detour into Maharashtra. On account of the trenches, the waters of the Mahadayi now flow eastwards and into the east flowing Malaprabha river in Karnataka rather than westwards into Goa from the point of diversion. The Sawant government has been on the backfoot over its inability to prevent Karnataka from diverting the water, and the “support” the central government is giving the Karnataka government to go ahead with the project. However, Sawant said it was the fault of earlier regimes that matters have come to this. “The Karnataka government built trenches and canals to divert the water but nothing was done to stop it back then. The Congress government of the time, from the beginning, failed to object to in-basin utilisation of waters of Mahadayi by the riparian states,” Sawant said. He also blamed the government, led by his predecessor Manohar Parrikar, for claiming as a victory the decision of the tribunal to allow Karnataka only 13.42 TMC (Thousand Million Cubic Feet) water. Karnataka had claimed 36.55 TMC water from the Mahadayi basin. The diversion project involves the construction of three dams, two canals to divert water and the diversion of 499.13 hectares of forest land including submergence of 406.60 hectares of forest land. The plan involves diversion of west flowing streams in the Mahadayi basin to the allegedly water deficit Malaprabha basin by construction of dams across the Haltara, Kalasa and Banduri streams. The project proposes to divert 7.56 TMC of water during monsoon season through Inter connecting gravity canals for crossing the ridges at the cost of Rs 840.52 crore.In its verdict passed in 2018, the tribunal awarded Karnataka 3.45 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) from their total claims of 7.56 TMC. According to the breakup, Karnataka has been allowed to divert 1.18 TMC from the Kalasa Nala and 2.27 TMC from the Banduri Nala from their claims of 3.56 and 4 TMC respectively. The award is yet to be notified by the central government and all states -- Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa -- have challenged various portions of the award before the Supreme Court.“There was no decision taken to challenge this award at the relevant time for 10 months. When I took charge as the chief minister, and appointed new Advocate General, it was realised that the diversion of water from Mahadayi basin to outside basin is required to be challenged as the same is against the interest of the State,” Sawant said, indirectly blaming the government led by his predecessor Manohar Parrikar for the lapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-file-contempt-plea-against-karnataka-in-mahadayi-water-dispute/story-j46tjinWCeCTJxmlSrMgtJ.html

06-10-2020||India||With cops on overdrive, cannabis seizure in Odisha likely to cross 1,000 quintals this year||With a seizure of close to 1,000 quintals of cannabis so far, it has been a good year for the Odisha police, excise department and other agencies tasked to check the drug trade in the state. While the Special Task Force and district police officials have seized over 900 quintals of cannabis in little over the last 9 months, other agencies like Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), state excise department as well as Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have seized over 25 quintals in the same period. The seizures have become frequent over the last 2-3 months as enforcement officials are intercepting more and more consignment of cannabis.On the evening of October 4 police in Ganjam district seized 2.5 quintals of cannabis covered in PPE kits while they were being transported in an ambulance near Budhamba village under Kabisuryanagar police station area. Similarly, excise department officials early Monday morning seized 7 quintals of cannabis during a raid at Sargiguda village in Malkangiri district. On October 3, Narcotics Control Bureau officials had seized 7 quintals of cannabis from a coir-filled truck near Godipada toll gate in Khurda. On September 8, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence seized 5.5 quintals of cannabis worth around Rs 80 lakh in Bhubaneswar while it was being illegally transported in a vegetable truck.“This year will be the most successful year for Odisha when it comes to enforcement activities to prevent cannabis smuggling. While Odisha police alone is likely to seize 1,000 quintals of cannabis by the end of this year, the combined seizure of other agencies would put Odisha in the top spot among all states when it comes to cannabis seizure,” said Jaynarayan Pankaj, deputy inspector general of police of Special Task Force that is mandated to go after cannabis smugglers.Though last year Odisha police seized 618.15 quintals of cannabis, Pankaj said Odisha DGP Abhay’s focus on going after the cannabis smugglers persistently has been the key to higher seizures this year .“As the DGP headed the Narcotics Control Bureau a few years ago he is laying greater stress on increasing the interception. So we are focussing more on districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Kandhamal, Boudh, Rayagada and Gajapati where the crop is cultivated on a large scale in Maoist-affected areas. While Maoists are slowly losing control in the state, the pandemic also helped make things easy for us due to less number of vehicles on roads. It was easier for us to intercept the cannabis-laden vehicles as the traffic was less. But the biggest cause of higher seizure is due to sustained drive and better intelligence collection,” the DIG said.The cultivation of cannabis starts in September at the end of the monsoon season when there is less humidity and the temperature drops. It requires quite a bit of sunshine and colder temperature. When the plants start budding, cannabis becomes ready for harvest. The buds are dried in the sun to make ganja, the most popular form of cannabis that is exported out of Odisha.The hilly tracts of Maoist-affected Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Kandhamal districts have been the traditional areas for growth of cannabis. As it offers better returns than cereals, the tribals grow it with active patronage of the Maoists. The crop does not need much care and can withstand harsh weather conditions and water scarcity.Excise department officials said in 2019-20, cannabis crops over 18,000 acres of area, the largest so far, were destroyed in Odisha. A multi-disciplinary committee headed by chief secretary has been formed for regular interaction with various state and central agencies for better coordination and sharing of information about the drug situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-cops-on-overdrive-cannabis-seizure-in-odisha-likely-to-cross-1-000-quintals-this-year/story-Rprn3cKS6NiKbAEsuzg4vJ.html
06-10-2020||India||India ranks 4th in global survey assessing public perception of govt response to Covid-19||India, which scored 63.88 out of 100, is ranked fourth in a global survey to assess public perception of government responses to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.China scored 80.48, followed by South Korea (74.54) and South Africa (64.62) -- the only nations that are ranked ahead of India.Around 13,400 people were surveyed across 19 countries in June, whose findings have come out in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal published by the Public Library of Science since 2006. The average score varied considerably between countries – from 35.76 for Ecuador to 80.48 for China, where the public response was found to be the most positive. Also Read: India likely to join Canada-led multilateral group tackling Covid-19 pandemicThe United States of America (USA) is ranked 17 among the 19 countries surveyed regarding the government cooperation with other nations and international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).The average score for a country was strongly linked to the level of trust in its government.The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by the “la Caixa” Foundation in coordination with the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) and other international institutions, developed an easy and reliable tool to evaluate the public perception of governmental response to the Covid-19 pandemic.The response has varied considerably among countries. Although most governments have implemented a series of common measures such as mobility restrictions, closure of businesses, places of worship and schools, their timing and approach have been varied, the researchers said.Also Read: Covid-19 could spread by airborne transmission: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention“We need basic tools to help us assess the public perception of government responses in key aspects such as communication, or access to healthcare services and social welfare,” said Jeffrey V Lazarus, a researcher at ISGlobal.Countries in Asia reported higher scores, unlike Latin American and European nations.Some of the questions that were asked to the public included whether the government communicated clearly to ensure that everyone had the information they needed to protect themselves and others from Covid-19, irrespective of their socio-economic conditions, migrant status, ethnicity or language.The questions also focused on whether the government had a strong pandemic preparedness team, including public health and medical experts, to manage national response to the Covid-19 epidemic, and if it made sure there was access to the healthcare services. The researchers hoped that the survey would help public health officials and other decision-makers identify and rectify weaknesses in key aspects of a country’s response, and track trends as the Covid-19 pandemic evolves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ranks-4th-in-global-survey-assessing-public-perception-of-government-response-to-covid-19/story-I0gXSGfCs14vru9Sf9ymzO.html

The fifth man, who circulated the video of the crime on social media, will spend five years in jail, the court said. The verdict was pronounced by a special court for hearing cases under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.The woman was raped by five men in front of her husband on April 26, 2019, in Thanagazi in Alwar. The crime sparked criticism by the opposition parties for the delay in lodging a First Information Report (FIR) and not taking action until the purported video of the gang-gape began circulating on social media.On May 18, police had filed the charge sheet against the accused-- 16 days after the FIR. As per the FIR, four men and a juvenile raped the woman while another man filmed the entire incident. They were then asking for Rs 10,000 from the woman for not putting the video on social media. Chhote Lal (22), Hansraj Gurjar (20), Ashok Kumar Gurjar (20) and Indraj Singh Gurjar (22) were charged under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 327 (Voluntarily causing hurt to extort property, or to constrain to an illegal act), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354B (outraging the modesty of a woman), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 376D (gang rape), 384 (extortion), 395 (dacoity) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.Police also invoked different sections of the SC/ST Act and the Information and Technology Act in the FIR.During the course of the investigation, the state government removed the then superintendent of police Rajeev Pachar and suspended the Thanagazi SHO Sardar Singh for alleged laxity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-5-accused-of-raping-19-year-old-dalit-woman-in-rajasthan-s-alwar-last-year-pronounced-guilty/story-uLksI6ZWQqQQQBejdwNxbJ.html

Shaurya is the land version of the submarine-launched BA-05 missile and has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). The land version was discreetly tested for the final time before induction as part of user trials in Odisha’s Balasore on October 3.According to top missile experts, Shaurya is a delivery system stored in a composite canister for rapid deployment and minimum interaction with the elements for a long period. The strategic missile flies at a supersonic speed of Mach 7, or 2.4 km per second, at a height of 50 km (within atmosphere) and hits the designated target at Mach 4.The missile will be soon deployed at locations identified by the Indian Strategic Forces Command under guidance from National Security Council. The missile has a warhead weighing around 160 kg.While the Modi government’s decision to go for a land version is significant as the missile can be launched by a single vehicle, the DRDO is also making rapid strides in the development of a 5,000 km version of the submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). With a range equivalent to Agni-5 land-based ballistic missile, the K-5 will be deployed on Arihant class of nuclear submarines.While missile scientists are tight-lipped about the K-5 SLBM, the weapon system is expected to be tested in the next 15 months and then deployed on the 6,000-tonne Arihant class of SSBNs. The second Arihant-class nuclear-powered submarine, INS Arighat, is to be operationalised within the next six months.The consecutive testing of hypersonic missile (September 7), Shaurya missile (October 3) and supersonic missile assisted release of torpedo (October 5) by DRDO from Balasore are clear signals from the government to the country’s adversary that India will not cow down to any coercion. The 800 km-range subsonic Nirbhay cruise missile will be tested in the next couple of weeks and will be inducted into the Indian Army and Navy. The tactical missile has already been deployed in limited numbers in response to the Chinese build-up in Tibet and Xinjiang.Coming at a time when India is engaged with a belligerent Chinese Army in Ladakh sector, a senior government official said the testing and deployment of short-range delivery platforms clearly conveys Modi Government’s intention of not backing down to any aggression or cartographical expansion plan of any adversary in the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shaurya-missile-to-be-inducted-in-strategic-arsenal-agni-5-s-sea-version-by-2022/story-bS1100SkwoGLEXW5ANFQuO.html

Dinesh Bhatt, president of Rafting Association in Rishikesh said that Rishikesh alone recorded over 6,000 tourists coming in for river rafting in the last three days “In the past ten days, since the Uttarakhand government allowed resumption of river rafting, Rishikesh has welcomed over 8,000 tourists, with almost 6,000 people coming to participate in river rafting in the past three days over the long weekend,” said Bhatt. He added that the response has been well with business picking up, but the rafting companies are still facing minor losses while practicing physical distancing. “Earlier, ten persons were allowed in a single raft, but now, only four tourists are going, with two guides in one raft. We have not increased our prices, so we are facing some loss, but safety is important for us,” Bhatt said. Dilip Jawalkar, secretary for tourism in Uttarakhand said adventure tourism is a major component in the state’s overall tourism industry. “I am happy that our step towards resuming the adventure sports activities have achieved the desired results and has attracted a large number of adventure seekers to the state,” he said He added that while activities for tourists are being opened up, the state government expects full cooperation from all the stakeholders to ensure effective implementation of rules and guidelines to control the spread of Covid-19 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rishikesh-draws-over-8-000-tourists-for-river-rafting-within-10-days-of-re-opening/story-hp1abhrjzeMIhU6GL4TjOO.html

The state government has already recommended a probe by the central agency.The state government also said in the affidavit, which was filed on Monday, that the body of the 19-year-old Dalit woman was cremated at night to avoid law and order problems. The government has blamed political parties and civil society organisations for attempting to create a caste divide in the aftermath of the crime in September.“The district administration took the decision to convince the parents of the victim to cremate her with all religious rites at night to avoid large scale violence in the morning. Once the post mortem of the deceased victim was already conducted at Safdurjung hospital, New Delhi, there cannot be any bad intention on the part of anyone to expedite the cremation except to obviate the political violent situation resulting from planned caste divide by certain vested interests,” the affidavit said.Also read | UP police arrest ‘PFI-linked’ men on their way to Hathras from Delhi: All you need to knowThe affidavit went on to blame the “vicious propaganda” unleashed on social media and by certain sections of print and electronic media and some political parties to deliberately mislead the public and to create caste and communal disharmony in the state.Besides the Hathras gang-rape, the state has also sought a CBI investigation into the alleged criminal conspiracy to spread caste conflict, instigate violence and into the propaganda unleashed by certain sections of media and political parties.Also read | Rectify mistake, focus on ensuring justice to Hathras victim’s family: Mayawati tells UP govt“The state government is committed to conduct free and fair investigation to reach the truth.

The two have been identified as Md Khurram and Gulab Sheikh. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the BJP leader may have been killed because of some personal enmity and not because of any political reasons, a police officer said. Manish Shukla, an outgoing civic body councillor in North 24 Parganas was shot dead on Sunday by four motorcycle-borne masked assailants at Titagarh around 20 km from Kolkata. The probe was later handed over to the CID even though state BJP leaders have been demanding a CBI investigation. Police had found on Monday that several criminal cases were pending against Shukla. A few years ago, Khurram’s father was killed and the name of Shukla had cropped up in that case. “A person was shot dead last evening in Titagarh area of Barrackpore. Police is investigating the crime and looking into all possible reasons including personal enmity because the victim was accused in some cases of murder and attempt of murder,” West Bengal Police had tweeted on Monday. Shukla used to carry a pistol for personal safety till early this year but his arms licence was cancelled earlier this year.While BJP leaders had alleged that TMC-backed goons had killed Shukla and they were hand-in-glove with the local police, TMC leaders refuted the allegations and hinted that BJP leaders could be behind the crime. West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday stirred up a controversy by accusing the state police of trying to cover up the murder and called for an independent probe. The TMC described Dhankhar’s statement as “irresponsible” and alleged that Shukla was involved in extortion and murders and was propped up by a BJP MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-arrested-for-bjp-leader-s-murder-in-bengal-cops-suspect-old-enmity/story-pfEx1vzv94x6Rl8nKXUmgI.html

06-10-2020||India||UP police arrest ‘PFI-linked’ men on their way to Hathras from Delhi: All you need to know||Police in Uttar Pradesh have claimed they have apprehended four people linked with the Popular Front of India (PFI) in Mathura, while they were on their way to Hathras from Delhi.The development comes amid allegations by chief minister Yogi Adityanath there is a big ‘international conspiracy’ to defame his government and attempts to spark caste and communal riots over the murder and gang-rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in the state’s Hathras district.Here’s what you need to know:1. The four men, according to the police, are linked with the PFI’s student wing Campus Front of India (CFI). They were identified as Atiq-ur-Rehman, Siddiqui, Masood Ahmed and Alam.2. In a press release late on Monday, the police said the four were moving towards Hathras in a car and were detained as suspicion grew around their movement. The four are being interrogated, the release added.3. On Monday, Adityanath alleged there is an ‘international conspiracy’ to defame his government over the Hathras gang-rape incident. Attempts are being made to stoke sectarian violence in the state, he further alleged.4. The UP police have filed 19 first information reports (FIRs) in seven districts, including those of sedition and promoting enmity between different groups, in this regard.5. The woman was allegedly gang-raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died in a hospital in Delhi on September 29 and was ‘forcibly cremated’ by the police in the early morning hours of September 30.6. Last week, there was a steady stream of political visitors to her village. Among those who met the victim’s family were Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday, two days after being stopped from going there.7. The UP government is facing severe flak for its handling of the incident. It has set up a three-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case and also recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Also, the case will be tried in a fast-track court.8. The UP police too are under intense scrutiny for cremating the victim’s body against her family’s wishes. It has also been accused of manhandling political leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Derek O’Brien and Jayant Chaudhary, and misbehaving with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.9.The PFI was formed in Kerala in November 2006 by merging three Muslim organisations, which were formed after the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya was demolished in 1992. In recent days, it has come under the scanner for its alleged role in anti-CAA (full version) protests in UP and communal riots in Delhi in February this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-police-arrest-pfi-linked-men-on-their-way-to-hathras-from-delhi-all-you-need-to-know/story-rkyRsYEmXps2c6iHzmij7O.html

The deceased was identified as Sonam Manhas, daughter of Bhagwan Singh of Talab Tillo in Jammu. “Her body was recovered around 6 pm on Monday. We have registered a case at Talwara police post and have also initiated inquest proceedings under section 174 Cr PC,” Reasi district’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rashmi Wazir said.Her family had lodged a missing report at the Parade police post in Jammu on Sunday evening after she did not return home, the district police said.The police officer said the woman had to appear in her UPSC exam at SRML Higher Secondary School at Parade Ground in Jammu city. “The family claimed that she had left home to appear in the UPSC exams but then she didn’t turn up there at the SRML School. We also came to know that the woman had some relatives in the Sila area of Reasi.” “Her last location was traced to Siyad Baba in Talwara -- a religious place before her cell phone was switched off and this morning (Monday) our police teams launched searches in the area. They found her body in the Siyad Baba area. It appears that she had jumped off from a hill on the rocks and not in the stream,” said the SSP. “We found her body with a dupatta tied over her eyes. Prima facie it appears to be a likely case of suicide but we have to wait for the post mortem report and investigations,” she added The post mortem will be performed by a team of doctors in Reasi district hospital on Tuesday.

06-10-2020||India||Special websites likely for details of cases pending against 4,859 former, serving lawmakers||The Supreme Court is likely to consider a proposal asking all high courts to have special websites for details of cases pending against 4,859 former and serving lawmakers along with the progress in each trial as part of attempts to expedite them.The suggestion is among recommendations of Vijay Hansaria, the amicus curiae (friend of the Court) assisting the Supreme Court in connection with Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay’s plea seeking fast-tracking of pending criminal cases lawmakers.Hansaria submitted a report to the court on Monday analysing the pendency of 4,859 cases at 25 high courts.The report said the number of cases pending against serving and former members of parliament (MPs) and legislative assemblies (MLAs) has increased over the last two years despite the Supreme Court’s monitoring for expeditious disposal. “It is therefore submitted that strict monitoring at the micro-level, by the High Courts, is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases against legislators.”Hansaria considered suggestions from various high courts on possible steps to expedite the trials. He cited Telangana high court’s move of creating a special website to update the pendency and status of the cases and called it useful. “A special website may be created for posting the details of cases pending against MPs and MLAs in various courts, including the case status, as has been done by the Telangana High Court.”A Justice NV Ramana-led bench will take up Hansaria’s suggestions on Tuesday.The Supreme Court on September 16 asked high courts to consider framing action plans for disposal of the pending cases within a year.In an earlier report submitted to the Supreme Court on September 15, Hansaria recommended special courts in each district to exclusively deal with cases against lawmakers. Such courts currently function in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Kerala.Except Tripura and Meghalaya high courts, others have filed their action plans and largely favoured setting up of special courts in each district. Some have proposed these courts at zonal levels. Almost all high courts have also registered suo moto writ petitions (on their own) to monitor the progress of trials pending against lawmakers within their jurisdictions and to give suitable directions.Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of such pending cases (1374), followed by Bihar (557), Odisha (445), Tamil Nadu (361), and Maharashtra (337). The status of cases pending with the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, and other central agencies under the Prevention of Corruption Act, etc, is still awaited. The Supreme Court has directed the Centre to furnish this information.In his latest report, Hansaria has said some high courts have written to the state governments seeking appointments of police officers as nodal prosecution officers and additional special public prosecutors as part of the Supreme Court’s September 16 directions.A nodal prosecution officer will be responsible for producing accused and witnesses and ensure execution of summons and non-bailable warrants. In case of any lapse, the officer would be liable for contempt of court apart from disciplinary proceedings, Hansaria said.Hansaria has also raised the issue of stays granted in the cases related to the lawmakers. The Supreme Court has granted stays in 10 such cases and high courts in 300 without finally deciding the matter. Most high courts informed the top court that special benches have been constituted to dispose of the cases.Hansaria requested the top court to pass directions for listing the 10 cases. He added this will require appropriate directions from the Chief Justice of India for urgent listing.In its action plan, the Kerala high court has said the police are reluctant to arrest legislators. It has called this one of the reasons for the pendency of six cases against legislators before vigilance courts and 310 cases before magistrates.Hansaria has recommended directions to the police superintendents to ensure execution of warrants/summons to accused legislators, failing which they shall be liable for contempt action and disciplinary proceeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-websites-likely-for-details-of-cases-pending-against-4-859-former-serving-lawmakers/story-3KQMmShE2195QcuAWQVMeM.html

However, she added, the government can “still rectify its mistake” and provide justice to the victim’s family.On Sunday, Uttar Pradesh police lodged at least 19 FIRs across the state on charges ranging from attempt to trigger caste conflict to sedition in connection with the incident.Also Read| Hathras fallout: Yogi Adityanath smells ‘international’ plot to destabilise UP govtOne of the FIRs lodged at Chandpa police station in Hathras district against “unknown persons” mentioned alleged attempts to foment cast conflict, promoting enmity between groups and tarnish the image of the government and invoked section 124A of the Indian Penal Code -- the serious charge of sedition.The FIRs also deal with content posted on social media.“Time will tell whether UP government’s charge against the Opposition that it was conspiring to incite caste and communal riots to impact development under the guise of Hathras case is right or electoral trick. But the public opinion demands that it is better if the government concentrates on bringing justice to the family of the victim,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.The 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped by four “upper caste” men on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment.The victim was cremated near her home on September 30. But her family alleged they were forced by the local police to conduct her last rites in the dead of the night. Local police, however, said the cremation was done “as per the wishes of the family”.“There’s a lot of anger and outrage across the country over the wrong and inhuman treatment given to Hathras victim’s family. The government can still rectify its mistake and be serious about bringing justice to the victim’s family, otherwise it will be difficult to prevent heinous incidents,” Mayawati added in another tweet.Also Read: ‘CM Yogi playing ‘riots game’ to divert public attention’: Samajwadi Party leaderThe state government has recommended a CBI probe and quoting an FSL report, it has denied the woman was raped.In his address to BJP workers on Monday, chief minister Adityanath referred to “recent incidents” and said “anarchist elements” were trying to trigger communal and caste violence in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rectify-mistake-focus-on-ensuring-justice-to-hathras-victim-s-family-mayawati-tells-up-govt/story-eXc534HaE55NinctFuFA2N.html

Chakraborty’s brother Showik and Rajput’s former manager Samuel Miranda will also be produced before the court along with the 28-year-old actor and 17 others arrested in the case. NCB has stated that Chakraborty and her brother financed and arranged drugs for Rajput at his instructions. The actor, however, maintains that she is innocent. She has alleged that she has been falsely implicated in the case and was coerced into making “self-incriminatory” confessions by the central agency. Meanwhile, Bombay High Court (HC) has reserved its verdict on the bail petition filed by Chakraborty, Showik and other co-accused in the drugs case. NCB contested their application saying a strong message must be sent out to the society, especially youngsters, to ensure they don’t consume drugs. Also Watch | Sushant case: Mumbai top cop ‘not surprised’; Sena sees plot after AIIMS reportIt added that the Chakraborty siblings and others arrested in the drugs case were “active members of a drug syndicate” and vowed to go to the roots of the case, an offshoot of probe into filmstar Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June.Chakraborty’s earlier bail plea was turned down by a special court saying if the actor was released on bail she might alert others and they might destroy evidence. The arrests have been made under section 27A of the NDPS Act, which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders.Rajput was found dead at his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing his death while the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is looking into the money laundering angle.

He knew that there was a threat to his life, said his father and local JP leaders. The weapon’s licence was revoked by the police about eight months ago, his father as well as the local BJP Lok Sabha MP, Arjun Singh, said on Monday. “Unlike other states, politicians from opposition parties face death threats in West Bengal. My son had to surrender his pistol after the licence was revoked by the Barrackpore police. He never fired a round but the police cancelled the licence without assigning any reason. Attempts were made on his life earlier also,” Chandramoni Shukla, father of the slain leader, said. “Shukla was not an exception. The police revoked the gun licences of my son and nephew as well. They did not show any reason. This was done to make them vulnerable to threats. We have learnt that Shukla was shot with a 9 mm carbine. These weapons are used by the police,” Singh told HT. Singh’s son Pawan Singh is the legislator from Bhatpara, which is part of the Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency. Urban development minister Firhad Hakim alleged that Shukla was a victim of conspiracy. “He was pressured to join the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He was not happy and wanted to return to the Trinamool Congress (TMC). He sent feelers to us. Singh is protected by Central security forces. Why wasn’t Shukla provided with the same security? I have heard that sharpshooters were brought from another state. Police will get to the bottom of this. Shukla was a favourite leader of mine,” said Hakim. Also read: Guv Dhankhar stirs another controversy, says ‘Bengal police trying to cover up BJP leader’s murder’BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national secretary Arvind Menon demanded a CBI probe, saying law and order in West Bengal has collapsed and more than 20 BJP workers have been murdered in the last two months. The West Bengal police, however, said that Manish Shukla, who was an outgoing councilor of the Titagarh municipality, faced several charges of murder and attempted murder. The state police also said that his death could be related to personal enmity. “A person was shot dead last evening in Titagarh area of Barrackpore. Police is investigating the crime and looking into all possible reasons including personal enmity because the victim was accused in some cases of murder and attempt of murder,” tweeted the state police without naming Shukla. “Please do not jump on conclusion without proper investigation. Irresponsible comments on social media tantamount to interference in the investigation. Please refrain from this,” the state police said in a second tweet. Barrackpore police commissioner Manoj Verma refused to divulge details of the investigation but a senior police officer told HT on condition of anonymity that gun licences of many people in Barrackpore came under the scanner last year. “The Arms Act department found that these people had procured the licences from a north eastern state by declaring local addresses in that state as their permanent residence. This is punishable under the Indian Arms Act. Weapons were purchased from gun shops in West Bengal against those licences,” the officer said. “We are checking the sale records of all gun shops in Kolkata and the districts. This is a big investigation,” he added. While the BJP observed a bandh in Titagarh, agitated party workers attacked the police with stones. The police resorted to baton charge and lobbed tear gas shells to disperse the mob. No casualty was reported. Senior BJP leaders and a large number of party workers waited all day outside NRS Hospital in Kolkata where the post-mortem examination on Shukla’s body was conducted. The body was handed over to the BJP leaders around 6.45 pm Barrackpore constituency has witnessed numerous incidents of violence and deaths since Singh left the Trinamool Congress and joined the BJP in 2018. He defeated the TMC’s sitting MP Dinesh Trivedi in 2019. “In July, a professional hitman named Neeraj, who belongs to the gang of Mukhtar Ansari in Uttar Pradesh, was sent to kill me. I came to know of this and informed Union home minister Amit Shah. Last night I lost my brother,” Singh told HT. Hakim alleged that it was Singh who brought sharpshooters from other states. “He introduced this culture in Barrackpore,” Hakim told reporters. Three people were detained by the police on Monday evening for questioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gun-licence-of-slain-bengal-bjp-leader-revoked-8-months-ago-police-say-he-faced-murder-charges/story-3KgiRUPT886TeptkTitQSN.html
06-10-2020||India||Dr Reddy’s asked for fresh application, patent suit against Regeneron’s ‘antibody cocktail’: Latest on Covid-19 vaccine||The cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have mounted to over 35 million and 1,042,679 people have died across the globe even as the World Health Organization (WHO) said its “best estimates” indicate that 10% of people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus.Dr Michael Ryan, WHO’s head of emergencies, said on Monday the figures vary from urban to rural and between different groups, but that ultimately it means “the vast majority of the world remains at risk.” He said the pandemic would continue to evolve, but that tools exist to suppress transmission and save lives. “Many deaths have been averted and many more lives can be protected,” Ryan said.According to Ryan, southeast Asia faced a surge in cases, Europe and the eastern Mediterranean were seeing an increase in deaths, while the situations in Africa and the Western Pacific were “rather more positive.”Researchers across the world are racing against time to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease as several of them have in advanced stages of the clinical trial.Vaccine development usually takes years, but scientists have been racing to shorten that time.Here are the latest developments on Covid-19 vaccine:1. Dr Reddy’s Lab asked to revise protocol for Russian Covid-19 vaccine trialsDr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) has been directed by the expert panel of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to submit a revised protocol for performing phases 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India. Dr Reddy’s Lab had submitted an application to the top drug regulator seeking a nod to conduct clinical trials for the Russian Covid-19 vaccine in India.“The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) had a thorough evaluation of the application submitted by Dr Reddy’s Lab. The SEC has sought revised protocol from Dr Reddy’s Lab along with more information and now Dr Reddy’s Lab has to furnish a fresh protocol to the DCGI,” a government official said, according to news agency ANI.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayDr Reddy’s Lab has joined hands with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine as well as its distribution. RDIF has said it will supply 100 million doses of its potential Covid-19 vaccine to Dr Reddy’s Lab.2. Regeneron antibody cocktail used by Trump faces patent suitAccording to a lawsuit by a California company that patented the technology, the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc “antibody cocktail” given to US resident Donald Trump to treat his Covid-19 symptoms was developed with the unauthorised use of a fluorescent protein.Allele Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals Inc sued Regeneron on Monday in White Plains, New York, seeking royalties for the use of its mNeonGreen protein in developing the experimental treatment. A separate federal lawsuit was filed in California against Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, partners in the race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.Also read | 5 states saw big surge in Covid-19 cases despite fall in national average: DataA fluorescent protein is injected into cells so researchers can watch what’s happening -- to determine, for example, how a virus reacts to an antibody. The patent for mNeonGreen, issued in March 2019, covers the use of the protein, which Allele said scientific journals have dubbed the “gold standard” for testing the efficacy of antibody and vaccine candidates.3. White House blocked tougher FDA guidelines on vaccine approvalThe New York Times reported on Monday that White House officials are blocking new federal guidelines for the emergency release of a coronavirus vaccine, including one that would likely ensure that no vaccine could be authorised before the presidential election on November 3.The US Food and Drug Administration submitted the guidelines to the Office of Management and Budget more than two weeks ago, but they stalled with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the approval process.According to Reuters, an administration official that the approval process was still pending and denied any Election Day connection. The FDA is seeking other avenues to ensure that vaccines meet the guidelines, the Times reported.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has pledged that career scientists, not politicians, will decide whether any coronavirus vaccine meets clearly stated standards that it works and is safe.

06-10-2020||India||Special court likely to pronounce verdict in 2019 Alwar gang rape case today||A special court for SC/ST cases is likely to pronounce the judgment in the Thanagazi gang rape case in Rajasthan’s Alwar on Tuesday. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang raped by five men in front of her husband on April 26, 2019, in Thanagazi in Alwar. The Rajasthan government drew criticism from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bahuajan Samaj Party chief Mayawati during the Lok Sabha election campaign for the delay in lodging an FIR in the case and not taking action until the purported video of the sexual assault began circulating on social media. According to the FIR lodged on May 2, 2019, four men and a juvenile took turns to rape the woman near Duhar Chaugan between Thanagazi and Talvrikash for three hours after beating her husband while another man filmed the assault. The accused demanded Rs 10,000 from the victim for not putting the video of the gang rape on social media. The FIR was registered on the day the video of the ghastly crime went viral on social media. Police filed the charge sheet against the accused on May 18, 2019, 16 days after the FIR. Chhote Lal (22), Hansraj Gurjar (20), Ashok Kumar Gurjar (20) and Indraj Singh Gurjar (22) were charged under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 327 (Voluntarily causing hurt to extort property, or to constrain to an illegal act), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354B (outraging the modesty of a woman), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 376D (gang rape), 384 (extortion), 395 (dacoity) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.Police also invoked different sections of the SC/ST Act and the IT Act in the FIR. The fifth accused Mukesh Gurjar, 28, was charged under different sections of the IT Act for circulating the video. The prosecution produced 32 witnesses. The trial of the minor is currently on in the district and sessions court. The state government removed the then superintendent of police Rajeev Pachar and suspended the Thanagazi SHO Sardar Singh for alleged laxity. On June 7 last year, the Rajasthan government ordered FIR against the SHO under section 166A(C) of the IPC, which covers a public servant failing to record any information given to him in relation to cognizable offence. Circle officer Jagmohan Sharma was transferred out of the district after the charge sheet was filed. Other staff of the police station was sent out of Jaipur police range. HT has earlier reported the findings of an administrative inquiry into the case in which Pachar was found guilty of negligence as he did not visit the spot within 24 hours of the incident. A police inquiry prior to this had given him a clean chit.

Like hepatitis B and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, hepatitis C virus is a blood-borne virus. In the late 1969, Alter showed that a non-A, non-B blood-borne virus also caused liver disease, and in 1989, Houghton successfully cloned the virus by introducing viral DNA from an infected animal into bacteria, and using human antibodies to screen for its genetic sequence. This pioneering molecular biology technique to identify a virus led to tests to screen blood for hepatitis C virus, which increased blood safety. Rice cloned the virus to demonstrate that it alone caused disease. Also Watch | US-British trio win Nobel Prize in Medicine for Hepatitis C discovery “The main work on hepatitis C virus discovery was Houghton’s, though Alter suspected it much earlier but couldn’t prove it. Harvey Alter...wrote a poem in 1988 titled, “I Can’t See the Forest for the HBsAgs”(hepatitis B virus surface antigens), which moved scientists to tears. Another person who contributed to blood safety was the Indian doctor Girish Vyas, who was the director of the blood bank at UCSF Medical Center in the US from 1969-88, and found unexplained cases of jaundice that hepatitis A and B couldn’t account for,” said Dr Shiv K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hepatitis-c-discovery-earns-trio-nobel-prize-for-medicine/story-cfnLSEylOY4sk8v9rLjsqJ.html

We have several languages and dialects and can use AI to bridge the language barriers,” he said. “It remains our collective responsibility to ensure trust in how AI is used. Algorithm transparency is key to establishing this trust. Equally important is accountability. We must protect the world against weaponisation of AI by non-state actors,” he said.Addressing the conclave, Union minister for information and technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said that technology has helped improve governance in India. “We have e-hospitals, digital markets for farm produce, digital literacy and nearly 17.2 billion was transferred using the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme. 10.6 million farmers use e-markets to sell farm produce...we welcome AI because it has enormous potential to generate development and equity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-calls-for-use-of-ai-in-health-farm-sectors/story-ITU6WcmQCWo7MX7y3XFCZN.html

Although the extradition proceedings against the liquor baron concluded in May after the UK high court rejected Mallya’s plea to approach the UK Supreme Court against the proposed extradition to India, the fresh proceedings have delayed his departure for India, the apex court was told. “After extradition proceedings were complete, another secret proceeding has commenced, but we have not been notified and we are not a party to the proceedings. The extradition is not happening (due to the new proceedings),” advocate Rajat Nair, representing the central government, told a bench headed by justice UU Lalit. Mallya flew to the UK in March 2016 as a consortium of Indian banks, which claims that he owes them ₹9,000 crore in principal and interest on loans extended to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, closed in on him to recover the money. He was subsequently declared a wilful defaulter in India.Also Read | Bad Boy Billionaires: Sid Mallya says his father is a ‘political pawn who was made an example of’In London, speculation arose that most likely issue holding up Mallya’s extradition to India was an application for asylum, which is a process on which British authorities do not publicly comment in individual cases as a matter of policy and strict data protection laws.Mallya has lost a series of challenges to his extradition in the Westminster Magistrates Court and the high court since proceedings began after his arrest in April 2017. Under UK rules, until an asylum application is determined, extradition cannot be carried out.“It’s an asylum claim for sure”, an individual associated with past extraditions said.A ministry of home affairs spokesperson did not respond to HT’s queries on the matter.A high commission spokesperson had stated on June 5: “Vijay Mallya last month lost his appeal against extradition, and was refused leave to appeal further to the UK Supreme Court.”“However, there is a further legal issue that needs resolving before Mr Mallya’s extradition can be arranged. Under United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. The issue is confidential and we cannot go into any detail. We cannot estimate how long this issue will take to resolve. We are seeking to deal with this as quickly as possible.”The UK home office has a backlog of over 100,000 asylum applications.In the year ending June 2020, the UK offered protection – in the form of asylum, humanitarian protection, alternative forms of leave and resettlement – to 16,952 people, latest official figures show.Grant rates vary considerably by nationality as the protection requirements of specific nationalities or individuals vary, officials said, adding that of those nationalities that commonly claim asylum in the UK, Libyans (98%) and Syrians (96%) typically have high grant rates, while nationals of India (3%), China (19%) and Bangladesh (16%) typically have low grant rates.On Monday, the Indian Supreme Court asked Mallya’s counsel, Ankur Saigal, about the nature of the fresh proceedings cited by the Centre, but the lawyer said that he had not received any instructions from his client on the subject. The bench, which also comprised justice Ashok Bhushan, objected to Saigal’s response.“As his counsel, you must be completely aware. You cannot say you are not aware,” the court remarked, and posted the case for the next hearing on November 2.The court also ordered Mallya’s lawyer to submit a concrete response on November 2 about the nature of the fresh proceedings in the UK, when those proceedings are likely to conclude and when Mallya will make an appearance before Supreme Court.Also Read | CBI gets letter rogatory to investigate fund flow in Vijay Mallya’s bank accountsThe court was hearing a contempt petition filed against Mallya by 14 banks including State Bank of India for violation of the Supreme Court’s order of April 2016 asking the fugitive businessman to disclose details of all his properties and assets in India and abroad.The contempt plea itself arose from a case filed by the banks before the Debt Recovery Tribunal in Bengaluru against Mallya seeking recovery of more than ₹6,300 crore owed to them in 2016 by Mallya’s companies. The banks had also prayed that Mallya’s passport should be frozen and he should be arrested.The DRT failed to hear that prayer by the banks, prompting them to approach the Karnataka high court, seeking appropriate directions to the tribunal for quick disposal of the application moved by banks. The Karnataka high court in March 2016 denied the request, prompting the banks to move the Supreme Court, which in April 2016 sought details from Mallya about his assets.The banks approached the top court in July 2016 alleging that Mallya failed to make such disclosure. The judgment in that contempt case holding Mallya guilty was pronounced only on May 9, 2017 nearly 10 months after the plea was filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extradition-stalled-vijay-mallya-seeks-asylum/story-aQ260a6QVo1FwdFDnJqVdN.html
06-10-2020||India||Tarawati: Unsung hero who risked her life daily||A new sanitation worker has been assigned to the streets of ward number 257 in north-east Delhi’s Vijay Park locality. Tarawati (who only used her first name), the previous worker who cleaned the lanes there for eight years, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in June. Tarawati’s source of infection remains unknown more than three months after her death, said eldest son Joginder, highlighting the precarious conditions under which thousands of sanitation workers do their daily work during the pandemic. Tarawati, a permanent employee of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation for the past 30 years, is among 23 sanitation workers who have died of Covid-19 in the past six months in Delhi. On June 10, the 56-year-old felt a fever come on, so after work, she went to a doctor for medicine. But over the following week her condition only became worse. She got herself tested for Covid-19 on June 16, but three days later, she was admitted to the Baba Sahib Ambedkar Hospital — the same day, her test results came back positive. She died the next day. “Mother was given charge of sweeping the roads and clearing pavements of seven particular lanes in her ward. She was regularly in contact with the families who lived there, other sanitation workers deployed in the ward and random people on the street. When she tested positive for Covid-19, district health officials could not trace the source of infection. So, it remains unknown till today how she contracted it,” said Joginder, also a sanitation worker deployed in a neighbouring locality. Joginder said that the municipal corporation had given sanitation workers masks, gloves and sanitisers. However, this was not enough for workers like his mother and him, he said.  “Rich people have more resources for healthcare and isolation. These are basic things that the poor cannot afford. But people like us still have to risk our lives and do our jobs. Many sanitation workers do not know much about protecting themselves. We need to be told about this in a systematic, methodical way,” he said. Tarawati is survived by her three sons, Joginder, Arjun and Rajesh. All are married and have children of their own. Arjun, a driver and Rajesh, who worked as a clerk at a physician’s private clinic in east Delhi, lost their jobs during the lockdown. Tarawati’s death set alarm bells ringing for the family. Their house is a maze of small rooms constructed over a 70 square-yard plot in north-east Delhi’s Ghonda Khas village — home to at least 40 other families belonging to the Balmiki community who form part of the Dalit caste.  In Ghonda Khas, most families claim to have lived here for five to six generations — a period over which frail tenements turned into concrete houses (some of them three-storey high) built over 50-100 square-yard plots, much like the one in which Tarawati’s family lives. “My mother was a victim of somebody’s carelessness. Somebody may not have worn a mask, or thrown garbage around. At times it makes me angry. But then there is no point thinking about it. A lot of people have died. We are not alone,” Joginder said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tarawati-unsung-hero-who-risked-her-life-daily/story-WgXO6tXYyZ5y6Lpi7cVz7I.html
06-10-2020||India||Suresh Angadi: Minister with common touch||At 65, Suresh Angadi may have been vulnerable to Covid-19, being a senior citizen, but that never stopped him from doing what he loved best — meeting his constituents. At a time when the world was socially distancing and avoiding physical contact, Angadi was meeting up to 500 people at his home in Belgaum, Karnataka daily. The four-time member of Parliament of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also loved indulging in some dark, pandemic humour with his colleagues. “We all come with an expiry date, we shouldn’t worry, he said to me,’’ Dhananjay Singh, executive director of public grievances, recalled. “I said, that may be true, but we shouldn’t expedite someone else’s expiry date either. We had a good laugh.’’ Singh was attached to the minister of state for Railways since Angadi’s appointment in 2019. Angadi was initially asymptomatic and he had no co-morbidities or prevailing medical conditions like heart disease, hypertension or diabetes. On September 11, he was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi.“The last conversation I had with him was through video call when he was in AIIMS and I was crying,’’ said daughter Shraddha (28), the younger of Suresh and Mangal Angadi’s two children. Also Read | Suresh Angadi: A giant killer who never lost an election“He said ‘Why are you crying? I’m going to be home soon’,’’ Shraddha said. An inability to meet him coupled with the fact that he had been moved to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for developing a cough had made her break down, she said. But Angadi believed that he would recover even after he was admitted to the ICU. “He kept saying that he has a lot of work to do, and he wants to come home.’’However, four days after his hospitalisation, his oxygen saturation dropped to 70% (the normal range is about 95%) and he was put on a ventilator. His condition remained stable over the following week, and Shraddha said that the doctors were about to take him off the ventilator. But then his vitals crashed. From what looked like a manageable infection, the situation became dire within a matter of 10 days. His family, friends and colleagues said that he took his position as the ninth rail minister from Karnataka seriously, and started 30 new trains in Karnataka. But a few dreams remained unfulfilled, Singh said. “He wanted to make Mumbai to Bengaluru a popular train route. The journey takes 21 hours right now by train, and people prefer to fly. Since the start of the pandemic, he wished he could travel to new project sites in Odisha and the Northeast,’’ he said.Others remember him for his ordinary acts of kindness and for the friend he was to them. Office assistant Ravinder Singh said no other minister asked whether a peon had eaten or not, while his driver, Krishna, called him “bahut acha admi’ (a very good man).“I used to tease him as the right person in the wrong party,’’ said former Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka and close friend Prabhakar Kore. “He was so persuasive that he made me also leave Congress and join his party [the BJP]. We all thought he would come out of it fine and now everybody is worried as it’s become that much more relatable.’’Shraddha said among the things that her mother will miss, playing chess with Angadi will top the list. Mangal (57) and the family are still receiving several visitors, constituents and others who come to pay their respects. “We just ensure that our mother is tested regularly. We can’t stop people but we lost dad so we are being very careful about her,’’ Shraddha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suresh-angadi-remembering-everyday-acts-of-kindness/story-pPNYdXPUoPV9Z8GmjubyxN.html
06-10-2020||India||Delhiwale: In search of ‘Videshi Baba’||Sapna means dream and now, indeed, it seems just like a dream. It is Monday noon and the shutters of the Sapna Travel are down. Some steps ahead is Appetite German Bakery. The glass doors are open, but it’s empty inside. The place hasn’t been serving since the pandemic hit this part of the world in late March. The bakery would make Delhi’s best honey-ginger-lemon tea (which went so well with its almond cake).Truth be told, the Main Bazaar in the hotel district of Paharganj is still milling with local people—not many, but some—and yet it is looking ghostly. After all, what is Paharganj without its so-called Videshi Babas, or foreign backpackers? In the BC (before corona) era, before the international travel came to a halt, the locality would teem with foreigners in long matted hair and colourful tattoos. Dressed in all sorts of eye-catching costumes, they would be chilling out in one of the many cafes, or looking for a travel guide in a used bookstore, or staring at us, Indians, who would be staring back at them.But there are no foreigners any more in Paharganj. A shopkeeper—his leather goods store is open—talks of the early days of the lockdown, when “big buses came from foreign embassies to take the foreigners to the airport.”They all went.Here is Madan Cafe, shuttered. Known for its yummy masala chai, it used to be filled with hippie-like travellers. Sam’s Cafe, famous for its rooftop, is also closed. And here’s the dining hall in Ajay Guest House—it made such yummy shakshuka, the Israeli dish. This moment, the place is submerged in darkness, the tables are empty, and no staff is to be seen. In the tourist season, every Paharganj cafe would show-off at least one backpacker, either sitting with a guitar, or a notebook, or some such artsy stuff that people carry when they go to far-off lands to find themselves. That’s all history, now.The Jackson’s used bookstore is shuttered down as well. (A quick investigation reveals that the bookstore has opened but remains closed on Sunday and Monday).Nearby, a most poignant sight. The shutter on a closed shop is painted with a bearded man’s face, with the caption—Videshi Baba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-in-search-of-videshi-baba/story-Kg6U9hz2pp9tM0kcEgPXfK.html

This is almost five-time the number of cases (264) recorded during the kharif harvest of 2019 in the corresponding time period. State authorities are worried at this trend.Amritsar has reported more than 50% of total stubble fires, recording 686 cases. It is followed by 259 in Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur (50) and Patiala (60). All districts where most cases have been reported sow early-growing paddy varieties.“State agencies have taken tough measures this season, as compared to the previous kharif harvest and were expecting fires to be in control. Things, however, have gone awry,” said an officer of the state’s agriculture department. He attributed the early harvest for the spike in cases.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), however, downplays the rise. “It is beginning of the season and the actual trend would be known by the last week of October when we are in middle of the season,” said board’s member secretary Krunesh Garg. In 2018 and 2019 seasons, the number of cases crossed 50,000 and Garg hoped there will be a reduction in this number.To check these fires, the state government has authorised 8,000 nodal officers to keep vigil in paddy growing villages. There are 10,500 villages in the state, where paddy has been grow over 66 lakh acre this year. Of this, 17.5 lakh acre is long grain aromatic basmati.Also Read | Delhi to begin production of stubble decomposing solution today350 farmers have been fined Rs 9.3 lakhThe PPCB has imposed environment compensation of Rs. 9.3 lakh on 350 farmers caught burning paddy stubble this year.

State agencies do not have a system to recover the compensation and have written to the National Green Tribunal to suggest a model. “We are waiting for a reply from the tribunal,” a PPCB official said.The PPCB has challaned owners of five harvest machines for working without the Super Straw Management System (SMS) that state government has made mandatory. The SMS system helps in in-situ management of paddy straw. “Each machine was fined Rs 50,000,” SS Marwaha, PPCB chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fields-on-fire-1-200-cases-of-stubble-burning-in-2-weeks-in-punjab/story-SAQuwLM4Pvll4xN2mjj8gN.html
06-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||US President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 infection and the treatment he is receiving is a good opportunity to revisit the science behind some aspects of the viral disease and the therapies and drugs used to treat it.We know Trump used to take hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), once widely considered a prophylactic for Covid-19, before science showed that it (probably) wasn’t. Sure, it wasn’t as straightforward as that — there were missteps along the way, including research that used dodgy data, but the current scientific thinking is that HCQ does not help prevent the coronavirus disease.THE CASE FOR STEROIDS?The US President has been put on dexamethasone, a steroid whose use is recommended only in severe cases of Covid-19, and whose benefits have been proved by research. It isn’t clear why Trump is being given this if his infection is, as the White House claims, mild.Trump admitted he had been taking HCQ for a few weeks in a May meeting that was widely reported. Interestingly, the details of his current medication released by his physician do not mention HCQ. They do mention zinc — considered by some to be a prophylactic against Covid-19, in particular, and a general immunity booster —but it isn’t clear whether he has been taking this to ward off the coronavirus disease or it is part of his daily vitamin supplements (which, as we all know, the Americans are particularly big on).In addition to this, we know Trump was put on oxygen at least once (although his blood oxygen level dropped twice). This is common in people with moderate Covid-19 infections. The condition is hypoxia, literally low oxygen, and is a sign of the infection starving the body of oxygen. Both anecdotal medical evidence and research has shown that, in some cases, Covid causes silent hypoxia — which means the patient doesn’t exhibit the symptoms hypoxia usually comes with (including incoherence, which usually accompanies altitude sickness).THROWING THE KITCHEN SINK……at his infection. The US President has taken an experimental antibody cocktail made by Regeneron. The US President received this drug through the so-called “compassionate use” route, which allows for the use of experimental drugs that are yet to be approved (and do not even have an emergency-use clearance).Trump’s doctor also said the US President has been put on a dose of remdesivir. This is an injected antiviral which has been shown to benefit mild-to-moderate infections of Covid-19, in the early stages of hospitalisation. Patients get five shots of remdesivir as part of the treatment.Interestingly, Trump’s doctor also said the US President has been put on dexamethasone. This is a steroid whose use is recommended only in severe cases of Covid-19, and whose benefits have, again, been proved by research. It isn’t clear why Trump is being given this if his infection is, as the White House claims, mild; nor is it clear whether dexamethasone can provide any relief at all to early-stage patients. Worryingly, we do not know if the steroid has any adverse effect when given to patients who do not really need it. Indeed, some media reports in the US have used this fact to ask whether the US President’s infection is more severe than what is being claimed.In a classic example of throwing the kitchen sink at the infection — I notice several doctors have actually used the same term — Trump’s doctor has also revealed that the US President has taken an experimental antibody cocktail made by Regeneron. Previous editions of Dispatch have talked about Regeneron, whose cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies targets the spike proteins of the Sars-CoV2 virus. Keeping with the kitchen sink metaphor, it has been revealed that Trump received a more powerful dose of the cocktail (eight grams as compared to the 2.4 grams the company said was usually effective). The US President received this drug through the so-called “compassionate use” route, which allows for the use of experimental drugs that are yet to be approved (and do not even have an emergency-use clearance). Regeneron has released early data from a clinical trial underway that shows that the monoclonal antibody cocktail works in patients with no antibodies against Covid-19 and who are either asymptomatic or have a mild or moderate infection. It still isn’t clear whether this treatment can work in the case of severe infections. That’s a lot of treatment options.So, is there anything left?Well, China’s Sinopharm disclosed recently that several hundred thousand people have already been injected with its experimental vaccines, and Russia has approved the Gamaleya Research Institute’s Sputnik-V vaccine — but it is unlikely that the US President would allow himself be injected with an unproven vaccine from a rival power.The US drug regulator has also approved convalescent plasma therapy, and that too is a treatment option yet to be used by Trump’s medical team. The US President has talked up plasma therapy in the past, despite a panel of experts put together by the US National Institutes of Health in early September saying more evidence is needed before plasma therapy can be recommended for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-9ZGO1J93f5tm6XEy17MsSL.html
06-10-2020||India||Stalemate persists after states rebuff Centre’s GST offer||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting on Monday put off for a week a decision on compensating states for the shortfall in their share of the indirect tax revenue after a stormy meeting where states governed by opposition parties insisted that the Centre borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore deficit and reimburse them, four people who attended the meeting said.The meeting had almost ended without resolving the demand of the dissenting states when they asked for a division of voting if consensus could not be reached, two finance ministers of opposition-ruled states said, requesting anonymity. “The crisis was averted as the chair deferred the matter for more discussion, which is judicious,” the finance minister of one state said.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government will immediately release Rs 20,000 crore to states for their revenue shortfall in the current financial year. This money is part of the Rs 65,000 crore compensation cess expected to be collected in 2020-21 in the normal course. “This year whatever we have collected [cess] till now, Rs 20,000 crore will get disbursed tonight,” she said.The Centre had placed two options before the states — borrow Rs 97,000 crore (the amount has been raised to Rs 1.10 lakh crore) to bridge the shortfall in revenue from GST, equal to the shortfall resulting from issues related to its implementation, without repaying either principal or interest, or alternatively, borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore (the remaining deficit caused by the Covid-19 pandemic) and bear significant interest costs.As many as 21 state governments opted to borrow Rs 1.10 lakh crore to repay the funds that would come out of the cess levied on sin goods like cigarettes, pan masala and aerated drinks; and luxury products like automobiles. Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal, had demurred.“About 10 members have expressed their inability to accept either of the two options given to states — borrow Rs 97,000 crore and pay principal and interest from compensation cess fund, or borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore and bear the interest cost. We proposed a third option — the Centre should borrow the entire shortfall, compensate states in full and retire the debt from the compensation cess fund,” the minister said.The Centre could have moved ahead with the first option as 21 states, the majority, have already accepted it. But, it would not have been possible without a division of voting, the ministers cited above said. Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have, so far, opted for the first borrowing option.A person representing the central government said on condition of anonymity: “The issue of borrowing is not something which is under the jurisdiction of GST Council. Legally, some 10 states cannot stop other members — 21 states — from opting for the first borrowing option.”Also Read | GST collection shows growth for the first time since March“Today the Council exercised its authority to extend the levy of cess beyond June 2022. This decision has actually assured all states that they will get full compensation with respect to any shortfall as compared to the protected revenue of 14% growth. But those [states] who want to borrow cannot be stopped,” the person said. Borrowing is the individual choice of a state, which squarely falls under the Article 293 of the Constitution, the person said. “When something is not under the jurisdiction of the GST Council, how can any voting or division be permitted? Voting can occur in GST Council only on those matters which are under the express jurisdiction of the GST Council,” the person added. “If there is no consensus in the GST Council on the above negotiable issues, the legal provisions for Dispute Resolution Mechanism within the Council should be activated without delay,” Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said.He put forward two non-negotiable cardinal principles on compensation — there can be no bifurcation of the revenue shortfall for calculating compensation, with one portion being blamed on Covid-19 on another on GST implementation issues; secondly, compensation cannot be linked to normal borrowing or additional borrowing limits allowed to states. “Both the options presented by the central government infringe upon the above two cardinal principles and therefore not acceptable,” he said. Once the two basic principles enunciated above are accepted, compensation can be discussed and an attempt made to arrive at a consensus on issues such as who borrows and in what proportion, how much to borrow this year and how much in 2022, Isaac said.There was a consensus in the Council to extend the period of compensation beyond June 2022, for such period as may be required to meet the revenue gap, Sitharaman said at a press conference after the meeting.The GST Council is empowered federal body on matters related to the indirect tax. It is chaired by the Union finance minister and represented by the finance ministers of states. On deferring the meeting for one week to October 12 over the compensation cess issue, she said that 21 states had chosen the first option, but there were some that have not chosen either. “It was felt that you can’t decide on the basis of 21 which have written to you, we need to talk further,” she said. “I was also gently reminded that I can’t take anybody for granted. I don’t take anybody for granted, I have said this there and I am saying it here. I’ve always been open for more and more talk which is what I have said there and I’m saying it here too,” the finance minister said. At the time the new tax regime was introduced in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to June 30, 2022); any revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury and sin goods. The cess would have ceased to exist after June 30, 2022, without the Council’s decision to extend it.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said: “Though the Centre has increased the borrowing limit under option one, the same is not expected to pacify the opposition-ruled states and they are expected to stick to their guns in the upcoming meeting on October 12th, forcing the centre to either constitute a committee of ministers or formulate another dispute resolution mechanism to bring consensus.”Atul Gupta, partner at Deloitte India, said, “There is an underlying and implicit recognition by the GST Council members of the fact that the authority and responsibility of the GST Council should not get undermined and to that effect there has been a concerted bid by all participants for achieving a consensus on the issue of shortfall in compensation cess and also of GST revenue accruing to the states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalemate-persists-after-states-rebuff-centre-s-gst-offer/story-ujI0s9XfQzurBNrulSC5hP.html
06-10-2020||India||Govt issues SOPs for reopening of schools||With schools set to reopen in a graded manner on October 15 after a nearly seven-month break, their management teams will have to ensure that all areas and fixtures on the premises, including water tanks, kitchens, canteens, washrooms, storage areas, laboratories and libraries are disinfected thoroughly to protect staff and students from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Schools will also have to ensure the presence of trained health professional like a doctor or nurse on campus or available on call. Closed indoor spaces will require adequate air circulation. Schools will also have to form emergency response teams and hygiene inspection teams when they reopen, according to a standard operating protocol prepared by the Union education ministry and released on Monday.A distance of six feet has to be maintained between students, with one student per desk being the ideal. Classes can be held outdoors If the weather is pleasant. Schools will be strictly spitting-free zones. Schools have been given the option of calling in only a certain percentage of pupils at one time to avoid overcrowding. They have the option of holding extra shifts or tailor classes on the odd-even model. Schools will also work to communicate the safety measures to parents. Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who released the guidelines on the basis of which states can prepare their own protocols, said no assessments or tests should be conducted for up to two to three weeks of a school reopening. Organising functions and events has also been barred. Time tables will be staggered as will be the entry and exits of student.“States and UTs to prepare their own SOP regarding health and safety precaution for reopening of schools based on the SOP to be issued by the department of school education and literacy of the education ministry. States/UTs may adopt or adapt the SOP as per local context and requirements,” said Pokhriyal.Educational institutions have been closed since March, when a nationwide lockdown was put in place to control the spread of the pandemic that has infected millions across the world and claimed more than one million lives so far. The government has allowed states and Union territories to open educational facilities in a graded manner starting on October 15; in Delhi, all schools will be closed for the rest of the month.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in New Delhi’s Rohini, said: “The SOPs are simple and easy to implement. Many schools, including ours, have already decided to follow all these norms once the schools will reopen in Delhi. We will have to create awareness among students and parents about the importance of masks, sanitisers and social distancing so that all these guidelines can be implemented without any hurdle once the schools reopen.”The education ministry guidelines strongly emphasise the use of masks -- be it in classrooms or in common areas like canteens, libraries or labs.Even in the canteen, students have to keep a mask on while the food is being served and can remove it only when eating or drinking, an official said on condition of anonymity. Circles will be marked on the ground at drinking water and hand washing facilities to ensure distancing.No outside vendor should be allowed to sell any eatables inside the school premises or at the entry gate/point. Thermal screening of students may be done by the bus conductor at the time of their boarding the bus. Sanitization of school transport on a regular basis at least twice a day – once before children board the transport and once after -- has been suggested. Private cabs or carpooling have to be discouraged as far as possible.For air conditioning within the school, Central Public Works Department norms shall be followed, which prescribe a temperature setting in the range of 24-30°C, relative humidity in the range of 40-70% and provision for intake of fresh air and cross-ventilation.“The problem is not opening of schools, the real challenge will be to ensure students follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, especially when you see adults around taking preventive measures too casually. Also, there is enough evidence to suggest that there is greater risk of passing on the infection in closed air-conditioned spaces. Kids themselves may not be very sick but once they come back home they might pass it on to the more vulnerable population such as their grandparents,” said Dr JS Bhasin, head of the paediatrics department at BLK Hospital in Delhi. The guidelines also stress the need to sensitize students and staff, including those at hostels, on the need for social distancing.The guidelines allow for changes in the academic plan, particularly those relating to vacations and exams, in the Covid-19-affected year.Attendance requirements will be flexible and students who want to continue online learning can do so. Regular health check-ups should be organized. Appropriate protocols have to be followed in case an infection is detected.The ministry has also suggested that teachers discuss with their students learning goals and the roadmap and methods they would employ to teach the curriculum. The guidelines also direct schools to focus on the needs of students from vulnerable sections like the homeless or migrants. The norms allow the use of diverse teaching resources, including volunteers. Steps have also been suggested to ensure that students maintain sound emotional health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-waste-a-single-vote-on-jd-u-says-chirag-paswan/story-gAEXlc9I6dCKbQaTpZSDmN.html
06-10-2020||India||Bihar elections: Don’t waste a single vote on JD(U), says Chirag Paswan||A day after walking out of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Monday penned an open letter to people of the state, once again attacking incumbent Nitish Kumar government’s ‘seven resolves’ developmental programme, and the approach of the Janta Dal (United), or JD(U), towards its allies.On Sunday, the LJP had said that it would fight the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections separately and not as a part of the JD(U)-BJP alliance. The party, however, had reiterated that its differences were limited to the JD (U), and that it continues to support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as an NDA ally at the Centre.In an emotionally charged letter, Chirag urged the people “not to waste even a single vote by voting for a JD(U) candidate” and went on to say that Bihar would have a BJP-LJP government after the polls next month.“Every vote going to the JD(U) candidate will compel your children to migrate from the state. It is a do-or-die battle for 12-crore Bihar people, and we have nothing to lose. I know the way forward for the LJP is not going to be easy, but then it has not been easy for the people of Bihar for the last three decades either,” he wrote.The LJP president also said that the decision to fight against the JD(U) was taken on the basis of suggestions received from the common people. “And it (the decision to contest polls separately) is not to rule Bihar, but to feel proud of the state (Bihar par raaj karne ke liye nahin, balki Bihar par naaz karne ke liye),” he added.He further wrote that some people might try to mislead the voters by attributing other motives to his decision. “But let me tell you, the new government in the state will be BJP-led, comprising the LJP, and the elected MLAs of the party will strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he added.Also Read | JD(U) takes stock of situation as LJP exits NDA ahead of Bihar pollsBihar BJP’s general secretary, Devesh Kumar, said that party’s national president JP Nadda had already announced that NDA’s CM candidate will be Nitish Kumar. “We are fighting election under Nitish Kumar’s leadership,” he added.Attacking the Nitish Kumar government on development and governance issues, he alleged that people’s grievances were neither redressed at the level of local officers nor at the CM’s level in the state. “This has resulted in the development of LJP’s ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ vision document on the suggestions of four lakh people of Bihar,” he wrote. Referring to his ailing father, founder of LJP and union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag wrote that he derived strength from him and his five-decade of social and political life. “I am also worried about him. Seeing him in the hospital surrounded by all kinds of equipment is not easy. But with his blessings, I will go to the people with a promise to realise their dreams,” he added.Chirag had on Sunday tweeted about a heart surgery his father had undergone at a Delhi hospital.“My father always said that party interest is above personal interest and the national interest overrides everything. Today, my decision is in the interest of the country and Bihar. I know my father will also feel proud of me, though working in his company would have been even better,” he wrote. Also Read | BJP and JDU agree to a 50-50 seat sharing for Bihar pollsJD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan on Monday said Chirag’s political journey has so far been in the shadow of his father, and this election would be a big test for him. “Being ambitious is not wrong, but being unrealistic certainly is. The benchmark of development set by Nitish Kumar is for all to see and feel. Nitish Kumar walks the talk, while some people talk and walk away. Nitish Kumar has already brought visible changes in the life of people, who will no more be swayed by empty promises, no matter which side they come from,” he added. On Chirag’s claim of a potential BJP-LJP government ,Ranjan said it was a classic case of ‘one-sided love’. “The pain of one-sided love will be borne by the LJP. BJP has announced that NDA will contest election under Nitish Kumar’s leadership and that explains everything,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-waste-a-single-vote-on-jd-u-says-chirag-paswan/story-q4eINcbfyqO6XHvPTl7szM.html
06-10-2020||India||PM Modi, Xi to come ‘face-to-face’ at virtual Brics Summit next month||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to come face to face, virtually, during the 12th summit of the Brics grouping to be held on November 17 via video conference. This will be the first virtual multilateral meeting to be joined by the two leaders since the border standoff in Ladakh became public in May. India’s foreign ministers and defence ministers have participated in other meetings that featuring their Chinese counterparts in recent weeks. The Brics Summit will focus on further strengthening cooperation among the member states -- Brazil Russia, India, China and South Africa -- amid the Covid-19 crisis, according to a formal announcement on Monday from Russia, the current chair of the grouping. The theme for the meeting will be “Brics partnership for global stability, shared security and innovative growth”. In May, Russia postponed that the Brics Summit, which was to have been held in St Petersburg along with a meeting of the heads of state council of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) during July 21-23, due to the spread of the coronavirus disease. Also Read | China’s PLA complicates troop disengagement over Ladakh. It has a conditionRussia was keen on hosting the leaders of the five Brics countries but several members expressed apprehensions about the holding of an actual summit in view of the risk of infections, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. “Despite the current global situation due to the spread of the coronavirus infection, the activities under the Russian Brics chairmanship in 2020 are carried out in a consistent manner,” said Anton Kobyakov, adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin and executive secretary of the organising committee, to prepare and support Russia’s SCO presidency in 2019-20 and Brics chairmanship in 2020. “Since January 2020, more than 60 events have been organised, including via videoconferencing. The Brics Summit will be the jewel-in-the-crown event of the Russian Brics chairmanship, which will provide impetus for further strengthening cooperation together with our partners to ensure well-being of Brics countries,” he said. Russia has focused on multifaceted cooperation between the Brics countries in order to contribute to raising living standards and quality of life, the official statement said. During 2020, the five countries in the grouping continued their close strategic partnership on three major pillars, peace and security, economy and finance, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, it added. Russia has also helped facilitate meetings between the Indian and Chinese sides, such as the meetings of the foreign and defence ministers on the sidelines of SCO meetings in Moscow last month. Also Read | Modern PLA barracks, heavy artillery at LAC: China mediaThe meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow led to a five-point road map for taking forward disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said the presence of the Indian and Chinese leaders at the virtual summit would be more about “keeping the show going and ticking the box”. “The summit will be more of symbolism than substance. A virtual Brics summit will have the limited purpose of the leaders making statements and going through the motions. During summits held in person, the actual business happens on the margins. With a virtual summit, there will be no business on the sidelines. With so much of tension in India-China relations, the possibility that the Brics summit will produce anything meaningful – I don’t see that happening,” he saidA meeting of the Brics foreign ministers last month expressed concern at violence and conflicts in different parts of the world and said such situations should be resolved peacefully through political dialogue. The joint statement issued after the virtual meeting of the foreign ministers didn’t refer to any particular conflict, and the grouping has a convention of not taking up bilateral issues between its members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-xi-to-come-face-to-face-at-virtual-brics-summit-next-month/story-W9dVI9SlnMv4SlFIu2ngBP.html
06-10-2020||India||China’s PLA complicates troop disengagement over Ladakh. It has a condition||Indian and Chinese military commanders are set to meet in Ladakh on October 12 for their seventh round of talks to reduce friction in the sector, but the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is showing no signs of disengagement, deploying solar- and gas- heated troop containers and pitching snow tents on the ridgelines to defend its positions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) .According to government officials with knowledge of the situation, the PLA has dug in for the winter, with each container accommodating some four to six soldiers, and with new hospital facilities coming up in the depth areas to cater to those suffering from altitude sickness or high-altitude pulmonary edema.While the Indian side believes that comprehensive disengagement and de-escalation will require multiple rounds of military and diplomatic dialogue, PLA commanders have complicated the drawdown by insisting that the Indian Army first disengage from the southern bank of Pangong Tso and the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline before the Chinese Army goes back from the Finger Four spur on the north bank of the salt water lake. Also Read | Modern PLA barracks, heavy artillery at LAC: China mediaWhile the PLA has transgressed into the Indian perception of LAC on the north bank, the Indian Army is holding ground on its perception of the LAC on the southern bank of the Pangong Tso. The Chinese, from their standpoint, believe that India has transgressed into their perception of LAC south of Pangong Tso. Also Watch | ‘No question of China getting the better of us’: IAF Chief on LAC standoffIndian military commanders say the PLA should withdraw first from the Finger Four spur on the north bank and restore status quo ante by going back to Finger Eight, as was the case in April 2020. According to them, since the Chinese first unilaterally changed the status on the north bank, they should withdraw first and establish trust. Given that the PLA have a road right up to their posts on the LAC, they will occupy positions on the Rezang La -Rechin La ridgeline the moment Indian troops withdraw from their current positions on the south bank. The Indian Army occupied these positions on the south bank through military manoeuvres on August 29-30 by pre-empting planned PLA aggression.With disengagement on both the north and south banks locked in a stalemate, it has also come to a halt in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, north of the lake, and the PLA is continuing its efforts to block patrols in the Depsang Bulge area. This has alerted the Indian army to possible Chinese move to transgress into the Indian side of the LAC before snowfall begins after October 15.Also Read | Modi, Xi to come ‘face-to-face’ at virtual Brics Summit next monthEven though the PLA Air Force activity is reduced in the area, its troops are deployed in full strength in occupied Aksai Chin and depth areas all the way up to Lhasa and Chengdu. The Indian Army and Air Force remain on high alert with similar troop strength and support systems.“ If China is looking for incentive from India to disengage from Ladakh, then it will have to wait for another time. The LAC status was unilaterally changed at the directions of PLA Commander-in-Chief Xi Jinping. It is he who has to restore status quo ante,” said a senior South Block official who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-signs-of-disengagement-from-china-despite-talks/story-pZzWb5SRb9hik5ESs6LOKJ.html
06-10-2020||India||Modern PLA barracks, heavy artillery at LAC: China media||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has, for the first time, commissioned new, modern barracks for soldiers and to station heavy artillery close to the disputed Sino-India border in the Ngari region of Tibet as part of its “preparations for war” and “concealment,” a state media report has said.The permanent barracks have been constructed in the backdrop of ongoing border tension, replacing older, temporary housing facilities for PLA’s border troops in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).It’s possibly the first confirmation of satellite imagery released earlier this year, which suggested massive construction activity near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ngari including for an aircraft base in Ngari prefecture.Though not confirming PLA deployment numbers, the report and the photos give an indication of the deployment size – which is clearly large.The new facility is located at an altitude of nearly 15,000 feet and could be close to one of the primary battle fronts during the 1962 Sino-India war.The Ngari prefecture borders India, Nepal and China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and is considered TAR’s most remote region; it is the prefecture with the lowest population density in China. Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar are located in the prefecture.Part of the Demchok area, a flashpoint in the Sino-India boundary dispute, is in the prefectureAlso Read | China’s PLA complicates troop disengagement over Ladakh. It has a conditionThe report by national broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) did not share details about how long it took to build the barracks or when construction started, but said several new construction techniques were used to build the facilities, indicating a short construction time.The PLA released multiple photos of the new facility, showing the sprawling complex including massive buildings and facilities for keeping artillery guns.“While facilitating the daily life of officers and soldiers to the greatest extent, the new generation of barracks also highlights the concept of service and preparation for war,” the report released on October 2 in Mandarin said.Giving details, the report said “…stairs and corridors in the dormitory area of officers and soldiers have been widened to facilitate the rapid assembly of personnel; the war preparation material warehouse and garages have been seamlessly connected to facilitate the rapid loading and dispatch of troops in emergency situations.”The report added that the commissioning of the new generation of barracks will also help shorten the plateau adaptation-period needed by recruits and reduce the incidence of altitude sickness among guards and soldiers.Also Read: Post Ladakh, PLA no longer a bogey for Indian Army | Analysis“…in view of the high-cold and high-altitude environment of the plateau, the design and construction of the new generation of barracks focusses on heat preservation, energy saving and concealment.”Diplomats and military commanders from the two countries have held several rounds of talks to defuse the tension at the boundary and disengage troops since the current standoff began in May.The latest virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, held last week, provided both sides an opportunity to review the situation along the LAC and to hold “frank and detailed discussions” on developments since the body’s last meeting on August 20, India’s external affairs ministry said in a statement. Both the Indian statement and a readout in Mandarin from China’s foreign ministry said the two sides “positively evaluated” the outcome of the sixth military commanders’ meeting on September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modern-pla-barracks-heavy-artillery-at-lac-china-media/story-rydfGSo24EX2K1GxtbIZmL.html
06-10-2020||India||Monsoon withdrawal likely to be delayed||The monsoon is likely to take longer to complete its withdrawal this year because of the influence of two low-pressure areas that are likely to bring widespread and heavy rain to Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and east Madhya Pradesh, weather scientists said.“We don’t see any indication of rains stopping immediately in east and northeast India and even eastern parts of central India. Withdrawal cannot be announced before rain stops completely and, in any case, northeast monsoon will set in over peninsular India from October 15 onwards,” said K Sathi Devi, head of the India Meteorological Department’s national weather forecasting centre.A low-pressure area is likely to form over the Andaman Sea around October 9 and is gradually likely to intensify into a depression over central Bay of Bengal during the next two days, moving towards the north Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts. There is also a low-pressure area presently lying over northwest Bay of Bengal and the adjoining Odisha coast which is likely to persist until October 5 and become less marked, but the cyclonic circulation associated with it is likely to move to south Chhattisgarh on October 6.Under the influence of current low-pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Odisha coast, fairly widespread to widespread rain is likely over Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal during the next four days.Also Read | Depression likely to form over Andaman Sea; widespread rains can delay monsoon withdrawalIsolated heavy rainfall is likely over Odisha during October 4 to 6, over Jharkhand on October 4, 6 and 7, over Bihar on October 6 and 7, over Chhattisgarh from October 4 to 7; the fresh low-pressure area is likely to trigger rainfall over Odisha and coastal Andhra Pradesh from October 11 to 13.“Monsoon withdrawal from the eastern side will be delayed. It will withdraw from northwest India, including Gujarat but will not withdraw very quickly from east India. Another well-marked low pressure area is likely to move from Gulf of Thailand to Bay of Bengal around October 16,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather, a private forecaster.“This is also the cyclone season because the north Bay of Bengal is warmer and there is less wind shear (a zone of change in wind direction and velocity) when the monsoon withdraws,” he added.DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD-Pune, said that as of now the likely depression over Andaman Sea will not intensify into a cyclone but since October is typically the cyclone season, development of more such systems can be expected.Also Read | After 61 years, India records two consecutive years of ‘above normal’ rainThis year, the monsoon’s withdrawal started from west Rajasthan on September 29. Last year, the monsoon started withdrawing only on October 9 against the normal date of September 1 and prolonged rains brought a deluge to parts of Maharashtra, Kerala and Bihar in August when rains usually diminish. The monsoon withdrew completely only by October 17. The monsoon season officially ended on September 30. This year’s monsoon season recorded total rainfall equal to 108.7% of the long-period average (LPA), the third highest since 1990, behind only 1994 and 2019 when rainfall equal to 112% and 110% of LPA was recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-withdrawal-likely-to-be-delayed/story-VT7jOe79LZvCMLPh2W1RCO.html
06-10-2020||India||62.5% hospitalised Covid patients under age of 40: Govt data||Six in every 10 people (62.5%) hospitalised on account of the coronavirus disease in India are below the age of 40, according to an analysis of around 200,000 Covid-19 hospitalisations in India by the Union health ministry’s Integrated Surveillance Programme. The findings is in line with both Indian and international trends where many of the infected are relatively younger people, even though many of the dead are older. According to an analysis of almost 100,000 deaths last week -- the death toll in India as of Monday night was 103622 -- 53% are over the age of 60 and 88% above the age of 45. This is the first time an age distribution of those hospitalised on account of the viral pandemic has been accessed. Only 9% of those hospitalised were older than 60 years, according to the data; 25.84% were in the 21-30 age group; and 22.48% between the ages of 31 and 40. The data shows that nearly one in two people hospitalised on account of Covid-19 was in the prime of life.  The findings about the age-wise distribution of infections and deaths in India appear to be in line with what scientists have observed globally — it disproportionally infects younger people, but the deaths have a disproportionate number of the old.  “The pattern that is visible in India is not really different from the data that is coming from experts globally, that the infection is relatively less common among children, and mostly affects the adult population. Elderly people, and those with comorbidities, are at a higher risk of developing a severe form of the disease,” said a health ministry official who asked not to be named. At least 70% of the deaths have been seen in patients with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac, liver or kidney disease. “Our data from various hospitals shows that most of the patients who have succumbed had comorbidities, with many suffering from at least two chronic health conditions. This category of people needs to be extra careful; this is a crucial part of government’s community surveillance efforts, especially those living in containment zones,” the official added. His reference is to the government’s effort to keep an eye on vulnerable population, including elderly, people with comorbidities and pregnant women, that is at high risk of contracting the disease. In all, close to 4 million people currently are under community surveillance, which includes adults with comorbidities in containment zones.Experts say that because of the high transmissibility of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19, the number of infections could rise, albeit with fewer severe cases and deaths. Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine: Finger-pointing will not save a single life, says WHO“Since it is a highly contagious virus, everyone runs the risk of exposure. However, we are seeing lower severity of the infection, because of which our death rate is also very low, and that could be attributed to the fact that our immunity levels are modulated to fight infections better as compared to say Europeans or Americans. The young population getting infected could also be movement-related as we have managed to quarantine to a large extent, our vulnerable population,” said Dr NK Mehra, an immunology and immunogenetics expert, who was former head, transplant, immunology and immunogenetics department, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “The changing weather, however, needs extra caution as respiratory illnesses are known to get worse with the drop in temperature,” he added. Around 4.4% of those hospitalised were children below the age of 10, suggesting that children are also being infected in some numbers. Child specialists say that while infections among children are not uncommon, they are usually mild.“The severity of the disease is obviously low in children but it is not that there are absolutely no cases of severe Covid-19 illness reported in children.

The police has lodged several FIRs regarding the matter and it will be too early to reveal the names or more details without a proper investigation,” he added.The officer did not present any evidence to support his claim. “Police teams are checking the veracity of these messages. Action will be taken against those involved if anything comes up in our investigation,” Kumar said.Six FIRs were lodged in Hathras district while others were filed in Bijnor, Bulandshahr, Lucknow, Prayagaraj and other places, he added.In the FIR lodged at Chandpa police station, unidentified groups were booked under 20 sections, including sedition (124A of Indian Penal Code) and for inciting caste-based violence.

At least six people, including two in Lucknow, have been arrested in connection with these FIRs.In Hathras, the police filed three separate FIRs against the Bhim Army chief, RLD and SP workers for violating section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, barring the public assembly of four or more people, and provisions of the Epidemic Act during their visits on Sunday, officials said.On September 14, the victim was raped by four members of a dominant caste in Hathras district when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She was partially paralysed in the attack.As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29. At 2.30 am the next day, the police forcibly cremated the body without the family’s consent in a field near the village.Since then, Opposition leaders have made a beeline to the village even as the police and the Hathras district administration have denied that she was raped, citing the forensic report. Five police officials have also been suspended in line with preliminary recommendations of a special investigation team (SIT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-fallout-up-probing-international-plot-to-defame-state-govt-trigger-caste-violence/story-aFGQIhdMErqnQ1JwKRXYML.html
