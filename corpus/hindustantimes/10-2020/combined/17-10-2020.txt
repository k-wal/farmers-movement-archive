17-10-2020||News||On Libya, the drama at the UNSC in 2011 | Opinion||For an ambassador to be covered by TIME is quite heady. But for a deputy permanent representative, even a headline “losers”, would do. This happened to me in the magazine’s edition of July 29, 2011. Former Mexican foreign minister Jose Castaneda wrote a column calling members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) who did not support resolution 1973 adopted on March 17, 2011 “losers”. Under the guise of protection of civilians, the resolution basically authorised the use of all necessary means (code for military action) to bring down the Libyan government led by Colonel Gaddafi. UNSC resolutions must not be vetoed by any of the P-5. But to be adopted, they need nine affirmative votes in the 15-member UNSC. This effectively means that an abstention by a P-5 is a “yes” while a similar action by an elected member is like a “no”. UNSCR 1973 was one of the only times in recent memory when it appeared that even though no veto was envisaged, the nine votes may not be forthcoming. This was mainly because there was uncertainty in the way South Africa and Nigeria would vote. African solidarity and the principle of non-interference in internal matters were important to them and this resolution sought to upend that by invoking a controversial concept of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) introduced some years earlier in UN thinking. The politics behind the votes have been discussed in many places but the nine votes business saw a brief but heightened drama in the UNSC chamber before the vote was called. Our permanent representative (PR) was out of New York on March 17 and I had the privilege of leading the Indian delegation. As soon as I entered the UNSC chamber, just before 3 pm, the usual time for the start of formal Council meetings, I heard a senior UN official, who had long served on Security Council Affairs, saying “here comes trouble”. And, then the PR of a P-5 country that was pushing the resolution rushed to me and wanted to know how we would vote. In his anxiety, he blurted that he was surprised that “this time” they had no indication from Delhi regarding India’s vote. It was soon 3 pm, but the South African delegation was missing and once again the PR of the P5 country was in a tizzy. However, a few minutes later, the South African PR entered the room and explained that he was late having been held up at lunch. Soon, the vote was called, and the resolution adopted with 10 affirmative votes. Both South Africa and Nigeria voted “yes”. Apparently, the South Africans were “persuaded”, possibly during the lunch break, at the highest level by the United States and the Nigerian instruction was to vote as South Africa did. The five Castaneda “losers” were those who abstained — Russia, China, Germany, Brazil and India — while the winners were supposedly the Libyan people. The country has been in strife for a decade now and as the UN marks its 75th birthday, R2P is nowhere to be seen. In the UNSC, India and Germany sat next to each other and provided an excellent focus for the photo that accompanied Castaneda’s article. Germany had been a house divided and its PR remained uncomfortable with his country’s vote. For me, this remained an opening for light-hearted banter often telling him that had his vote been different, he wouldn’t have been in TIME!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-libya-the-drama-at-the-unsc-in-2011-opinion/story-QTi5a3IJIXdDUDutWP7UFJ.html
17-10-2020||Mumbai||Highway Safety Patrol fines 18,125 vehicles in Sept along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway||In merely one month, the Palaspa unit of Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) has imposed fine on more than 18,125 vehicles along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. Of these vehicles, at least 10,115 were fined for speeding on the highway.The action was taken in 30 days of September, while HSP police officials claimed that this was highest number of cases done in a month. The over-speeding vehicles were identified by the interceptor van assigned for the expressway.Assistant police inspector Subhash Pujari, Palaspa unit, said, “In order to bring down the accidents on the expressway, we have been identifying the speeding vehicles with the help of interceptor van. Apart from the 10,115 vehicles fined for speeding, 8,010 people were fined separately for lane cutting, using mobile phone while driving, having black tinted windows, for not having reflector in the vehicles – making a total of 18,125 vehicles that were issued fines in one month.”The interceptor has been in use on the expressway since November 2019.Superintendent of Highway Police, Pradhan Digambhar, said, “The interceptor van sends a message to the mobile number linked with the vehicle registration number about the fine. We also have around 10 CCTV cameras on the expressway that is linked to the server of e-challan to capture violations. These cameras also capture the violation of the motorists.”He said that the HSP staff were initially instructed not to conduct any checking by physically stopping a vehicle due to the pandemic but now the same is being done at the expressway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/highway-safety-patrol-fines-18-125-vehicles-in-sept-along-the-mumbai-pune-expressway/story-PCUvhWNIaoD6XVtfztEy0L.html
17-10-2020||Mumbai||Crime in Navi Mumbai on the rise during lockdown, up by 220 cases in 4 months||After a brief lull in theft cases at the start of lockdown, a surge in number of cases is again being witnessed in Navi Mumbai as Mission Unlock began. From merely 94 cases registered across the city in April, they rose to 314 in August across the city. Police have attributed the recent surge in increased criminal activities to history-sheeters being released to ease overcrowding in prisons. On an average, in the pre-Covid times, at least 450 criminal offences were registered in the city every month, according to the 2019 data of Navi Mumbai police. Recently, the Panvel police arrested Rajesh Kaikade alias Raja, 39, who had a long list of crimes against him ranging from murder to gang-rape. Kaikade was released from Taloja prison a few months ago but it took no time for him to fall back into his old habits. He was rearrested for trying to extort a construction material supplier at gunpoint. Like Kaikade, police said, many habitual offenders were back to committing crimes. In March, the state home minister Anil Deshmukh had announced release of undertrials on parole from across Maharashtra prisons following the decision of Maharashtra High Powered Committee (MHPC). So far, around 10,000 undertrials have been released from the state prisons.In May, only 117 cases were registered in the city but they doubled next month with 248 reported in June. Most of the offences were thefts, motor vehicle thefts and burglaries.“It is not so that a person with no criminal record is going out and committing thefts. The criminal mentality and behaviour are important factors for recidivism,” said Sunil Tarmale, sub-inspector at Panvel police station, part of the detection cell.While 23 burglaries were reported in three months between April and June, 21 cases were registered just in July and 35 in August. While detection is marginally affected due to limited workforce, police are still putting on a brave front.Similar modus operandi “In cases like burglaries and thefts, the modus operandi in many cases is similar to the one adopted by previous criminals. In several cases, those criminals recently released from jails were found to be committing the same crimes for which they were imprisoned earlier,” said Dinkar Mohite, senior inspector at CBD Belapur police station. Some of them were drug addicts and carry out theft to fund their addiction after being released from jail.While a senior crime branch officer said no data was maintained to quantify the number of recently-released persons committing crimes, he said it was a noticeable trend witnessed across police stations. Officials said they were taking steps to curb this menace. Police stay vigilantSuresh Mengade, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, said, “The trend of recently released undertrials committing street crimes has been noticed. Hence, we are more vigilant than ever. We are conducting nakabandis, gathering intelligence and also conducting raids based on the information we receive.”Mengade added the crucial part of the process is keeping tab on those released recently and that was being done by police officials maintaining and verifying updated records of the history-sheeters.The process involves gathering intelligence from informants about the suspects’ latest activities and whether they were staying at their place of residence. “Challenge arises when the accused is traced to outside the city limits. This increases the risk factor for the police officials during the raging pandemic. We have to be extra cautious and at the same time be quick because the accused does not wait for us at the same location and may soon be on the move,” added Tarmale. Like everything, the ways of interrogation have also changed due to Covid-19. Today, policemen are seen maintaining physical distance from the accused out of fear of infection.“Once the test for the accused is conducted and report comes negative can the interrogation proceed properly. Most of us cannot even go close to the accused to interrogate properly,” said another officer. Expert Speak*** Vijay Raghavan, criminologist, is sceptical of the police’s version that most offenders are sliding into recidivism. He says socio-economic conditions are one of the reasons for those committing crimes again. “It is a known fact that those with a criminal record often get re-arrested on suspicion. Ultimately, it has to be proved in the court of law if they are guilty. The other side is that the offenders face social stigma and, at times, even their own families reject them. They find it difficult to find local jobs as they earn a bad name in society. Many come from poor socio-economic background and find themselves with limited job options,” says Raghavan, adding that the prison rehabilitation programme is very limited for under-trials and hence they may get pushed into taking support of earlier contacts and negative peer groups.*** Vaibhavkumar Ronge, sub-inspector at Khandeshwar police, counters Raghavan’s allegation that the accused are picked up on merely suspicion as proving their involvement is still crucial during the first remand at the magistrate. “With the arrest, we also have to prove to the court that there is an involvement of the accused. This means finding evidence such as CCTV footage, call records and also recovery of stolen property,” Ronge says. RECENT CASE STUDIESOctober 9: Panvel police arrested Rajesh Kaikade, 38 for threatening a building material supplier at gunpoint to extort small-time civil contracts in Karanjade village. The accused is currently out on bail in a 2012 murder case where he, with his co-accused, allegedly murdered the village’s former sarpanch.September 4: Three men, recently released from Thane prisons, were rearrested for duping scores of persons under a fake bank loan scheme. Police found the accused cheated a few Navi Mumbai residents of at least ₹14 lakh.August 11: Rabale police arrested two men and recovered four pick-up trucks worth ₹11 lakh from them. The duo committed the crime with two wanted accused while two persons from the gang – one arrested and another wanted – were released during the Covid-19 lockdown from Nashik jail and another prison in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crime-in-navi-mumbai-on-the-rise-during-lockdown-up-by-220-cases-in-4-months/story-1bhKYGZ21YSPHKEwbEeJrL.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||From 17 to 130 days, doubling time of Covid-19 cases slows down in Chandigarh||The health department has said that the doubling time of the new Covid-19 cases in the city has improved to 130 days from 17 days in mid-August.The doubling time is the number of days required for the number of cases in an epidemic to double, based on the rate of the cumulative increase in the number of cases, giving doctors an estimate of the current rate of virus spread.On September 16, when active cases peaked at 3,141, the doubling time was 19 days. At the national level, India’s doubling time has increased sharply to 70.4 days from 25.5 days in mid-August. Higher doubling time suggests slowdown in spread of infection .Steeper decline“The doubling rate has increased manifold in comparison to last month. This is the trend in the whole country, though it’s more pronounced in Chandigarh as the decline is steeper,” said Arun Gupta, health secretary.However, news on the fatalities was grim with 45 deaths reported in October, totalling 22% of the deaths (207) reported so far, pushing up the rate from 1.36 % to 1.52% as calculated between October 1 and October 16. September, however, had the worst record with 106 (51%) of total deaths, 67 reported in the last two weeks as against 39 in the first two weeks of September.Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health department, said all the health facilities had recorded fatalities and that patients were given the best possible medical care.Fatalities among September cases “Patients undergoing treatment from the last 10 to 20 days could not survive so that is increasing the numbers, but not that significantly. It is not that the patients were diagnosed yesterday and could not survive. Majority of deaths are being reported among the patients who were admitted in late September or so,” Dr Nagpal said.Staff from local dispensaries had been roped in to keep an eye on patients under home isolation.The health staff which works in the dispensaries and the hospital staff in Manimajra, Sector 22 and Sector 45 is looking after the patients in home isolation. A particular health worker has been assigned a designated area to check on positive patients through phone and also make personal visits to check the vitals, Dr Nagpal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/from-17-to-130-days-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases-slows-down-in-chandigarh/story-8z3z3HXZzrDWG0sN040vmM.html
17-10-2020||Mumbai||Duo arrested for stealing TVs from Navi Mumbai hotel||The Navi Mumbai crime branch has arrested two men, a month after they stole ten Smart TVs from a Nerul hotel that was shut due to lockdown. The hotel was undergoing renovation in September when the duo raided 15 rooms and stole TVs along with other items from the bathrooms.The duo, identified as Salman Khan, 45, a Mankhurd resident, and Satyam Harijan, 22, from Nallasopara, showed up at Hill View Residency in the intervening night of September 9 and 10.Since the hotel was shut, the owner decided to undertake renovation work. On September 9, the painter finished painting work and locked the premises in the evening. When he returned the next morning, he found the items stolen.“Both the accused have previous criminal records. They broke the window of the rooms to gain access into the hotel. They stole the items in a few hours and then loaded them into an auto, which they used as a getaway vehicle. We are on the lookout for the auto driver, who has gone to his native place,” said NB Kolhatkar, senior inspector, central unit crime branch.The duo stole 10 TV sets, a computer desktop and bathroom fittings including towel racks and jet sprays. The CBD Belapur police had registered the case of house break-in following the incident.The crime branch conducted a parallel probe based on the CCTV footage at the hotel and with the help of informants, traced the accused duo.Police said the accused chose the hotel as they were aware that they will not be caught in the middle of the theft as the area was isolated at night with a quick entry and exit possible for them.“They had planned to sell the TV sets but waited as they learnt police were looking for them. One of them stored the TVs at his Nallasopara house and they fled to Lonavala. There, they took up odd jobs and were keeping a low profile,” said Rajesh Gajjal, assistant inspector, crime branch, central unit.Following their arrest, police recovered nine of the stolen TVs from Harijan’s Nallasopara house. It was also revealed that Harijan was allegedly involved in another theft case under the jurisdiction of NRI police for stealing from a temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/duo-arrested-for-stealing-tvs-from-navi-mumbai-hotel/story-7eZSM1yOjrM7zx6YkhtzeL.html

17-10-2020||Gurugram||Construction of road via Aravalli Biodiversity Park retained in draft mobility plan||Despite facing backlash from citizens on the proposed construction of a road via Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) on Saturday confirmed that the plan for the road has been retained in the final draft of the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP). The draft of the CMP, developed for improving road junctions, construction of roads, bridges, pedestrian footpaths, cycling tracks, among others, is awaiting approval from by the GMDA’s Resident Advisory Council (RAC) and later by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, said officials. The CMP has been compiled by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), New Delhi, to improve public transport and pedestrian infrastructure in Gurugram. A six-month-long extensive study of traffic infrastructure, road network, parking facilities among others was conducted to prepare the CMP. It identified the current problems related to mobility and recommended solutions based on the projected population and expansion plans for the city till 2041. In 2019, the draft CMP was put up in the public domain for feedback to which residents raised objections on the proposal to construct a road between Ambience Mall and MG Road via Aravalli Biodiversity Park. VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA said, “The final draft of the CMP has been prepared that still has the proposed road passing through biodiversity park. The road has a key role as per the mobility projections done in the draft. Whether it will be implemented or not will depend on the approval by RAC and CM. The alignment of the road can be decided as the situation arises.” According to him, the road is important as it is a part of the radial plan with two concentric ring roads, as proposed in the CMP. “The road passing through the Aravallis is a part of the second ring. According to engineers, there will be a missing link in the radial plan if the road is removed from the overall layout,” said Kundu. In 2018, a similar proposal was submitted by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for two roads passing through the biodiversity park connecting MG Road to Delhi-Gurugram Expressway and Vasant Kunj.Sairam Dasari, assistant professor, SPA, who has worked on the CMP project said that road stretch is a part of an outer ring road plan that will act as bypass. “Survey on traffic patterns in Gurugram shows that there are 11 points to enter Gurugram where road linkages are required. Nearly 22% of the traffic entering Gurugram is external as they are using NH48 to cross the city. We are trying to divert the external traffic from the internal traffic by designing an outer ring road similar to Delhi. A part of this ring road passes from Ambience Mall to MG Road and further connects with Gurugram-Faridabad Road.”According to him, options for the alignment of the road that passes through the park has been given in the detailed project report. Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning, SPA said, “It is a misconception that the road stretch will destroy the park. There is no consensus on the alignment of the road, whether it will be elevated or take minimum area of the park or completely avoid it. The decision has to be taken based on the detailed project report. This outer ring road is required as NH 48 has saturated to its capacity. Since Gurugram lacks its urban network plan, it is important to develop one where internal and external traffic is bifurcated.” “Gurugram cannot afford to lose the biodiversity park. Any road passing through the park will spoil the park completely. Gurugram is a smart city and local biodiversity is an important indicator to retain its status as a smart city. The park is a biodiversity hotspot and it would be a shame if it is destroyed,” said Vijay Dhasmana, curator of Aravalli Biodiversity Park.“Gurugram cannot afford to lose the biodiversity park. Any road passing through the park will spoil the park completely. Gurugram is a smart city with a biodiversity park in it. Therefore it should be retained without doing any damage,” said Vijay Dhasmana, curator of Aravalli Biodiversity Park.Experts say the road passing through the park comes with a high environmental cost. Chetan Agarwal, a city-based environment analyst said, “Three factors have to be considered: First what is the utility of the road for Gurugram, how it benefits the real estate market and what is the environmental cost of the project. It has to be looked upon carefully as to why the road is needed. If traffic and easy connectivity are issues, then the authorities should factor in Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor which is designed to ease the traffic burden from Delhi to Manesar.” Sarika Panda, who works extensively on the mobility related issues of the city, said, “Gurugram does not need more roads as it will not solve the traffic problems. The focus should be on shifting from private vehicular infrastructure to public.”GMDA planned to take the project back to drawing board earlier this year due to Covid-19 pandemic which highlighted at the use of personal vehicles rather than public transport due to safety issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/construction-of-road-via-aravalli-biodiversity-park-retained-in-draft-mobility-plan/story-0rdhmWsQso6f1jX3fNcEpI.html
17-10-2020||City||Gurugram: 5,000 visit Sheetla Mata Mandir on first day of Navratri festival||Gurugram: Amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Navratri festival commenced at the Sheetla Mata Mandir -- the most famous temple in the city -- on Saturday with nearly 5,000 devotees turning up on the first day. Temple authorities said that the rush was nearly one-third of the usual strength on the opening day and that largely devotees followed social distancing and other safety protocols.“Around 15,000 people usually turn up on the opening day. We distributed around 35 masks free of cost to devotees who had come to the temple without mask today. Almost all of them belonged to the economically weaker section and hence, we did not levy any fine on them. Regardless, we ensured all other measures such as thermal scanning at entry, hand sanitising, and six-foot distance in queues,” said Yugdutt Sharma, temple officer, Shri Mata Sheetla Devi Shrine Board.With the district administration mentioning that any kind of offerings and prasad distribution is prohibited during the festival in its standard operating procedure (SOP) issued on Friday evening, the shrine board members have installed a counter outside the temple premises where devotees carrying idols and offerings could leave their items behind before proceeding inside.The temple and health department officials are estimating around 4 lakh devotees are expected to visit the festival. Sharma said that nearly 70% of the total number of devotees usually turn out on the last two days of the nine-day festival.To keep constant surveillance on devotees, the temple has installed 58 CCTV cameras. Also, as part of security measures and keeping a vigil on coronavirus-related safety guidelines, around 250 Gurugram police officials, 200 temple staff, and around 50 workers of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) have also been deployed at the temple.DK Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gurugram police, said that due to the lower than the usual rush, there was no congestion on the stretches leading to the temple and added that until there is a change in the situation, no route blockages or diversions would be enforced.“The rush on the stretches leading to the temple was not high and was easily managed. There were no instances of congestion or any traffic build-up as such. Nevertheless, we had deployed a high number of traffic police marshals on the stretch as a precautionary measure. Until the rush increases manifold, our traffic management plan will remain the same,” said Bhardwaj.Vinay Pratap Singh, MCG commissioner and chief administrator of the shrine board, said, “All safety measures regarding coronavirus have been taken in the temple by both the MCG as well as the shrine board. While we understand the relevance of the festival, we want to ensure both devotees and the staff inside the temple stay healthy and safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-5-000-visit-sheetla-mata-mandir-on-first-day-of-navratri-festival/story-IxhSVijCzDpENEMQQnNq9I.html

17-10-2020||City||Gurugram’s air quality worsens, but still in ‘poor’ category||Gurugram: The city recorded ‘poor’ air quality on Saturday with the air quality index (AQI) standing at 280, according to the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). However, the air quality has worsened as compared to Friday’s AQI which was 216.In the past six days (October 12-17), Gurugram’s AQI remained in the ‘poor’ category, except on October 15 when it witnessed ‘very poor’ air quality with an AQI value of 311. As per the data from official air quality monitors operating in the city, Sector 51 and TERI Gram (on Gurugram-Faridabad road) had an AQI of 345 (‘very poor’) and 288 (‘poor’), respectively on Saturday, while a monitor at Vikas Sadan within the Mini Secretariat complex had an AQI of 284. The fourth monitor at National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) set up by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed an AQI of 248. Experts have warned that the city’s air quality is likely to get worse in the coming days. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said that meteorologically north-westerly winds have started moving towards Delhi, while creating a passage in Gurugram. “For a day or two, the air quality in the city will remain moderate. There will be a temporary relief as again from Monday night or Tuesday, there will be an increase in the pollutants due to moderate dip in temperature and stubble burning in parts of Haryana. Owing to this, dust particles will accumulate in the lower periphery of the atmosphere. Air quality is likely to get worse with AQI reaching very poor or severe in the coming days.”Fall in temperature and winds bringing pollutants from farm fires in Haryana and Punjab leads to deteriorating air quality during winters every year. For the next few days, according to the IMD forecast, minimum temperature will dip to 14-15 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature will vary from 32-34 degrees Celsius. Though there will be clear sky till afternoon, experts said nights will see an increase in the pollutant accumulation in the air. As per the CPCB’s categorization of air pollution, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered good; from 51-100 is satisfactory; 101-200 is moderate; 201-300 is poor; 301-400 is very poor and 401-500 is severe. Prolonged exposure to poor and very poor air quality may lead to breathing discomfort and respiratory illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-s-air-quality-worsens-but-still-in-poor-category/story-8twNLx8vn3PQ3HF8NtkBZJ.html
17-10-2020||Gurugram||Realtors offer cash discounts, porting of stuck properties to attract customers during festival season||With the festival season fast approaching, real estate developers in Gurugram are hoping that the last quarter of 2020 would be more fruitful than the rest of the year. The Covid-19-induced national lockdown, which began in March, hit the sector hard with almost no sales. From July to September, with the country relaxing restrictions in phases, there was a noticeable rebound and sales improved, reaching 60% of the pre-lockdown scenario, according to reports by private consultants.But the coming months are a testing time. With Dussehra, on October 25, and Diwali, on November 14, the question that real estate experts are asking is that will the customer spend? Or will they rather save keeping in mind the coronavirus disease pandemic is not yet showing any signs of abatement?Developers across the national capital region (NCR) have pre-empted this with innovative moves — allowing people to buy their property in exchange for their undelivered ones (a scheme called “porting”), attractive discount schemes, and flexible payment plans.Earlier, developers would offer free tickets to exotic destinations abroad such as Europe, free parking space, modular kitchens and finished bathrooms, wooden flooring and similar freebies that would attract customers. However, in the current scenario, buyers are preferring healthy cash discounts and flexible payment plans.Market watchers say this could potentially give the sector the boost it has been seeking.“The pickup in sales in the July-September quarter is driven by affordable and mid-segment housing and by end-users in tiers two and three cities. Around 50,000 home loans under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) were distributed by a large private bank in the last six month. The festive season will see a further jump in sales by about 30%,” said Vinod Behl, a real estate expert based in the city.Under the PMAY, buyers get an interest subsidy of 3% for loans up to ₹45 lakh while for EWS housing it is around 6%, say officials.Earlier, whereas consumers looked for future value appreciation, they are now looking for more short-term tangible options.PortingM3M, a city-based developer has offered customers a ready-to-move in property in exchange for theirs that may be undelivered due to construction delays or other reasons. Called the ‘Port your Property’ plan, this is available to customers of commercial and residential projects, said the developer. These “disputed” properties can be anywhere in the country.“Customers can upgrade their property by opting for a new property from our portfolio. Whatever the amount is paid to the earlier developer would be adjusted in the new project. This will lower the cost of acquisition and a chance for buyers to get out of a stuck property,” said Pankaj Bansal, director, M3M Group, which, however, is not offering any other kind of discount.Cashback, discounts and fee cutsThe Signature Group, which develops affordable housing, has decided to offer an immediate cashback of ₹51,000 on the occasion of Dhanteras for all properties that are booked during festival season.“The enquiries and sales have increased in the third quarter of the year and we have been able to allot 4,000 properties in the last few months. Cash discounts, easy payment plans would be made available to serious buyers during festival season,” said Pradeep Aggarwal, chairman and managing director, Signature Developers.Another developer, who did not wish to come on record, said that he has decided to forego parking fees and maintenance fees for three years, and has decided not to charge preferential location cost. These costs earlier formed almost 5% to 7% of the property price tag.“If the customer wants more, we will even offer to reduce the club charges so that sale happens. Everyone is doing this but won’t accept in public,” he said.Other developers are even offering discount of 1% to 2% discount on stamp duty charges, which otherwise ranged from 5 to 7% of the entire deal, says Behl. “With no GST to pay on ready-to-move-in houses, the discount on stamp duty makes the deal even more sweet for prospective buyers,” he adds.According to Pawan Sharma, a broker in Sector 85, said that such offers were attracting buyers. “The festival season is likely to get better with these offers that were not available earlier,” he said.Advantages of these optionsThe discounts and flexible payment plans will play a crucial role in converting those who are waiting to enter the market into buyers, said Behl.“Developers have large inventories of ‘ready-to-move-in’ properties and they want to monetise the same to ensure positive cash flows. It will help them to launch new projects and ensure its completion,” said Behl.Gaurav Kumar, who is looking to buy a home, when asked whether the current offers made by developers carry weight, said that the present times were the best for an end user to buy a home as interest rate was low, the developers were offering discounts and were desperate to make sales. “ There can’t be better times to buy a home in this city,” he said.Challenge graver than demonetisationThe present crisis, the experts say is more serious than demonetisation, which too had a profound negative effect on the sector. But the loss of jobs and salary cuts, were not a factor then. “That was manageable but the problems caused by Covid-19 seems to be unending,” said a developer, who did not want to be named.Developers are confident that they will be able to sell this year, albeit slowly.“We are not holding large events due to Covid-19 and instead reaching out to buyers with upfront discounts. In a number of cases we are letting them take possession of property even as they arrange payments flexibly in six to nine months. Also, part-payment now and paying the rest of the amount in four to five years is also gaining traction,” said Kamaljeet Singh, vice president, Bestech Developers.“Both premium and affordable properties will be made available at attractive terms so that interested buyers can take the right decision. We will also launch new properties in affordable and premium categories during festival season,” said Prashant Solomon, managing director, Chintels.Ashish Sarin, CEO, AlphaCorp said that combination of demand and supply side enablers such as low interest rate, attractive payment plans, government-aided recovery programmes will help the industry do better.The Central government had created a ₹20,000 crore fund in June for real estate projects that was expected help complete around 350,000 flats and houses stuck in various stages of construction.Solomon, also the spokesperson for CREDAI Haryana, said these measures had a positive impact on stressed projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/realtors-offer-cash-discounts-porting-of-stuck-properties-to-attract-customers-during-festival-season/story-UFAQ0SfiLrcqfBEMz8IPqJ.html

The quack, Surender Singh of Vishnu Vihar, performed the woman’s sonography.“Sonu called the decoy near Manav Chowk for the advance amount and then she was taken to the quack’s residence on a bike, where the test was performed and the sex of the foetus was declared as male. The team that was following them raided the centre and recovered ₹20,000, the machine and handed over both the accused to the police for further investigation,” said Dr Balwinder.The nodal officer added, “The quack used to fool his customers by using a smart reader device along with the oxygen monitoring machine and declare the gender randomly.”Ambala Sadar police station in-charge Suresh said, “The FIR was lodged under sections 120-B and 420 of the IPC and relevant sections of the PNDT Act.

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Festive season gradually driving Chandigarh markets out of pandemic gloom||Even as the Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdown forced near shutting of businesses and kept people indoors, the approaching festival season and significant drop in the number of virus cases has heightened the hopes for all quarters.The onset of nine-day Navratri festivities has already started multiplying customer footfall and sales in the city’s markets, to even pre-lockdown levels for some, say traders.President of Business Promotion Council, Sector 17, Neeraj Bajaj said, “The corridors of Sector 17 which wore a deserted look earlier have started filling up again. People are coming out to eat at restaurants and to buy gifts for their families, and sales have increased greatly. On the weekends, the market looks nearly as busy as it used to be during pre-Covid times.”The old buzz is almost back at Sector 46 market too, shares its association head Balwinder Singh Uttam. “The number of Covid cases has gone down so people aren’t as scared as before and are now used to wearing masks and maintaining social distance. We are highly encouraged by the buyers’ response and hope that sales during the festivals go as high as the previous years.”Stalls to come up before Dussehra Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) chairman Charanjeev Singh, who owns a shop in Sector 22, said the shopkeepers had been asking the UT administration for permission to set up stalls and they have got the same only recently. “Shop owners will start setting up stalls around 3 days before Dussehra. Stalls bring a festive look to the market and the extra space can be utilised for more sales,” he said adding that sweets and clothes were becoming the most sold items in the markets.Plan to use schools, colleges for parking Even though the rush in markets is expected to be lesser than previous years, the traffic police will take the same precautions to monitor the traffic. Officiating senior superintendent of police for traffic, Manoj Kumar Meena said, “We have converted schools and colleges around the 16 busiest markets of the city into makeshift parking. Traffic police personnel will also be posted here to ensure that the rules are followed. Challans will be issued for wrong parking.”However, the CBM chairman said some of the major markets including those in sectors 22, 27, 46 and 46 haven’t been covered under this plan and they will approach SSP Traffic regarding the same.Sales go up at Elante Mall Meanwhile, sales have also gone up in the city’s malls, with Elante looking livelier now after the lockdown. Nexus Malls executive director for corporate affairs Anil Malhotra said, “Elante is now almost 100% operational. We have special offers for customers who shop here and Navratri special food at our restaurants.”Smaller markets recovering slowly The smaller and congested markets in the city, where odd-even rule had been established earlier, are still on the road to slow recovery. President of Shastri Market in Sector 22, Jaswinder Nagpal said, “Due to the Covid-induced lockdown, our sales had dropped down to only 10% of what it used to be earlier. Now, it is at 35%, but the signs are encouraging. People have starting to come out more now and during festivals like Dusshera and Diwali, we expect more customers here.”Rules to follow Get thermally scanned and sanitised outside shopsWear masks, those without them will be fined ₹500Keep physical distance of 6 feet in and around shopsPrefer contactless payment, use e-banking or UPI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/festive-season-gradually-driving-chandigarh-markets-out-of-pandemic-gloom/story-IjgNRPLib52OyPvCdbqcyM.html

It is expected to be over by the end of this month,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, the successor-designate to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.“Navratri is considered auspicious and saints wanted to start the construction work of the Ram temple on this occasion,” Mahant Kamal Nayan Das added.The trust had planned to start the construction work from this Navratri. The nine-day festival began on Saturday. About 12 foundation pillars have already been laid at Ram Janmabhoomi. Larsen and Toubro, the company carrying out the construction work, is conducting the testing under the guidance of experts from IIT-Madras.Also read: From PM Modi’s clarion call on vaccine to Sputnik V trial: 10 developmentsOn September 11, the trust had started the piling work for testing the foundation pillars.

The hike is between 50 per cent and 200 per cent, depending upon the category of user and consumption level, and has burdened the city residents who are already affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.During the campaign, ‘Speak up Chandigarh’, the Congress will also highlight exorbitant parking rates, the issue of dumping ground and potholes, Chhabra said. In a virtual meeting organised by the party, it was decided to hold meetings, protests and dharnas to raise important issues of the city.“We have decided to start an online social media campaign under which the party leaders will regularly raise issues plaguing Chandigarh like three-fold increase in water tariffs and a huge number of various taxes being imposed on city residents,” Chhabra said. He appealed to the residents to raise their voice against the “inept administration” under the BJP rule through their Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp profile and groups “so that the unjust, insensitive BJP leadership starts listening to the voice of the voters”. Chhabra also informed that the party will soon hold meetings on other issues like BJP government’s “anti-farmer laws, atrocities and crimes against women and Dalits and various issues facing colonies and villages”.  “The BJP ruled Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has burdened the citizens with a huge increase in various taxes and now the water tariffs have been increased recently by three times which will be an additional burden on the residents. These unjust and ill-timed decisions are causing huge resentment among the city residents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-to-launch-social-media-campaign-speak-up-for-chandigarh/story-hJDjlLj0uKE7JsLtT3HoML.html

Earlier that day, farmers and political leaders had gathered in huge numbers at the SP’s office with the same demand.Meanwhile, no arrest was made in the case till Saturday evening. Sources said that since the final medical report is pending as some samples were sent for testing on Wednesday evening to get more clarity on the cause of death, no one has been arrested yet.However, SP Kalia has confirmed about a “blunt injury mark” on the farmer’s body, but refused to give more details till the final report comes in.A condolence meeting was held also for the deceased farmer in Naraingarh. It was attended by Kurukshetra MP Naib Saini and other leaders on Saturday.Highway blockade: Six accused get bail Six men, who had been arrested for blocking the national highway during BJP’s tractor rally in Naraingarh, were granted bail by a court on Saturday.The accused — Gurdev, Manjit, Dhanraj Singh, Deepender, Dharamvir Singh alias Sonu and Prince — were on one-day remand and were presented in a court through video conferencing and the police asked for judicial remand. However, during the remand, the police failed to recover the sticks that were allegedly used at the protest site.Congress leaders from Ambala who had offered to appear for the accused in the court free of cost, advocated for their case on Saturday. Appearing at the hearing, Haryana Congress treasurer and Ambala Bar association president Rohit Jain and his fellow advocates argued that the arrested men were not criminals, but just farmers.“Also, section 8 (B) of the National Highways Act doesn’t match with the facts mentioned in the FIR. The section calls for any damage to the highway, but there was no such allegation. The accused were granted bail after 10 minutes over surety bonds worth ₹60,000 each,” Jain held.Station in-charge Gurmail Singh said, “The sticks that were used by them are yet to be recovered from Shahabad, Raipur Rani, Dera Bassi and Shahazadpur. We are investigating the case and our teams are out in various districts to arrest the remaining accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/murder-charge-on-farmers-bku-s-haryana-chief-announces-mass-gathering-to-press-for-fir-withdrawal/story-mq8juqfULo8eTHrm8vpHTI.html

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Connecting with our heritage in the kingdom of the Gods||An invitation from a friend posted as a commanding officer in the Territorial Army at Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu for a holiday was hard to resist. I couldn’t say no to the generous offer of my large-hearted friend because I had never been to the southern state. “History, heritage and culture of Tamil Nadu is awe-inspiring and the temples in and around Tiruchirapalli may surpass your imagination and expectations by miles,’’ the friend had said.For us, vacations almost always meant going to overcrowded and jam-packed hill stations in the neighbouring states. Travelling to a remote, exotic destination of historical significance, seeing heritage temples in the company of a childhood friend was something new. My wife and children lost no time in packing their bags and after changing three planes in a day, we reached Tiruchirapalli by the evening. My colonel friend, smartly dressed in his highly decorated uniform was there to welcome us with open arms and a bear hug. While on our way to the Army guest House, we noticed a number of things that made us want to pinch ourselves to see if we were dreaming. Almost unlike any other place in India, people were following traffic rules, not honking their car horns and traffic was smooth and slow. The city had a laidback ambience. My friend had planned our itinerary meticulously, ensuring we pack in as many visits to heritage sites in and around Tiruchirapalli as possible during our brief stay. Meenakshi Temple in the city of Madurai close by is a heritage marvel built in the twelfth century. Magnificent sculptures and statues of maidens, elephants and gods and goddesses looking as if they could spring to life any moment adorn the vast corridors of the temple amid the intricately carved pillars.The gigantic structure and beautiful architecture enthralled the mind and soul and one was transported back in time to marvel at the knowledge, intelligence, patience and skill of the artisans and craftsmen of ancient times.The Brihadeeswara Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva in Thanjavur built by Chola dynasty kings in the eleventh century was another ancient wonder that left us awestruck, as did the size and splendour of the Rockfort temple in Tiruchirapalli, built on an 83-metre high rock by the Pallavas and Cholas between the 5th and 11th century.Three days spent in the Kingdom of the Gods was an eye-opening experience. Spirituality, divinity, history and heritage of the monuments made us travel back in time and feel proud of our rich and kaleidoscopic heritage. For our children, the short trip to Tamil Nadu was a great learning experience. They were moved by the scale and magnitude of the vision of our ancestors. Last but not least, we were impressed by the immaculate tidiness of the cities we visited. Tiruchirapalli, positioned 39 in the Swachh Bharat rankings, is striving hard to be amongst the top 10. We saw numerous signboards at public places, that read: “Keep your house clean God is coming, keep your city clean, PM is coming”. The entire city was filth free and after dustbins are emptied into the garbage truck, DDT was sprayed around the trash bins to keep insects and flies at bay. The city was encroachment free and from vegetable shops to fruit juice vendors, all the people worked within the four walls of their own units.All in all, it was a great experience.The writer is a doctor based in Amritsar, Punjab||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/connecting-with-our-heritage-in-the-kingdom-of-the-gods/story-GuC5qUg0HDDFEHEygGrbfK.html

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Ad came. Ad Trolled. Ad left||In the movie The Godfather, based on Mario Puzo’s novel, Don Corleone, when meeting the heads of five mafia bosses had said “I hoped that we would come here and reason together. And as a reasonable man, I’m willing to do whatever’s necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems.”Most reasonable Indians, who are a tad bit informed about the economy are aware that India’s demographic dividend started in 2018, when its working age population aged between 15 and 64, outnumbered the dependent population. What’s the big deal, you ask?In the 18 years since China entered this stage in 1994 — this came 16 years after Deng Xiaoping launched his economic reforms that led to eight years of double-digit growth — there have been only two years when it didn’t cross the 8% growth mark. Japan had this period from 1964-2004. In five of these years, Japan grew in double digits; the growth rate was above 8% in two years, and a little less than 6% in one. Growth slid below 5% in only two of these 10 years.It’s not just these two countries, you may look at Italy, Republic of Korea, Spain, Thailand, Brazil, or even our younger cousin Bangladesh, all have seen an upward trajectory of growth in the first few years.In our case, two years after 2018, we are recording the highest unemployment in 45 years. But the prime time on TV, and trending hashtags on social media are so preoccupied with Bollywood or religion that there is little mention of this anomaly.A study by Dr Kota Neelima, a researcher, recently placed on record before the Supreme Court which shows how the way TV debates are conducted constitute hate speech. Another report by Rate the Debate, an independent research platform, analysed 32 weekdays of news content, 55 hours of programming, and 76 debate topics of a popular news anchor and found that 65% of his debates focused only on a Bollywood suicide case in a tone it called ‘toxic, polarised, and filled with innuendos, salacious gossip, wild allegations, and character assassination”. So what does all this have to do with the ad?Well, religion, after Bollywood is an emotive issue. To borrow a line from a popular Vietnamese T-shirt slogan, Hindus and Muslims are “same, same but different”. Yet they have co-existed happily in this generous melting pot called Bharat. But of late, it’s the differences that have come into sharp focus. And both the sides have considerable numbers who are prone to blame the other. Jonathan Haidt, a highly regarded American social psychologist at New York University Stern School of Business, in his book, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, explains that people who share sacred objects and fraternise on the basis of their faith, trust each other completely but consider the other group their arch enemy.In this climate, with a significant population young, unemployed, and constantly triggered by a provocative narrative peddled by various media, it’s no surprise that they are reacting unreasonably to an otherwise very reasonable situation, aka the Tanishq ad. While the solution to India’s problems will not come from religion, but jobs, it might be a good time to also reflect on what John Stuart Mill wrote in 1859, “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.” So cultivating a few cross-religion friendships will not only make us smarter, but calmer as well, no matter how polarised the general climate.Being aware of how our emotions are being manipulated by politicians and TV channels would be another useful tool to use from the toolbox. And finally, in times like these, the sanest counsel that comes to mind is from, well, Don Corleone. Let’s be reasonable men (& women), and be willing to do whatever’s necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems.The author, a former COO of a Philippines-based group of companies, is now an independent business consultant||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-ad-came-ad-trolled-ad-left/story-or8VNHrYXFkZDRVUwNMmUN.html

Officials said that they have received directions from the Uttar Pradesh transport department under which the fitness of vehicles, not fitted with HSRP, have been stopped from October 15. They added that the directions have also listed that more services which are to be stopped from October 19. “The services which will be stopped from October 19 are related to transfer of vehicle’ ownership, change of address, cancellation of hypothecation, new permits, temporary permits, special permits and national permits, among others, for vehicles which do not have HSRP fitted,” said Vishwajeet Pratap Singh, additional regional transport officer. The directions have been issued in order to get more and more vehicles take up the HSRP. “As of now, the vehicles getting registered from April 1, 2019 and thereafter are getting fitted with HSRP through their dealers. In case other vehicle owners wish to get the HSRP, they can book time slots and make payments online through websites - www.bookmyhsrp.com and www.makemyhsrp.com. The websites will show nearest dealers where the vehicle owners can go on the time-slot specified and get the HSRP fitted to their vehicles,” Singh added. In furtherance of the directions of the Supreme Court on September 30, 2019, the state officials had issued an order on October 5 in which they stated that all vehicles in the state registered under in the National Capital Region should get fitted the HSRP in three months.“If such vehicles do not register within the timeframe, they will face enforcement and action,” Singh added. The October 5 government order also said that those vehicles which are not registered in NCR and registered before April 1, 2019, should get the plates fixed within a specific time ranging from four months to ten months for different vehicles registered before April 1, 2005, up to those registered till March 31, 2019. According to official records, the Ghaziabad district, till end of September, had 9,84,891 registered vehicles while 1,03,643 were fitted with HSRP. In neighbouring Noida, the official statistics stated that it has about 7.21 lakh registered vehicles and nearly 6.5 lakh vehicles registered before April 1, 2019 need to get the HSRP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/starting-monday-transport-dept-to-restrict-services-for-vehicles-without-hsrp/story-CQyQMYZ9ZtSJaZmDulTf1J.html

Monty, alias Ozans, who studied till Class 12, has seven cases of attempt to murder, extortion and rioting registered against him in police stations of Sector 26 and 34. He had been convicted and sentenced to three-year jail for shooting at a cop who had gone to arrest him in 2015.He allegedly runs at extortion racket on behalf of Bishnoi, who is presently lodged in jail. While Bishnoi makes calls to businessman from behind bars, Monty collects money from the targets, said police.Got bail amid Covid pandemicTill a few months back, Monty was lodged in Chandigarh Model Jail (Burail jail) after being arrested by the crime branch in December 2019. Police had seized countrymade arms — a.32 pistol and double-barrel gun — besides magazine and live cartridges from him.Covid-19 pandemic came as a blessing for him, as he was granted bail along with other prisoners in order to decongest jails. On the night of October 11, he was caught on camera brandishing two pistols while approaching the office of his cousin Praveen Shah and bouncer Tirath, a former aide, in Burail. The two are witnesses in the Sonu Shah murder case that dates back to September 28, 2019. Praveen is Sonu’s brother. According to the chargesheet, Bishnoi was behind the murder. Though Praveen and Tirath saved themselves by hiding inside the office, police had registered a case of attempt to murder against Monty. Earlier on September 30, he was booked for harassing a woman and posting her daughter’s pictures on social media platforms. Fired at cop in 2015 Monty Shah had shot at and injured inspector Baldev Kumar, who is presently posted as the Sector-34 station house officer, when a police team had gone to arrest him in July 2015. He was arrested after the shootout.Monty had been booked along with Tirath after allegedly demanding extortion at gunpoint at a hotel in Burail. They had even taken away ₹10,000 and two LCD televisions from the hotel. Police had gone to arrest him in that case.After Bishnoi issued a threat of bloodshed to avenge his aide Gurlal Brar’s murder outside a mall in Chandigarh last Saturday, police have registered three fresh FIRs against his gang members running extortion racket in the city.Police have also arrested Bishnoi’s aide Praveen Kumar, alias Bhima, who is a shooter, for extortion and mobilising gang members, besides Raju Basondi and Abhishek in connection with Sonu Shah murder case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-police-announce-50-000-reward-for-info-on-gangster-bishnoi-s-aide-monty-shah/story-4pH3MYBqGifTJDsSB9765M.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Our Take: There should be no place for gangsters in Chandigarh||From October 11, violent incidents involving criminal gangs have shattered the calm of this city, once renowned for its beauty and tranquillity.Gurlal Brar, 26, an accomplice of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and a former state president of the Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU), was shot dead outside a mall in Industrial Area Phase 1, early on Sunday. Another gang owing allegiance slain criminal Davinder Bambiha took responsibility for the act, saying it was done to avenge the death of their member. After a few hours, TikTok star Saurav Gujjar was shot at and injured outside a nightclub in Sector 9. On the same day, as threats were posted on a Facebook page dedicated to Bishnoi, saying there would be “ bloodshed on the streets,” another of Bishnoi’s aides, Monty Shah, was booked for making a murder bid on a rival in Burail. Then, news surfaced that another gangster, Dilpreet Singh Dhahan, earlier accused of shooting and injuring Punjabi singer Parmish Verma in Mohali in April 2018 and arrested after a police encounter in Chandigarh, had organised for shooters and weapons from prison to have Brar killed. On Friday, police arrested Praveen Kumar, a shooter of Bishnoi’s gang, from Sector 45. He was in the city to avenge the death of their member Ankit Bhadu in an encounter with the Punjab Police at Zirakpur in 2019. The rising incidents of gang warfare, including open challenges being issued from one gang to another on social media have unnerved residents, a majority of them retired citizens, and prompted Punjab governor and Chandigarh administrator VPS Badnore to come down heavily on Chandigarh police for the deteriorating law and order in the city and ask for investigations into Brar and Gujjar’s cases. Since January, before this period of lawless activities, there have been five firing incidents. Questions need to be asked: How are gangsters entering the city? How are Dhahan and Bishnoi operating from behind bars and what are the prison officials doing about it?End violenceWhat should be done to stop the gang culture Chandigarh?What should be done to stop the gang culture in Chandigarh? Who should be penalised and held accountable for increase in criminal activities, how and by when?

17-10-2020||Noida||Air quality dips again, ‘very poor’ in parts of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad||The air quality at various places in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Faridabad remained “very poor” on Saturday, according to a government agency. There was a heavy concentration of PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants in the air of the four immediate neighbouring districts of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to the index, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. Gautam Buddh Nagar’s Greater Noida city had the worst AQI of 364 as recorded by the station in Knowledge Park V, while it was 299 in Knowledge Park III, according to the CPCB data at 7 pm. In Noida, the AQI was measured at 325 by the station in Sector 62, 312 at Sector 116 and 287 at Sector 1. No data was available for the station at Sector 125, it showed. In adjoining Ghaziabad, the AQI was 306 at Indirapuram, 311 at Loni, 261 each at Sanjay Nagar and Vasundhara. Gurugram had an AQI of 345 as recorded by the station in Sector 151 followed by 288 at the Teri Gram, 284 at Vikas Sadan and 191 at NISE Gwal Pahari, the CPCB showed. The AQI in Faridabad also largely remained in the very poor category. It was recorded at 320 at the station in Sector 11 followed by 311 at New Industrial Town and 295 at Sector 16A. The data from the sector 30 station was “insufficient” for the last 24 hours, the agency stated. The worsening of the air quality comes even as the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been implemented in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) from Friday. Among the GRAP’s measures for checking air pollution are increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees, stopping use of diesel generator sets, checking dust on roads and at construction sites when the air quality turns poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-dips-again-very-poor-in-parts-of-noida-ghaziabad-gurugram-and-faridabad/story-h93Al77xNXUiYYaXH2sXSL.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: The present is a gift, use it well||Today, nearly one among four people is down with mental health problems such as depression. Half of us do not even realise it and most of us feel ashamed to report it or seek treatment. That is why the World Health Organisation (WHO) says depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.Mental health issues often plague us because either we are overambitious or we worry too much about the past and future. Many of us don’t think twice about joining the rat race, working overtime, taking on stress and getting burnt out even before crossing the age of 40 or 50.Young boys and girls, with the carrot of higher salaries or perks dangling before them, work from 9 am to 9 pm (maybe from home these days because of Covid–19) in corporate sectors, with little time for exercise, recreation, or family life. When they are left out, or fail to reach the targets as set by their bosses, depression sets in. They suffer quietly, still running after the elusive carrot.The past is over and the future is yet to arrive, but like a monkey, our mind keeps vacillating between unhappiness we have experienced and worries over what’s going to happen to us if we lose our jobs or fall ill. In the process, we do not only waste 90% of our energies, we also miss out on enjoying the present: Living in our comfortable homes; forgetting to remember our children’s birthdays, and yes, not spending quality time with them.Though our desires multiply manifold, we get upset if these remain unfulfilled. This kind of life seems artificial, when we distance ourselves from nature and don’t enjoy the small pleasures of daily life.We have become selfish, and materialistic, to say the least – our own enemies.Hence, mental health today is a top priority, something one has to take care of, like brushing one’s teeth or shampooing one’s hair. How can that be done? First and foremost, we have to change our lifestyles and understand that negative experiences have been left behind – in the past. Living in the present is what matters, so one has to live life to the fullest. Second, there is no need to compete with anyone, except with our own self. Competition leads to stresses and tensions, and also negativity. Why not enjoy challenging ourselves and doing our best?Third, we have to constantly observe ourselves and keep our minds calm and focused. This can be achieved by spending a few minutes daily on yoga and pranayama with self introspection. Let us learn to let go and relax. We are one particle of this universe, let’s not think we are saviours of this world, as if things will not move without us. Our society needs to accept and empathise with people who have mental health issues. Rather than being impatient with them or refusing to understand them, we should build them up, and help them as much as we can to come out of the dark phase. Families must watch out for members who are feeling low or showing signs of depression and get them treated.Let’s not hide the problem but face it.It’s high time we slowed down, regained balance, and focused on our inner hygiene. A happy family life, with good physical and mental health, is the key to peace and happiness.The author is an Ambala Cantonment based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-the-present-is-a-gift-use-it-well/story-o9T8ZrQEpQTS3ajdr8bHTL.html

Meanwhile, 11 Covid-related deaths have so far been recorded in the district up to October 17, with a CFR of 0.4%.As many as 2,756 new cases have been detected in the district up to October 17, with a daily average rate of over 162 cases per day. District magistrate Suhas LY said that as nearly all commercial activities have opened up, the main aim of the administration now is to reduce the CFR to the minimum possible, and ensure maximum testing. “The ‘track, test and treat’ method for checking the spread of Covid-19 has so far yielded expected results. Due to this method, the district’s CFR has gone down to 0.4%, which is much better than the national figure of 1.58% and the state’s 1.46%,” he said.The DM also said that the district’s testing rate is the best among all districts of north India. “Our testing rate per million per day is over 1,750, which is much better than other districts in north India. We have also issued instructions for industrial establishments to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols. Our teams are regularly monitoring factories and other business establishments to ensure that safety protocols are being followed there,” he said.According to official data given by the district health department, while in April, as many as 3,290 tests were conducted, total tests done in May and June were 40,100 and 44,016 respectively. In July, the district health department tested 65,418 persons. In August and September, the tests done in the district were recorded 58,029 and 75,442 respectively. In October so far, over 32,000 tests have been conducted at different hospitals and Covid-19 check-up centres. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that to check the spread of Covid-19 in the district, daily testing has been increased and regular rapid antigen testing camps are being organised at different places. “Besides ramping up testing and starting effective monitoring of patients under home isolation, the health department’s surveillance staff have also started implementing stringent containment measures. Timely hospitalisation for patients needing medical support and efficient infection control in healthcare facilities are in our top priorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-fatality-rate-surges-in-gb-nagar-district/story-NdC1aJQClN4lGpCT3OZWuI.html
17-10-2020||Noida||Man put on payroll of Greater Noida firm twice, drew two salaries for a year; arrested||Greater Noida: A 25-year-old man was arrested for allegedly defrauding a company in Greater Noida by getting himself enrolled on the payroll twice through forged identities and thus drawing two salaries, the police said.According to the police, the suspect, Ram Kumar Das, had joined Minda Corporations Limited in Greater Noida through a contractor two years ago. In June last year, however, he allegedly got himself secretly enrolled in the same company again via another contractor, thus ending up on the payroll twice. Police said Das allegedly managed to pull this off till mid-October this year, before the firm got on to his act and approached the police.The complainant, Nirankar Singh, assistant manager (HR-Minda Corporations Limited), in the FIR has alleged that the suspect used to mark his biometric attendance for his two different work profiles through two different fingers. Das was allegedly getting the double salary for over a year, the complaint added. “In March 2020, the company replaced the biometric attendance with the card system due to health safety protocols due to Covid-19. The suspect, meanwhile, got two cards made through two contractors, and started marking his attendance using them on two different machines,” he stated in the FIR. To improve safety, the company had recently introduced a face detector at the entrance.Bhuvnesh Kumar, station house officer, Ecotech III police station, said to avoid detection in the face detector, the suspect allegedly went to the first contractor and got his photo approved in the machine. “The suspect then went to the second contractor for the same process, and the system detected his photo, which had already been fed into the database. Suspecting fraud, the contractor alerted the company’s management,” Kumar said, adding that the suspect was interrogated where he allegedly admitted to have marked attendance through a double identity. The management conducted an audit and found that the suspect has allegedly cheated the firm of about ₹81,715 besides his salary from the company in one year. Singh on Thursday filed a complaint at the Sector Ecotech III police station. When contacted, Singh admitted that the incident took place, but refused to share a comment.The station house officer said that around 800 people work in the company and hence the suspect allegedly managed to use the crowd to disguise his identity and get a double salary for some months. “A case has been registered against the suspect under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. The suspect was arrested from the company premises the same day. He was produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-put-on-payroll-of-greater-noida-firm-twice-drew-two-salaries-for-a-year-arrested/story-C0CHC6np40k4AjgFT3n2mJ.html
17-10-2020||Noida||Raj Nagar District Centre made vehicle-free zone to decongest area||The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) on Saturday inaugurated the city’s first vehicle-free zone project at Raj Nagar District Centre (RDC) to decongest the area spread over one lakh square metres. According to officials, nearly 6,000 square metres area of the district centre, has been made vehicle-free zone. RDC is a major commercial hub in the city with malls, multiplexes, eating joints, pubs and other facilities.Besides, the authority also opened a park for the specially-abled at Indirapuram and a cattle shed at Nandi Park near Raj Nagar Extension. The officials said that a total of ₹10.89 crore was spent on the three projects. The authority had conceived the plan for the vehicle-free zone at RDC last year. The GDA officials said that as part of the plan, they have also developed three parks at the district centre for children, senior citizens and general public. “Under the project, no vehicles will be allowed to enter the vehicle-free area in RDC. Instead, there is a separate parking for visitors and they will walk to the vehicle-free area for about 100 metres. The parking lot can be able to accommodate about 150 cars. Several fountains, kiosks, and lighting, among others, have also come up at the project site, and it will be a place to visit for families, especially during the evening time,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, GDA’s chief architect and town planner. The officials said that under the plan they wish to decongest part of roads in RDC as the entire area witnesses about 10,000 vehicles every day. For development of parks and the parking at the backside of the vehicle-free zone project, GDA in December last year had exchanged the two plots of land for respective development. The authority on Saturday also inaugurated another project of a park for differently abled persons in Indirapuram. “In Indirapuram, we have developed Avantibai Park in Niti Khand I which houses various facilities for specially-abled persons. The park is spread over an area of about 10,000 square metres and even houses directions written in Braille besides facilities like open gym, Braille reading area, playing area and library, among others,” Shivpuri said. He said that the concept is unique as there was no such exclusive park available for specially-abled persons. “All the facilities developed at the park have been designed keeping in mind the needs of such people,” he said. Apart from the two projects, the authority has also started with a gaushala for cattle near the Nandi Park area on the master plan road leading to Raj Nagar Extension. The facility has come up over an area of about 14,000 square metres which will have the capacity to house about 1,300 stray cattle, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/raj-nagar-district-centre-made-vehicle-free-zone-to-decongest-area/story-aWhp8EDajf3EuUSXqYvmnI.html
17-10-2020||Noida||Noida district launches woman empowerment campaign ‘Mission Shakti’||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration on Saturday launched ‘Mission Shakti’, a programme for women empowerment, on the directions of the state government. Noida authority chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari and district magistrate Suhas LY jointly flagged off an LED van from the magistrate’s camp office in Noida Sector 27. The DM said that the Mission Shakti programme is being held from October 17-25. “This campaign will run for one week in Noida and Greater Noida. The sub-divisional magistrates have also flagged off such vans in their respective areas. Police teams are also conducting parallel awareness programmes,” he said.The DM said that the teams will collaborate with different schools and colleges and organise virtual programmes for awareness. The officials will also approach different companies, corporate houses, and industries and organise programmes for women safety at work place. The officials’ will inform women about help lines such as 1090, 112, UP Cop App, and laws such as the POCSO Act, etc. They also raise awareness about the Union ministry of women and child development’s ‘She-Box’ initiative (sexual harassment electronic box), a single window access system to stop harassment at work place. People can log in to the ministry’s website and file a complaint. Police officers will also inform women about the ill effects of child marriage, dowry, etc, in the initiative. Maheshwari, the nodal officer for this project in the district, said this is a state-level programme. “The government’s aim is that women should know their rights as well as laws for their safety, through this campaign. We will also sensitise men towards women equality. We have made a coordinated action plan to be rolled out in one week,” she said. She added that she will also inspect some police stations on Sunday. An awareness programme was held at Sharda University under this initiative which over 150 students and faculty members attended. A similar programme was held at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida. Vrinda Shukla, DCP, women safety, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the LED van, equipped with audio and visuals, will halt for 15 minutes at different locations and relay information. “It will visit different villages, colonies, societies, parks, markets, shopping malls, etc. The police department also issued a mobile number – 9870395200 – where women can contact and share details to join virtual chaupals, which will be organised in a few days,” she said. The police department has also planned to organise a webinar on cyber security where students from 74 government and private schools will join.

17-10-2020||Noida||Three major roads in Noida have high dust content, says pollution control board study||A A study conducted by the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) to find out the total mass of dust, as well as dust particles up to 75 microns, through samples taken from 10 different roads in Noida has found three major road stretches in the city have heavy dust pollution.The UPPCB had recently conducted a similar study for 18 different road stretches in Ghaziabad, samples of which were tested at UPPCB’s laboratory at Vasundhara. The samples from Noida roads were also tested at this facility.The study revealed that three roads – Near Parthala Chowk-Sector 121-Vikas Marg, Sector-129 to Sector-155, and the road in front of Spectrum Metro Mall near Sector 50 metro station – have the highest dust mass of all samples.These three stretches, were found to have total dust mass of 552 grams per square metres (g/m2), 536.5 g/m2 and 513 g/m2, respectively, while the mass of dust having dust particles up to 75 microns was 159.43 g/m2, 108.03 g/m2 and 84.89 g/m2, respectively, the study shows.Officials said the board conducted the study after discussions with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur, during which they got to know that dust particles up to 75 microns have lesser tendency of settling down, and thus move about with movement of wind as well as vehicles, which also leads to air pollution.“The report will now be sent to the Noida authority and for them to take up appropriate steps to bring down these levels and control dust. In future, we will get a similar study conducted for roads in Greater Noida as well,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida. The study revealed that the total dust mass in samples collected from Noida ranged between 552 g/m2 and 59.84 g/m2, while the range of mass of dust contents up to 75 microns in size stood between 159.43 g/m2 and 9.77 g/m2.It said that in all the Noida samples, highest dust mass was found near Parthala Chowk-Sector-121-Vikas Marg stretch, while the least was in front of NSEZ Phase-II-Surajpur Road, Noida. These two stretches also figure as highest and lowest in terms of mass of dust contents up to 75 microns.Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty (OSD) from Noida authority, said the authority is yet to receive the UPPCB study report.“At Parthala Chowk, there is no construction work going on as of now. We will go through the UPPCB road study report and take necessary measures. We will do more of water sprinkling, washing roads at night etc., and will fix any technical issues found. Sometimes, potholes also lead to dust pollution. We will visit the roads and take necessary actions,” he said, adding that dust particles on the roads may be due to vehicular movement. While detailing the measures taken up by the authority under the graded response action plan (Grao), Tripathi added, “We have engaged 47 tankers for sprinkling water on a total of 107 km of roads per day. The authority is also taking up washing a total of 80 km of roads every night whereas mechanical sweeping of over 250km roads is taken up at night.” The authority has also made a total of 235 km road stretches dust free zones, covered by grass and shrubs on the footpath in order to check pollution, officials added. On Saturday, the authority had fined a mechanical-sweeping agency ₹1 lakh as it had left the dust collected in the open in Sector 67, officials added.“We found some dustbins overflowing in Noida Sector 65 and 66 on Saturday and fined a door-to-door garbage collection agency Rs 1 lakh for the lapse,” Tripathi said, adding that all such measures will surely reduce pollution. A comparison of the UPPCB’s road dust study of the two cities of Ghaziabad and Noida found that the total mass of road dust in samples was higher in Ghaziabad, where it stood between 579.54 g/m2 and 14.43 g/m2. On other hand, the particles of dust up to 75 microns were on the higher side on roads in Noida, where it stood between 159.43 g/m2 and 9.77 g/m2, as compared to between 154.37 g/m2 and 2.22 g/m2 in Ghaziabad. Dr S Velmurugan, chief scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), Delhi, said that due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and social distancing protocols, many people now use their private vehicles, which aids dust pollution.“Most people use private vehicles instead of metro trains etc., for commuting, which adds to pollution in the National Capital Region. Dust particles are also caused due to stubble burning in northern areas. Proper water sprinkling on the roads may yield some good results but there is a need for strict enforcement of rules to check pollution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-major-roads-in-noida-have-high-dust-content-says-pollution-control-board-study/story-Ilb86pI5rNxJvpZye0V5AL.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: An isle of hope at Sukhna||For most waterbirds, deep sheets of water at the Sukhna lake are no more a habitat than a barren desert. The agony of birds is reflected in the fact that devoid of mud banks, even a common, resident species such as Red-wattled lapwings have gone missing from stretches of the lake’s northern shores where they were breeding comfortably. But a small isle of hope has come up at the rowing canal at the lake’s regulator-end, which affords birds a safe spot to rest, snooze, bask and most importantly preen and dry their feathers.The isle is an innovative experiment of the Chandigarh forests and wildlife department, which brought together two bamboo floats, anchored them with heavy stones in the 10 feet deep water and layered the platform with soil and vegetation to create an extended mound above the water. A variety of resident birds have availed the opportunity afforded by the artificial isle and include Cattle and Large egrets, Black-winged stilts, Black bittern, Snake bird (Oriental Darter), Red-wattled lapwings, Lesser Whistling teal, Spotbill ducks and recently, as the migratory season got underway, a pair of Gadwall ducks. The importance of the isle lies in the fact that deep water has wiped out mudflats and extended shores of the lake, leaving birds no room for resting and allied activities. It is a fallacy to presume water birds prefer to perpetually swim about in deep lakes. Shallow ”chhapars’’ or wetlands with exposed vegetation and harbouring small aquatic creatures are eminently preferred by water birds.The last good winter for migratory waterfowl at the Sukhna was 2016-2017 due to shallow waters and exposed aquatic vegetation but ever since an abundance of seasonal and unseasonal rainfall has ensured the lake is drawing lesser birds, with the colonising lotus weed compounding the predicament. The November bird census by the Chandigarh Bird Club will reflect the abandoned waters.WHAT BUTTERFLIES LOVE Householders are left puzzled when their beautiful, exotic flowers fail to attract butterflies. A lack of nectar coupled with the leaves not suitable for the butterfly larvae to feed upon are the main reasons. In this context, research has established that when a floral species is suitable for butterflies, it attracts them in droves. Those wanting to attract butterflies to their gardens and butterfly parks can take heed of the clear vote delivered in favour of the native species, Derris scandens (commonly known as Jewel Vine, Hog Creeper). As many as 22 species of butterflies were observed on this plant in the Kazhuveli wetlands, Tamil Nadu, by Dr M Bubesh Guptha, director, Universal Eco Foundation.“Being dependent on vegetation as adults and larvae, butterflies enter into a complex feeding relationship with green plants. As adults, they require nectar resources to provide energy for flight, which is vital to find mates. As larvae, butterflies are typically specific to a host plant and often show a ‘botanical instinct’, ie, closely-related butterfly species choose closely-related plants. Butterflies provide the best rapid indicators of habitat quality and are sensitive indicators of climate change. Our findings prove that the Derris species are good for butterfly parks, protected and non-protected areas for conservation of multiple species of butterflies and other insects,” Dr Guptha told this writer.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-an-isle-of-hope-at-sukhna/story-E986g3aO1vainIadvaMErI.html

This step has been taken after the department found students’ performance unsatisfactory in the Punjab Achievement Survey held last month. As per sources, over 70% students from government schools in Ludhiana district participated in the survey. Government school principals said that participation was relatively low as many students who failed in Classes 9 and 11 have dropped out but their name still appears in the school’s online database. As per information, from the 48 aided schools in the district, only 35% students participated in the survey held in September. Recently, an online meeting was held between the district education officer (secondary), Swaranjit Kaur, and principals of aided schools. Kaur has directed them to ensure all students of Classes 6 to 10 participate in the practice test. Kaur said, “We must ensure that students participate in these practice tests. We have held many online meetings with school principals and asked them for the reason behind low participation. We have motivated them to ensure 100% participation and asked teachers to contact students so that every child can improve their learning outcome.”The heads of these institutions told the DEO that only students of grant-in-aid classes participated in the test and the others skipped it.The practice test will be held via Google form and comprise of 5 questions each from six subjects- English, Hindi, Punjabi, social studies, science and mathematics. The online link for the practice sheet will be activated at 11 am on every Sunday. The tests will be conducted on October 18, October 25, November 1 and November 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-edu-dept-to-hold-practice-tests-for-classes-6-to-10/story-rqVNx5PGsm0xCjvmkurz2L.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ahead of Dussehra, pandemic shadows effigy business in Ludhiana||Even as the government has allowed Ravana Dehan to be held this year and some Dussehra committees have stepped forward to organise them, the ongoing pandemic has taken a toll on the business of effigy makers.Due to dip in orders and reduced size of effigies, it is difficult to even meet costs, said Asgar Ali, 48, a resident of Agra, who has been making effigies at the Daresi ground for over three decades now.Ali said that they have received 15 orders from Ludhiana last year, but this time, only three Dussehra committees have come forward. Ali and his team reached the city late on Thursday evening and are currently working at Daresi ground. The effigy makers said that they are working just to retain customers and are making no profit.Ali added that organisers are not getting effigies of other mythological figures including Megnadh and Kumbhakaran built this year, as Ravana Dehan will be a low-key event.Ali’s son, Sohail Khan, 19, said the number of labourers deployed in the process has also been reduced from 30 to eight this year. Earlier, they only used to supervise the labourers, but now, they are preparing the effigies themselves to reduce costs.“We used to bring along a team of around 30 labourers and different teams used to work at separate locations in the city. We used to get around 15 orders from Ludhiana and also from Chandigarh. But this year, we have received no order from Chandigarh while only three committees have placed orders in Ludhiana - Daresi, Upkar Nagar and Dhandra Road,” said Khan.A student, Khan said that his two elder brothers also used to assist them in the previous years. But this time, they have opted to stay back in Agra as the demand is so low. “Earlier, we used to get orders from Haryana and Rajasthan as well, but this year, we have only received few orders from Haryana,” said Sohail. “This year, we are only working to retain the customers, as they will replace us with local artistes and prefer them in the coming years also,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-shadow-effigy-makers-rue-lack-of-business/story-0PtYAZC9XNUvcX6Du5H0iO.html

17-10-2020||City||Only Ravana effigy to be burnt at Ludhiana’s Daresi ground this year||As Ravana Dahan will be a low-key event this year, no effigy of Meghnath, Khardushan and Kumbhakaran, the mythical symbols of evil, will be burned at Daresi Dussehra ground on Dussehra. Organisers said that for decades, they used to burn the effigies of Khardushan, Meghnath and Kumbhkaran on separate days as per the chronology depicted in Ramayana. “But this year, we have received permission to organise Ravana Dahan for just one day due to the ongoing pandemic,” they said. No Ramlila and Dussehra fair will be organised and Ravana Dahan will take place with limited gathering. Member of Shri Ram Lila Committee (Daresi), Dinesh Marwaha said, “Many committees burn all the three effigies on Dussehra, but we burn four effigies on separate days as per the chronology of events (their deaths) as depicted in Ramayana. We cannot change our tradition and burn the effigies on a single day. We will only organise Ravana Dahan this year.”Another member, Kamal Bassi said that Ramlila would not be held this year and instead Ramayana Paath would be organised at Sita Mata Mandir with a limited gathering. Size of Ravana effigy reducedMarwaha said that the size of Ravana effigy has also been reduced. Their committee has reduced the height of its effigy from 90 feet to 30 feet.Effigy maker, Asgar Ali, who is making effigies at Daresi ground for over three decades, said that earlier only the head of Ravana used to be of 30 feet, but this year the entire effigy will be 30 feet tall. The size of Ravana effigy to be burned in Upkar Nagar has also been reduced from 65 feet to 15 feet. Organisers to broadcast Ravan Dahan liveMarwaha said that they are making arrangements to broadcast the event live through social media and local cable operators so that the public can become a part of the celebration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-ravana-effigy-to-be-burnt-at-ludhiana-s-daresi-ground-this-year/story-agoo9PY7tSM9EpT9q6EQNP.html
17-10-2020||Pune||CM Thackeray, Pawar, Fadnavis to visit rain-affected areas||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition and former chief minister, will visit the rain-affected areas in western Maharashtra. CM Thackeray, who announced his plans on Saturday evening after coming under heavy criticism from the opposition parties, will tour rain-affected areas of Solapur on Monday and Osmanabad on Tuesday, an official said. Pawar will be on a two-day visit to rain-affected areas in Osmanabad to assess the damage to crops due to rains. Pawar will begin his two-day visit on Sunday (October 18) and will visit Tulajapur, Ausa and Paranda Tehsil during his tour, that will conclude on Monday after which Pawar will return to Baramati, according to details shared by NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade in Pune. Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition and former chief minister, meanwhile, will also undertake a tour of rain-affected western Maharashtra and Marathwada. According to his office, Fadnavis will begin his three-day visit on October 19 from Baramati, a constituency represented for decades by Pawar and currently by his daughter Supriya Sule. Fadnavis will tour the rain-affected parts of Pune, Solapur, Osmanabad and Beed districts. At least 29 people lost their lives in four districts of Western Maharashtra and crop over five lakh hectares has been damaged in the state due to heavy rains in the region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday spoke to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and promised Centre’s support to Maharashtra. “Spoke to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray Ji regarding the situation arising due to flooding and heavy rain in parts of the state. My thoughts and prayers are with those sisters and brothers affected. Reiterated Centre’s support in the ongoing rescue and relief work,” (sic) Modi tweeted on Friday. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, on Saturday morning, visited Baramati and adjoining areas affected by rains while in the afternoon he visited flood-affected areas of Pandharpur. While Thackeray has taken review of possible loss to crops, livestock and property through video conferencing, the opposition leaders had asked the chief minister to step out and visit affected areas. “Farmers from across Maharashtra have been badly affected due to heavy rains. Chief Minister, please step out of your house now. The farmers are waiting to see you,” said BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil. Thackeray had come under criticism from various quarters for not stepping out of his home to review Covid-19 situation as well as rain- affected areas. Earlier this month, Congress MLA from Vidarbha Ashish Deshmukh questioned Thackeray for ignoring the region, affected by heavy rain which damaged crops. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi founder president Prakash Ambedkar too has asked Thackeray to visit the rain-affected parts of Maharashtra. “The farmers are worst-affected by the rains and they need relief in this time of adversity. The chief minister should tour the affected areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cm-thackeray-pawar-fadnavis-to-visit-rain-affected-areas/story-wxRV8XCXczxW4d6ryF8hHL.html
17-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Rahul to join electioneering from Oct 23, may share dais with Tejashwi||Congress leader and former party chief Rahul Gandhi is likely to address six election rallies as part of the party’s election campaign in Bihar. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha said that Gandhi is slated to launch his campaign for the party nominees at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur and Hisua in Nawada on October 23. “So far, Rahul Gandhi has given his consent to address six rallies, two each in the three-phased elections. More rallies may be planned if the situation arises,” said Jha. The former Congress chief’s rally is set to coincide with the programme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also scheduled to start his public address for the assembly elections, the polling for which is to start on October 28. The BJP had planned as many as 12 rallies by PM Modi during the electioneering for NDA candidates in Bihar. Jha said that the schedule and the venue for next round of public address by Gandhi would be decided later. It is believed that RJD leader and chief ministerial face of the Grand Alliance (GA) Tejashwi Prasad Yadav may share the stage with the Congress leader. However, it is not yet clear if AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would also address election meetings in Bihar. Also read: Officials work overtime to dispatch Covid-19 kits to lakhs of polling booths in BiharThe Congress has fielded as many as 70 candidates in the fray for the three-phased elections in Bihar. This is the maximum number of seats the party managed to contest after 2005. In November 2005 polls, the Congress got 51 seats to contest in alliance with the RJD and 41 during the last assembly elections under the GA, then consisting JD(U) also. Former director of AN Sinha institute of social studies DM Diwakar said the issues taken up by the top leaders were more than the number of rallies during the elections. “PM Modi had addressed 31 rallies during 2015 assembly elections which was more than double attended by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Still, the BJP had to be contented with only 53 seats,” said Diwakar. Diwakar added that people are not taking the PM Modi’s rhetoric very seriously now. “Modi is seldom seen talking about serious issues such as the state of the economy, which is in shambles, or about shrinking jobs, auctioning of public sector undertakings, measures to tide over the social impact of the lockdown, health and education, among other pressing issues. Anti-incumbency is there against Nitish Kumar-led dispensation. The GA may capitalise on the issues people of Bihar are grappling with,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-rahul-gandhi-to-join-electioneering-from-oct-23-may-share-dais-with-tejashwi/story-QvoJoPbLoVbOC7nnZ5p8YI.html
17-10-2020||Bhopal||Covid-19, farmers, women find special spot in Congress’ manifesto for MP by-polls||The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Saturday promised job and pension to a family member of those who died due to Covid-19 in its 52 points ‘Vachan Patra’ (manifesto) released for by-election to 28 assembly seats to be held on November 3. The manifesto, which focuses on Covid-19-affected people, farmers, unemployed youth, women and businessmen, was released by state Congress president and former chief minister Kamal Nath.Releasing a list of promises fulfilled during Congress’ 15-month-long tenure in state, Nath said, “During the tenure of 15 months, Congress fulfilled 574 promises out of 974 mentioned in the manifesto released before the 2018 assembly election.”He added, “We don’t believe in making false promises like MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.”Also read: ‘LJP not a part of alliance,’ BJP reiterates ahead of Bihar assembly pollsNath also said that Congress opposed farm bills amendment in labour laws approved in the monsoon session of Parliament and claimed that they would not be implemented in Madhya Pradesh if Congress returns to power.Congress needs to win all 28 assembly seats to get through the majority mark of 116 in the 230 member state assembly.“If Congress comes to power, it will initiate Corona Samajik Suraksha Pension Yojna for the next of kin of those who die due to Covid-19. Similarly, jobs will be provided to a family member of Covid-19 victims. The Congress-led state government will also help the family members of the victims in setting up businesses,” Nath said.The manifesto, bearing pictures of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra, also stated that businessmen affected by the pandemic will be provided Rs 50,000 loan without interest to revive their businesses. Also, no fee will be levied on unemployed youth for applying for government jobs. Nath also said the farm loan waiver scheme will be resumed. Like Congress-led Chhattisgarh government, Gaudhan Sewa Yojna will start in the state, he said.According to the manifesto, the Congress promised an annual award of Rs 1 lakh which would be given to a person working in the field of women empowerment, safety, security and welfare.Besides promising development of Gwalior-Chambal division, where by-election will be held on 16 of the 28 assembly seats, the Congress tried to woo different castes with promises to bring justice to them. The party also promised to include certain castes, like Keer, Meena and Pardhi, in the list of scheduled tribes.MP Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “Earlier in September, MP Congress committee released the sample draft on local manifestos for all 28 assembly seats and that was not a final one. The final draft on the manifesto was released on Saturday. Nobody raised any question from the party. It was BJP which is creating propaganda.”BJP-led state government home minister Narottam Mishra took a jibe on the manifesto and termed it a ‘Kapat (deception) Patra’. He said, “Congress promises are just for the draft not to fulfill. Earlier, they tricked the voters in the name of farm loan waiver scheme, now nobody is going to believe these promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/covid-19-farmers-women-find-special-spot-in-congress-manifesto-for-mp-by-polls/story-ekPT7yXcrigdFUNFndYzIK.html

17-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Officials work overtime to dispatch Covid-19 kits to lakhs of polling booths||Bihar’s assembly polls amid Covid-19 pandemic is different in many ways. State officials are on their toes for not only transporting EVMs and coordinating deployment of election staff but much more. For the last one week, health department officials are working overtime to complete the gargantuan task of packaging and dispatch of a whopping 13 lakh Covid-19 kits containing face covers, santisers and other safety material. These kits will be distributed to around 11.59 lakh polling personnel, including 5.20 lakh security personnel, at 1.06 lakh polling stations across 243 assembly constituencies. This comes as part of the Election Commission guidelines to ensure safety of election staff in the three-phase polls. Each Covid kit contains 100 ML of santiser, face shield, hand gloves (2 pairs), three-ply mask (six pieces) with additional items. In addition, polling booths would get 500 ML santiser (six pieces), one IVR thermometer, batteries, among other items for use. Also read: ‘LJP not a part of alliance,’ BJP reiterates ahead of Bihar assembly pollsThe dispatch of kits for 16 districts going to polls in the first phase on October 28 will be completed by October 17. “We are racing against time because of the tight schedule to package the cartons and load them in trucks for dispatch within the deadline,” said an official working at Gyan Bhawan in Patna. Besides, nearly 6.56 crore hand gloves for each voter – 90 percent of the total voters of state - are also being dispatched across 38 districts. The EC, this time, will provide one pair of gloves each to voters coming to the booths for using the EVM to cast their franchise as a precautionary measure against Covid-19. The voters would also be screened by infrared thermometers before being allowed inside the booths. “We are sending around 13 lakh Covid kits by provisioning reserve of 20 percent for the election staff so that there is no shortage of any protective items like sanitisers, face masks and gloves. We are also sending hand gloves for voters to each of 1.06 lakh booths by making provision for nearly 90 percent of total voters,” said a senior official of the Bihar Medical Services And Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL). The Corporation has been assigned the task of packaging the Covid-19 kits for use during the elections. Conducting the polls, amid the pandemic, is a big challenge for the EC, state election department and other concerned departments, including the health department, given the surge in number of Covid-19 cases in the state. The distribution of Covid-19 kits has increased the election costs with added expenditure in packaging these kits purchased through tendering process by the BMSICL. The estimated expenditure of the same is pegged around Rs 200 crore, officials said. “The state election department has already been allotted additional Rs 250 crore in the first supplementary budget, of which Rs 225 crore has been provisioned for footing the bill of protective gears, essentially Covid kits, and other costs owing to increase in polling stations,” said a finance officer. The supplementary budget was passed during the last monsoon session in August. In the state budget, a provision of Rs 627 crore was made in this fiscal year. In total, the state election department has a budget allotment of Rs 877 crore for this fiscal year given the increase in costs for implementing the safety guidelines laid down by the EC to check the spread of Covid-19 during the polling process. EC officials said the election cost this time is likely to be around Rs 625 crore – a jump of almost 131 percent from 2015 assembly polls when an expenditure of Rs 270 crore was made. This one is slated to be one of the most expensive elections in recent times.

The Purnea and Muzaffarpur units have their deadlines to dispatch the kits through trucks for the second and third phase of polls by the one week, officials said. “The entire exercise of packaging and dispatching has been a challenging task, especially due to the humongous amount of kits and materials and logistics involved in transportation. The workforce, including women staff, are working overtime and it is worth appreciating,” said Pratay Amrit, principal secretary, health. “It is a big job and we are working to meet all deadlines,” said managing director of BMSICL, Pradeep Kumar Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-officials-work-overtime-to-dispatch-covid-19-kits-to-lakhs-of-polling-booths/story-mQzF8IjZF5xsccxk6XujCN.html

The flow of water from the damaged pipeline located at lane number 29 was so strong that it infiltrated into 40 nearby houses, catching people by surprise as they were asleep. The pipeline, according to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), is 45 years old and has corroded at multiple places.The 18-inch radius pipeline is crucial as it brings water from Khadakwasla dam to Pune city via Parvati pumping station. The pipeline passes parallel to the canal in Janata Vasahat which houses low income slum tenements. According to the PMC water department, the pipeline repairing work was undertaken immediately and was completed by afternoon. Due to the incident, water supply to some parts of the city was affected. However, it was restored by evening after repair work was completed, said officials. As all off the sudden water started flooding from the pipeline with full pressure, it entered the Janata Vasahat slum which is located along this water pipeline.Among those injured in the incident are local residents - Mahesh More, Ravindra Kondhalkar, Sunita Bait, Piyush Jadhav, Akshay Solkar. The injured persons were immediately sent to Sassoon and Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital for treatment, said locals.According to Suraj Lokhande, a social worker from Janata Vasahat, two persons from Janata Vasahat suffered from bone fractures. Locals said many didn’t understand initially what was happening as it was dark. As water starting gushing into houses, people began running while some of them fell off due to the slippery stretch. “After receiving calls from residents, fire brigade officials reached the spot immediately and began rescuing people,” said fire brigade department head Prashant Ranpise.Earlier in April 2019, the same pipeline had burst though nobody was injured in the incident. In September 2018, around 350 houses from Janata Vasahat had been inundated with water after the Mutha rightbank canal wall suffered a breach at around 10.30 am causing minor floods in the Dandekar bridge area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pipeline-supplying-water-to-city-bursts-at-janata-vasahat-nine-injured/story-y23VPy43ggdyvE1LsxXhfK.html

I’am very happy and the credit goes to the state government and Naveen sir. I had dreamt of becoming a doctor as health facilities are very poor at the village level. Many students have been paying huge amounts of money for coaching. But under this programme I paid nothing and passed the exam,” he said.Another student, Vinod Kumar, a resident of Bhoda Hoshnak village in Fatehabad district, said he got AIR 12,358 (EWS) rank in the NEET exam. “The Agroha Medical College in Hisar district is just two kilometres from my village. The doctors there have been doing a good job and after seeing them, I dreamt of becoming a doctor myself. I am not sure whether I would be able to get admission in the MBBS course at a government college. I urge the state government to help me by providing assistance this year too because I want to study at a good college. I want to appear in the NEET exam again next year to improve my rank,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/72-students-enrolled-in-haryana-s-super-100-programme-crack-neet/story-plV2P8rI46zeGVB4fXyVfK.html

However, villagers of Kathura turned down the plea and stated that they will support Kapoor.Talking to HT, Kapoor Singh Narwal, said the Congress and the BJP had back stabbed him and planned to ‘destroy his political career’ by denying him a ticket at the last moment during the 2019 assembly polls. “The BJP leaders had assured me of giving the party’s ticket in the 2019 assembly polls but they pitted newcomer Yogeshwar Dutt at the last minute,” he said.“Now, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Deepender had called me to Delhi for the Congress ticket but failed to fulfill their commitment. The Congress leaders were promising me a ticket till October 15 but the grand old party had officially given ticket to Indu Raj on October 14 and made the announcement the next day. The letter signed by state Congress chief Kumari Selja on October 14 mentioned Indu Raj as its candidate. The Congressmen were making a fool out of me till October 15 by assuring me to consider my candidature,” Narwal said.He said he had failed to understand ‘the dirty politics’ of the Congress and the opposition party to stop him from filing the nomination papers. “The residents of my village have unanimously decided to support me. I will not withdraw my nomination. We assured Indu’s villagers to help him in future but this time we will fight,” he added.Meanwhile, the residents of Ridhana village said Kapoor Narwal’s entry in the fray will reduce the votes of Congress candidate Indu Raj Narwal. “We requested Kathura villagers to convince Kapoor to step down and support Indu Raj but our plea was rejected by a few people. Our village had voted for Kapoor twice.

17-10-2020||Mumbai||Daily Maharashtra Covid-19 test numbers have dipped in October: Devendra Fadnavis||Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the Uddhav Thackeray government must increase the number of Covid-19 determination tests in Maharashtra as the daily average was on a downward trend since September 1.In a letter to the chief minister, Fadnavis said the the average number of tests per day between October 1 and 15 was 75,296, down from 91,743 during the September 16 to 30 period and 84,675 in the September 1 to 15 period.He said the low number of tests in October might be behind the reduction in coronavirus numbers on a daily basis, which he claimed was “hiding reality”.The leader of opposition in the state Assembly said Maharashtra’s death per million figure was high and so was the case for Mumbai.The national death per million figure was 97.6 while it was as high as 333 in Maharashtra, the former CM claimed.“In Mumbai, the infection ratio in the first fortnight of September was 15.95 per cent which increased to 17.61 per cent in the second fortnight of September and remained 17.39 per cent in the first fortnight of October,” Fadnavis said, wondering why test numbers were not being ramped up despite “high prevalence of infection”.He said the rising infection numbers in the state meant all sectors of the economy cannot resume operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/daily-maharashtra-covid-19-test-numbers-have-dipped-in-october-devendra-fadnavis/story-a4G3C8y1v9r6PqZB27bsFM.html

This nukkad natak urges students to remain cautious,” a teacher said. Face us, say Congress councillors as MC set to meet virtually again Scheduled for October 30, the general house meeting of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation will be a virtual one again. The Congress has been pushing for a regular session with physical attendance but MC officials maintain that the Covid-19 situation necessitates a virtual meeting. “Even central government guidelines now allow a gathering of 100 people and here they can’t make arrangements for 30-odd councillors. This is only an excuse not to face the opposition and skirt important issues,” said a Congress councillor. Friday special: Ride in formals to work and keep cyclingKeeping the momentum of the cycling trend going, Chandigarh-based group Cyclegiri has started a Ride in Formals initiative. Every Friday, cyclists from the group will go to work on their cycles together, in their formal best. The route has been planned in a way that they will pass by each member’s office. Group administrator Akshit Passi says that the idea is catching on and HDFC Bank and State Bank of India are in touch to participate in the initiative.Covid rules out Ramlila at Panjab University Panjab University’s Ramlila, which started in 1935, will not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The university’s Ramlila is in Urdu with a distinct Lahori flavour that it has retained even after Partition when the institution was divided between Pakistan and India. Since its inception, the Ramlila has been held every year but this time, PU will miss its date with Ramlila. Tale of an ailing ambulance at Mohali’s ESI HospitalFor four years, the ambulance at the Employees State Insurance (ESI) zonal hospital in Industrial Area, Phase 7, Mohali, hasn’t budged an inch. Ever since its driver retired in 2016, it has stood still as the authorities concerned failed to depute another driver. In these Covid-19 times when emergency patients struggle to make their own arrangements to reach hospital in the absence of the ambulance, the vehicle stands in a state of disrepair with worn-out tyres and a damaged battery. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu happens to be a Mohali resident but infrastructure at the hospital needs a relook. The ultrasound machine there has not been put to use for two years as the authorities have failed to appoint a radiologist.

17-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Upper caste, Dalits dominate LJP’s 2nd list, party banks on own cadre||Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on Friday released its second list of 53 candidates, taking the total number of candidates so far announced to 95. On November 8, the party had released its first list of 42 candidates.While some of the candidates in the second list are also those left out by the BJP and the JD-U in ticket distribution, the party has mainly banked on its cadres this time. Sticking to its plan, the candidates are mostly from seats where the JD-U is contesting and has a dominance of Brahmins, Bhumihars and Dalits as part of its social engineering.On five seats, LJP candidates will also be against the BJP, with respect to the Govindganj seat in East Champaran, and Lalganj in Vaishali district. Both the seats with sitting LJP MLAs have gone to the BJP in the NDA seat-sharing deal.The Govindganj seat is held by LJP state parliamentary board president Raju Tiwari, while from the Lalganj seat, LJP candidate Raj Kumar had won in 2015, defeating JD-U’s Vijay Kumar.The woman candidates have also benefited with 16 candidates fielded by the LJP in the two lists so far. LJP spokesman Vikas Mishra said that in keeping with the party’s focus on youth, 30 candidates out of 95 are below 40 years of age.Also read: ‘LJP not a part of alliance,’ BJP reiterates ahead of Bihar assembly polls“Winnability of the candidates and their profile are the only two factors that party chief Chirag Paswan has considered while selecting the candidates. Other factors only come later after media scrutiny. Most of the candidates feel that this is the chance of the LJP as it is the end of the road for Nitish Kumar due to huge anti-incumbency wave against him,” he added.Like in the first list, however, prominent BJP names are not there, but by fielding disgruntled BJP and JD-U candidates, the LJP has tried to put up a brave front in the face of growing attack from BJP leaders who have branded it ‘votekatwa’ (vote splitter).From Teghara, former BJP MLA Lallan Kumar, who won in 2010, has been fielded this time. In NDA, the seat went to JD-U, which has fielded RJD import Birendra Kumar. Bhagalpur municipal corporation deputy mayor Rajesh Verma, who had joined the BJP, before the Lok Sabha elections, has been fielded by the LJP this time.Chirag Paswan’s brother-in-law Mrityunjay Paswan ‘Mrenal’ has been fielded from Raja Pakar seat, while council Krishna Raj will contest from Rosera seat.Talking to media on Thursday, Chirag had once again hit out at Nitish Kumar, saying there was “no vision in his governance to take the state forward” and that he had the blessings of his father to toe the line he is toeing, though he has full faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-upper-caste-dalits-dominate-ljp-s-2nd-list-party-banks-on-own-cadre/story-OoFHRgC1qYg5iumDfrkaLL.html

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||IPS, HPS officers to be posted as district transport officers: Haryana CM||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said IPS and HPS officers will also be posted as district transport officers (DTOs) to check corruption in the regional transport authorities (RTAs). The RTA is the regulatory wing of the transport department entrusted with the task to check overloading of freight carriers, issuing fitness certificate to commercial vehicles, issuing driving license, registration of vehicles among others. While addressing a press conference, Khattar said it is not necessary that the DTO should be an IAS or an HCS officer. “Any Class-I officer, including an IPS or HPS officer or any officer on deputation, can be appointed as DTO. The main objective is to curb graft in RTAs, a department known as hub of corruption,” the CM said. ‘Middlemen to be eliminated’ The CM said after ensuring the elimination of undesirable contact persons in tehsil offices, the government will also get rid of the middlemen in RTA offices. He said six more inspection and certification centres to inspect and check fitness of vehicles will be opened in Ambala, Karnal, Hisar, Gurugram, Faridabad and Rewari. Automated driving test tracks will also be set up in Kaithal, Bahadurgarh, Rohtak, Faridabad, Nuh, Bhiwani, Karnal, Rewari, Sonepat, Palwal, and Yamunanagar. Overloading of commercial vehicles to be checked Khattar said a strict vigil will be kept on overloading of commercial vehicles, which is a major reason for corrupt practices. The government has decided that portable scales will be installed on the roads and even the drivers will not get to know when the weight of their vehicles has been measured. He said 45 such portable scales have been bought by the government. He said body cameras will be worn by vehicle inspector going for checking and passing of commercial vehicles. The CM said the problem of overloading is usually found in vehicles used in mining operations. “Therefore, e-RAVANNA software prepared by the mining department will be integrated with the ‘VAHAN’ software of the transport department,” he added. He said this is the second initiative of the state government in which separate DTOs will be appointed in the RTA offices. Earlier, HCS officers were appointed as the chief executive officers of zila parishad. He said the DTOs will be appointed within the next two days and all 22 districts will have DTOs instead of regional transport authority, secretaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ips-hps-officers-to-be-posted-as-district-transport-officers-haryana-cm/story-F9YhFckQoDDAOZWXaSFLwL.html

17-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport now starts Covid-19 express test facility for departing passengers, visitors||The Mumbai airport on Saturday said it has extended the availability of its express coronavirus infection test facility also to departing passengers and non-passengers. The RT-PCR test facility is functional from October 15, the airport said in a release. Initially launched for arriving international transit passengers in line with the Civil Aviation Ministry’s directives, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has now further extended the availability of the test facility for passengers departing from the airport as well, the airport operator said in a release. The testing facility, located on the curbside of Level 4 at Terminal 2 for departing passengers, is also available for non-passengers visiting the airport to drop off or receive their loved ones, it added. The initiative addresses passenger concerns regarding the different Covid-19 regulations across domestic and international destinations, it said adding, departing passengers can undergo the test at CSMIA before travelling to their onward destination and produce their negative test report to skip institutional quarantine at their destination. The Mumbai airport had first launched the RT-PCR test facility last month for arriving international passengers transiting to a domestic destination from Mumbai as a measure to skip institutional quarantine upon arrival. This was later extended to all passengers arriving at the airport as directed by the MoCA. Since the commemoration of the test facility on September 6, the airport has witnessed a total of over 3,340 passengers opting for the test, with an average 100 test per day being conducted, said the release. Till date 38 passengers tested positive, of the total tests conducted at the airport facility so far and they were transferred by the state authorities to designated Covid-19 institutions, according to the airport operator. Departing passengers can make an online booking through the test feature available on the CSMI airport website or register themselves at the helpdesk set up at departures to enrol for the RT-PCR test before entering the terminal and receive a digital copy mailed directly or can also collect the physical copy of the test report within eight hours, it stated. Passengers departing from the airport are encouraged to arrive at the terminal 8-12 hours before their scheduled departure, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-now-starts-covid-19-express-test-facility-for-departing-passengers-visitors/story-XO6U7ezVTZHHSc6oEEjx1M.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers extend rail-roko protest till October 21||Farmers on Saturday extended the ‘rail-roko’ stir against the contentious farm laws till October 21. On the 24th day of the agitation, around 100 women extended support to the farmers’ cause by laying stoves, rolling pins and boards on the Amritsar-Delhi railway tracks and prepared chapatis. The women and children raised slogans and raised rolling pins demanding that the ‘black law’ be scrapped. General secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharash Committee (KMSC), which is spearheading the protest on the tracks in Devidaspura village, Sarwan Singh Pandher, said “We have extended the rail-roko protest till October 21. The decision was taken during a state committee meeting”. Pandher said, “The Prime Minister says the government will double the income of the farmers but refuses to address our concerns. It is a matter of record that between 1970 and 2020, the price of agricultural equipments has increased 130 times while the price of crops has increased 19 times only. Similarly, there has been a substantial increase in the income of the employees and remuneration of the MLAs. How will this gap be covered? The claims of increasing farmers’ income is not true as the prices of fertilisers, labour and agricultural equipments are still increasing.”He said, “BJP leaders in Punjab should resign from their posts and stand by the farmers if they are really concerned about the state and its farmers. These leaders are speaking against the farmers’ agitation on behalf of the Centre.” Lashing out on the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab, Pandher said, “The state government has been spreading rumours about shortage of coal in thermal plants. The state government wants to sabotage the farmers’ agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rail-roko-protest-in-punjab-extended-till-october-21-farmers-lay-siege-to-amritsar-delhi-tracks/story-e07pXYHgr73gnsbDuHHiTL.html

17-10-2020||Pune||87-year-old donates liver and cornea, marks 14th donation in Pune since lockdown||An 87-year-old donor became the oldest donor in the Pune zone to donate his organs after his liver and eyes were found fit in the apnea test. The donor became the oldest to donate organs in the entire Pune zone.This was the 14th organ donation in the zone since lockdown began. The donation took place on Friday when the entire city faced power disruption and network abruptions which proved to be a challenge for the zonal committee to coordinate for the donation purpose. Aarti Gokhale, Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC) transplant coordinator for Pune division said, “It was a historic organ donation as it was the 14th organ donation since May 2020 when the first lockdown was announced. It was specifically challenging as the entire city faced power disruptions and network issues due to heavy rains and we had to coordinate for two organ donations.” The 87-year-old donor was declared dead at Jupiter hospital and the liver and cornea were allocated to Sahyadri hospital, Deccan. The second donation was that of a 20-year-old male with severe head injury admitted to Ruby Hall Clinic. The donor was an unmarried student and a resident of Wadki, Pune. After the family consented, the donor’s heart, kidney, and liver were transplanted at Ruby Hall clinic, and kidney, pancreas were allocated to Sahyadri hospital. Dr. Vaishali Solao, director of transplant ICU said, “The 87-year-old patient was admitted for unconsciousness three days ago. His MRI revealed a massive brain infarct and we realised his neurological outcome was poor. As expected, his condition deteriorated over the next 36 hours. On the 14th, we realised that the patient was brain dead and consented to donate his organs. Subsequently, we conducted the necessary apnea test to confirm brain death. Meanwhile, the patient’s vital functions were maintained in an optimal condition by the intensive care team. After the second apnea test at 6:30am on Thursday, the patient was declared brain dead. Liver and eyes were found fit to be donated while the kidneys were not found fit.” Dr Solao further added that age is not a concern for donors if the organ is found fit. “The oldest internal organ donor in the world was a 92-year-old man from Texas who donated his liver while in India an 88-year-old patient is the oldest known donor when his liver and kidneys were donated,” Dr Solao added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/87-year-old-donates-liver-and-cornea-marks-14th-donation-in-pune-since-lockdown/story-kLVlNfT8p93DhrB5qsuUnO.html
17-10-2020||Pune||Central team projects 20 lakh Covid cases in state by October end||The central government’s department of health and family welfare has estimated that Maharashtra will cross the 20-lakh mark in the total number of Covid-19 cases in the state by October end. The projection also hints at a possible shortage of ventilators in the state and shortage of oxygen supported beds and ICU beds in major cities. This estimation is based on the growth rate of infection number as of September 24 and the ministry has asked the district and the state administration to prepare for the required health infrastructure accordingly and ensure that there is no shortage of essentials, including ventilators and drugs. A letter dated September 15 written by Rajesh Bhushan, secretary of National Health Mission (NHM), sent by the ministry to the director of health services, states, “The Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and so a periodic assessment is required. It may be noted that the estimates are derived on the basis of mathematical modelling and do not take into account the efforts made by the state or district to manage the situation.” The letter also states that the management of cases is necessary to keep the mortality rate down. It is also important that the needs for the infrastructure necessary for the delivery of non-Covid services are also addressed especially for maternal and newborn care, cancer care, dialysis, and surgical interventions. The projection states that major cities are likely to face a shortage of critical care facilities including ICU beds and ventilators. Major cities that are likely to face a shortage of oxygen supported beds and ICU beds with and without ventilators include Pune, Nagpur, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Nashik. While smaller cities like Amravati, Beed, Dhule, Nanded, Osmanabad, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Satara, Washim and Yavatmal are also likely to face a shortage of critical care facilities. Pune district which is currently the worst affected district is likely to report over 3.78 lakh cases by month-end. Dr Pradeep Awte, state surveillance officer said, “The calculation of cases and infrastructure is based on projection of cases as of September 24 in the respective districts when the surge was comparatively higher. For the preparation of infrastructure, we have considered the highest peak for the respective district; for example for Pune, if the peak was in the month of August then we will consider that number and prepare the number of beds, oxygen supply, required drugs, and manpower accordingly.” However, the estimate also does not account for a second surge which the central team had estimated during its visit to Pune. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the team had warned of a second wave in winter and asked citizens not to lower their guard and continue wearing masks and practice hand hygiene. Dr Satish Pawar, additional director, National Health Mission (NHM) and former state health director-general said, “These projections are based on the number of cases reported by September end. The situation then was completely different as compared to now. The number of cases is going down drastically and so the projections need to be revised. According to experts whom I have been talking to, the second wave could be less severe because of the memory cells which activate the immune system against the pathogens and the presence of antibodies. Also, this time residents would be more aware and will opt for home isolation, thereby reducing the pressure on hospitals. Residents are now more aware of basic hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene, so the panic situation will also come down significantly.” Pawar further added that currently there is no shortage of beds, oxygen or even essential drugs reported even from private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/central-team-projects-20-lakh-covid-cases-in-state-by-october-end/story-GqauMmM5JFFeqOxFYPDorJ.html

The air is rich with the fragrance of shiuli, or night-blooming jasmine, the kind that prepares you for the onslaught of winters. The vibe is heightened further as temple bells drown out the traffic in the Capital city’s mini Bengal. Even though the calendars indicate the beginning of Navratri, something is amiss. Each year, people from all over the city flocked to Chittaranjan Park for pandal-hopping and to revel in the festivities, which now looks devoid of any and all cheer.A walk up the steps of the famous Kali Mandir would usually end up with sprawling views of the pandal, but this time, the barren lawns paint a desolate picture. There is an unfinished pandal, almost a fraction of what used to stand in its place. Where committee members would be in a mad rush to get things done, a lull has taken over. This lull is felt even deeply as one treads along the narrow bypass that cuts off from the main temple complex, leading to the place where idol makers give final touches to the idols. It is an unassuming set-up – tarpaulin sheets erected on bamboo structures with a few personal belongings, paints and endless rows of idols of various gods in different sizes. There are only two rows this year, and the tallest idols are no taller than five feet.Read: Delhi calls it quits on Ramlila celebrations amid delayed guidelines and Covid scare“Yeh sab ghar ki puja vale hain. Aur koi orders nahi aaye,” say the two lone artists from Vishwakarma Shilpayan, explaining how they haven’t got any orders from pandals. The restrictions on large gatherings during Navratri were only lifted some days back, leaving organising committees with no time or plan to hold events.“We will have a puja, but it will not be open for public. We will establish a small pandal and conduct the puja with five-six members only,” says Ashitava Bhowmik, president, Kali Mandir. This means no Dhunuchi Naach or Dhaakis, no food stalls and an overall blanket no to all on-ground events. “More than government directives, we are also concerned about safety. As responsible citizens, we cannot endanger ourselves and others,” he adds. A similar story is unfolding at Mela Ground where no idols or pandals will be established. “We will hold a Kalash Puja with no more than 20 members of the committee. Since there will be no idols, it negates the point of visarjan,” says Pronob Kumar Chatterjee, a member of the Pujo Committee. Talking about the plight of the idol-makers, he says that some of them had come to Delhi from Kolkata in hopes of getting work. “In addition to the artists who live here, some had come from Kolkata, but there are no orders because there are no permissions to erect pandals. Barring a few who have ordered idols for puja at their homes, there is no work for them,” he says.Read: Dussehra Dreams: Effigy makers in a fix after no-show on RamlilasPuja committees have planned small-scale rituals, in accordance with safety protocols. “We are only allowing five people at a time – two priests and three members of the organising committee. No one from the outside will be allowed. There will be no bhog distribution and no cultural programmes,” says Niloj Acharya, member of E-Block Pujo Committee.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-mini-bengal-devoid-of-durga-pujo-cheer-amid-covid-precautions/story-bF3rvFUhvcwEvdxzyEZwnJ.html

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Rahul Gandhi, Punjab CM Capt Amarinder vow to force Centre to revoke farm laws||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in pledging to force the Centre to revoke the recent farm laws, which they said will be debated in the special session of the Vidhan Sabha on Monday. Asserting that his government will take all steps to counter the three laws, Captain Amarinder said: “Whatever time I have left with me, I will fight for the farmers and every other section of the state’s people.” The chief minister also announced his government’s decision to give proprietary rights to those settled in ‘lal dora’ land for long. The ‘lal dora’ is a land in every village and city, which is used for residential purposes without any revenue record. Welcoming the chief minister’s decision to convene the special session, Rahul said the voice of the farmers was “gagged in Parliament, but it will now resonate in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha and echo in every part of the country till the central government is compelled to withdraw the farm laws”. SECOND PHASE OF SMART VILLAGE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED Virtually launching the second phase of the Smart Village Campaign (SVC-II), along with Captain Amarinder Singh, the Congress MP assured all panchayats of his party full support, as well as the farmers and farm labour, in their fight against the new laws. Representatives of Punjab village panchayats participated in the virtual launch programme. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar also took on the BJP over the farm laws, which he said were “designed to kill the farming sector”. The state government, he said, should do everything in its power to prevent that from happening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rahul-gandhi-punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-vow-to-force-centre-to-revoke-farm-laws/story-VtaAzpEdRvfIVvzBXgQQqN.html
17-10-2020||Lucknow||UP government clears Rs 1,960 crore festive bonanza for state employees||The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Friday approved a festival bonanza worth Rs 1,960 crore for state government employees in form of a special festival package and a special cash package in lieu of leave travel concession (LTC).Chief minister Yogi Adityanath chaired the state cabinet meeting that approved both the schemes on the pattern of central government schemes, ahead of the festive season, in a bid to boost cash-flow in the market in the remaining months of financial year 2020-2021.The state government will have to incur an expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore on the festival package while a sum of Rs 960 crore will be spent on the special cash package. Close to 10-15 lakh state government employees are likely to benefit from the two schemes.Under the special festival package scheme, an interest-free cash advance of Rs 10,000 would be made available to all state government employees. This scheme will remain in force till March 31, 2021. A pre-loaded State Bank of India card will be given to the employees on request by the respective heads of department. This amount will be recovered from the employees in not more than 10 instalments. The festival advance will be given for all the festivals listed in the state government’s list of public/restricted holidays.

17-10-2020||Delhi||Muted Navaratri festivities in Delhi, Kejriwal urges people to follow Covid-19 measures||Navaratri festivities, which began on Saturday, are expected to be largely muted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The national Capital still has 22,814 active cases of the disease that has killed 5,946 people in the city so far.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday tweeted the festival greetings and urged people to follow Covid-19 guidelines. “Navaratri is starting from today. I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of this auspicious festival. May the blessings of Goddess Durga be upon you all. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, I appeal to everyone to remember and follow all the rules in public places. Ensure that you always step out wearing a mask,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Almost all major committees in Delhi, which would organise mega fairs with performances by top artists, have cancelled Ramlilas. The events include those attended by the President and the Prime Minister.With no scope for the 11-day festivities, many committees are now doing symbolic Pujas on a smaller scale.Ravi Jain, press secretary of Shri Dharmik Lila Committee, which used to hold Ramlila at the Red Fort, said they will simply do a Ganesh Puja on Saturday to mark the beginning of Navaratras .Read: PM Modi wishes on Navratri, hopes for positive change in lives of the poor“We are inviting devotees to join our Ganesh Pujan at 5:30 on Saturday at Maharaja Agrasen Park near gate no 3 of Kashmere Gate Metro Station. We are also conveying it to everyone through SMS and WhatsApp messages that masks and social distancing are to be followed compulsorily.”With hardly any fairs for them to go to, temples in the city are preparing for a surge in the number of devotees.South Delhi’s Kalkaji Mandir has sought help from the police and the district magistrate to manage crowds and ensure Covid-19 guidelines are followed.“Our temples have been opened for the people from today [Saturday]. We will also be live streaming all our morning and evening aartis to decongest our temple via all our social media handles. People can be at their homes and pray while watching the live Aarti,” said a member from the Kalkaji Mandir management.Kishor Chawla, the chief executive officer of Katyayani Shaktipeeth temple in Chhattarpur, said the devotees will not get prasad at the temple and social distancing will be maintained. He added prasad will be given to the devotees in packets. The entry of devotees without masks is strictly prohibited, Chawla said.The grounds of the Red Fort, which used to host three of the biggest Ramlilas in the city, will remain empty this time.Arjun Kumar, general secretary of Lav Kush Ramlila Committee which organises an 11-day event every year at the Red Fort, said they have pulled out of the festivity this year.“This is the first time in 40 years that Lav Kush Ramlila will not happen. The Delhi government issued guidelines on the festivities only on October 11 - barely five days before the beginning of Navaratri. So, it was impossible for us to plan and prepare anything in such little time,” he said.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on October 11 issued an order allowing Navaratri and Durga Puja functions to be organised in the national Capital with limited attendees, even as it prohibited all kinds of fairs, food stalls, exhibitions, rallies and processions till October 31.Kumar said no one wants to take any risk as such events involve big congregations, exposing a large number of people to the threat of contracting the disease.“Our Ramlila plays involve 250 artists who do each other’s facial make-up which means coming close to each other. If by chance anyone gets the infection, all the effort of making the arrangements for 11 days will go in vain because the venue will be sealed for sanitisation for the rest of the days,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/muted-navaratri-festivities-in-delhi-kejriwal-urges-people-to-follow-covid-19-measures/story-ZLcEUdDFicAGQ4ttIkCqJM.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh opens regular school for students of Classes 10, 12 from October 19||Though there has been no let-up in the Covid-19 cases, the Himachal Pradesh government will be reopening regular school for students of Classes 10 and 12 from Monday. The decision was taken in accordance with the Union home ministry’s order, which allows states to reopen schools after October 15, depending on the Covid-19 situation, said education minister Govind Singh Thakur. However, students can join classes with the written consent of the parents. It will not be mandatory to attend school as attendance will not be marked for a month. Thakur said that the decision to reopen schools for Classes 9 and 11 will be taken after consulting parents. School for Classes 1 to 8 will remain suspended, he said. During the e-PTMs, parents had suggested reopening schools for board classes as online classes were not sufficient to thoroughly cover the syllabus and students were facing difficulties in subjects such as science and mathematics. DECISION ON UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES SOON The minister said the decision to promote undergraduate students to the next class will also be taken soon. The education department has prepared a proposal to be discussed in the next cabinet meeting. Thakur hinted since college students were already attending the next class and semester exams were drawing close, promoting them would be a better option. Educational institutions in Himachal have been closed since mid-March following the Covid-19 outbreak. PARENTS QUESTION CONSENT CLAUSE Parents have objected to the consent letter they have been asked to sign before sending their wards to schools. Hem Raj, a resident of Kangra, said the consent letter says parents will be responsible if their child catches Covid-19. “This is not the right way. People will be scared to send children to school if such conditions are imposed,” he said. GATHERING LIMIT INCREASED In fresh standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued on Friday, the government has increased the limit on gatherings during social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and political events from 100 to 200 in closed spaces. In open spaces, 50% of the capacity of the venue is allowed. However, people above the age of 65 years, those suffering with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below 10 years of age have been advised to avoid such gatherings. Theatre and cinema may also open with extra ticket counters and separate exit and entrance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-opens-regular-school-for-students-of-classes-10-12-from-october-19/story-JzYMjz1lMFu0KMj4WfxioK.html
17-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Aarey flooded for the 1st time, walls blamed for choking floodplains||Cow sheds at Mumbai’s Aarey Colony were flooded for the first time this Monsoon due to walls built on both sides of Mithi and Oshiwara rivers, environmentalists claimed. They also filed a complaint with the state government asking for taking down the walls that were allegedly responsible for choking rivers’ floodplains.Environment group Vanashakti filed a detailed complaint on Friday with the state environment department, urban development department, and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to highlight that water this year entered the cow sheds at Aarey Colony putting animals at grave risk while damaging property. The complaint stated that the interaction of rivers Mithi and Oshiwara with Aarey forests was crucial for the survival of the entire ecosystem.“The walls are not needed on riversides inside Aarey and its only purpose is to dry up and create land for construction. This will eventually kill and degrade the forests,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. He added that even the 32-storey Metro Bhavan was coming up on one side of the wall.“The river has already been diverted outside Aarey and land filling has been done on the river to create a bus parking. Human interference has no business in the relation between forests and rivers,” he said.While both rivers originate from the overflow of the Vihar Lake at Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Oshiwara flows westwards through Aarey towards Malad Creek while Mithi meets the Arabian Sea at Mahim creek, coursing through Kurla, Saki Naka, Kalina and Vakola.The BMC built the 20-metre wall along Oshiwara at Walbut Nullah in 2018 as part of a ‘beautification work’ that it claimed would not affect the river’s natural flow and was constructed specifically for flood control. The site was selected by the BMC after a bridge collapsed during the Monsoon in September 2017.Also Read: SC rejects plea seeking imposition of President’s rule in MaharashtraAarey chief executive officer Nathu Rathod refused to comment about the BMC wall along Oshiwara but confirmed that dairy units in close proximity to the river had been flooded this monsoon, for the first time ever.Stalin added that the forests of Aarey were closely linked with both Mithi and Oshiwara rivers and were interdependent on each other for their survival. “We have thus requested the removal of the walls immediately and also issue orders to revive the river regulation zone (RRZ) policy–to safeguard rivers-- scrapped by the previous government,” he said.Also Read: IRCTC’s Tejas trains resume services from today. Here are the safety protocolsMeanwhile, the issue of the walls along the Mithi river, built by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), is already sub judice before the Supreme Court. Vanshakti’s complaint further highlighted a 2019 report by a committee appointed by the SC that recommended the removal of the Mithir river wall from Aarey. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC said, “We will go through the details of the SC panel report and the complaint. After discussion with the department, necessary action will be initiated in both cases.”“All urban rivers are facing a similar crisis where the construction of retaining walls and pressure from human habitations close to them are either choking them or affecting their natural flow and ebb. We will study the issue at Aarey,” said another state government official, requesting anonymity.The SC panel report had revealed that land filling at the 33-hectare metro car shed site at Aarey Colony (which was recently shifted to Kanjurmarg by the state government) had altered the natural course of the Mithi River. As a result there was a significant rise in the frequency of Mithi overflowing between 2015 and 2019 during major extreme weather events.“Declaring one third of Aarey as a forest was a welcome decision but the damage left behind by the car-shed construction and associated development activities by the municipal corporation has permanently affected both rivers, increasing the chances of floods every monsoon,” said Professor AD Sawant, member of the SC panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-aarey-flooded-for-the-1st-time-walls-blamed-for-choking-floodplains/story-griLD4hnXSt4WvcpTE0IZO.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||Two held in Delhi shootout days after attack on police official||Delhi Police on Friday night arrested two men suspected of opening fire at a Delhi police assistant sub-inspector and his friend in outer Delhi’s Alipur earlier this month. The two were arrested following a shootout with a team of police officers from the Delhi Police special cell. One of the two men sustained gun shot wounds in the leg, police said, adding that no police official was injured in the shootout. Police identified the two men by their first names -- Niraj and Sonu. They said they had received information about the presence of the two men in Alipur area and laid a trap. However, when they were asked to surrender, they opened fire at the team, triggering a shootout. “During the cross-fire, one of the criminals got a bullet injury to his leg. We managed to arrest both of them,” deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said. He added that the two men are part of Delhi’s Jitender Gogi gang. Gogi was a wanted criminal until his arrest in March. Yadav said both Sonu and Niraj were on the run after they shot at a Delhi Police assistant sub inspector(ASI) on October 3. While the ASI had sustained a bullet injury to his leg, his friend escaped with a minor injury.The incident had taken place around 6pm when ASI Sube Singh was sitting with his friend, 54-year-old Mahendra, in Alipur area. Singh was posted at the Seelampur police station.Interrogation of the two arrested men is underway to find the reason behind the attack, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-held-in-delhi-shootout-days-after-attack-on-police-official/story-dbvkN5q9ezSVgNC67jJTaL.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality remains in ‘poor’ category||Delhi’s residents woke up to hazy skies and a cover of smog as the Capital city’s air quality remained in the ’poor’ category on Saturday morning. The air quality index (AQI) was 261 in the early hours of the day, higher than the 235 average AQI recorded on Friday. The deteriorating air quality during winter months has become an annual crisis in Delhi-NCR with the onset of cold weather conditions and increase in stubble burning in neighbouring states. This season, air Quality in the Capital entered the poor category with the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 207 on October 6, and very poor category (304) on October 14, according to the System of Air Quality, Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). Data from the Indian weather office shows a sharp increase in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, with 3,517 incidents till October 15 in this harvest season, compared to a third that number last year.Read: Farm fires increase in Punjab, Haryana despite assurancesAccording to the Air Quality Early Warning System under the ministry of earth sciences, the predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from the east of Delhi, with wind speed likely to be up to 10 kmph with a mainly clear sky -- reflecting a possibility that pollutants could be dispersed. But the Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi, said winds are likely to be variable on Saturday and Sunday. “There was hardly any wind till 7.30am today. It was calm. Now winds are northswesterly and speed is only 5kmph. Minimum temperature has also fallen to 16.8 degree C compared to normal of 19.4 degree C. Sometimes wind direction may change but when its northwesterly, the impact of stubble burning in the northern states will be felt,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.According to weather scientists, light to moderate rain is likely at a few places over coastal districts of Saurashtra during the next 24 hours. Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over east central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea on October 17 and over central and adjoining northwest Arabian Sea on October 18. This is likely due to the low-pressure area over east central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea, which is likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over east central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea during the next 12 hours. A fresh low-pressure area is also likely to form over central Bay of Bengal around October 19. It is likely to become more marked during the subsequent 24 hours and bring heavy to very heavy rainfall at several places over Odisha and coastal Andhra Pradesh. Heavy rainfall is also likely over the rest of the east peninsular coast of India on October 18 and 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-remains-in-poor-category/story-b8kmvy1ojoMluh43rjqw5J.html

The petitioner, one Vikram Gehlot, had filed the PIL seeking dismissal of the government alleging that the affairs of the state were not being carried out in line with constitutional and legal provisions. The plea referred to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and the demolition of Ranaut’s property as examples of poor law and order in the state. During the brief hearing, the top court took strong note of the submissions and asked as to how it can be said that the Constitution is not being followed in the state because of some incidents. Maharashtra is a big state, the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-imposition-of-president-s-rule-in-maharashtra/story-60g3jPzW6nZmPZXWmjS15L.html

An elderly woman, who was charred to death after getting trapped in fire, was the second casualty. At least seven persons were rushed to the hospital where two are still admitted and undergoing treatment. The building is located in a congested area, with adjoining buildings standing dangerously close to each other. The fire was spotted around 10.30 pm in the basement and it spread fast to the upper floors, said fire brigade officers.12 fire tenders and a hydraulic ladder were pressed into service to douse the fire. Fire services minister Sujit Bose rushed to the spot and stayed there till the flames were brought under control till 4 am in the morning. “Rescuing people and fire fighting are going on simultaneously. The building has only one entry and exit point which is narrow. This has made things difficult,” he said. The source of the fire was suspected to be in the basement.

17-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: An oasis of the mind||For those who like to crib about Delhi, some of the recurrent grievances against the city are that it’s not walking-friendly, that pavements are too few, and that traffic is loud and polluting and dangerous for flâneurs.Who could contradict them? True, true, and again true.Or well—partly true. Indeed, some roads have beautiful tree-lined pavements for the walkers among us, such as Lodhi Road in central Delhi.In fact, Lodhi Road has become truly fantastic since part of its pavement has been decked up with benches—it happened not long before the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. This concerns the long stretch that runs past the Dyal Singh College: the benches are built alongside the college’s boundary wall and don’t interfere with the pavement, which remains as broad as before.Truth be told, walking on Lodhi Road always brings calmness. There are trees and birds, and you are likely to stroll past a series of Lodhi Road’s regular characters, from food hawkers to pavement barbers. Until some years ago, Lodhi Road was also home to Catherine Lama, an elderly Anglo-Indian woman who wore flowers as jewellery and lived on the footpath with a family of beggars. She died four years ago. Lodhi Road is no longer the same without her, and yet it continues to have a character difficult to find in any other New Delhi avenue.The new benches give the hurry-hurry stroller a chance to slow down, take a seat and appreciate the ambiance more patiently.The traffic is sluggish on the road this afternoon, and the vantage point from the pavement bench is more panoramic than when one is simply passing through. A gentleman, sitting on one of the nearby benches, is found insulting the area’s charm by gazing exclusively at his mobile phone screen. If only he looked up at the trees! He would doubtlessly be entranced by the avian life, as leaves continue to fall upon him. Squirrels are fooling about the fallen leaves. Occasionally pedestrians walk past—some are loners and others appear to be romantic couples. And soon appears Naresh Chandra. A Lodhi road living landmark of several years, the ram laddu hawker goes about the area the whole day long with his delicious deep fried delicacy.Meanwhile, the walls behind the benches have probably lived through so many shifts of seasons that they have discoloured to a strange shade of golden yellow, scarred with rust-coloured scrawls.When you’ve had enough of sitting and looking (and perhaps reading), you can start walking again and in no time will reach Sab ki Khatir. The footpath eatery is loved for its kebabs. Time for yet another break.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-oasis-of-the-mind/story-07lBAXsjlh7bgJBUBxUnoJ.html

Police said a three-page suicide note signed by the 40-year-old head of the family was recovered from near the bodies and it blamed the hardships faced due to the Covid-19 lockdown as the reason behind their taking the extreme step. Superintendent of police Sewa Singh Malhi said that the family belonged to neighbouring Rajasthan. The bodies of the supervisor’s 36-year-old wife, 15-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son were also recovered. It is suspected that they poured kerosene and set themselves ablaze around 4am. “The supervisor sent text messages to villagers before ending his life but everyone was sleeping at that time and found them dead later,” Malhi said. “Investigation is on. A forensic team is at the spot. We are trying to ascertain if the children were awake or if they were burnt alive while they were sleeping,” he said. The suicide note was signed by the head of the family with the time and date mentioned as October 17, 2020, at 3.15am. The note also gave financial details of the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/four-of-family-found-burnt-to-death-in-punjab-s-faridkot-district-suicide-note-blames-covid-lockdown/story-dvRK6temOQSH0zUWr8lsuJ.html
17-10-2020||Kolkata||Durga Puja pandals in Bengal highlight the plight of migrant workers||As West Bengal gears up for its biggest festival, the Durga Puja, which starts next week, some organising committees have decided to portray in their pandals  (temporary sheds), the travails of millions of migrant workers in the wake of the lockdown imposed on March 25 to fight the coronavirus disease -- keeping with the trend of pandals reflecting contemporary themes. At least 10 million migrant workers left cities -- many lost jobs because of the lockdown -- and returned to their homes in the hinterland. With special trains for them being launched only on May 1, many ended up walking home in April, and even later. Some hired trucks and buses. A few cycled back home. West Bengal alone is estimated to have seen the return of at least a million such workers. “Not only are we installing statues of migrant workers on the move to portray one of the biggest human migrations the country witnessed after Partition, but we are also coming up with a statue of actor Sonu Sood, who booked chartered flights, trains and buses to help migrant workers return home. A real bus will be parked in our pandal and there will be statues of migrant workers seated inside the bus,” said Ranjit Chakraborty, secretary of Keshtopur Prafulla Kanan (Pashim) Adhibasi Prinda puja committee in north Kolkata. The puja will be inaugurated by migrant workers on October 19 and residents in the area will switch off their lights at homes, light diyas and maintain a minute’s silence to mourn the passing of migrant workers who died on the way back home. Artisans at a puja pandal in Salt Lake’s AK block have made life-sized statues, and painted murals to depict scenes of the massive exodus the country witnessed during the 68-day lockdown. Bedraggled migrant workers -- men and women, young and old – carrying belongings and children on their head and shoulders, walking hundreds of miles down national and state highways to reach their homes became a common sight during the pandemic. A few died, even though the centre said in the parliament that it has no data on migrant deaths.

They would represent the local press-wala, the panipuri wala, the tea stall owner who basically work as migrants workers in cities. Even the idol of Goddess Durga has been made in such a way that she resembles a simple village woman,” said Raja Banik, one of the organisers of the 33-year-old Salt Lake’s AK Block Puja. In another puja pandal  in west Kolkata, organisers have selected relief as their theme, replacing the idol of Goddess Durga with a statute of a migrant woman carrying her child. Her children, including a son with an elephant-head walk behind her. “The family represents Goddess Durga and her children, including Ganesha and Kartikeya. The woman is a migrant worker and a mother who is searching for food and water for her children,” said Rintu Das, the artisan. In West Bengal, puja pandals in and around Kolkata are built around a current theme -- from a socio-economic problem to the Indian Premier League to cyclone Amphan. “We are portraying the devastation caused by cyclone Amphan through jute work -- collapsed huts, uprooted trees and dead cattle. The suffering of the people will also be depicted through these jute artworks, which are being deisgned on the pandal walls,” said Gautam Biswas, secretary of Simla Vivekananda Sporting Club. Cyclone Amphan, which hit the West Bengal coast on May 20, killed 98 people and affected around 100 million people in 10 districts of south Bengal leaving a trail of destruction. Also Read| Cancelling Durga puja revelry not an option, people should follow Covid protocols: Mamata“In our pandal we are depicting this destruction. The moment people enter, they will be able to see the destruction the cyclone has inflicted in rural Bengal and the plight of the people,” said Timir Sarkar, joint secretary of Chakraberia Sarbajanin Durgotsab which is in its 75th year. Durga Puja will be celebrated for four days starting October 23. This year, at least 37,000 pujas are being organized across the state, including at least 2500 in Kolkata. Around 1700 pujas are organized by women across Bengal. The list doesn’t include those organized inside housing societies and houses. The festivities continue for at least a week. The big-theme pujas parade down the road to participate in a carnival during immersion where thousands gather every year.

But those who have committed hooliganism in the name of farmers will be prosecuted according to the law and the family will get justice. I’m from that same area and I know that these people are directly associated with the local Congress leaders and a Congress rebel (Nirmal Singh),” Saini said.He also said that no lathicharge took place in Pipli in September, when farmers led by Chaduni gathered in the town for a rally against three farm laws.SARPANCH ALLEGES LAPSES IN ARRANGEMENT BY ADMNAs reported exclusively by the HT on Thursday, village head Anil Kumar mentioned about the lapse in arrangements made by the administration. “The administration failed to maintain law and order during the rally. There were protests in Yamunanagar too, but nothing happened there.”On this, Ambala SP Rajesh Kalia said the police restrained from using force, otherwise there could have been a law and order situation in Haryana.“There could have been some shortcomings, but that is not any failure or lack of police force. We knew about the probable protests, but the protesters included only 10% of farmers, rest were anti-social elements. A few of the BKU leaders had praised our preparations then. We are investigating efficiently on both the complaints (murder and highway blockade) we have received,” SP told the HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goons-of-congress-chaduni-responsible-for-death-at-ambala-rally-k-shetra-mp-saini/story-sRWpHWwXjYhbtS5BAjAbrL.html

The BJP-JJP coalition government had on Thursday appointed new chairpersons to 14 boards and corporations with immediate effect. JJP leaders, including MLAs Jogi Ram Sihag, Ram Karan Kala (Shahbad) and Ramniwas Surjakhera (Narwana), were chosen for five seats. Interacting with reporters in Hisar, Sihag said he will not accept any benefits till the government amended the recently enacted farm laws. “I have been raising my grievances against these bills at every stage, but the government is in deep slumber. I had joined politics to help poor people, but the government has failed to start a dialogue with the protesting farmers. As a farmer’s son, I know the consequences these farm laws will have,” he added.“If the people of my constituency will ask me to step down, immediately I will resign from my post. This MLA’s position was given by Barwala voters, not any party. I will not accept any position whether it can be a ministry or board chairman till farmers’ grievances are resolved,” Sihag said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jjp-mla-jogi-ram-sihag-refuses-to-be-housing-board-chairman/story-ctiEIv4R29a0lTtvvKOkEK.html
17-10-2020||Chandigarh||High court upholds Haryana RERA rules||The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 as well as the Haryana Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017. Some provisions of RERA law and rules framed by the state were under challenge in a clutch of petitions mainly from developers. The HC has held that when it comes to refund of the amount, and interest on the refund amount, or directing payment of interest for delayed delivery of possession, or penalty and interest, it is the RERA authority which has the power to examine and determine the outcome of a complaint. When it comes to question of seeking the relief of compensation or interest by way of compensation, the adjudicating officer, alone has the power to determine it, the court said, adding that RERA tribunal would hear the appeal of a builder against appellate authority’s decision only if interest amount decided by the latter is deposited with the tribunal by real estate developer in question. The court also gave time till November 16 to the developers, whose cases could not be adjudicated due pre-deposit condition issue pending before the HC. The court also held that RERA law was consciously made applicable to ‘ongoing projects’. All ‘ongoing projects’ — those that commenced prior to the Act, and in respect of which no completion certificate is yet issued — are covered under the Act, it said, adding, “It is plain that the legislative intent was to make the Act applicable not only to the projects which were to commence after the Act became operational, but also to ongoing projects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-upholds-haryana-rera-rules/story-gb8IjsoHRVuDVkfiOTwIRP.html
17-10-2020||City||Baroda bypoll: Know your candidates||Yogeshwar Dutt, 37, BJP The Olympian grappler made his electoral debut in 2019 assembly polls after securing a BJP nomination from Baroda. Dutt, though, lost the election by about 4,800 votes to Congress candidate Sri Krishan Hooda. A Brahmin, his second shot at Baroda hinges on his star value and consolidation of non-Jats in this Jat-dominated constituency. He would take heart from the fact that he is pitted against Jat candidates from two prominent political parties and a Jat Independent candidate giving rise to prospects of a three-way split of Jat votes. Also, Dutt was able to get about 30% votes in 2019 polls. Indu Raj Narwal, 40, Congress A rank newcomer who got the Congress nomination due to his proximity to former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Deepender Hooda. Narwal, a former member of Sonepat zila parishad, was a surprise pick considering Hooda originally pushed for Kapoor Singh Narwal, a turncoat from the Indian National Lok Dal stable who till recently was in the BJP. A Jat, Indu Raj comes from Rindhana in neighbouring Gohana tehsil, a village known to produce international kabaddi players. Joginder Singh Malik, 41, INLD The INLD has put its money on Malik again, despite the fact that he badly lost the 2019 assembly elections from Baroda. Malik, a Jat candidate, finished a poor fifth securing mere 3,145 votes, less than 3% of the total votes polled. However, he could potentially dent the chances of the Congress candidate by eating into the Jat vote bank. Kapoor Singh Narwal, 62, IndependentA turncoat who was hankering for a Congress nomination, Kapoor Singh Narwal’s entry as an Independent in the by-election could prove significant. His last outing from Baroda in 2014 was on an INLD ticket when he finished runner-up, losing by about 5,100 votes, to the Congress candidate, securing about 37% votes. Narwal, who comes from Kathura, a village with about 6,000 votes, has the potential to hurt the prospects of the Congress candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baroda-bypoll-know-your-candidates/story-e2oz10UhTOoNtwCmGkpFEO.html
17-10-2020||City||BJP, Cong, INLD candidates file nominations for Baroda bypoll||Four prominent candidates — BJP’s Yogeshwar Dutt, former Sonepat zila parishad member Indu Raj Narwal of the Congress, Joginder Singh Malik of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Kapoor Singh Narwal (an independent) — filed their nominations for the November 3 Baroda assembly byelection on Friday, the last day to enter the fray. The Baroda seat had fallen vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda.Congress, INLD bet on old workersLeader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda backed his old worker Indu Raj Narwal as the party’s nominee for the Baroda bypoll after party’s Haryana unit chief Kumari Selja ‘opposed the nomination of an outsider (Kapoor Singh Narwal )’. INLD candidate Joginder Singh Malik had also contested the 2019 assembly elections from Baroda on the party ticket and had polled 3,145 votes. Wrestler-turned-politician Dutt, who hails from Baroda’s Bhainswal Kalan, had joined the saffron party ahead of the last year’s elections and lost to Congress’ Sri Krishan Hooda. All the parties pitched their candidates by keeping the caste equations in minds, experts say. The INLD has won the constituency from 1977 to 2005. The saffron party’s nominee has never won from Baroda, which has 54 villages. Half the voters here belong to the Jat community. The Congress and the INLD have pitted Jat candidates, from Narwal and Malik sub-castes, which are quite influential in Baroda. The BJP backed Dutt, a humble Brahmin, whose caste has the second largest votes in this constituency. The Congress and the INLD have urged the voters to elect their candidates, who belong to the farming community, saying that their victory will boost the morale of farmers protesting against the agricultural laws, while the BJP maintains that Dutt has brought laurels to the nation and a wrestler has no caste.Former education minister and BJP state chief OP Dhankar said, “Yogeshwar is son of all farmers, who fed him ghee and milk when he won medals for the country. He has joined politics to serve people.” Selja created hurdles for me: Kapoor SinghKapoor Singh Narwal, who was confident of getting the Congress ticket till Thursday afternoon, filed his nomination as an Independent and said, “Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Deepender had called me to Delhi for the Congress’ ticket, but party’s state unit chief Kumari Selja created hurdles.”“The people of Baroda will elect an MLA, not a party. I’m contesting to highlight their plight, particularly those of farmers, labourers, and women,” he said at a meeting at his native village Kathura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-cong-inld-candidates-file-nominations-for-baroda-bypoll/story-qCpeZP4Xyi8o1AipDHkkKO.html

Besides, all individual advertisement boards in front of the retail shops will also be removed.While the administration is already restoring government buildings, including the deputy commissioner’s office and the Central State Library, this is the first time that it will undertake repairs of private buildings.The UT engineering department has already floated tenders for the Rs 4-crore project, which is expected to be completed within a year after starting in November.“Uniformity will be brought back in the facade construction material. Over time, private building owners have used different materials on facades, disturbing the sanctity of the Plaza’s heritage. Besides, the surface of the facades has deteriorated due to black spots and erosion,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t want to be named. “Most shop owners have also laid down their own flooring using different materials and designs. These will be replaced with a uniform red stone as per the original heritage plan,” the official added.“The administration briefed the market associations about the project in September. Though we welcomed the move, we have requested that the work be carried out block-wise instead of all at the same time,” said Neeraj Bajaj, president of the Chandigarh Business Council.SECTOR-17’S REVITALISATION AND RESTORATION PROJECTUnderway for the past few years, the project aims to make Sector 17 a hub of culture, recreation and events.

A country made weapon bearing the name of the gang’s sharpshooter, Ankit Bhadu, who was killed in an encounter with the Punjab Police at Zirakpur in February 2019, was recovered from him.“Parveen was in Chandigarh as part of the gang’s plan to avenge the killing of Bhadu. He had also planned another murder in his village owing to an old rivalry,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. “The gang members have engraved Bhadu’s name on multiple weapons. One of these was recovered from Parveen,” the SSP added. Besides the pistol, five live cartridges and a stolen motorcycle with a fake registration plate were also found in his possession.“An active member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Parveen had come to Chandigarh to meet Monty Shah, a close associate of Bishnoi. He is also involved in extorting money on behalf of the gangster and mobilising the gang members,” one of the investigators said. A case under Sections 384 (extortion), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and 120-B (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act has been registered against Parveen and other members of the gang, including Monty Shah, Pankaj Jhakhar, Bhola and some unidentified men.LIFER WAS OUT ON BAILPolice said Parveen was facing seven heinous crimes in Haryana and two in Punjab.

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents rue erratic supply, foul smell of tertiary treated water||Summers are long gone, but the city is yet to see improvement in the supply of tertiary treated (TT) water in residential units and at some of the neighbourhood parks connected with the TT line.Tertiary treated (TT) water connection was first introduced in the city in 2017 and was made mandatory for houses with area more than 1 kanal. However, the supply still hasn’t been extended to all houses eligible for the connection even though they are paying the charges. There are around 6,870 houses eligible for TT water connection. Ideally, 14 million gallons per day (MGD) tertiary water is needed to sustain these as well as the parks and green belts, but the current supply is only 9 MGD.Highlighting the issue, president of the Sector 38 (West) HIG flats resident welfare association (RWA) Neha Arora said, “For the last two months, we have not received any TT water in our neighbourhood parks. This has spelled disaster for the plants growing here. We residents are using drinking water from our own houses to water the plants, but this is not feasible and the plants are drying up.”She added that there were around 15 neighbourhood parks in her sector affected by this and no action had been taken despite repeated complaints to the municipal corporation (MC).President of the Sector 8 RWA Ranvinder SIngh Gill said that the 1 kanal plus houses in Sector 8 were frequently complaining of problems related to TT water. “All houses haven’t been provided with the connection. The supply is erratic and starts late in the morning making it hard to use the water for lawns or washing cars. We have to use drinking water.”General secretary of the Sector 33B RWA Kuljinder Sra added, “Besides the irregular supply, another big problem is the foul smell emanating from this water. It is impossible to use it to water lawns because we can’t sit outside afterwards. The MC should work on filtering the water better so that people can use it readily.”MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “We have not been receiving many complaints regarding TT water. Some complaints of leakages do come in, which are quickly resolved. If people are facing problems, they should approach us and we will get them fixed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-rue-erratic-supply-foul-smell-of-tertiary-treated-water/story-puvBdEK0eVxufnuSv0TGMK.html

Earlier, the DC Office had recommended some changes in the initial plan. “There have been several rounds of discussions on the plan and changes can still be made if required,” the official added.The old DC office, which was designed by Swiss architect Pierre Jeanneret, will be converted into the National Gallery of Modern Art, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-dc-office-in-chandigarh-to-be-as-high-as-secretariat/story-ALoMOpIAIB4wyG5R2KIHTP.html
17-10-2020||City||Mohali to miss Ramlila action this year||Even though the Mohali administration has given a go ahead to Ramlila associations to perform in the district, late permission, tight restrictions and a wary public have forced many of them to decide against doing so.On Thursday, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan permitted the staging of Ramlilas in the district. In a statement, Dayalan observed that the government had already permitted social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and political functions and other congregations outside the containment zones with a ceiling of 100 people.However, almost all Ramlila associations have pointed out that it will be impractical to put up a show, and at such short notice, too. Another reason they have cited is the onus of ensuring social distancing among the limited crowd that will be allowed to watch the function.First time in 3 decadesThis will be the first time in three decades when Mohali will not see Ramlila. The last time it happened was during insurgency in Punjab.In Mohali, every year Ramlila is staged at eight places—Phase 2, Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 11, Sector 68, Mataur and Sohana. The main Dussehra is held at the Dussehra ground in Phase 8.Jugal Kishore, the organiser of the Saraswati Kala Manch, which has been performing for the last two decades in Phase 11, said, “It is difficult to perform this year as we don’t have time to prepare and then there are the restrictions of 100 visitors only.”Arun Sharma, president of Nav Yuva Club in Phase 5, a group that has been performing for 12 years now, said “The state government should have given us permission at least three week prior. We don’t have time now. Our artistes need at least 20 days to prepare.”‘People want a show’On the other hand, the stage secretary of Ankush Club in Phase 1, Sanjeev Sharma, said, “People of the area are demanding a show this year, too. We have already applied for permission from the municipal corporation and will see how to go about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-to-miss-ramlila-action-this-year/story-4D0LOfDtFwUg2v4jczgfpM.html

Senior BJP leaders met the representatives on Thursday and slammed the Gupkar Declaration. “Attempts are being made to bleed Kashmir again. We will not allow them to succeed at any cost. There were no stone peltings and protests when these trouble-making leaders were under detention but now that they are out, they are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by raking up Article 370 again,” said Raina. He alleged that the leaders were hatching a conspiracy under the garb of the Gupkar agenda. Raina said, “When they were in power, they never implemented people friendly laws.”On Thursday Raina had said that “no power on earth can restore Article 370” and that “it will not be implemented till doomsday”. Raina said the Article 370 had given birth to separatism and terrorism. “It was due to this obnoxious Article that several ills continue to plague Jammu and Kashmir,”he said, warning the trio (Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti) of ‘serious ramifications’ if they tried to push their anti-India Gupkar agenda. On August 22, six regional and national parties unanimously resolved to fight for the restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir as it existed before August 5, 2019, saying the measures taken were ‘spitefully short-sighted’ and ‘grossly unconstitutional’. IkkJutt Jammu slams Gupkar league, demands statehood  Amid attempts by Kashmir centric parties to get back special status to Jammu and Kashmir, IkkJutt Jammu chairman Advocate Ankur Sharma slammed the ‘latest theatrics of members of Gupkar Gang.’Sharma dismissed Gupkar as a declaration seeking constitution of J&K as a special Muslim domain within the territory of secular India. IkkJutt Jammu also attacked the UT and Central Government for not taking necessary follow up steps post abrogation of Article 370/35-A.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/people-s-alliance-is-dancing-to-pak-china-s-tune-j-k-bjp-chief/story-7Moa0OmS81OMCg1vTi8bCP.html

Police believe the men had been involved in four attacks on security forces over the past two months.“We did not stop with Saifullah’s death. We found that around 3-10 people were working for the module, of which six have been identified and arrested ,” Kumar said, adding, “Srinagar police have busted a major LeT module . When it comes to disturbing peace, the role of over ground workers (OGWs) is more than that of militants,” he said.Kumar said, “The accused told us that they had used a tavera, two altos and three bikes for transporting militants. The vehicles were seized. These people gave shelter to militants and would do a reconnaissance of the area to determine where security forces were deployed and could be attacked,” he said.  “Around two months ago, Saifullah a Pakistani militant associated with the LeT had come to central Kashmir, Srinagar and Budgam areas and carried out four attacks. On August 14, he attacked a check post party of forces at Gulshanangar and killed two our armed police jawans. He then attacked a ROP party of the CRPF. On September 25, an ASI of CRPF was killed in an attack. Emboldened, the module then killed two CRPF personnel and injured three during a highway attack,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/let-module-busted-in-srinagar-six-arrested/story-PgTZSQYXomsBKO11hjGVeP.html

Bhat had emptied the magazine.Commending the security forces, Kumar said, “We had been convincing the duo’s parents to call them back. Now only legal action will be taken against them. If our people had not shown restraint, Jehangir would have been killed. Our forces set an example.” Kumar also requested his fugitive police colleague to return. “I also request our SPO to come back. Only legal action will be taken and his life will be saved,” he said.This is second time that a militant has been captured alive during an encounter this month.On October 10, two militants including a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander were killed in Dadoora area of Pulwama.

The case was registered based on a complaint by an actor claiming that the man had sexually assaulted her from 2015 to 2018 on fake promises of marriage. The complainant, who has worked in Hindi and Bhojpuri films, stated that she was in a relationship with the accused. In May 2015, she alleged that he had called her to his flat where he gave her a spiked soft drink. She claimed that he then allegedly sexually assaulted her. In her complaint, the actor mentioned that the man sexually assaulted her for years on the pretext of marrying her. The complainant further alleged that she got pregnant during their relationship, but the accused asked her to get an abortion and gave her medicine for it. According to the actor, the man’s mother was aware of the situation. Dayanand Bangar, senior inspector, Oshiwara police station, said,” We have registered the offence and are investigating the case.” A first information report (FIR) was registered against the mother and son under sections 376 (2)(N) (commits rape repeatedly on the same woman), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc, with intent to commit an offence), 417 (punishment for cheating), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 313 (causing miscarriage without woman’s consent) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The couples had to reach out to the local police which warned the villagers of strict action.  The incident took place on Wednesday but came to light on Thursday evening when the police got to know about the matter and reached the village.  Senior sub-inspector (SSI) Pradeep Kumar, Roorkee police station, said, “Both the couples hail from the same village. When they informed the police, their family members were called to the police station.” “Parents of one of the girls said they will not stop their daughter from going anywhere as she had already registered her marriage in court. Similarly, the parents of the other girl also said that they won’t stop her from going with her husband,” said Kumar.  Both the couples then went to their home in the village.  One of the villagers, privy to the matter and on the condition of anonymity, said, “Both the couples hail from the same village and had eloped before their marriage.” Also read: ‘Give him water,’ Jawans applaud as terrorist in J&K surrenders“One of them registered their marriage in court while the other couple didn’t.

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Help juveniles turn right on the route to reformation||Many flaws in JJ ActA review of judgments of various high courts of the past five years reveals that the current JJ Act, 2015, is ill equipped to tackle child offenders in the age group of 16 to 18 years who knowingly commit “heinous offences” of rape, robbery, murder, drug trafficking, gun running and dacoity. Armed with the complete confidence of immunity of juvenile protection, these legal delinquents indulge in crime and then reap the reward and protection as juvenile offenders. The JJ Act, 2015 is flawed from another perspective. Any juvenile alleged to have committed an offence upon being apprehended or detained by the police, shall be released on bail, except in three exceptions i.e. when his release will bring him in association with any known criminal, or expose him to danger or his release will defeat the ends of justice. With the advancement of the age of the internet freely dispersing all possible information on every available subject on a smart phone or a computer, a 16-year-old today is an informed adult, irrespective of his education, family background or societal set up. Glamour of crime, freedom, curiosity to implement explored knowledge and ability to devise analytical methods makes any such teenager an adult. It is time therefore, that the definition of a “juvenile” particularly who is in conflict with law and who is found to have committed a “heinous offence”, should no longer be treated as a child. The age of the juvenile in the JJ Act should revert back to 16. The benefit of reform for juveniles under 16 ought not to be extended any more to those above 16 who enjoy crime and not suffer it. Anil MalhotraIdentify and help students at risk“ The earlier the better” is a promising approach in which the teachers must inform parents about the child’s behavioural misconduct, absenteeism and lack of interest witnessed during the early school years and counsel them about the child’s need for parental care, love and affection. Prevention and intervention programmes must be designed for students at risk for development of substance abuse. It is important for the teacher to understand individual differences and not set unattainable goals as it may lead to great irritability and accentuate feelings of inferiority. The schools as well as parents must not lay emphasis on grades or marks and make it a benchmark of success and failure. The curriculum should promote value education, social competence and conflict resolution. Participation in recreational programmes like sports, music and art must be encouraged to channelise their surplus energy. The police must act as a preventive force by focusing on reform rather than punishment and treat them with sympathetic care as it may determine the child’s future behaviour.Komal Singh, ChandigarhHate the sin, not the sinnerThe main motive of the juvenile justice is to reform rather than punish the child in conflict with law. The government should allocate more funds to set up Juvenile Justice Boards and correctional homes. Reformative methods should be designed to instil values that can socially uplift juveniles. Their confidence levels will improve with regular education, vocational training opportunities, therapeutic training (yoga/meditation) to improve their psychological behaviour, and finally with employment. Manjinder Kaur, ChandigarhParents should give time to childrenGive children healthy activity alternatives. Those who spend more time with their parents are less likely to take to a life of crime. Some experts believe that holding family dinners at least five times a week can help to prevent juvenile delinquency. If children surround themselves with good and educated people these things can be prevented. Children should be taught about peer pressure early in life. They should study books motivational books.Ishita NaraMinors exposed to violence on net The reason for delinquency is parental neglect, especially in the poorer and lower strata of the society. Minors are also exposed to lot of violence on the internet, media and movies which is leading to mental and psychological illnesses. A legal framework is already in place in India to care of the juveniles but its enforcement is poor. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhFocus on poor neighbourhoodsIt’s important to catch them young and mainstream them through education and proper nutrition. Childhood is the most impressionable age. There is a need to identify poor neighbourhoods and educate not only children but also their parents. Society and state will have to come forward to provide for Anganwadi (3-6 years old), Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (to provide education to children left out of schools), vocational training and adult education. It should be mandatory for every employer to set aside at least one hour for literacy and education of poor illiterate employees. The administration will have to provide for expert psychological counselling to the children who continually neglect their studies at the school and fail repeatedly. The case in point is that of schools in the poorer colonies where children serve as bar/catering bearers and members of dance troupes during marriages etc at nights. Lt Col GS Bedi (retd), MohaliFlag unusual behaviour Schools should be on alert to check the behaviour of students. Mobile phones and cars should not be allowed and counselling services should be provided to all the youngsters with anything unusual red flagged and brought to the notice of parents and teachers for treatment.Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhSeek help firstParents need to keep an eye on their children and seek help from counsellors if behavioural changes such as lower grades in examinations, aloofness, loss of interest in family conversations and lethargy are noticed. Instead of fearing social stigma,the family should lose no time and seek expert counselling. The efforts of the police to mainstream juvenile delinquents by teaching them various skills under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana with assistance from the NGOs has to be appreciated. Usha Verma, ChandigarhSet up secure centresJuvenile homes need to guide youngsters to become responsible citizens through love, affection and proper direction. Emphasis should be laid on making these centres secure. Law universities should introduce courses on juvenile justice. Such a policy is being adopted in Scandinavian countries which has resulted in the least rates of juvenile crimes. Muskan Kotwal Light sentences not the solutionEducation is the key. Children from financially backward families need some incentives for attending school regularly.They can be kept busy after school hours with games or studies and senior citizens can help in this.If the children play and read, they will automatically get weaned away from crime.The message – easy come, easy go – must be instilled in juveniles in their formative years.Those gone astray should get psychiatric counselling besides training in skill development or athletic/ games. The new trend of enticing minors into contract stealing/thefts and other crimes should be stopped immediately, that too with an iron fist.Our statute book has enough provisions for reformation and rehabilitation of delinquent juveniles.Many a time provision of light sentence, even for serious crimes, is responsible for their proxy deployment.This has to be reviewed. For crimes of rape and causing death, even juveniles must suffer for life and the message has to go out loud and clear. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaSet up special homes There are some contributing factors ranging from parental care, differences between temperament, family influence, impact of school friends, neighbourhood and our society as a whole. All these deeply influence the young mind that finally chooses a short-cut to everything. Now there is only one way to bring all these juveniles involved in crimes into the mainstream and that is to bring them to special juvenile homes especially set up for this purpose. All issues related to crimes, their actual rights and issues about starting new avenues should be discussed with the juveniles by a team of experts in this field. Providing children with the opportunity to develop positive behaviour should be the foundation of most efforts to prevent youth crime and violence. Now a law has been made in which all past records of a juvenile’s crime are erased to afford him to start a new life. The objective of the Juvenile Justice Act is to integrate a person who committed a crime while under the age of 18 rather than punishing him for a longer period. This is a wise move.Gurpreet S Malhotra, KansalProvide anger management trainingYoungsters in juvenile homes should be taught social skills, anger management, physical exercises, yoga and meditation to understand that a life of crime will lead them nowhere. Drug rehabilitation services should also be provided.Col TBS Bedi (Retd), MohaliGet reformed prisoners for talksYoungsters in reform homes need the right kind of education to realise their wrong deeds. It should be mandatory to teach them vocational skills to enable them to stand on their own feet. Apart from this, they must be involved in some schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act will also help. Adults who have completed their jail terms should be made to interact with the youngsters and talk to them about the consequences of a life and crime. Collaboration of NGOs, RWAs and the police can enable youngsters to become responsible members of the society.Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliKeep mobile phones awayMost parents today have no qualms about parting with their hard earned money to buy their children mobile phones and laptops to help children supplement their studies. This is not helping as most adolescents waste time and money playing video games, with Blue Whale and PUBG having a harmful effect on them. More sadly, children have easy access to prohibited sites and is such are influenced by criminal elements into taking up a life of crime. What parents can do is narrow gap between themselves, their children and their teachers to make sure checks and controls are imposed in schools as well as at home to understand the students, curb harmful behaviour and arrange for periodic counselling.Subhash Puri, PanchkulaParents’ support criticalGone are the days when children used to be afraid of the authority of a senior member of the family, usually the father. Now, with fast paced city lifestyles where parents are busy with work and socialising hardly get time to spend with their children after fulfilling their basic needs and education. Absence of much needed control during the formative years is the main reason why young boys become spoilt brats and get into bad company. Juvenile delinquents can be disciplined and brought into the mainstream to become responsible citizens provided their parents remain supportive and interact regularly with them in the reform homes, making every effort possible to help their children lead normal lives again.SC Luthra, ChandigarhKeep communication channels openLack of moral values and communication with parents forces juveniles to take the wrong path in life. It is the duty of the elders in the family to spend quality time with their children, maintain proper communication, listen to their problems and guide them accordingly.It’s important that children are taught to be down to earth, practical, determined, happy and strong to combat life’s challenges. Parents need to win their trust too so that children can speak freely with them and share their problems as and when needed.Use of mobile phones should be restricted. Teachers should understand the psychology and pay individual attention to every child. Proper coordination between parents and teachers is expected to make students better individuals. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliHelp them pursue higher educationParents should ensure their children are supervised at all times. Youngsters come under the influence of bad company easily. The government should make better policies for the welfare of juveniles. When in reform homes they should be enrolled in crafts Institutions/ centres The government should provide them training as per their aptitude/level of education. Those interested in higher education should be given every opportunity to pursue the programme of their choice and encouraged to take up gainful employment after completing their reform terms. Bank loans on easy terms and conditions should be granted to help them start businesses and every possible effort should be made to showcase their work.

17-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress seeks probe into Vivek Oberoi, Sandip Ssingh in illegal drugs case||The Maharashtra Congress has again questioned the ongoing Bollywood drugs probe by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and reiterated its demand for an investigation into movie producer Sandip Ssingh’s alleged link to the drug racket. The renewed demand comes close on the heels of a search conducted by Bengaluru Police at actor Vivek Oberoi’s house in Mumbai on Thursday.A delegation led by the Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant met state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday and demanded to probe the drugs racket in Bollywood and its connection with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They also alleged the Central investigating agencies could be deliberately shielding Oberoi and Ssingh, who had together produced a biopic on Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. “I had demanded with NCB to investigate the BJP Drug connection in Bollywood. In my questions to NCB I had specifically mentioned the name of Aditya Alva found in Sandalwood drug racket who is brother in law of Vivek Oberoi who is partner of Sandeep Ssingh. But NCB didn’t pay heed,” Sawant tweeted.“Despite having all the reports regarding BJP’s Bollywood drug connection, which were handed over by the state government to CBI, the NCB has not yet inquired into the matter. The names of the makers of Modi’s biopic had come up through media reports. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had also demanded an inquiry into the producer’s role, but no inquiry has been done as yet. The Bengaluru Police raided Oberoi’s house, but the Central agencies have not taken any cognizance of their [Oberoi and Ssingh] possible involvement in drug dealing,” Sawant said after his meeting with Deshmukh. He also asked why actor Kangana Ranaut was not called for questioning by the Central agency. Sawant said that the home minister has assured them to remind the NCB about the investigation into the complaints submitted, and if the Central agency failed to investigate it, the Mumbai Police would take up the probe.BJP has, however, rubbished the claims and dared Sawant to produce evidence in an appropriate forum.“He is free to produce the evidence, if any, to the investigating agency or the courts. BJP never shields any wrong-doer, and the search at Oberoi’s house is an example of the same. PM Narendra Modi’s integrity or sincerity cannot be contested. The allegations by Congress leaders are malicious and born out of frustrations,” said BJP leader Madhu Chavan. Ssingh’s public relations manager said there was no truth to the allegations and he could take legal action against those who are maligning his character. “We dealt with all kind of false allegations for more than 100 days, and Ssingh’s family has gone through trauma because of it. It is now time for these people [who are levelling allegations] to face the repercussions. If Sawant is looking for more publicity by making allegations without any proof, he will have to pay for it. He is compelling us to take legal action against him,” said Deepak Sahu, public relations manager for Ssingh.“Only Sawant would be able to tell about his agenda behind this baseless and false information or if he is being paid by somebody for it. CBI had summoned Ssingh and his statement has been recorded. Ssingh is even ready for an NCB inquiry as demanded by Sawant.

Thakur is also the working president of the Maharashtra Congress and legislator from Teosa in Amravati district. Additionally, she holds the post of guardian minister of Amravati.The Amravati district and sessions court on Thursday found Thakur and three others guilty of beating up an on-duty police officer who stopped her vehicle on a one-way lane. Judge Urmila Joshi sentenced Thakur, her driver and two workers to three months’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹15,500 each.Commenting on the judgement, BJP spokesperson Shivray Kulkarni said that Thakur has lost any moral right to continue in office. “How can a minister who abuses and bashes up police personnel and does not respect the law of the land continue as the minister?” questioned Kulkarni. “Thakur should first unconditionally apologise to her voters as well as the police department, for her action, and tender her resignation,” he added.Kulkarni said the incident took place when the Congress party was in power in Maharashtra, and the BJP had no role to play in this matter. Thakur was not available for comment.The incident took place on March 24, 2012, when Thakur, then an MLA, was travelling in her vehicle along with her aides. When the traffic policeman Ulhas Raurale noticed that her vehicle was entering a one-way lane from Chunabhatti to Gandhi Chowk, he stopped it. Angry with the cop, the convicted trio assaulted Raurale, following which a first information report (FIR) was registered against them at Rajapeth police station.The Congress dismissed the BJP’s resignation demand as politically motivated and said that the BJP should first introspect. “Yashomati Thakur has not been convicted of corruption, and it was due to some personal tiff. She is going to appeal in the Bombay high court against this order,” said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. “Many of the BJP’s ministers in the last government were accused of corruption, but they still refused to resign,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-demands-resignation-of-maharashtra-congress-minister-yashomati-thakur-convicted-in-assault-case/story-wL8UkYTliafhnjctgjFy6K.html
17-10-2020||City||Staff salaries not paid: NOCs of three Ludhiana schools cancelled||Acting tough against three prominent private schools of Ludhiana for violating government instructions during the Covid-19 pandemic, Punjab school education minister Vijay Inder Singla has cancelled the no-objection certificates (NOCs) given to them. The schools whose NOCs have been cancelled include Guru Nanak Public School in Sarabha Nagar, DAV Public School in Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar and Amrit Indo-Canadian Academy in Ladian Khurd. The schools are in the dock for slashing salaries of its employees or not paying them altogether, due to the pandemic, despite clear government directions against such acts. Singla said that most of the complaints against these schools had come from the staff. The minister added that that he has been personally monitoring complaints against such schools and after reviewing the cases of these three schools, he decided to cancel their NOCs for defying government directions. The school education minister had floated his personal email id, vijayindersingla@gmail.com, to receive complaints against wrongdoings of private school management. He added that after receiving the complaints against these schools, the education department had served notices to their managements. After finding their replies unsatisfactory, their NOCs were cancelled. He said that the Punjab government will not allow any school management to exploit employees or flout any instructions. Shocked, school authorities in a fixThe decision to cancel NOCs left the schools’ authorities in a fix.When contacted, principal of Guru Nanak Public School (GNPS), Sarabha Nagar, Parvinder Kaur, said, “We have not received any show-cause notice from the director public instructions (secondary) office. We are shocked to know that the minister has cancelled the NOC of our school.”Amrit Indo Canadian Academy principal Jaskiran Kaur, said, “We have received any copy of the notice from the state education department and have no idea why the authorities cancelled the no-objection certificate of our school. For over three months, we deferred the salaries of teachers as we were not receiving fees from the parents. We had taken the teachers in confidence before arriving upon the decision. Now that many parents are submitting the fee, we have started disbursing the salaries of our teachers.” Despite repeated attempts, JK Sidhu, principal of DAV Public School, BRS Nagar, was not available for comments. A senior official confirmed that all schools were issued show-cause notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/staff-salaries-not-paid-nocs-of-three-ludhiana-schools-cancelled/story-tnVUgb6VieINOM4QPd2SAJ.html
17-10-2020||Mumbai||Heavy rain in central and western Maharashtra damages crops on 7 lakh hectares||Over the past four days, the retreating monsoon has caused damages to harvest-ready crops across over 7 lakh hectares, in more than 10 districts in central and western Maharashtra. The state has decided to approach the Centre for a relief package. Spot estimates of losses are underway. After satisfactory rainfall this monsoon, farmers were expecting bumper crops until torrential rain hit these regions this week. In areas like Solapur, Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, Osmanabad, Latur, Beed and Aurangabad, rain flattened standing crops like soya bean, cotton, gram, sugarcane, pomegranate across more than 7 lakh hectares. Cash crops, like cotton, soya bean and sugarcane, have suffered extensive damage. Solapur in western Maharashtra and Osmanabad in central Maharashtra are the worst-affected.“The affected crop area in central Maharasthra is over 6 lakh hectare, while it’s more than 87,000 hectare in five districts of western Maharashtra according to preliminary estimates. The process of spot estimates of losses is underway and expected to take a few days. The state government compensates the farmers as per the National Disaster Response Fund norms, which ranges between ₹6,800 and ₹18,000 per hectare. The losses sustained by the farmers are much more than the compensation offered,” said an official from agriculture department.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took a review of the estimated losses to crops, livestock, structure over the past four days. District collectors and divisional commissioners of the affected districts have been directed to complete spot assessments and release compensation at the earliest. The government has assured release of required funds at the earliest. “There is forecast of similar downpour next week in parts of the state. The district machinery should pre-empt the measures to ensure there is no loss of life. The evacuation of people from the low-lying areas should be done well in advance,” Thackeray said.This week in five districts in western Maharashtra, 29 people died due to heavy rainfall and eight are still missing. Four teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in Solapur, Osmanabad and Baramati; and 40,036 people been evacuated. The figures for the other districts are not available yet. Rescue aircraft from the Indian Air Force are on standby to paralift from flooded areas. “With rainfall subsiding in most districts, and a forecast of reduction in rain over the next few days, we hope air lifting will not be required,” said an official from the state disaster management unit.Previously, in June, the Konkan region sustained crop losses due to Cyclone Nisarga and in August, heavy rainfall affected crops across more than 1.80 lakh hectares in Vidarbha. The state has already raised a demand with the Centre for relief to affected farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/heavy-rain-in-central-and-western-maharashtra-damages-crops-on-7-lakh-hectares/story-a8UNw8quBewUkDr5QTTuxN.html

17-10-2020||Dehradun||Rishikesh’s musical instrument maker was someone Dia Mirza will ‘never forget’||Uttarakhand’s Rishikesh is globally known as the yoga hub and spiritual base camp for the sacred Himalayas. It was also home to a much-loved artist, 69-year-old Didgeridoo maker Mukesh Dhiman, whose demise has drawn tributes from all over the world. Didgeridoo is an Australian aboriginal musical wind instrument. Dhiman was known for his art of making Didgeridoo, which is considered as the oldest known musical instrument in mankind’s history with its roots in Australia. He passed away of cardiac arrest at his residence in Rishikesh on October 11. Dhiman, used to make Didgeridoos for the last forty years after being taught the art by an Australian tourist in 1980 in Rishikesh. Since then he made hundreds of the hollow log-based wind instruments and also taught the art of making it and playing it to many people with most of his pupils and followers from foreign countries. Ever since his demise, his followers have been paying tributes to him on social media platforms. Also read: ‘Give him water,’ Jawans applaud as terrorist in J&K surrendersBollywood actor and UN Environment goodwill ambassador Dia Mirza also paid him a tribute on her Twitter handle. Sharing the news of his demise she tweeted, “Mukeshji is someone I will never forget. a remarkable human being. A kind, gentle soul. He never locked the door of his home. Handcrafted and taught people how to make the Didgeridoo. A truly special interaction with him on Ganga- The Soul of India.” One of his followers, Eyal Amit from Israel who also made a documentary on him, posted on Facebook, “My dear and beloved friends, unfortunately, there is no easy way to write this. My beloved and legendary teacher separated from this world this morning (October 11) and moved on.”“I am still having trouble digesting the gospel and finding words. If you are able to light a candle, incense stick for the elevation of his illuminated soul, I would be very grateful. May he rest in Eden,” wrote Amit. Idan Hojman, his admirer and student from Spain, wrote, “Dear Mukesh, thank you for all the wonderful moments we shared together. For all the teachings, music, jungle vibes, art, adventure and so much more. ““You inspired so many people and touched so many souls. May you rest in peace dear friend and master. Your light will keep shining in our hearts,” wrote Hojman. Another follower from Argentina, Nicolas Larocca, paid him tribute by dedicating a 2-minute 57 seconds song titled ‘Gracias Mukesh (Goodbye Mukesh)’ on Facebook. HT had spoken to him in January this year during which he was working on his ‘dream’ studio up in the Himalayan foothills of Rishikesh with the help of some of his foreign friends and four sons. He had then said that his new studio in the lap of nature would be his abode for practising the ancient wind instrument away from the hustle of Rishikesh town. One of his sons, Sourabh Dhiman, said, “We will carry on our father’s legacy of making Didgeridoo and teaching others how to make it.” He said, “We would complete his dream studio which was left incomplete due to the lockdown. The studio would be his memory and a heartful tribute.” Sourabh also informed that ever since the news of his father’s demise broke, he has been receiving calls from people all across the globe to offer their condolences. “All of them are very upset. They said that they will come here as soon as the international flights are resumed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/maker-of-one-of-the-world-s-oldest-musical-instruments-dies-dia-mirza-pays-tribute/story-M1czRjrjoUvLrnrYxene0I.html
17-10-2020||City||Why one of India’s most wanted criminals Dawood Ibrahim continues to be a fugitive since 1984||In 1984, Dawood Ibrahim, one of India’s most wanted criminals for his role in several terror attacks, including the 1993 Mumbai blasts, then 29, escaped the Indian law enforcement agencies. The gangster, now aged 65, still remains a fugitive in the Indian records. For over three decades, why did the law enforcement agencies fail to dismantle the criminal syndicate and rein in the gangster’s flourishing illegal business, now spread across the globe, despite Ibrahim being designated a global terrorist by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in 2003? Security experts blame the “toothless” UNSC and Interpol, maintaining there are difficulties on various levels. Last month, the Pakistan foreign ministry issued a Statutory Regulatory Order, taking note of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which directed an asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo against certain individuals. The list included Ibrahim’s name. While India claimed this was the first time a Pakistani official document mentioned the fugitive gangster was in Pakistani territory, Islamabad responded saying the listing was “routine”. “Two factors are the most significant in ensuring the survival of the D-Company network. The first and obvious is the safe haven and state support he receives from Pakistan. However, if there was concerted action against the network on Indian soil, its defeat would be inevitable. The second factor, then, is a collusive network within India which includes significant elements in the power structure here, including influential elements within the political leadership, bureaucracy and police,” said Ajay Sahni, executive director of Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi. Sahni’s explanation was similar to the findings of the NN Vohra Committee, set up to study the criminalisation of politics, in 1993. The only tangible action, according to experts, against Dawood Ibrahim in all these years has been confiscation and auction of five of his properties in Mumbai worth about ₹14 crore. “As long as this collusive network is not smashed, the crime network will continue to flourish. This is the essence of successful organised crime – it does not confront or directly challenge the state’s power structures, but subverts and co-opts elements within them,” said Sahni. Arvind Gupta, former deputy national security advisor, has a different viewpoint. “Pakistani help and shelter play a major role, because Dawood is running the network from there and have wide connections. As he is in the safe shelter of Pakistan, it becomes tough for the agencies to react,” said Gupta, adding, “We are talking about a syndicate, a network, whose big players are outside, so it’s difficult to cause harm to it, with its masterminds operating from outside. Dawood’s name is on the UN’s list. But the UN works on the basis of the co-operation it gets from the member countries. In Dawood’s case, he is being helped and sheltered by all top agencies of the state. So how would any agency take on the syndicate?” The scope of the syndicate, too, is part of the problem, said Gupta. “When we work with the Interpol, we work with several national security agencies, where cooperation and co-ordination are key. This becomes tough as some government agencies co-operate, while some don’t.” Another issue is the power bestowed in these agencies. “Global anti-crime agencies have no teeth. The Interpol has often been described as a post office. It takes details of particular criminals from one country and sends these as ‘red corner notices’ to the country where these criminals are purportedly hiding. It is the local enforcement agencies in the latter country who have to actually have to ‘execute’ the notice. If a collusive country chooses to protect such criminals and, as Pakistan does, officially declares that the wanted man is not present on its soil, despite evidence to the contrary, there is very little that Interpol can do,” said Gupta. Agencies such as the Financial Action Task Force have some coercive powers, such as blacklisting, which brings into play a range of crippling international sanctions. “But FATF is a politicised agency and has never been able to secure the necessary consensus to blacklist Pakistan,” said Sahni. The UNSC can designate individuals as terrorists, but has no instruments to secure their custody, or punish them, according to him. “One of the major issues with the UNSC listing is that it does not possibly list all the aliases of Dawood Ibrahim, enabling him to operate under various aliases. Also, Pakistan communicates to terrorist leaders and organisations about the impending freezing of accounts which enable them to withdraw in bulk and transfer it to other accounts under different names,” said a senior IPS officer. “Alternately, a superpower like the US can ‘take out’ targets on Pakistani soil, as it did with Osama bin Laden and scores of Taliban and al Qaeda leaders, with or without legal sanction,” said Sahni. However, Ibrahim is not that high on the US’s priorities, claimed sources. “Also, this would be quite difficult given the levels of protection he is provided. But no state with that profile of covert capabilities has attempted such an action,” said Sahni. G Parthasarthy, former High Commissioner to Pakistan, said, “Why do we have to rely on Interpol or any other international law enforcement agencies, if we are capable enough to deal with it? Their paths are limited. India will have to look at it in innovative ways and use all its assets and powers abroad to eliminate its enemies. There are weaknesses and disunity in Pakistan’s state structure which can be used by India. The US has done it, Israel does it regularly, we should learn from them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-one-of-india-s-most-wanted-criminals-dawood-ibrahim-continues-to-be-a-fugitive-from-1984/story-f838xgBmYFy5V8e2K3gatJ.html

The BJP’s tractor rally, in favour of the farm bills, was lead by Saini and Ambala MP Rattan Lal Kataria.He was sharing the stage with Ambala BJP chief Rajesh Batoura, son of the deceased farmer, Bhupender Singh, village Sarpanch Anil Kumar and some locals who were injured during the rally.An FIR amounting to murder was lodged against seven farmers including Ambala BKU chief Malkit Singh. “The farmer’s murder by the Congress goons and Chadhuni is a murder of democracy. But those who have committed hooliganism in the garb of farmers’ protest will be prosecuted according to the law and the family will get justice. I’m from the same area and I know that these people are directly associated with the local Congress leaders and party rebel (Nirmal Singh),” Saini told the media persons.He added that no lathicharge took place in Pipli in September when farmers led by Chaduni gathered in the town for a rally against three farm laws.SARPANCH ALLEGES LAPSE IN ARRANGEMENTS BY ADMINISTRATIONVillage sarpanch Anil Kumar, while speaking at the press conference, said that no arrangements were made by the administration during the rally. “The administration failed to maintain law and order during the rally. There were protests in Yamunanagar too, but nothing of this sort happened there.”Several villagers and relatives of Bharat Singh had said that despite knowing that a rally would be conducted, the administration did not make any arrangements. “Even, when we were heading for the rally from our village to the originating spot, BKU goons had tried to block our way and one of them even argued with Bharat,” Anil Kumar had said earlier. On this, Ambala SP Rajesh Kalia said the police restrained from using force, otherwise, there could have been law and order issues in Haryana.“We knew about the probable protests, but the protesters included only 10% of farmers, rest were anti-social elements. Some BKU leaders had praised our preparations then. If we would have used force then that could have serious law and order consequences in the entire state. We are investigating both the complaints (murder and highway blockade),” said Kalia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-goons-chaduni-did-hooliganism-in-name-of-farm-protests-kurukshetra-mp/story-gJbycWOanLjov8Mj317b0I.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||CPCB divides Delhi into 4 zones to focus better on anti-pollution war||A majority of Delhi’s 13 bad air hot spots saw a spike in PM2.5 levels in February this year, as compared to the same period in 2019, the Central Pollution Control Board said on Friday, even as they announced that the city would be divided city into four zones to allow more focussed and specifically tailored anti-pollution efforts. In nine of the 13 pollution hot spots, PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels in February increased compared to the same period last year. The levels of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) were higher in six hot spots that month, as compared to last year, CPCB data showed. Keeping this mind, as well as the rising pollution levels in Delhi and rest of the National Capital Region, senior officials of the anti-pollution body said the city will be categorised into four quadrants—clean, moderate, polluted and critical. Also Read| Delhi: Blame game erupts as bad air worsensThis cluster approach — a part of CPCB’s winter emergency plan — will help agencies monitor areas and pass on information to enforcement teams to focus action, the officials said, adding the division was made based on pollution levels recorded in each area.Speaking about the February spike in PM levels recorded this year, Prashant Gargava, CPCB member secretary, said it was observed that while all resources were focused on controlling the pollution spike in the winter months, especially in December and January when plunge in air quality is most severe, this effort was not consistent. Gargava said this was possibly due to lax on-ground monitoring after the peak winter months. Dwarka saw PM 2.5 levels spike by 44%, while the surge was between 11-14% in Mundka, Narela and Rohini. Six areas, including Bawana, Dwarka, Jahangirpuri, Mundka, Rohini, saw PM10 levels rise between 1-17%. Gargava said CPCB teams will continue monitoring efforts till end of February to ensure such a situation does not recur this season. “We have directed state governments to ensure their enforcement teams are also constantly monitoring the ground situation till February-end. Long-term plans are necessary and we will require the cooperation of all agencies as well as the people of Delhi to curb the levels this year,” Gargava said. In response, Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai said that the government has been working around the year to control pollution levels. “Apart from improving enforcement on the ground, our government has come up with long-term policies, which will help keep pollution levels in check through the year. Our initiatives such as the tree transplantation policy, electric vehicle policy, etc., will go a long way to help bring down pollution levels in the city,” Rai said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), agreed that consistent enforcement is needed to ensure good air quality in Delhi, especially in the 13 hot spots where the pollution levels are higher. “The action needs to be consistent and not just focused during winter months. Compared to January, February is generally warmer with more favourable weather conditions so with stricter action there can be a lot of reduction in the levels,” Roychowdhury. Also Read: AQI reaches ‘very poor’ on the first day of Grap winter plan in DelhiMeanwhile, officials said dividing the city into zones would help focus attention on those areas, depending on the dominant source of pollution in each. CPCB officials explained that the monthly pollution values of all the monitoring stations will be collected and areas will be divided based on the pollution load and the ration between PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels there. Officials said these zones would be dynamic, and areas will be moved after regular reviews.While the pollution load will give a sense of the how much the pollution levels are rising, the ratio between PM 2.5 and PM 10 will help the agency ascertain which source of pollution is acting up every month. For instance, if the ratio shows a higher level of PM 2.5, contribution of smoke from sources such as open burning and vehicular emissions is likely to be more. If the PM 10 is on the higher side, then dust sources are to be targeted during enforcement. “We had put this approach on trial last year and had shared our findings with the municipal agencies for better enforcement. This is the first time we are sharing our recordings and this year we are expecting that the result of such a targeted approach will be better,” a senior official said. According to the division, nine areas — Jahangirpuri, Bawana, Narela, Mathura Road, Anand Vihar etc—have been categorised in the ‘polluted quadrant’, where extensive efforts will be made to control the primary polluting source, dust. The ‘moderate quadrant’ has three areas, Sri Aurobindo Marg, IGI Airport and Pusa, where open burning and vehicular pollution was found to be the primary pollution contributors. Twenty-four areas have been put under the ‘clean quadrant’, where dust is the primary pollutant. There are no areas under the ‘critical quadrant’ yet, but officials warned that this could change depending on the change in pollution levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpcb-divides-delhi-into-4-zones-to-focus-better-on-anti-pollution-war/story-GYnFoTFqafbP2SZwAKvpXO.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||High wind speed improves Delhi’s air quality to ‘poor’ zone||High wind speed cleared Delhi’s hazy and polluted skies to a considerable extent and improved the overall air quality index (AQI) to 239 in the ‘poor’ zone on Friday, a day after it had slipped into the ‘very poor’ category for the first time this season on Thursday.Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin on Friday recorded the overall AQI of Delhi at 239 -- categorised in the poor category. Meteorological officials said some more improvement could happen from Saturday as the wind direction is expected to change to easterly from the north-westerly at present.On Thursday, the day when the winter segment of the Supreme Court-approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) — a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels — kicked in, Delhi’s AQI slipped into the red zone, recording an AQI of 312 in the CPCB scale. On Friday, however, levels of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) also saw a downward trend through the day. Also Read: AQI reaches ‘very poor’ on the first day of Grap winter plan in DelhiFrom 155.1ug/m3 recorded at 2pm on Thursday, the level of PM 2.5 dropped to 104.7ug/m3 at 2pm on Friday. PM 10 levels also decreased from 317ug/m3 at 2pm on Thursday to reach 237.2ug/m2 at 2pm on Friday. The permitted limits of PM10 and PM2.5 are 100µg/m3 and 60µg/m3, respectively. Apart from the Jahangirpuri and Wazirpur CPCB monitoring stations, the hourly average AQI at all other observatories had improved from the ‘very poor’ zone to the ‘poor’ zone. Some stations such as Najafgarh, Lodi Road, Aya Nagar and Okhla had improved to the ‘moderate’ category by Friday evening. Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said this improvement was mainly because the wind speed during the day rose to around 10-12kmph, helping disperse pollutants that had accumulated closer to the surface. VK Soni, head of IMD’s Environment Monitoring Research Centre, said the wind speed during the day remained in the range of 10-12kmph. So, even though the wind direction remained north-westerly, the ventilation co-efficient was high, Soni said. The wind speed till 9am on Thursday was calm. Even though it picked up to reach 6kmph around 11 am, the direction was north-westerly, which brought smoke residue from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.The higher the coefficient, the more efficiently the atmosphere is able to dispose of the pollutants and better is the air quality. Also Read: AAP, BJP trade charges over farm fires, pollution“Through the day, Delhi’s average wind speed was 10-12kmph, blowing from the north-west direction. However, by evening, the wind speed reduced. But from Saturday we are expecting some improvement as the wind direction will change to easterly,” Soni said. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, also said that in the next two days, there is no sign of any significant deterioration in the air quality. The Union ministry of earth science’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) data also showed that the contribution of stubble burning from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana in the city’s air pollution levels remained low. “The share of stubble burning on Delhi’s air quality was 18% on Friday. The number of fires spotted over Punjab and Haryana were 583,” the Safar air quality report read. On a scale of 0-500, a value of 0-50, the air quality is considered good (minimal health risk), 51 -100 is satisfactory (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is moderate (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease), 200-300 is poor (breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure), 300-400 is very poor (respiratory illness on prolonged exposure) and 400-500 is severe (affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-wind-speed-improves-delhi-s-air-quality-to-poor-zone/story-ielCu7t6owEgzkUGhKJbyN.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP trade charges over farm fires, pollution||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday accused the governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab of not being able to control crop stubble burning, which worsens Delhi’s air quality very winter. It also said the city’s BJP-ruled municipal corporations were polluting Delhi’s air by burning garbage in the open. “The governments in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab have failed in stopping crop stubble burning. They have failed in ensuring incentives to farmers for not indulging in crop stubble burning. The stubble burning in these states significantly worsens Delhi’s air quality. We are thankful that the Supreme Court has taken cognisance of the matter and set up a committee to monitor crop stubble burning in these states,” Saurabh Bhardwaj ,chief spokesperson of the party, said. The Supreme Court on Friday constituted a one-member committee headed by one of its former judges, Justice Madan B Lokur, to carry out a physical surveillance of farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh -- a main cause of air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region -- and submit a report after Dussehra vacation. Reacting to the allegations, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg said, “The issue raised (by Aam Aadmi Party) needs to be analysed properly if there is a truth. In my opinion, if the issue has been raised it should be corroborated with evidence and supported technically. As technocrats, we are open to suggestions, and there is no denying the fact that Punjab is doing its best to control stubble fires.”Also Read| Behind Delhi’s polluted air: Early stubble fires, weatherPunjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said the Punjab government is doing all it can to curb stubble burning, but the problem lies elsewhere. “If the AAP has the guts, it should question the Central government. Paddy stubble management by farmers means they have to incur extra cost. The chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh) has written to the Centre several times, seeking funds for cost compensation to motivate farmers against burning of paddy residue, but there has been no response from them so far,” he said. The chief engineer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, VK Singh, said, “We are tackling the issue of stubble burning proactively. Punitive measures like fines and FIR are being taken.” A fine of Rs 2 lakh in total has been imposed on over 60 farmers in West UP districts and FIRs have been filed, he said.In a separate press conference, the party’s other spokesperson Raghav Chadha accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) of polluting Delhi’s air by burning of garbage in the open at a time when the air quality level is in “poor” category. Chadha said, “The BJP-ruled MCDs is Delhi have been caught burning garbage in Kirari area. The impunity with which the MCDs are playing havoc with the health of Delhi residents is flabbergasting to say the least. Delhi is breathing toxic air because of the MCDs,” Chadha said. He said, “The Delhi government has been fighting pollution with all its political will and administrative might. The EPCA should take strong action against the MCDs.” Also Read: CPCB divides Delhi into 4 zones to focus better on anti-pollution warReacting to Chadha’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “This is manipulation of words by Aam Aadmi Party leaders. A solitary accident happens somewhere and they say MCDs are burning garbage as a practice. Such allegations are a part of AAP’s strategy to tarnish the image of hardworking civic sanitation workers. ““Today, the Delhi BJP has drawn attention towards massive dust pollution due to callous works at several PWD projects across the city, including at Ashram Chowk, Pragati Maidan and especially Chandni Chowk, for which the Delhi High Court has shown concern and demands a reply from the Delhi government on this.”In a separate presser, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the Delhi government is little to address local factors that contribute 95% to air pollution. He said stubble burning accounts for 5% of air pollution currently. He asked AAP what it had done since the beginning of the year to address the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-trade-charges-over-farm-fires-pollution/story-IXuXFkxwGIHExcRCixV6yN.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||Reserving ICU beds a stop-gap measure to combat Covid, govt tells HC||The Delhi government on Thursday told Delhi high court that its decision of reserving 80% ICU beds for Covid patients in city’s private hospitals was a policy decision that was taken considering the increase in the cases across the city. The government said that the move was a temporary measure to mitigate the surge in number of virus-related cases. The court was hearing a plea challenging a September 13 government order, directing all private hospitals having bed strength of 50 or more to reserve at least 80% of their total ICU bed strength for Covid-19 patients. The plea — filed by the Association of Healthcare Providers — had said that the government’s move was a violation of the fundamental right of the citizens of Delhi. Also Read| Covid: Daily RT-PCR tests touch record 15,000-mark, cases above 3,000 in DelhiThe government told the court that the association was looking to secure the financial interests of its member hospitals, under the garb of securing healthcare facilities for non-Covid patients. The government argued that the association was opposed to the reservation of beds as it wanted to admit critical Covid patients in their ICUs and levy arbitrary and exorbitant medical treatment fee and other such charges from them. The government also pointed out that not only did none of the subject hospitals raise any protest and/or objection to the decision, the fact was that almost all of the 33 private hospitals had started implementing the order with immediate effect. The HC then granted one-week time to Association of Healthcare Providers, which claims that the 33 private hospitals against whom the order was passed are its members, to file its response. The high court has asked the association to file a reply and will hear the case on the next on November 18.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe state government in their also reply said several other states like Maharashtra and Odisha have taken similar steps and put in place similar measures to combat the pandemic. It said they have adopted a hands-on dynamic approach for the management and mitigation of this disaster. It said since certain private hospitals have been the preferred choices of patients, it has been found that they hardly have any free and available ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. The government said that there is a section of the society — including those with health insurance, CGHS, DGHS, and ECHS beneficiaries — who prefer admission in private hospitals despite the availability of beds in the government sector. Despite repeated attempts, Girdhar Gyani, the director general of Association of Healthcare Providers was not available for a comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/reserving-icu-beds-a-stop-gap-measure-to-combat-covid-govt-tells-hc/story-oFNP9YVV4rUCWg5zPZi8iJ.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||AAP hits out at BJP for supporting Facebook in top court||The Aam Aadmi Party lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday over the Union government’s decision to back Facebook’s contention in the Supreme Court that the social media company’s representatives must not be made to appear before a Delhi assembly committee.Facebook India’s vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan has been summoned by the committee on peace and harmony to present the company’s stand on allegations that it acted in politically partisan manner, a controversy that echoes similar political wrangling over social media in other countries.“Why is the BJP-ruled Central government backing Facebook at the Supreme Court over the matter of summoning Facebook India’s Ajit Mohan by the Delhi legislative assembly committee on peace and harmony? The BJP government is objecting to the investigation of the role of Facebook in instigating Delhi riots? This raises serious questions against the BJP. The BJP should disclose the nexus between them and Facebook,” said AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj during a press conference at the party’s head office in central Delhi. Facebook India told the Supreme Court on Thursday that it is unwilling to participate in the proceedings before the Delhi legislative assembly’s committee and that the matter was outside the scope of the Committee’s jurisdiction. The central government had said that Delhi assembly’s action in holding such an inquiry is without jurisdiction. Also Read| Unwilling to appear before Delhi assembly panel: Facebook to top court“Public order and police are not under Delhi assembly and their action is without jurisdiction,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the central government, submitted. The court was hearing a plea by Facebook India and its vice-president and managing director, Ajit Mohan challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the Committee that sought Mohan’s presence before the panel as part of its inquiry into the Delhi riots. “The voters of Delhi elected the Aam Aadmi Party to serve them and not be obsessed with social media platforms,” said BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli. A Facebook spokesperson said that they won’t comment on the issue.Bhardwaj said that the BJP is objecting to scrutiny into Facebook’s potential role in “instigation” of the Delhi riots in February, which left at least 53 dead and more than 500 injured. The Committee told the top court on October 6 that Mohan was summoned as a witness and not as an accused – and no coercive action was intended against Facebook India and Mohan – in order to ascertain the social media platform’s views on the question of whether it had contributed in any way to the building up of a situation in Delhi that ended in communal riots in February 2020. The controversy around Facebook traces back to an article by the Wall Street Jounral on August 14 that cited unnamed company insiders as saying Facebook’s India executives had prevented action against a Telangana BJP leader for his Islamophobic comments. Weeks after the report, the company ordered a permanent ban on the leader, MLA T Raja Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-hits-out-at-bjp-for-supporting-facebook-in-top-court/story-CYGcw9VoD0e6lIE3x97PaI.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||Four held for slitting throat of e-rickshaw mechanic in front of his nephew||A 23-year-old e-rickshaw mechanic was killed allegedly by four men, in front of his nephew at his shop in north-west Delhi’s Jahangirpuri late Wednesday night. The four men were arrested on Thursday and police said they are neighbours of the slain man. The arrested men were identified by their single names as Rajan,28, his brother Sanaj,20, and their friends Sachin,20 and Akash,18. Explaining the motive for the murder, police said the two brothers bore a grudge against mechanic Faizan Mohammad .Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Vijayanta Arya said about a fortnight ago, Mohammad had allegedly had made indecent remarks about the brothers following an argument that took place while they were all drinking together. Mohammad’s family said they were unaware of the altercation or the motive for the murder. They alleged that Mohammad was stabbed 17 times with eight knives. The police, however, said apart from his throat being slit, Mohammad had sustained two stab wounds on the hand and back. Arya said around 12.30am on Thursday, the police control room was alerted about a man being murdered at a shop in Jahangirpuri. A police team reached the shop and found a man bleeding from his throat. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. A case of murder was registered and investigation was taken up. Mohammad’s brother Qadir said their nephew, Iqbal, and two other employees were present at the e-rickshaw workshop when the murder took place. While the two staffers were asleep, Mohammad and Iqbal were installing a music system on an e-rickshaw when the four men lifted the iron shutter and entered the shop. “The four men greeted my brother and nephew and then got into an argument with them. One of them slapped Mohammad and he fell on the floor. When Iqbal tried to help him up, two of the attackers overpowered him. One of the two smothered Iqbal while the other pointed a knife at him and threatened to kill him if he raised the alarm. The other two men then stabbed and killed Mohammad,” Qadir said. According to Qadir, Iqbal managed to free himself and fled from the shop. He informed his parents about the attack and also alerted the police. But by the time the family could reach the shop, the attackers had fled, Qadir said. DCP Arya said during the probe, the involvement of Mohammad’s four neighbours emerged. “Our teams raided their hideouts and arrested all four of them within six hours of the murder. The knife used in the crime was also recovered from them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-held-for-slitting-throat-of-e-rickshaw-mechanic-in-front-of-his-nephew/story-ETjGj0AKCDKID8cQL9Zg8J.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||BJP-led civic bodies still not ready to hand over hospitals to govt: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Friday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCDs) for not handing over the charge of hospitals to the Delhi government, despite civic bodies being unable to pay salaries to health care workers. “The hospitals operated by the MCDs lack the necessary patient care and infrastructure. They have not been able to pay salaries to doctors and health care workers, especially at a time when health care workers are risking their lives treating Covid-19 patients. That is not justified. They are also not handing over the charge of these hospitals to the Delhi government,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of MCD affairs. Citing a letter, purportedly written by the North Delhi civic body in July 2018, Pathak said, “The north corporation had told the central government that it was not being able to run hospitals under it. What is stopping the civic body from handing over these hospitals to the Delhi government?” The Delhi BJP denied the allegations and accused the AAP-led Delhi government of perpetrating the crisis by not releasing funds due to the three municipal corporations. Doctors and health care workers of the north corporation’s Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals have been protesting against non-payment of salaries for the past several months. Earlier this week, the Delhi government had denotified Hindu Rao as a Covid-19 facility and had shifted all Covid-19 patients admitted there to Delhi government hospitals. Jain, who is also the urban development minister, had written to the MCDs urging them to hand over the hospitals to the Delhi government if they were unable to operate them. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The AAP leaders have a habit of levelling allegations without going through facts. The MCDs are capable of handling their hospitals if the Delhi government releases proper constitutional funds. Many of the municipal hospitals provide better service than Delhi government hospitals.” Later in the day, Pathak, along with several municipal councillors of the AAP, joined a group of doctors at Jantar Mantar where they staged a protest against the MCDs over non-payment of salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-led-civic-bodies-still-not-ready-to-hand-over-hospitals-to-govt-aap/story-AhBTiPmXzlpG15yFZLppuK.html
17-10-2020||City||Nearly half DU seats filled in first list, second cut-off on Saturday||As many as 34,814 out of 70,000 available undergraduate seats in colleges across the Delhi University have been filled under the first cut-off list this year. The final tally was likely to increase as around 6,000 applicants were yet to pay fees at the time this report was filed. The second cut-off will be released by Saturday evening. Officials across the colleges said there will be a marginal drop of 0.5 to 1 percentage points in the second list in almost all the courses. Last year, 24,000 candidates had taken admissions under the first cut-off list. According to the data provided by the university, as many as 59,730 students had applied for 70,000 undergraduate seats across 61 colleges (excluding St Stephen’s and Jesus and Mary) under the first cut-off list. Of them, 34814 had paid the fees to confirm their admissions by 8 pm on Friday. At least 6,394 applicants were expected to complete the formalities by 11.59 pm on Friday. Despite the high cut-offs, colleges witnessed a huge rush for admissions in the first list. Several courses at some colleges have already seen over-admissions. In Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College, which has announced a 100% cut-off for admissions to Political Science, Psychology, and Economics this year, 400 out of the available 750 seats were filled in the first cut-off list. Principal Suman Sharma said that seats under the unreserved category won’t be available in some courses, including BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and at least four combinations of BA (prog) in the second list. However, seats are still available in all three courses having the 100% cut-off. “There will be only a marginal drop in the cut-offs of these subjects in the second list,” Sharma said. Hindu College will close admissions for eight of the 17 undergraduate programs it offers. The college has already enrolled more students than the available seats in courses such as BA (Hons) Hindi, Political Science, History, and English. “We will close admissions under Political Science, History, Physics, Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Chemistry, and Zoology. For the roughly 20 seats in BA (Honours) in Hindi, we had admitted over 65 people. So there will only be a marginal drop in the rest of the cut-offs,” said principal Anju Shrivastava. The college has admitted over 900 students under the first cut-off list. Ramjas College has also witnessed over-admissions in courses, including Political Science (Hons), BSc in Statistics and Zoology, and some combinations of BA (prog). The college has witnessed 916 admissions under the first cut-off list. Principal Manoj Khanna said there won’t be any change in the cut-off of some courses in the second list in which only a few seats are vacant. In Hansraj College, as many as 1,220 seats were filled in the first cut-off, and admissions in some courses including BSc in Mathematics, Anthropology, and BA (Hons) in History will be closed in the second cut-off list. Miranda House had admitted at least 542 students under the first cut-off list till Friday evening. Acting principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said the college will not take admissions in BA (Honours) in Political Science and Geography for the unreserved category in the second list. “There will only be a marginal decrease between .25 and one percentage point across the rest of the courses. We had kept the BA programe cut-offs on the higher side, so that too will be reduced,” she said. In Shri Ram College of Commerce, as many as 125 students have already enrolled for BA (Hons) in Economics against the available 155 seats. In BCom (Hons) 121 admissions were done in the first cut-off list for 626 seats. The rush was equally heavy in off-campus colleges in the first list. In Rajdhani College, 450 out of the available 1194 seats were filled in the first cut-off. College principal Rajesh Giri said that the admissions will not be open in the general category in some courses, including English (Hons), Political Science (Hons), History (Hons), and BSc in Mathematics and Chemistry, in the second cut-off list. In Bhaskaracharya College Of Applied Sciences, seats in 7 out of 11 courses were filled in the first cut-off. College principal Balram Pani said, “We won’t have admissions in the unreserved category in some courses including Physics (Hons), microbiology, Zoology (Hons), Chemistry and biomedical science in the second cut-off list.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nearly-half-du-seats-filled-in-first-list-second-cut-off-on-saturday/story-eaaD5HRESlenXOzwow1UHL.html
17-10-2020||Delhi||Use student funds to pay salaries, Delhi govt tells 12 DU colleges; teachers decry move||Twelve Delhi University colleges, fully funded by the Delhi government, which have been unable to pay salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff for the past several months for want of funds/grants from the government, were Friday told the directorate of higher education to utilise the student fund to pay salaries within two weeks. Citing the pending salaries of staff owing to “ongoing special audit and non-release of grant-in-aid”, the directorate of higher education ordered, “Outstanding salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff be released immediately from the Student Society Fund (SSF) as has been done in the past, till the process of special audit is completed/further instalments of grant-in-aid (under the salary head) are released.”The government did not clarify whether the money, thus borrowed, would be later put back.No sooner had the direction been issued than it came under fire from teachers, including members of the Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), which said it was “unacceptable to use student funds for paying teachers their salaries”.Maintaining that employees of at least six government-funded DU colleges are without salaries for six months, DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “Using Students Society Fund (SSF) for pay the outstanding salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff is unacceptable. This fund is collected from students for organising extra-curricular activities and is, thus, used by colleges for students. By ordering that colleges use SSF to pay salaries, the Delhi government is pushing the burden of salary payments on to parents and students. This is unacceptable, even as an interim measure.” The 12 colleges include Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Shaheed Rajguru College for Applied Sciences for Women, Maharaja Agrasen College and Acharya Narendra Dev College, among others. There are around 1,200 teaching and 900 non-teaching staff members employed on a permanent basis in these colleges, apart from contractual staff.DU teachers and principals have been protesting since May against the delay in disbursal of grants to 12 government-funded colleges, which they said is the main reason for salaries remaining unpaid for the past five to six months. The government, last month, attributed this delay in releasing funds to the alleged financial irregularities in these colleges and ordered special audits of these colleges. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia later said the initial reports of the audit showed misappropriation of funds in at least four colleges. The department also said if any salaries remain unpaid even after SSF is exhausted, the remaining amount will be covered by the government on “receipt of a formal request from colleges”.Teachers are decrying the move. “Even in the past, if colleges were forced to use SSF for such purposes, the money was borrowed from the account and was always returned as soon as grants-in-aid were released. The SSF cannot be siphoned off towards salary payments on a permanent basis…Audits are routine matters for any institution and salaries have never been stopped on this pretext earlier. Why should it be any different this time?” Ray said. The Delhi government, in a statement, said, “The lawyer representing Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College had stated in court that they have paid salaries from the SSF in the past. When the judge asked him whether they are allowed to do so, he said “yes, they are -- all they need is a permission from the directorate of higher education”. They should also be asked to present any document that states that this is illegal. The reason they now claim this is illegal is because this fund is discretionary, to be spent by principals, and there is corruption in how the money is spent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/use-student-funds-to-pay-salaries-delhi-govt-tells-12-du-colleges-teachers-decry-move/story-YZN8L2RS6YhRqPBmiknVjP.html

Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials and workers visited the various flood-affected areas and carried out cleaning and relief related works. The affected citizens have asked the civic administration to build a strong retaining wall on both sides of Ambil Odha flowing through the city area. The 2019 flash floods in the city had claimed 266 lives of which seven residents of Tangewala colony in Sahakarnagar were washed away in the strong currents of water as they were asleep. “The cleaning of our houses is still going on and stink will remain for some time. We are living under fear and PMC has not learnt a lesson from last year’s flash floods. PMC officials and local coporators visited our area today and once again assured to build the wall. Who will compensate for the damage that could have been avoided if civic administration had taken adequate steps?” said Kaushik Sabale, a resident of Sahakarnagar area whose entire house was filled with water and mud. People living at Katraj area and close to the lake also face risk of water entering their houses during heavy rains.“It is an issue we face in every rainy season. The damage we faced this time is less as compared to previous year, but we cannot live under flood threat every year.

Khadse has made his dissatisfaction with the BJP public and has engaged in continuously attacking former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The buzz in political circles is that Khadse is going to join the NCP very soon, as early as the Navratri festival, which begins from October 17. Pawar was in the city to take a review of the Covid- 19 situation in the district. All party MPs and MLAs from the Pune district were invited to the meeting. When Pawar was questioned on Khadse’s switch to the NCP, he said he wasn’t aware of any such developments. Pawar said, “It is very common that people from different political parties meet each other. We cannot come to the conclusion that meeting the opposition party leaders means any new development. Even I used to meet opposition party leaders when we were in the opposition.” Meanwhile, when Sule was questioned about Khadse’s induction into the party, she replied, “I am not aware of this. Media should ask this to the state unit president Jayant Patil.” Meanwhile, Pawar charitable trust donated ambulances to the district administrations of Shirur, Baramati and Indapur in Pune district. No political intention behind inquiry of Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan – Pawar Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that though the state government opened an inquiry into former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ flagship scheme Jalyukta Shivar, no political intention was behind it. Pawar clarified that the inquiry was not to corner anyone. According to Pawar, the CAG has highlighted some flaws in it and the minister of state for irrigation Tanaji Sawant has raised some points about this scheme in their tenure only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ajit-pawar-and-supriya-sule-water-down-reports-of-khadse-s-switch-to-ncp/story-qKtQQLNu5aztdmb1gHmeZK.html

17-10-2020||Pune||Mandals in Pune give mandaps a miss for Covid-hit Navratri||The Navratri mandals have taken a conscious decision to not erect pandals of the goddess Laxmi for the nine-day celebration of Navratri in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic this year. The famous temples in the city that attract a large crowd during the nine-day festival like Chaturshringi devasthan, Bhavani mata mandir, Tambdi Jogeshwari, Taljai, Mahalaxmi mandir, Padmavati are following the government norms and have decided to keep their temples shut. Some temples in the city have taken a decision to live stream the rituals like ghatstapana on Saturday and the aarti of the goddess on their websites or social media pages. “It is most unfortunate that we have to keep the temple closed during the Navratri celebrations, but one has to follow the government norms and rules which in the best interest during the Covid-19 situation in the city. Though we will be continuing with the religious rituals within the inner sanctum performed by the priests and staff, we will live stream on the big LED screen displayed near the big gate in our premises,” said Devendra Angal, managing trustee, Chaturshringi devasthan. The Chaturshringi devasthan will upload videos and stream on their official page on social media and also on their website www.chattushringidevasthanpune.org and www.chattushringidevasthan.org. The Mahalaxmi temple has also announced that it will be live streaming the ghatastpana and other programmes online. But older temples in the city like Tambdi Jogeshwari are still undecided on how to reach out to their lakhs of devotees. “We usually have a lot of women performing the puja and other rituals within the inner sanctum of the temple, and since it is a small space, we usually use to have a mandap outside the temple with all the nine vahanas on display, which also eased the crowds from entering into the temple, but this year, we are following the protocols laid by the government and also still haven’t got permission to put up LED screenings, so we are undecided,” said Vinayak Bendre, a priest at the Tambdi Jogeshwari temple. There are at least 100 smaller temples who usually put up mandaps outside the small temples of the goddess. However, in light of the protocol, they have taken a decision to not to hold any programmes for nine days. “We will have ghatastapana within the small temple performed only by the priest and have cancelled most of our programmes except for a ‘hom’ which will be held outside the temple in a 10x10 mandap, provided we get permission,” said Kumar Renuse, president of the Nav Vishnu chowk mitra mandal, Navratri utsav, Sadashiv peth. Madhav Jagtap, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) encroachment department said, “Looking at the Covid pandemic situation, we have begun unlock phase 4 however, not a single mandal or temple has approached us for permission for setting up mandaps for Navratri. It is a conscious decision by many mandals to follow the norms in the strictest possible way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mandals-give-mandaps-a-miss-for-covid-hit-navratri/story-G0BfqpwZSsJWV7d0GuZo2L.html
17-10-2020||Pune||200 illegal structures over waterbodies await demolition in Pune||The issue of illegal structures constructed over different nallahs (canals) in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) regions, has come to light following the death of Nimit Ashok Aherwal (21), a resident of Sanaswadi, who was swept away by water overflowing in a nallah near Hotel Kaveri on the Pune-Ahmednagar road on Wednesday night. Following the incident, residents of Wagholi have demanded strong action against PMRDA officials for failing to act against construction on nallahs in the area. According to the PMRDA administration, there are 100 structures occupying space on natural waterbodies in the area, causing repeated flooding in Wagholi. Apart from Katraj, Sahakarnagar, Bibvewadi and Dhankawdi, suburbs like Wagholi, Undri, Mohammadwadi, Ahmednagar road, Vishrantwadi, Phulenagar, Mundhwa, Hadapsar and Wanowrie areas have experienced flash floods in the past one year. Citizen rights activist Vijay Kumbhar said, “We are waiting for another tragedy to happen. The builders in connivance with the politicians have brutally chopped off the hilltops, destroyed the environment and filled up nallahs and rivulets during the past one decade. The citizens are afraid to raise their voice against these illegalities. It is time Puneites take action against construction on waterbodies. Nallah encroachments in the suburbs and inaction by the respective civic bodies is the main reason behind intense waterlogging.” Sanjeev Kumar Patil, director, Wagholi Housing Societies Association, said, “The PMRDA is guilty of misconduct and action needs to be taken against officials for not removing the illegal encroachments on the nallah. We want to make lives safe for all Wagholikars and also all commuters using the highway. There are a large number of encroachments on natural water bodies which need to be removed at the earliest to prevent flooding and flash floods in the area.” Suhas Diwase, chief of PMRDA, said action will be taken against violators. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We have ordered an inquiry into the death and suitable action will be taken against the violators.” Twenty-one-year Nimit Ashok Aherwal of Sanaswadi lost his life near hotel Kaveri on Ahmednagar road at 10 am on Wednesday. He was on way to drop his relative to railway station and when he saw overflowing water asked his relative to get down on bike. While he proceeded on bike, he was washed away.Unchecked construction near water bodyDevelopment Control (DC) rules of the PMC prohibit construction within 20 metres of any water body. Even if the nallah flows through private land, the owner cannot construct on it. While the responsibility of keeping a check on such violations lies with the irrigation department, ward offices of the civic body are also empowered to act against offender. The PMC had appointed a private firm, Pri-Move, which identified 77 structures alongside the Ambil odha which aggravated the floods last year. A separate committee of environmental activists and residents then prepared a report pointing to specific unauthorised constructions that contributed to the floods. Based on the Pri-Move report, the PMC served notices to all 77 unauthorised structures, but none have been demolished till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/200-illegal-structures-over-water-bodies-await-demolition/story-WwrLKa3dS1aWEWfJl7jy4K.html

The deceased has been identified as Chaya Pandurang Gunjal and the injured woman is Mangal Sahebrao Satvadhar (48), according to the police. Santosh Pandhurang Gunjal (32), the deceased woman’s son, who is also the complainant in the case, is married to Satvadhar’s daughter.

17-10-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana cabinet withdraws ordinance on private job quota||The Haryana cabinet on Friday withdrew the ordinance it had approved two months ago to provide 75% reservation in private sector jobs. The ordinance was not promulgated by the governor, who had reserved it for the consideration of the President. The proposed legislation was sent to the Union home ministry for scrutiny before the President took a call. The BJP-JJP regime intends to bring a replica bill in the assembly after withdrawing the ordinance. A replica bill passed by the assembly will also have to be reserved for the consideration of the President, officials said. Deputy chief minister and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, who piloted the private quota move, had earlier written to the governor, seeking the withdrawal of the ordinance. However, officials said the cabinet will first have to sanction the move to withdraw the ordinance. “The ordinance has not been promulgated. Since it has been sent to the Centre for the President’s consideration, it is still under progress. So,unless it’s withdrawn by the governor by writing to the central government, a replica bill cannot be tabled in the assembly. The move to withdraw it can only be approved by the cabinet,” a senior official said. Former advocate general Ashok Aggarwal said it is the government’s prerogative to introduce an identical bill in the legislature. However, the decision not to do so when an ordinance is reserved for the President’s consideration is a step in consonance with the highest traditions of constitutional propriety. “Once the governor has expressed an opinion for seeking presidential assent, it is appropriate not to hurry up or make an overreach by presenting a bill in the assembly. Let the higher constitutional functionary take a view,” Aggarwal said. The law expert said the Supreme Court had held that an ordinance is also identical to a law passed by the legislature. The governor’s move to reserve the ordinance for the consideration of President is being seen as a setback for Dushyant, whose party had made a poll promise to implement the quota. Article 201 of the Constitution says that President can either declare that he assents to the proposed law or that he withholds the assent. The President can also direct the governor to return it to the House for reconsideration. Why was it reserved for President’s consideration The ordinance was reserved for the President’s consideration as its Section 23 gave it an overriding effect over other laws and it had the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana also was seemingly in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) that provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The Constitution does not provide a time limit for the President to assent to a bill or withhold it. Amended crime control bill without wiretap clause to be tabledFollowing objections by the Centre, the cabinet on Friday struck off provisions pertaining to phone interception in the Haryana Control of Organized Crime (HCOC) Bill, 2019, replacing it with an amended version. The state assembly had in 2019 passed the HCOC Bill. Subsequently, the governor had reserved it for the consideration of the President. However, the Centre raised objections regarding provisions pertaining to phone interception and its authorisation in the proposed law on the ground that such provisions already exist under the Indian Telegraph Act and the IT Act. Thus, the cabinet considered the proposal of home department to withdraw the 2019 bill and introduce it in the amended form in the next assembly session. Other decisionsHaryana cabinet on Friday approved amendments in the Teacher Transfer Policy, one of which states that after the transfer drive, the ‘newly married’ or ‘recently divorced’ female employees will be given preferred place of posting against vacancy upon request.Haryana government has also decided to exempt CTU buses plying in Panchkula on local routes from payment of Motor Vehicles Tax.It gave nod for draft of Haryana Water Resources Conservation (Management and Regulation) Authority Bill, 2020.Haryana government has decided to redesignate the ‘Department of Housing’ as ‘Department of Housing for All’, which will subsume various housing schemes currently undertaken by several departments.It has also given nod to reinstallation of toll point number 26 on Kala Amb-Sadhaura-Shahbad road up to March 31, 2022.The cabinet gave ex post facto approval for providing state government guarantee of ₹700 crore in favour of commercial banks for working capital facilities sanctioned to DHBVNL.It also approved an amendment in Haryana Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 2016, for the pay fixation/ pay protection on subsequent appointment from higher pay scale to lower pay scale.The cabinet gave its nod to creation of new directorate of MSME, which will be responsible for making policies, schemes for the overall development of such enterprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-cabinet-to-withdraw-ordinance-on-private-job-quota-today/story-7Mar8i3tbvii1BnWG0ZlvI.html

Two others showed up independently at a local precinct and reported being in contact with the suspect.The other detainees include the family -- father and his wife -- of a student who complained about the teacher, Ricard said. According to the prosecutor, the father was known to authorities because his half-sister joined the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia) in 2014.Reports emerged on Friday night of a French teacher getting beheaded in the outskirts of Paris. Police chased down and shot to death the main suspect, a Moscow-born Chechen teenager. The victim reportedly taught freedom of speech and showed caricatures depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad to his students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-authorities-confirm-9-people-detained-in-probe-into-killing-of-teacher/story-ItlNXB1CeNLIsQllLCS1nM.html

Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.theatres in New York City aren’t included, and counties must have a positivity rate below 2% on a 14-day average and have no “cluster zones.”Audiences will be restricted to 25% of capacity with a maximum of 50 people per screen, Cuomo said at his briefing. Masks will be required and there will be assigned seating to ensure social distancing.This week, the Global Cinema Federation sent an open letter to Cuomo urging him to let theatres reopen, saying Hollywood studios may continue delaying their remaining 2020 releases if theatres remain closed. The group asked Cuomo to adopt a county-by-county plan for theater openings based on virus data, similar what it said California Gov. Gavin Newsom has done.School suedState and county health officials filed a lawsuit Friday against an Orange County school that they said has remained open despite an order to close because of a spike in coronavirus cases.The Times Herald-Record reports the suit filed in state Supreme Court in Goshen names the Bnei Yoel school in Kiryas Joel, an Orthodox Jewish community. Earlier this month, Orange County health officials ordered schools in the area to close for two weeks.In the lawsuit, a deputy county health commissioner said he visited the school on two days recently and saw children not wearing masks and not observing social distancing.A phone message was left Saturday with the village’s administrator.Cuomo reinstated restrictions this month on businesses, houses of worship and schools in and near areas where coronavirus cases are spiking.The new rules, which include school and business shutdowns and limitations on gatherings, affect parts of Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, sections of Orange and Rockland counties outside the city, and an area within Binghamton in the Southern Tier.Some Jewish leaders have called the measures “blatantly anti-Semitic” for targeting Orthodox communities. On Friday, in a case brought by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, a federal judge upheld Cuomo’s order limiting worship to as few as 10 congregants in communities seeing spikes in coronavirus infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/movie-theatres-in-new-york-can-open-from-next-friday-with-limits-guv-cuomo/story-yMEEi6lrV8cHEn9z9RBmNJ.html
17-10-2020||World||Lock up the Bidens, lock up Hillary: Donald Trump tells supporters at Georgia rally||Donald Trump on Friday escalated his attack on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying he should be “locked up” for dubious allegations of corruption. The US president was speaking at an election rally in the state of Georgia.“Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary,” Trump told his supporters at the rally in Macon, Georgia, seeking to tie Biden to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic challenger he beat in 2016.Biden leads Trump narrowly in the state that has firmly been Republican and has not voted for a Democrat since 1992.Biden, meanwhile, kept the focus of his attacks on the US president’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a rally in Michigan, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2016, Biden said the Republican incumbent had “gone around the bend” for repeatedly claiming the US had “turned the corner” on the outbreak.With less than three weeks left for the close of polling on November 3 - more than 25 million people have already voted through mail or in person - Trump was trailing Biden by 9 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and 10.6 points in the FiveThirtyEight weightage of polls.The US president has been desperately trying to shift the focus of the election from his handling of the pandemic to his Democratic rival, questioning his age, his mental health status, and using a dubious news story - which is being investigated by the FBI as a possible Russian misinformation ploy - to allege corruption by Biden.Earlier on Friday, in Fort Myers, Florida, Trump sought to reach out to the elderly people - a key support base that felt alienated by his handling of the pandemic. “We are rounding the turn. I say that all the time. Some of the media doesn’t like hearing it. But I say it all the time, we’re rounding that turn.”Biden, who has questioned Trump’s claims in the past, slammed him at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. “He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like a miracle,” Biden said. “As my grandfather Finnegan might say if he were here... he’s gone around the bend. Turned the corner - my lord! It’s not disappearing. In fact, it’s on the rise again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lock-up-the-bidens-lock-up-hillary-donald-trump-tells-supporters-at-georgia-rally/story-zsmwKxoFdThjUogRNmjEMK.html
17-10-2020||World||Italy governor eyeing Covid-19 surge blasts ‘idiotic’ Halloween||Americans may love Naples for its most famous export, pizza. But the governor of Italy’s southern region had choice words for the exported American holiday of Halloween as Naples buckles under surging coronavirus infections.Campania Gov. Vincenzo De Luca blasted the holiday as a “stupid American extravagance” and a “monument to imbecility” in announcing a 10 p.m. curfew in Naples and the surrounding region over Halloween weekend.De Luca has blamed “irresponsible” young people for Campania’s surge in infections, and this week closed schools for in-person learning for two weeks.His bah-humbug to Halloween was in keeping with that tough line. While Italy has long celebrated the religious holidays of All Saints and All Souls, Halloween has only taken off in the last generation, most strongly in the Italian south.Campania was largely spared the first wave of Covid-19, but the region is now one of the worst-hit in Italy and is reaching a critical stage given it has far fewer hospital beds, intensive care units and medical personnel than other regions of a similar size.De Luca won praise — and another term in office — for taking a tough line to keep infections down during Italy’s initial outbreak. But his decision to shift all learning online prompted criticism from the education minister and protests from parents.His Halloween rant sparked some ridicule on social media Saturday with the hashtag #allouin, which is how “Halloween” is sometimes written in Italian.The rant was included in one of De Luca’s Facebook videos on Covid-19, which feature his colorful language and obvious frustration that Neapolitans are flouting social-distancing rules and mask mandates.“How can you be so irresponsible?” he demanded Friday of students who wear their masks around their chins rather than over their noses.Corriere della Sera, in parsing De Luca’s latest video, noted that the veteran of Italy’s center-left is in a tough spot given Campania’s hospital capacity cannot handle any more serious infections. But commentator Fabrizio Roncone criticized the governor’s seemingly dictatorial bent, saying he’s treating residents like “subjects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-governor-eyeing-covid-19-surge-blasts-idiotic-halloween/story-aImtjKigDwM36R3ogdQG6I.html

17-10-2020||World||New coronavirus restrictions in Europe; Merkel warns of hard days||Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to come together like they did in the spring to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the country posted another daily record of new cases Saturday.“Difficult months are ahead of us,” she said in her weekly video podcast. “How winter will be, how our Christmas will be, that will all be decided in these coming days and weeks, and it will be decided by our behavior.”Meanwhile, new restrictions went into effect in several other European nations in an effort to staunch the resurgence of the pandemic.In Paris and eight other French cities, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other establishments were being forced to close no later than 9 p.m. to try to reduce contact among people. The country was deploying 12,000 extra police officers to enforce the new rules.Many restaurant owners have bristled at the order. An earlier months-long lockdown devastated the sector.“I have the right to question the government’s approach, I think it’s a catastrophic measure for the industry,” said Xavier Denamur, who owns Les Philosophes and several other bistros in Paris’s chic Le Marais district, saying that if nothing else, the curfew should be 11 p.m.“At least that would not destroy us,” he said. “There’s no evidence that this difference of a couple of hours will have any effect on the virus circulating.”In Britain, a three-tier regional approach to battle the pandemic introduced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson went into effect, with each level bringing progressively tighter restrictions.On Saturday, tier-2 cities like London and York were subject to a ban on socializing with people from other households indoors, while the county of Lancashire joined Liverpool in tier 3 with the tightest restrictions.Among other things, that means pubs have been forced to close and socializing with others is banned even in many outdoor settings.In Northern Ireland a lockdown lasting four weeks came into force Friday. All pubs and restaurants must close except for takeaway services, and schools will close for two weeks for an extended half-term holiday.Data from Friday showed that a further 136 people died in the U.K. within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total official toll to 43,429.The World Health Organization has warned that intensive care units in a number of European cities could reach maximum capacity in the coming weeks if the number of infections doesn’t slow.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg joined the list of top politicians who have tested positive for the virus, and was quarantined though he showed no symptoms, his office told Austria’s APA news agency.The Vatican, meanwhile, said someone who lives in the same hotel as Pope Francis tested positive for the virus, adding to the 11 cases of Covid-19 among the Swiss Guards who protect him.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the country’s head of state, was quarantined after a bodyguard was infected, his office said. A first test came out negative.Germany, which was widely lauded for rapidly slowing the spread of the virus when the pandemic first broke out, has seen rapidly climbing numbers in recent days.On Saturday, the country’s disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 7,830 cases overnight, a new record.Like most countries, Germany has been grappling with how to keep schools and businesses open while trying to prevent people from coming into close contact with one another.Germany has registered a total of 356,387 coronavirus cases and a relatively low 9,767 deaths.Merkel urged Germans to avoid unnecessary travel, cancel parties and remain at home whenever possible.“What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic?” she asked. “It was that we stood together and obeyed the rules out of consideration and common sense. This is the most effective remedy we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever.”In the neighboring Czech Republic, the number of new infections surpassed 10,000 for the first time, surging to 11,105 on Friday, the Health Ministry said. The country has now registered a total of 160,112 cases, including 1,283 deaths.Despite new restrictive measures to slow the surge, Health Minister Roman Prymula said he still expects a rise in those testing positive for about two weeks.Next door, Slovakia said it was acquiring 13 million rapid antigen tests — enough to test each member of the population twice — and would establish 6,000 testing sites.Prime Minister Igor Matovic said testing will take place over the next two weekends, starting with the three or four hardest hit counties. It was not immediately clear whether tests would be mandatory.Italy’s northern Lombardy region, where the European outbreak began in late February, has taken new measures to contain rebounding infections, limiting bar service and alcohol sales, banning contact sports and closing bingo parlors.The regional government late Friday called for high schools to adopt hybrid schedules, with students alternating in-person with online learning.The measures were taken after Lombardy, Italy’s most populous region, once again became the most affected, adding more than 2,000 infections a day. Hospitals are coming under strain and intensive care units are filling up.The new measures allow only table service for bars from 6 p.m., ban takeout alcohol sales from that time and prohibit all consumption of booze in public spaces.Italy’s other hardest hit region, southern Campania, has taken similarly strict measures, including a shutdown of schools for two weeks. After parents protested, the regional governor backed off Friday and allowed daycare centers to remain open.In the capital, Rome, residents grumbled as cases climbed, fearing a return to the strict country-wide measures that were imposed when the virus was spreading out of control.“The situation is critical thanks to the morons, because I call them morons, who have not respected the rules,” said resident Mario Massenzi. “And if we fall back into the same situation as in March, we are finished.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-restrictions-in-europe-merkel-warns-of-hard-days/story-BR1WtHRVS5FlGEmA5n7wdO.html
17-10-2020||World||Transit shutdowns in Thailand fail to crush pro-democracy spirit||Pro-democracy activists in Thailand staged a fourth straight day of high-profile protests in the capital on Saturday, thwarting efforts by the authorities to stop them, including a shutdown of the city’s mass transit systems.Unlike protests a day earlier, which saw police using water cannons to keep the protesters at bay, Saturday’s demonstrations were peaceful, with no reports of any clashes by the time participants started heading home in the evening.The protesters are calling for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to leave office, the constitution to be amended to make it more democratic and the nation’s monarchy to undergo reform.All stations of Bangkok’s elevated Skytrain transit system were closed Saturday afternoon to try to keep protesters from gathering. The underground MRT system was also shut, and police blocked off several roads.Protesters met anyway as planned at the Skytrain stations, where they held small impromptu rallies, in effect establishing a temporary but active presence across the city.The organizers then issued a fresh advisory for followers to gather at three stations outside the city’s central area, where access was easier. Once that was announced, money was pooled by participants so they could take taxis to get around the transit shutdown.“Right now we can do nothing much,” said a 26-year-old hotel worker who asked to be called only Veronica. “What we can do right now is only show our power to let the outside see.”Several thousand people gathered in multiple locations, with some taking turns airing their views over a megaphone. By the evening, police had not disturbed them, even when some groups took to marching in the street. Protesters began dispersing at 8 p.m., the time organizers had said the protests would end.The protesters acted despite a state of emergency imposed by Prayuth on Thursday that makes them all subject to arrest.They also appeared not to be cowed by a crackdown on their rally in central Bangkok on Friday night, in which riot police backed up by water cannons cleared the streets in about an hour.No major injuries were reported from that confrontation. It was the first time in three months of sporadic protests that the authorities have employed such forceful tactics against the student-led movement.A 20-year-old student who used the name Ryo said Friday night’s events had hardened his resistance.“I respect people’s political opinions, but after yesterday’s incident, I feel it was so harsh, perpetrating violence against unarmed people who had no weapons to fight back,” he said.Protective gear such as goggles was distributed Saturday at some venues.ALSO READ| ‘I’m not afraid’: Thai protesters defy ban on protest gatheringsFriday night’s violent dispersal led the People’s Party, the protesters’ umbrella organization, to declare in a statement that “the government and military have established themselves as the enemy of the people,” Most of the group’s top leaders have been arrested.The protesters have been doing their best to elude the authorities, using social media to assemble followers before police have time to block them. The government has announced plans to take legal action against Twitter and Facebook accounts that announce the protests, but fresh calls to action were posted Saturday.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The call by the protesters for reform of the monarchy has significantly raised the political temperature in Thailand, angering many older conservative Thais for whom any critical discussion of the royal family is tantamount to treason.King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key members of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.Prayuth’s declaration of a state of emergency said the measure was necessary because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”He was referring to an incident Wednesday that showed some members of a small crowd heckling a motorcade carrying Queen Suthida and Prince Dipangkorn as it slowly passed.On Friday, two activists were arrested under a law covering violence against the queen for their alleged part in the incident. They could face up to life in prison if convicted. They denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/transit-shutdowns-in-thailand-fail-to-crush-pro-democracy-spirit/story-vMzYX9qhzrgTnniKDYInAP.html

They are planning to scale up the trials and set up a nationwide network of secure air corridors to enable the drone delivery service to work safely across National Health Service sites.The hybrid drones — which have the rotors of a typical drone and the wings of a plane — can carry a maximum of 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) and fly about 60 miles (96 kilometers.)The drone project is among others set to share 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) of funding from the U.K. Space Agency and the European Space Agency to businesses developing space-based solutions for challenges created by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-drone-delivery-project-that-can-aid-healthcare-workers-against-covid-19-wins-uk-space-agency-s-support/story-ZhJX76ibCQuvQMgr8GHaQN.html
17-10-2020||World||Pope Francis removes Polish bishop accused of sex abuse cover-up||Pope Francis on Saturday permanently removed a Polish bishop who was kicked out of his diocese a few months ago pending a Vatican investigation into allegations he covered up cases of sexual abuse by his priests.The resignation of Edward Janiak as bishop of Kalisz suggests the Vatican was able to substantiate at least some elements of the accusations made in a documentary about sex abuse in Poland that has undermined the country’s influential Catholic hierarchy.Francis on Saturday accepted Janiak’s resignation and confirmed the archbishop of Lodz, Grzegorz Rys, as the diocese’s temporary administrator. At 68, Janiak is well below the normal retirement age of 75 for bishops.Francis in June had ordered Janiak to leave Kalisz and forbade him from having any influence on how the diocese is run pending the investigation.In May, the online documentary “Playing Hide and Seek” exposed two cases of pedophile priests that Janiak handled, first as an auxiliary bishop of Wroclaw and then as bishop of Kalisz, which he had headed since 2012.It featured court testimony about Janiak’s role in helping transfer one priest, subsequently convicted and defrocked, from Wroclaw to another diocese even after a criminal investigation had begun. The film also documented an alleged cover-up relating to another priest during Janiak’s time as Kalisz bishop.The film was the second on Polish clergy abuse to be made by brothers Tomasz and Marek Sekielski. Their first film last year, “Tell No One,” triggered a national reckoning in a country where there is no higher moral authority than the Catholic Church and its clergy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-removes-polish-bishop-accused-of-sex-abuse-cover-up/story-5rc6rkUN1G9eKDiiXR4hCN.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Saturday and warned concerted action was needed to prevent millions of people being pushed into poverty and hunger.The former Portuguese prime minister said far more could have been done if countries had worked together to combat the disease, which has killed more than one million people.“The Covid-19 pandemic is a major global challenge for the entire international community, for multilateralism and for me, as secretary-general of the United Nations,” Guterres told Portuguese news agency Lusa. “Unfortunately it is a test that, so far, the international community is failing.”He said that if coordinated measures were not taken, “a microscopic virus could push millions of people into poverty and hunger, with devastating economic effects in the years to come”.Guterres also criticised countries for a lack of unity in trying to solve other global challenges including the conflicts in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria.“It is a source of enormous frustration,” he said.More than 39 million people have been infected by Covid-19, according to a Reuters tally based on official disclosures.Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/divided-world-is-failing-covid-19-test-says-frustrated-un-chief/story-KKTr40hC9VGTzqVXNmkV9M.html
17-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Joe Biden or Donald Trump? These states could decide||With 17 days left for November 3, when the American voters will choose their next President between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, some states are emerging as more crucial than others because of the unpredictable pattern of their voting preferences. Here’s a look at seven swing states that will shape the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election: 1. Michigan: Traditionally, Michigan has been a Democrat stronghold because of the working class voters, a group that tends to vote for the Democrat Party but this changed in the 2016 Presidential election when Trump won Michigan by a small margin of 0.23%, with 47.50% of the total votes as opposed to Hilary Clinton who won 47.27%of the votes. A win in Michigan means 16 Electoral College votes for the candidates and in 2016 Donald Trump won Michigan with the narrowest margin of victory in Michigan’s presidential election history which was also the narrowest victory margin of any state in the 2016 election. 2. Wisconsin: Demographically, the rural and blue-collar white voters of Wisconsin play a major role in deciding who wins the state. The state accounts for 10 Electoral College votes and Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 by a narrow margin of 0.77%, with 47.22% of the total votes as opposed to 46.45% of Hillary Clinton. This made Trump the first Republican candidate to win the state since Ronald Reagan won in 1984. 3. Arizona: Arizona has traditionally been a Republican stronghold with 11 Electoral College votes. Donald Trump won Arizona in 2016 with a margin of 3.5 percent but this once Republican stronghold is now being considered a key swing state in this election as the absence of Republican stalwarts like Sen. John McCain has affected the dynamics of the state. The state also has an increasing Hispanic population, a group that leans towards the Democrat Party.    4. Georgia: Georgia contributes 16 Electoral College votes and has not picked a Democrat to be a President since 1992. In 2016,Trump won Georgia by 5.1% as Hillary Clinton received 45.35% of the votes. With its rapidly growing diverse population and Democrats like Stacey Abrams gaining nationwide popularity, Georgia is being regarded as a swing state for 2020.5. North Carolina: In 2016, Trump gained North Carolina’s 15 Electoral College votes with a 3.66% margin and 49.83 % of the total vote whereas Hillary Clinton got 46.17% of the votes. With a mix of rural, city and suburban voters,the importance of the state is reflected through Donald Trump’s frequent visits to the state.     6. Florida: With 29 Electoral College votes,Florida is the largest swing state in America and has always been so. The margin of victory in the state has been very low and Trump won in this state in 2016 with 49% of the total votes as opposed to Clinton’s 47.8%; only by 1.2 percentage points.  7. Pennsylvania: In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes which is less than 1 percentage point, the narrowest margin in a presidential election for the state in 176 years. With 20 electoral votes, the state is called the ‘Blue Wall state’ but Trump’s victory in 2016 has made Pennsylvania a battleground state for 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-joe-biden-or-donald-trump-these-states-could-decide/story-4Rf1C1KvZtzeB16sDqdqnN.html
17-10-2020||World||Paris beheading: Suspect in teacher’s attack in France was Chechen teen||A suspect shot dead by police after the gruesome beheading of a history teacher in an attack near Paris was an 18-year-old Chechen, officials said Saturday.France’s anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said that authorities investigating the horrific killing of Samuel Paty in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday have also arrested nine suspects, including the grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother of the attacker.Paty had discussed caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class, leading to threats and a complaint from a parent, police officials said. Islam prohibits images of the prophet, considering that they lead to idolatry. The officials could not be named because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations.The French anti-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive, the prosecutor’s office said.French leaders offered messages of sadness but also of hope in the hours after the drama.“We’ll pick ourselves up together, thanks to our spirit of solidarity,” said Laurent Brosse, mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, at a news conference Saturday.“We are all affected, all touched by this vile assassination,” said Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer in a video message.A police official said the suspect in Friday’s attack armed was shot dead about 600 meters (yards) from where Paty died. He was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun — which fires plastic pellets — and police opened fire after he failed to respond to orders to put down his arms, and acted in a threatening manner. The official also could not be named because of the ongoing investigations.French President Emmanuel Macron arrived quickly at the school on Friday night to denounce what he called an “Islamist terrorist attack.” He urged the nation to stand united against extremism.“One of our compatriots was murdered today because he taught ... the freedom of expression, the freedom to believe or not believe,” Macron said.The presidential Elysee Palace announced Saturday that there will be a national ceremony on a future date in homage to Paty, about whom few details have so far emerged.In a video posted recently on Twitter, a man describing himself as the father of a student claimed that Paty had shown an image of a naked man and told students it was “the prophet of the Muslims.”Before showing the images, the teacher asked Muslim children to raise their hand and leave the room because he planned to show something shocking, the man said. The AP has not been able to independently confirm these claims.“What was the message he wanted to send these children? What is this hate?” the man asked.Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus. Two wars in the 1990s triggered a wave of emigration, with many Chechens heading for western Europe. France has offered asylum to many Chechens since the Russian military waged war against Islamist separatists in Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s.France has seen occasional violence involving its Chechen community in recent months, believed linked to local criminal activity and score-settling.It is the second time in three weeks that terror has struck France linked to caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Last month, a young man from Pakistan was arrested after attacking two people with a meat cleaver outside the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.The weekly was the target of a deadly newsroom attack in 2015, and it republished caricatures of the prophet this month to underscore the right to freedom of information as a trial opened linked to that attack.Friday’s terror attack came as Macron’s government works on a bill to address Islamic radicals, who authorities claim are creating a parallel society outside the values of the French Republic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-beheading-suspect-in-teacher-s-attack-in-france-was-chechen-teen/story-dJWUD4l3ojVQgveYzgdHrI.html

At least three protesters in Hong Kong were sentenced for desecrating the Chinese flag last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-amended-law-threatens-criminal-action-against-those-who-insult-national-flag/story-1lcZKAqAQZR3xao0fH2SSO.html
17-10-2020||World||For Donald Trump, city where ‘bad things happen’ looms large||When President Donald Trump told the world that “bad things happen in Philadelphia,” it was, in part, a blunt assessment of his party’s struggles in the nation’s sixth-most populous city.For decades, Philadelphia has been the cornerstone of Democratic victories in the battleground state — producing Democratic margins so massive that winning statewide has been a longshot for most Republican presidential candidates.But it’s a longshot Trump pulled off in 2016 and is trying to repeat again. His debate stage disdain for the City of Brotherly Love — which quickly inspired memes and T-shirts — underscored his campaign’s months-long effort to fight the blue tide that starts in the city.That fight has involved court challenges and statehouse wrangling over mail-in voting and poll watching, efforts Democrats characterize as voter suppression.And it came as Trump openly declared, citing no evidence, that the only way he can lose Pennsylvania to former Vice President Joe Biden is through a massive fraud engineered by Democrats in the city of 1.6 million.But Trump can’t change the basic political math in the state: one in eight registered voters live in Philadelphia, a city that keeps delivering increasingly large Democratic margins, routinely provides one in five votes for Democratic presidential candidates and is spurring a leftward drift in the heavily populated suburbs around it.“Trump is right, ‘bad things happen in Philadelphia,’ especially for him,” Philadelphia’s Democratic Party chair, Bob Brady, said. “And bad things are going to happen for him in Philadelphia on Election Day.”Recent polls show Trump and Biden in a competitive race in Pennsylvania, or Biden ahead by single-digits in a state Trump won by just over 44,000 votes — less than a percentage point — in 2016.Trump’s victory was the first by a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, and it shocked Pennsylvania Democrats to the core.In Philadelphia, Biden’s campaign is putting a heavy emphasis on turning out Black and Latino voters and is bringing in former President Barack Obama to campaign there. Trump’s campaign is making its own appeal to Black and Latino voters and hoping for even better results with his white, working-class base.Brady predicted Philadelphia will carry the rest of Pennsylvania and produce a bigger margin of victory for Biden than the 475,000 it produced for Hillary Clinton in 2016. That gap was slightly smaller than the historic margins Obama had in 2008 and 2012.The Biden campaign has several “voter activation” centers around the city, not to mention Biden’s campaign headquarters.Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, opened offices in heavily Black west Philadelphia and in heavily white northeast Philadelphia.Thanks to a year-old state law that greatly expanded mail-in voting, people now have weeks to vote and turnout is brisk at newly opened election offices around the city where voters can fill out and cast ballots.That is giving hope to Philadelphia Democrats, after the city’s predominantly Black wards did not turn out as strongly in 2016 for Clinton as they did for Obama, including some that delivered 10% fewer votes.“The line went around the block,” state Rep. Chris Rabb, whose district is 70% Black, said of a newly opened election office there. “It was nothing that I’ve seen since 2008 and I’ve worked the polls for 16 years now.”In a city that is 42% Black, the belief that Trump has fueled a racist surge is widely held.Breaking up concrete on a contracting job at a west Philadelphia rowhouse this week, Dexter Ayres, a lifelong Democrat, said he already voted for Biden in hopes of improving how Black people are treated in America.Some of his friends are skeptical that voting will change anything. Ayres, who is Black, admitted that makes him wonder, “Wow, why did I vote?”“But then I look at it like: ‘Well, maybe my vote will make a difference,’” Ayres said. “I’m just praying and leaving it in God’s hands.”Sitting on her front porch in west Philadelphia this week, Latoya Ratcliff, a Democrat, said she will vote for Biden, and sees more enthusiasm in her neighborhood to vote out Trump than in 2016 to vote for Hillary Clinton.The defining issue for Ratcliff, who is Black, is racism.“They understand a little more about getting out and getting that vote out,” said Ratcliff, 39.In northeast Philadelphia, Trump saw unexpectedly strong support from an area with a reputation for being home to unionized building trades members, police officers and firefighters. Republicans say they now expect even stronger support for Trump there.“Back the Blue” yard signs and thin-blue-line flags are everywhere in some neighborhoods, the city’s police union endorsed Trump again and the city’s firefighters and paramedics union also endorsed him, breaking with its international association’s endorsement of Biden.Leaving his northeast Philadelphia home to go shopping recently, lifelong Democrat Joe Dowling said he will vote for Trump after backing Clinton four years ago. The issue that changed his mind, he said, has been the violence in the wake of George Floyd’s death and a backlash against police.“It’s out of control,” said Dowling, 60, who is white. “There’s no reason for anybody to disrespect the police.”Democrats acknowledge that they slipped in northeast Philadelphia in 2016 — the swing was about 11,000 voters from 2012.Still, the area snapped back for Democrats in 2018 and U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, who represents it in Congress, said he expects Biden to do better there than Clinton.He recalled a paper-shredding event his office last fall, attended by hundreds in the parking lot of the plumbers’ union office in northeast Philadelphia.“I was surprised by the animus toward Trump, people unsolicited saying, ‘Gotta get him out of there, he’s a disaster,’” said Boyle, a Democrat. “And it was different. I wasn’t hearing that a few years earlier.”Stephen Lomas, a long-time registered Republican who lives between two Trump supporters in northeast Philadelphia, said he will vote for Biden.Lomas, 84, who is white, said Trump and members of his administration “are tearing down our belief in the system. ... They’re out-and-out crooks. They’re almost traitors to our Constitution.”Besides mail-in voting, another thing that is different in this presidential election is a network of allied liberal issues and community groups in Philadelphia, organizers say, with a long-term focus on reaching people unlikely to vote in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods.Briheem Douglas, vice president of Unite Here Local 274, a union of casino, food service and hotel workers that supports Biden, said he is canvassing harder than ever before.Douglas, 36, tells a personal story to everyone he meets who isn’t planning to vote: He is caring for the infant child of his 21-year-old niece, Brianna, who died in September from the coronvavirus.“So I’m laser-focused on canvassing more than in 2016,” Douglas said.___Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

17-10-2020||World||British Covid-19 testing adviser calls for ‘circuit-breaker’ lockdown||A professor who has advised the British government on its Covid-19 testing programme said on Saturday a short nationwide lockdown was needed due to “eye-watering” levels of infection in parts of England.As a second wave of infections gathers pace, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has favoured local restrictions in areas where cases are surging - hoping to shield the economy by allowing the least-affected regions to remain open.Johnson reiterated on Friday his belief in a localised approach rather than a new, temporary national lockdown, even as half of the United Kingdom’s people live in places subject to enhanced Covid-19 restrictions..But John Bell, regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, said the current measures did not go far enough and called for a brief but strict national lockdown - known as a “circuit-breaker”.“I can see very little way of getting on top of this without some kind of a circuit-breaker, because the numbers are actually pretty eye-watering in some bits of the country and I think it’s going to be pretty hard to get on top of this just biting around the edges,” he told BBC radio.Bell said schools and universities might also have to close for a short period.“If in the end we have to take kids out for two weeks, calm it all down and then start, ideally embed it in a much more rigorous testing regime, then that’s maybe what we may have to do,” he added.On Friday, more data suggested that England was still seeing a sharp rise in cases. The Office for National Statistics’ Infection Survey said there had been 27,900 new cases per day on average in the latest week.On Tuesday, Britain’s opposition Labour Party called for a two- to three-week lockdown across England, though it wants schools to stay open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-covid-19-testing-adviser-calls-for-circuit-breaker-lockdown/story-yochm08xaVBocvqu1fFrpN.html
17-10-2020||World||Bangladesh-India flights to resume from October 28 through ‘air bubble’||Bangladesh is all set to resume flights to India from October 28 under ‘air bubble’ arrangement, after nearly eight months the communications were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to media reports on Saturday.Under a bilateral air bubble pact, airlines of both the countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions.Since July, India has established such bubbles with several countries, including the US, the UK, France and Germany. Three Bangladeshi carriers -- Biman Bangladeshi Airlines, US-Bangla Airlines and Novo Air -- would initially operate 28 flights a week, while five Indian airlines -- Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara and GoAir -- would operate 28 flights a week between the two countries, The Daily Star reported, quoting civil aviation and tourism ministry Senior Secretary Md Mohibul Haque. Of the three Bangladeshi carriers, Biman is scheduled to operate flights on Dhaka-Delhi and Dhaka-Kolkata routes, US-Bangla Airlines on Dhaka-Chennai and Novo Air on Dhaka-Kolkata route, the report said. The five Indian airlines are expected to operate flights on Dhaka-Delhi, Dhaka-Kolkata, Dhaka-Chennai and Dhaka-Mumbai routes. The decision to resume flights to India was made at an inter-ministerial meeting at the civil aviation and tourism ministry on Friday, the report said. The resumption of air communications will bring relief to many Bangladeshis who are waiting to travel to the neighbouring country for treatment, it said. According to a report in The Dhaka Tribune, from January 2018 to March 2019, at least 2,876,000 Bangladeshis visited India, and on average 10 per cent of them went for medical treatment. Initially, around 5,000 passengers from both the countries would be able to fly each week, the report quoted Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) Chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman as saying.There is no transit facility for the passengers to fly to a third country, he said, adding that the passengers would have to undergo Covid-19 testing before flying.On October 9, the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh announced resumption of online visa application services for Bangladeshi citizens.For now, visas will be provided in nine categories, including medical, business, employment, journalists and diplomats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-india-flights-to-resume-from-october-28-through-air-bubble/story-1VwrE0SKETweIBc6CMSw3N.html
17-10-2020||World||Jacinda Ardern wins New Zealand election in landmark victory, secures second term||Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern swept to an emphatic victory in New Zealand’s general election and said she would use her mandate to rebuild an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic and tackle social inequality.“Over the next three years there is much work to do,” she told supporters Saturday night in Auckland. “We will build back better from the Covid crisis. We have the mandate to accelerate our response and our recovery.”With 87% of the vote counted, Ardern’s Labour Party had 49% support -- heading to its biggest share of the vote since the 1930s -- after a huge swing to the left in many urban and provincial electorates. The opposition National Party slumped to 27%, its worst showing since 2002.Ardern, 40, has captured the hallowed center ground in New Zealand politics with a blend of empathetic leadership and skilled crisis management that has also won her fame abroad. Her successful handling of the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated those strengths, drowning out criticism that she hasn’t delivered on some key promises during her first term in office.Ardern said she would govern for all New Zealanders and declined to say whether she would invite the Green Party into her government until final results were in. The Greens had 7.6% of the vote.The landslide victory will give Ardern more scope to deliver the transformational government she promised when she came to power three years ago, particularly if the Greens push her to be more progressive on issues such as poverty and climate change. Still, she will be wary of alienating centrist voters with increased social spending at a time when debt is spiraling due to the government’s pandemic response.Voters are rewarding Ardern for crushing community transmission of Covid-19 while countries like the U.K., U.S. and even neighboring Australia are still battling to contain the virus.National in DisarrayMain opposition National Party leader Judith Collins conceded defeat in a speech earlier, saying she had spoken to Ardern to congratulate her.Collins, who struggled to gain traction against the wildly popular Ardern during the campaign, pointed to the economic challenges facing the nation as it recovers from the pandemic.“New Zealand is in for a tough economic ride and it is going to need better fiscal policy than we have so far seen,” she said.National has been in disarray, changing its leader twice this year and suffering a string of scandals that eroded its claim to be a stronger team than Labour and a better economic manager.By contrast, Ardern has been mobbed by crowds on the campaign trail in a repeat of the “Jacinda-mania” first seen in 2017.In the battle against Covid, Ardern was alone among her western peers in pursuing an explicit elimination strategy and imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world.The economy suffered its most severe contraction since the Great Depression, slumping 12.2% in the second quarter, but the lockdown wiped out community spread of the virus and restrictions were removed sooner than in many other countries. After more than 100 days without community transmission, an outbreak flared in largest city Auckland, but that was also quickly stamped out.New Zealand has now gone three weeks without any cases in the community, with all new infections limited to returned overseas travelers undergoing mandatory quarantine. The nation has recorded just 25 coronavirus deaths.The challenges ahead are enormous. The border remains closed to foreigners, crippling the key tourism industry, and unemployment is forecast to rise.Labour is pledging massive spending on infrastructure to boost the economy and has pledged to impose a higher tax rate on income over NZ$180,000 ($120,000) a year to raise more revenue. Ardern has ruled out implementing the wealth tax proposed by the Greens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacinda-ardern-marks-landmark-victory-wins-new-zealand-election/story-nkBEBLcjb9QywhCys5ShyO.html
17-10-2020||World||The IMF has a blueprint for helping the climate without hurting economic growth||In a year when Covid-19 has dominated the International Monetary Fund’s agenda, the organization’s quiet rethinking of climate change in its latest World Economic Outlook report didn’t make much of a splash outside the Twitter feeds of development economics wonks. While the rest of the climate and energy world was poring over a different WEO — the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook — the IMF’s comprehensive assessment of what the energy transition will mean for economies was relatively overlooked.For decades, the need to cut emissions has been dogged by questions that essentially boil down to: how much will it cost, and is it worth it? Unlike the IEA’s analysis, which excludes the impacts of climate change altogether, the IMF’s role requires it to grapple with the implications for economies of acting versus not acting on global warming. The standard models addressing these tend to have limitations — many of them ably critiqued by my fellow Bloomberg Green contributor Gernot Wagner — but the underlying assumption is often that cutting emissions means sacrificing growth.In its new report, the IMF takes a different tack, arguing that there is no trade-off between the two. It also goes further than a lot of climate economists by factoring in the so-called “co-benefits” from cutting emissions — the often neglected side effects, such as fewer deaths from air pollution, and reduced traffic.The IMF’s climate chapter models a package of policy measures that it says would enable the world to get to net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. In addition to a carbon price starting at a modest $6 to $10 per ton, the package includes 80% subsidies for renewable energy production, a swathe of green public investments, compensation for households, and a supportive fiscal approach — that is, being prepared to load up on debt for the next decade. The IMF points out, reasonably enough, that we seem to be in a low-for-long interest rate environment.Cleverly, the IMF tests its measures against those reductive cost/benefit models — both the old school modelling by William Nordhaus, which is notorious for downplaying the damage caused by climate change, and the newer methodology developed by Marshall Burke, Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel in 2015 that found up to a quarter of global GDP could be affected by 2100 if emissions aren’t cut. The IMF still concludes that its proposed measures are net beneficial throughout the rest of the century. Even using the model where climate action is most harmful to growth — Nordhaus’ — the IMF’s projections show only a slight drag on GDP from 2037 to 2050, before the longer term benefits kick in. Even this, the IMF authors say, would be negated by benefits from lower air pollution and reduced traffic.The IMF’s WEO chapter builds on other evidence  published this year that green measures are good for economic growth, particularly when it comes to recoveries. It also adds to the growing understanding among policy makers that climate change is far more risky than most models would have us believe. The Network for Greening the Financial System — a coalition of dozens of central banks and financial supervisors — noted last year that higher cost estimates were more “robust”, and that most attempts to model the cost of climate change leave out effects such as catastrophic events and sea level rise.The IMF’s new approach might herald a tipping point not just in the institution’s thinking about climate change, but the mainstream views of economics and policy making. The fund’s Fall 2012 World Economic Outlook included the argument that austerity measures might counteract growth, marking the crumbling of a prevailing orthodoxy that had long been advanced by the IMF itself.Still, the IMF has to figure out how to implement its new thinking. A Dutch think tank, Recourse, last week published analysis suggesting that the IMF’s Article IV country reports don’t take climate change seriously enough. Its detailed review of the reports on Indonesia, India, South Africa, the Philippines and Mozambique found that climate change was only identified as a macroeconomic risk for the last two. The IMF analysis, Recourse argued, seemed to downplay the risks of South Africa and Indonesia’s heavy reliance on export earnings from coal, and of Mozambique being on the cusp of becoming a big exporter of both coal and natural gas. The report cites numerous instances where seemingly neutral IMF recommendations in areas such as tax or infrastructure would effectively lock in more dependence on fossil fuels.High level models are well and good, but as the Recourse report demonstrates, the details of implementation are what matters. That probably isn’t lost on IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. “Macro decisions have micro consequences,” she told Bloomberg Economics’ Stephanie Flanders last month, in a wide-ranging interview that also highlighted a little-known fact about her background: her PhD was, it turns out, in environmental economics. Kate Mackenzie writes the Stranded Assets column for Bloomberg Green.

17-10-2020||World||Vaccines against Covid-19 may not need to be administered annually: WHO Official||Ekaterina Ivanova - Any safe and effective vaccine against Covid-19 may not need to be administered annually, unlike vaccines for influenza, Dr. Richard Mihigo, the program area manager for immunization and vaccine development at the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, told Sputnik in an interview.“It’s difficult to predict now for how long the effect of the vaccine will last. It’s true that for flu vaccines, most of the time we need to repeat it every year, depending on the different strains of the virus being seasonal for north, west, etc. For the coronavirus, we believe that it may not necessarily be the case,” Dr. Mihigo remarked.Citing the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials of several candidate vaccines in South Africa, as well as of therapeutic treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone, the WHO official said it was unclear how long it will take for conclusive results to be drawn from the tests.“Our role is to create an enabling environment in which these therapeutics, these vaccines can be tested. And then we observe what will be the outcome of such clinical trials. It’s very difficult to predict when [we will see] the outcome,” Dr. Mihigo said.Three vaccine producers - AstraZeneca, Johnson&Johnson, and Novavax - are currently conducting trials of candidate vaccines in South Africa, the WHO official outlined.“We do have a few clinical trials currently going on, mainly in South Africa ... The AstraZeneca trial started a couple of weeks ago. We have a Novavax vaccine that also started in South Africa and, most recently, the Johnson&Johnson vaccine that also started in South Africa. Other countries have also been approached - Kenya, Uganda - but clinical trials have not yet started there,” Dr. Mihigo said.Johnson&Johnson on Tuesday announced that clinical trials of their candidate vaccine against COVID-19 would be paused after one patient exhibited symptoms of an “unexplained” illness.AstraZeneca, which is producing its candidate vaccine in conjunction with the UK’s University of Oxford, was also forced to temporarily suspend its trials in early September after adverse side effects were seen in one patient.Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has said that Russian vaccines against Covid-19, which are based on the well-researched human adenovirus platform, may prove safer than using Western vaccines that are based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.The RDIF is producing the Sputnik V vaccine in conjunction with its developer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-against-covid-19-may-not-need-to-be-administered-annually-who-official/story-u814G6NXV4s9Wk25OdODoL.html
17-10-2020||World||New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern headed for landslide win and a second term||Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was headed for a landslide win and a second term in office Saturday in New Zealand’s general election.With more than half the votes counted, Ardern’s liberal Labour Party had nearly double the support of its main challenger, the conservative National Party.Labour was on the cusp of winning an outright majority in Parliament, something that hasn’t happened since New Zealand implemented a proportional voting system 24 years ago. Typically, parties must form alliances to govern, but this time Ardern and Labour may be able to go it alone.“It’s a landslide that looks like our vote is the best it has been since the 1940s,” said Labour Minister David Parker. “It’s a tremendous accolade first and foremost to the prime minister, but also to the wider Labour team and the Labour movement.”A record number of voters cast early ballots in the two weeks leading up to the election.On the campaign trail, Ardern was greeted like a rock star by people who crammed into malls and spilled onto streets to cheer her on and get selfies with her.Her popularity soared earlier this year after she led a successful effort to stamp out the coronavirus. There is currently no community spread of the virus in the nation of 5 million and people are no longer required to wear masks or social distance.Ardern, 40, won the top job after the 2017 election when Labour formed an alliance with two other parties. The following year, she became only the second world leader to give birth while in office.She became a role model for working mothers around the world, many of whom saw her as a counterpoint to President Donald Trump. And she was praised for her handling of last year’s attack on two Christchurch mosques, when a white supremacist gunned down 51 Muslim worshippers.She moved quickly to pass new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons.In late March this year, when only about 100 people had tested positive for COVID-19, Ardern and her health officials put New Zealand into a strict lockdown with a motto of “Go hard and go early.” She shut the borders and outlined an ambitious goal of eliminating the virus entirely rather than just trying to control its spread.With New Zealand having the advantage of being an isolated island nation, the strategy worked. The country eliminated community transmission for 102 days before a new cluster was discovered in August in Auckland. Ardern swiftly imposed a second lockdown in Auckland and the new outbreak faded away. The only new cases found recently have been among returning travelers, who are in quarantine.The Auckland outbreak also prompted Ardern to postpone the election by a month and helped increase the early voter turnout.The National Party’s leader, Judith Collins, is a former lawyer. She served as a minister when National was in power and prides herself on a blunt, no-nonsense approach, a contrast to Ardern’s empathetic style. Collins, 61, was promising sweeping tax cuts in response to the economic downturn caused by the virus.In the election, voters also had a say on two contentious social issues — whether to legalize marijuana and euthanasia. Polls taken before the election indicated the euthanasia referendum was likely to pass while the marijuana vote remained uncertain. The results of both referendums will be announced Oct. 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-s-jacinda-ardern-headed-for-landslide-win-and-a-second-term/story-5RlLkh9yU8Ca5c06tGzSeP.html
17-10-2020||World||‘Something close’ to genocide in China’s Xinjiang, says US security adviser||The US national security adviser said on Friday that China was perpetrating “something close to” a genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.“If not a genocide, something close to it going on in Xinjiang,” Robert O’Brien told an online event hosted by the Aspen Institute, while highlighting other Chinese crackdowns including one on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.The United States has denounced China’s treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses. It has not, though, so far termed Beijing’s actions genocide, a designation that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.O’Brien referred to seizures by US customs of “massive numbers” of hair products made with human hair from Xinjiang.“The Chinese are literally shaving the heads of Uighur women and making hair products and sending them to the United States,” he said.US Customs and Border Protection said in June it had detained a shipment originating in Xinjiang of hair products and accessories suspected of being forced-labor products made with human hair.In June, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled as “shocking” and “disturbing” reports that China was using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims in Xinjiang.He said last month Washington was considering the language it would use to describe what is happening in the region but added: “When the United States speaks about crimes against humanity or genocide ... we’ve got to be very careful and very precise because it carries an enormous weight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/something-close-to-genocide-in-china-s-xinjiang-says-us-security-adviser/story-YHUs3BSyIF3yE9H8FxlQCO.html
17-10-2020||World||In his speech, Nawaz Sharif takes on Imran Khan||Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday directly hit out at Imran Khan and the economic situation of the country as he addressed the first public rally of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) in Gujranwala city. Sharif addressed the rally of the newly-formed joint opposition alliance, which is being headed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of the Jamiat-Ulema Islam (F), virtually from London.“The smiling faces I left behind look gloomy today. Gujranwala has always loved Nawaz Sharif. I am talking to you after three years. Many things have changed in the last three years,” he told the audience. “If I was not removed from the premiership the country and the economy would have been in a much better condition today,” Sharif said during the rally, which many said was attended by thousands.From joblessness to the prices of gold and basic items such as medicines, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader attacked the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government on multiple fronts .”I heard that the cost of per tola gold has crossed 110k. Will someone tell me how will a poor person’s daughter get married? PTI government used to say that they will give 10 million jobs, but about 15 million people have gone unemployed in this government. They said they will give five million houses. Tell me, has anyone gotten a single home?” he asked.In the speech of the 70-year-old Sharif, who is in London since November last year after Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for four weeks for treatment, India also figured. During his time as prime minister, Sharif said, the government stood tall with the nuclear tests that it conducted in response to the tests carried out by India. “But we saw Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit us and talk to us,” he said. He was referring PM Modi’s trip to Pakistan in 2015.Also read | Imran Khan govt would ‘go home’ before January: Maryam NawazSharif also recalled former Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s comments in the visitors’ book at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. “What beautiful sentiments he expressed. Wasn’t that a better Pakistan?” he asked. “Some people have a desire that my voice doesn’t reach you but their conspiracies will fail,” he said.The three-time premier also attacked the Pakistan army, saying it “broke the country into two”. Sharif directly accused army chief General Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt General Faiz Hameed of rigging the elections and making fabricated cases of corruption against opposition leaders. “They have to be held accountable for their crimes.”Sharif, who is currently out on bail and is facing multiple corruption charges, also accused the military and the intelligence agency of being behind his ouster as premier and installing their “puppet government” by bringing Imran Khan into power. “Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa ended my government. He rigged 2018 elections and imposed incapable Imran Khan on the nation. Gen Bajwa is a direct culprit and he will have to give an answer to this,” he said.PML (N) vice-president Maryam Nawaz, also Sharif’s daughter, was also at the rally in Gujranwala and so was Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. Maryam Nawaz was muted on a live telecast when she started speaking against Gen Bajwa. The next PDM rally is scheduled to be held on Sunday in Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-his-speech-nawaz-sharif-takes-on-imran-khan-recalls-pm-modi-s-visit/story-054rS12usTvZD05fEPZZtN.html
17-10-2020||World||US retail sales blow expectations in September; dark clouds gathering||U.S. retail sales accelerated in September, rounding out a strong quarter of economic activity, but the recovery from the Covid-19 recession is at a crossroads as government money runs out and companies continue to layoff workers.New coronavirus cases are also surging across the country, which could lead to restrictions on businesses like restaurants, gyms and bars, and undercut consumer spending. The economy is already shifting into lower gear. Other data on Friday showed an unexpected drop in output at factories last month.“Although sales growth is strong, it will slow through the rest of this year and into next year,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “The slowing will be even larger if Congress does not pass another stimulus bill. Unemployment remains pervasive throughout the U.S. economy.”Retail sales jumped 1.9% last month as consumers bought motor vehicles and clothing, dined out and splashed out on hobbies. That followed an unrevised 0.6% increase in August.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.7% in September. Some said September’s surge was likely exaggerated by difficulties stripping seasonal fluctuations from the data after the shock caused by Covid-19. Unadjusted retail sales fell 2.8% after dropping 1.0% in August.Retail sales have bounced back above their February level, with the pandemic boosting demand for goods that complement life at home, including furniture and electronics. An aversion to public transportation has boosted motor vehicle purchases. Retail sales rose 5.4% on a year-on-year basis in September. They account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales increased 1.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.3% drop in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have dipped 0.1% in August.Economists have attributed the strength in retail sales to fiscal stimulus, especially a weekly subsidy paid to tens of millions of unemployed Americans. September’s robust sales reinforced expectations for record consumer spending and economic growth in the third quarter.Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate. That would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of Covid-19. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.U.S. stocks bounced from three straight days of losses on the retail sales data and Pfizer’s announcement that it could apply for emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate as early as November.BROAD SALES GAINS Last month, sales at auto dealerships surged 3.6%. Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 2.1%. Receipts at clothing stores jumped 11.0%.“Some of the gain may have reflected increased demand from back to school sales, but with most schools remote learning the reported strength seems dramatic and likely unsustainable,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.Even with September’s gains, sales at bars, restaurants and clothing stores remain well below their pre-pandemic levels. Purchases at electronics and appliance stores fell 1.6%. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.5%. Furniture store sales gained 0.5%. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 5.7%. These categories notched big year-on-year increases in September, which economists said showed the uneven impact of the recession.“It’s further evidence of how many top earners have managed to dodge the pandemic by working from home, while most lower- paid workers have been forced to choose between jobs putting them at risk, when they can find them, and unemployment,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.The White House and Congress are struggling to reach a deal on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed. The government reported on Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a two-month high last week.Last month’s jump in retail sales set consumer spending on a higher growth path heading into the fourth quarter, which will likely ensure that the economy continues to expand, though at a moderate pace. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been slashed to as low as a 3% rate from above a 10% pace. Some economists believe that historic savings could cushion consumer spending in the absence of more financial aid from the government. Others, however, caution that rising Covid-19 infections and job losses could encourage some consumers to hunker down and conserve savings.A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment edging up in early October. Consumers, however, worried about current economic conditions because of “slowing employment growth, the resurgence in Covid-19 infections and the absence of additional federal relief payments.”They were less enthusiastic about buying household appliances. The share who believed it was a good time to buy a car was the lowest in nine years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-retail-sales-blow-expectations-in-september-dark-clouds-gathering/story-my8NwbnLT6adV1NH806efP.html

Lock up Hillary,” Trump declared at a rally in Macon, Georgia, stoking the crowd that chanted “lock him up” in favor of the Democratic candidate’s imprisonment.“We’ve learned over the last couple of months: Joe Biden is a corrupt politician,” Trump said to his supporters, “and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise.”Trump frequently demanded that his 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, be incarcerated over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. It was believed to be the first time he has ever used that sort of attack against the Bidens.The FBI declined in 2016 to recommend charges against Clinton for sending a small number of classified emails through a private server at her New York home.Trailing behind Biden in most opinion polls with the election less than three weeks away, Trump has zeroed in on a New York Post report from earlier this week that highlights documents purporting to show the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and China.The Post article, citing unverified emails from a laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop, alleged that Hunter Biden introduced a Ukrainian businessman to his father, who has said he’s never talked with his son about his international business dealings. The emails provided no proof of a meeting. The businessman, according to the article, thanked Hunter Biden for “the opportunity to meet your father.”The Biden campaign said his calendars turned up no record that the former vice president ever met with the businessman.The laptop’s hard drive was given to Trump ally Steve Bannon, who gave it to Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert Costello. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump’s lawyer, gave it to the Post.“I have no response. Another smear campaign,” Biden said Friday when asked about the reports.The Washington Post reported Thursday that Trump was warned last year that Giuliani had become the target of Russian intelligence for an influence operation. Giuliani’s efforts to obtain disparaging information about the Bidens from Ukrainian officials contributed to Trump’s impeachment in the House of Representatives.Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet for a presidential debate in Nashville next Thursday, their final encounter of the 2020 campaign.During the rally, Trump raised the possibility of a loss to Biden, though making light of it.“I shouldn’t joke because you know what, running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me,” he said. “Could you imagine if I lose? My whole life, what am I going to do, I’m going to say, I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics. I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country, I don’t know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lock-up-the-bidens-donald-trump-says-at-georgia-campaign-rally/story-O2s1kaITetRcfbKJmfxqkK.html

Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don’t forget this,” Harris tweeted.Americans are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a historic economic crisis. Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don’t forget this.The Senate Judiciary Committee is currently conducting the confirmation hearings of Barrett whose nomination will ensure conservative majority in the US Supreme Court for decades to come. Barrett is a Republican favourite and Donald Trump picking her could not have come at a more convenient time as the US president faces a re-election at a time when Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is leading in the national polls.The nomination of Barrett will also help around a dozen Republicans who face tough re-elections in their own states as she is known for her stance against abortion and Obamacare.Barrett also faced tough questions from Harris on October 14 when the Democratic vice-presidential nominee asked her if she believed that climate change was real, whether smoking caused cancer and if she thought coronavirus is infectious. Barrett answered yes to the questions regarding coronavirus disease and cancer.Kamala Harris, according to Associated Press, asked Barrett, “Do you believe that climate change is happening and that it’s threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink?” Barrett answered, “...very contentious matter of public debate. I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially when that is politically controversial.”Amy Coney Barrett will admit that COVID-19 is infectious. She’ll admit that smoking causes cancer. But whether climate change is real? Apparently that’s up for debate.Democrats fear that Barrett’s nomination will challenge the progress made so far regarding abortion in the United States and will help repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Judiciary Committee will hold the voting on October 22 to nominate Barrett to the US Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-slams-republicans-for-rushing-barrett-s-nomination-instead-of-helping-covid-19-struck-us/story-WiARSLsSFImqoBuD6jFKtL.html

The citywide testing was ordered after 13 people were infected in China’s first locally transmitted cases in over two months.The source of the outbreak was traced to two dock workers who had tested positive for the virus in September but did not exhibit any symptoms at first. They had visited a hospital in Qingdao and were sent to a CAT scan room, which was not disinfected properly afterward and led to the infection of other patients, according to health officials.Health Commission Director Sui Zhenhua and Deng Kai, president of Qingdao’s thoracic hospital to which the cases have been linked, have been placed under investigation in connection with the outbreak.On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported 13 new imported cases. China has reported 4,634 deaths among 85,659 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/basically-eliminated-qingdao-mayor-on-community-transmission-risk-after-testing-11-mn-citizens/story-S6Tely25QcxBPNPrEPhyCL.html
17-10-2020||World||Georgia’s Republican senator mispronounces Kamala Harris’s name at a rally for Donald Trump, sparks outrage||Republican Senator David Perdue, who is seeking re-election from the state of Georgia, has sparked a storm after mispronouncing Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s first name during a speech at a rally for US President Donald Trump.“Kamala? Kamala? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever,” Perdue said at a campaign stop in Macon, Georgia, in a comment that is being seen by many as a deliberately racist ploy to denigrate Harris.It is unlikely that Perdue would have made the remark out of ignorance or by accident because he has served with Harris, a senator from California, for at least three years. Mispronouncing Harris’s name has become standard practice for Republicans in recent times in what is seen by many as an effort to belittle her by highlighting her heritage - she’s the daughter of an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father.President Trump has been seen as leading the effort to belittle Harris by mispronouncing her name even as his re-election campaign has sought to reach out to Indian-American voters by claiming close ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.After Perdue’s controversial remark, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff shot back in a tweet, writing, “My opponent, GOP Sen. David Perdue of anti-Semitic attack ad infamy, just mocked Sen. Harris’ name as ‘Kamala-mala-mala-whatever’ at a Trump rally.”He added, “Senator Perdue never would have done this to a male colleague. Or a white colleague. And everyone knows it.”Perdue’s comment was a reminder of a 2006 incident at a campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia. There was an outcry after George Allen, a Republican senator from Virginia, had reportedly referred to SR Sidarth, an Indian-origin Democrat shadowing his campaign, as “macaca”, which is a genus of monkey. Allen subsequently lost his seat. As a standard opposition practice, Sidarth had been filming Allen’s campaign event on behalf of rival Jim Webb’s campaign.John Burke, a spokesperson for Perdue, sought to play down the incident, tweeting, “Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris’s name, and he didn’t mean anything by it. He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing.”Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for White House hopeful Joe Biden’s campaign, replied to Burke, tweeting, “Yes, that’s why he articulated all of those things by saying, ‘Kamala-ma-la-ma-la’. How many staff refused to put this in their name before you debased yours? Christ, y’all are pathetic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-s-republican-senator-mispronounces-kamala-harris-s-name-at-a-rally-for-donald-trump-sparks-outrage/story-U1GfcDNCww7d21SG0wk90L.html
17-10-2020||World||Pro-Brexit electorates have tough questions for UK PM Johnson as Covid-19 cases rise||Celebrating his election victory at a hotel bar in Barrow-in-Furness, Simon Fell made a promise to supporters: as the northern English town’s new Conservative member of Parliament he’d make sure the leadership in London “listens to us.”Less than a year after ousting the Labour Party in one of its heartlands in December, Fell is concerned those voters aren’t being heard as the coronavirus rips through the country. “A lot of people explicitly said to me that they lent me their vote at the last election,” he said this week. “People quite rightly look around their town and think we’ve been left behind.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s strategy for dealing with surging infections with localized restrictions has sparked an insurrection in some northern regions and further divided the country. But crucially, it’s also complicated his relationship with the places that propelled him to power on the back of his promises to deliver Brexit and tackle economic inequality.Swathes of the north and Midlands, parts of the “red wall” of Labour strongholds than turned Tory blue in the election, are in lockdown. Many pubs and restaurants are shuttered and people are banned from visiting their relatives. Some areas have suffered tough restrictions for over two months, while London and the more affluent southeast of England have—until this week—escaped the sharp end of the pandemic.Many Tory MPs who were vital to Johnson’s electoral success complained on Twitter that they aren’t being kept in the loop on the latest measures.A group of Conservatives representing districts in and around the northern city of Manchester turned on health minister Helen Whately in a Zoom call on Thursday as she made the case for the area to be put in the highest of the UK’s three levels of restrictions. Two days earlier, Chris Green, the Conservative MP for neighboring Bolton, resigned as a ministerial aide and warned Johnson that “the cure is worse than the disease.” The backlash is a concern for Johnson. He scored the biggest Conservative win since the 1980s on a campaign to “level up” the country with investment in the poorer northern regions after taking the UK out of the European Union.Those places are now recording the biggest spikes in virus cases in a country that already has Europe’s highest death toll from Covid-19. Infection rates in the north are more than double the average for the rest of England. Unemployment is surging, while talks on a post-Brexit trade deal could go either way. Negotiations resume next week after Johnson said on Friday an agreement looks unlikely. One minister said it was a “nightmare” that the regions suffering the most—and requiring the tightest restrictions on business—were the same ones that gave the Tories a big majority. The key is to win back trust by delivering on investment, the minister said. “If we do that, we can recover. If we fail to do that, we’re toast.”Fell joined a group of Conservative MPs pushing to ensure Johnson sticks to his promises. Of the 5.5 million people who live in the most deprived areas of England, almost 60 percent of them live in the three northern regions.The government made a down payment on investment promises in the March budget, with extra billions for infrastructure projects. But the plans have been thrown into doubt by the vast cost of protecting an economy facing its worst year for three centuries.Debt is already above 100% of economic output, and is expected to keep rising rapidly unless the government raises taxes or cuts spending. Unemployment, meanwhile, could surpass 3 million people, levels not seen since the 1980s, with northern regions among the hardest hit.The growing anger is reflected in Conservatives who now seem more politically aligned with local Labour Party mayors when it comes to new measures to curb the virus, such as shutting the hospitality industry.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, vowed to fight plans for tighter controls, saying on Thursday the north wouldn’t be “forgotten and pushed aside.” He refused Johnson’s request to move to the highest level of pandemic curbs unless there’s more financial support. On Friday, Johnson warned he will have no choice but to impose the toughest available measures on Manchester unless Burnham backed down.One Tory MP representing a more affluent southern English district said his northern party colleagues already know they won’t last, and that makes them more rebellious. But they are also critical. As Jake Berry, who represents a district in Lancashire, put it: “We are literally the prime minister’s majority, so he needs to look after us.”Britain’s next general election isn’t due until May 2024, but the government faces an effective referendum on its coronavirus strategy in a series of local and mayoral votes next May.Polls show the Conservatives are now neck and neck with Labour, the worst showing since before Johnson became leader in July 2019. Scotland, whose leadership has also been critical of Johnson, also holds elections with the pro-independence nationalists on course to win big again.A scientist who sits on the government’s pandemic advisory committee said on Friday that the fragmentation of the country risks damaging public health. “Frankly, making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that’s a very dangerous route to go on,” Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust research charity, told the BBC. Johnson has time to turn it around because many voters who defected to his party want to have their decision vindicated, according to Deborah Mattinson, co-founder of consultancy Britain Thinks and author of “Beyond the Red Wall.” But her research showed people who voted Tory for the first time feel “they have been ignored and hard done by compared with other places,” she said. “There’s a sense of being picked on.”The task in heading up a coherent and effective response to Covid-19 is complex because of the sheer level of political devolution in the UK Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have long had their own parliament. But now the premier is also negotiating with a raft of metropolitan mayors across England, many of whom are Labour.Burnham in Manchester stood in a navy anorak on the steps of the city’s Central Library as he told the government he would not accept the region being forced into the toughest coronavirus restrictions. People clapped behind the TV cameras as he said Manchester and other northern cities were “being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy.”“The north is fed up of being pushed around,” Burnham said. “This is real—the north stands on the brink of being back where we were in the 1980s. But we won’t let that happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-brexit-electorates-have-tough-questions-for-uk-pm-johnson-as-covid-19-cases-rise/story-0xGMeDHFFRro68q097yZLJ.html

The suspected attacker was shot and killed by police.French President Emmanuel Macron denounced what he called an “Islamist terrorist attack” and urged the nation to stand united against extremism. The teacher had discussed caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class, authorities said.The French anti-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive, the prosecutor’s office said.Macron visited the school where the teacher worked in the town of Conflans-Saint-Honorine and met with staff after the slaying. An Associated Press reporter saw three ambulances arrive at the scene, and heavily armed police surrounding the area and police vans lining leafy nearby streets.“One of our compatriots was murdered today because he taught ... the freedom of expression, the freedom to believe or not believe,” Macron said.He said the attack shouldn’t divide France because that’s what the extremists want. “We must stand all together as citizens,” he said.The incident came as Macron’s government works on a bill to address Islamist radicals who authorities claim are creating a parallel society outside the values of the French Republic. France has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe with up to 5 million members, and Islam is the country’s No. 2 religion.The killing of the teacher occurred in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine while the fleeing suspect was killed by police in adjoining Eragny.A police official said the suspect, armed with a knife and an airsoft gun — which fires plastic pellets — was shot dead about 600 meters (yards) from where the male teacher was killed after he failed to respond to orders to put down his arms, and acted in a threatening manner.The teacher had received threats after opening a discussion “for a debate” about the caricatures about 10 days ago, the police official told The Associated Press. The parent of a student had filed a complaint against the teacher, another police official said, adding that the suspected killer did not have a child at the school.An ID card was found at the scene of the suspect, but police were verifying the identity, the police official said. French media reported that the suspect was an 18-year-old Chechen, born in Moscow. That information could not be immediately confirmed.France has seen occasional violence involving its Chechen community in recent months, in the Dijon region, the Mediterranean city of Nice, and the western town of Saint-Dizier, believed linked to local criminal activity.It was not known what link, if any, the attacker might have with the teacher or whether he had accomplices. Police were fanning out on searches of homes and potential family and friends of the man in question, French media reported — a “classic” scenario in a terrorism case, the police official said.The two officials could not be named because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations.“We didn’t see this coming,” Conflans resident Remi Tell, who as a child had attended the Bois D’Aulne middle school, said on CNews TV station. He described the town as peaceful.It was the second terrorism-related incident since the opening of an ongoing trial on the newsroom massacre in Jan. 2015 at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo after the publication of caricatures of the prophet of Islam.As the trial started, the paper republished caricatures of the prophet to underscore the right of freedom of expression. Quickly, a young man from Pakistan was arrested after stabbing two people with a meat cleaver outside the newspaper’s former offices. They did not suffer threatening injuries. The 18-year-old told police he was upset about the publication of the caricatures.In a video posted recently on social media, a man describing himself as a father at the school said the teacher who was slain had recently shown an offensive image of a man and told students it was “the prophet of the Muslims.” Before showing the images, the teacher asked Muslim children to leave the room because he planned to show something shocking, the man said.“What was the message he wanted to send these children? ... Why does a history teacher behave this way in front of 13-year-olds?” the man asked. He called on other angry parents to contact him, and relay the message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-teacher-beheading-murdered-because-he-taught-freedom-of-expression-says-french-pm-macron/story-gfEtkUOquuRFvc2uPJPEBJ.html
17-10-2020||World||Nawaz Sharif accuses Pakistan’s army chief of toppling his government||Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan’s former prime minister, told an election rally on Friday night that the country’s army chief, General Qamar Bajwa, was responsible for toppling his government and installing Imran Khan as prime minister.Addressing the first public rally of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the newly-formed joint opposition alliance, in Gujranwala via video link from London, Sharif accused army chief General Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt General Faiz Hameed of rigging elections, removing his government, muzzling the media, pressurising the judiciary, and victimising opposition politicians.Several opposition leaders attended the PDM’s opening rally. Much of Sharif’s speech was not covered by TV news channels due to a ban by the country’s broadcast regulator that disallowed the airing of speeches, statements and interviews of proclaimed offenders and absconders. But the ban didn’t stop thousands of people from attending the PDM’s rally. One estimate put the number of people attending it at around 20,000. “This is all your doing,” Sharif said, addressing Bajwa in his speech, adding, “I hold you responsible for all the mess you have created. We are seeing unemployment, unprecedented inflation. The ‘roti’ now costs ten rupees and medicine prices have reached new heights. People cannot afford to pay their electricity bills.” Sharif added, “Call me a traitor. Call me a rebel. Make me a convict. Label me a hijacker. Seize my properties. File false cases against me, but Nawaz Sharif will continue to speak for his people.”The former PM pointed out that dictators in Pakistan have repeatedly labelled politicians as traitors. “The army has accused most of those who fight for the constitution as traitors,” he said. Recalling the past, Sharif said that Fatima Jinnah, often referred to as one of the founders of the country, had also been accused of being anti-state, and that since then, the trend has continued. “Sheikh Mujib (Mujibur Rahman) was accused of being a traitor, and that led to the creation of Bangladesh. But the real traitor was General AAK Niazi, who surrendered shamelessly in Dhaka, but no one can calls him a traitor,” Sharif said.Sharif said that during his time as prime minister, the government stood tall with the nuclear tests that it conducted in response to the tests carried out by India. “But we saw Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit us and talk to us (in 2015)”, he added.Sharif told his audience that the comments of former Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the visitors’ book at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore must be read. “What beautiful sentiments he expressed,” recalled Sharif, adding, “Wasn’t that a better Pakistan?”Taking on the current PM, Sharif said that the source of the funding behind Khan’s property should be investigated. “We will investigate Imran Khan. We will investigate his sister Aleema Khan. We will investigate the dealings of General Asim Saleem Bajwa, who has made billions,” he said.Pakistan Muslim League (N) vice-president Maryam Nawaz arrived at the rally in Gujranwala at around 9pm, local time, followed by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.Most political analysts in the country believe the PDM’s opening rally, held in an open stadium in Gujranwala in biting cold, was a success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-accuses-pakistan-s-army-chief-of-toppling-his-government/story-iyB1l9dA5Z47ta2pq8XhvM.html

Former Vice President Joe Biden named Harris as his running mate in August, making her the first Black woman and first Asian American to join a major party’s presidential ticket.She has said her name should be pronounced “comma-la.”Perdue, who is in a closely fought battle for re-election to the senate against Democrat Jon Ossoff, spoke ahead of Trump in the central Georgia city of Macon on Friday evening.Video of his speech shows Perdue repeatedly making exaggerated attempts to pronounce the name before saying, “I don’t know, whatever.” The crowd responds with laughter.David Perdue is just gross. He mispronounced @KamalaHarris' name just now warming up the stage for @realDonaldTrump to score race-baiting, cheap political cheers. pic.twitter.com/kiLmn8682AOssoff tweeted that Perdue would not have mocked a fellow senator who was male or white.John Burke, a spokesman for Perdue’s campaign, tweeted that the senator “simply mispronounced Senator Harris’ name, and he didn’t mean anything by it.”Republican incumbent Trump is trailing Biden in national opinion polls, but state polls show a close race in Georgia, a state that has become increasingly diverse and more Democratic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-senator-perdue-s-mocking-mispronunciation-of-kamala-harris-name-earns-him-flak/story-SM63GwuX8pdgugIpc5dxPL.html
17-10-2020||World||US to carry out first federal execution of a woman in seven decades||The US Justice Department said on Friday it has scheduled the first federal execution of a woman in almost 70 years, setting a Dec. 8 date to put to death Lisa Montgomery, convicted of a 2004 murder. Montgomery, who was found guilty of strangling a pregnant woman in Missouri, will be executed by lethal injection at US Penitentiary Terre Haute, Indiana, the department said in a statement. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who was put to death in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The justice department on Friday also scheduled a Dec. 10. execution for Brandon Bernard, who with his accomplices murdered two youth ministers in 1999. The two executions will be the eighth and ninth the federal government has carried out in 2020. The Trump administration ended an informal 17-year-hiatus in federal executions in July, after announcing last year that the Bureau of Prisons was switching to a new single-drug protocol for lethal injections, from a three-drug combination it last used in 2003.The new protocol revived long-running legal challenges to lethal injections. In August, a federal judge in Washington, DC ruled the Justice Department was violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in not seeking a doctor’s prescription to administer the highly regulated barbiturate.But an appeals court held the violation did not in itself amount to “irreparable harm” and allowed federal executions to proceed. In 2007, a US District Court for the Western District of Missouri sentenced Montgomery to death after finding her guilty of a federal kidnapping resulting in death.Her attorney, Kelley Henry, said that Montgomery deserves to live because she is mentally ill and suffered childhood abuse.“Lisa Montgomery has long accepted full responsibility for her crime, and she will never leave prison,” Henry said in a statement. “But her severe mental illness and the devastating impacts of her childhood trauma make executing her a profound injustice.”Bernard’s attorney, Robert Owen, said in a statement the federal government misled the jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, which in 2000 found Bernard guilty of murder. Its decision was tainted by false testimony, Owen said. “This evidence confirms that Mr. Bernard is simply not one of the ‘worst of the worst’ offenders for whom we reserve the death penalty, and that sparing his life would pose no risk to anyone,” Owen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-carry-out-first-federal-execution-of-a-woman-in-seven-decades/story-gJ78VU4JeP9tpd7lJMarJJ.html

17-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Donald Trump revels in division, chaos, says Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump “revels” in division and chaos, and he will do anything to distract people from his failures to deal with the Covid-19 situation, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has alleged.Speaking at a restricted election campaign event on Friday at Southfield in Michigan, a battleground state, Biden said the country is paying a heavy price for Trump’s policies on Covid-19.“Hate never goes away. It only hides. And if you give it oxygen, it grows. So we need to be clear: from the president on down in this country, there is no place for hate in America,” he said.“President Trump revels in division and chaos. He will do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and protect this nation,” Biden said.He is still living in a dream world and “keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear like a miracle”, the presidential candidate said.“But it’s (coronavirus) not disappearing. In fact, it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse. We all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives are being lost. Unemployment is way up,” Biden said.He said that across Michigan and the country, people are worried about making their next rent or mortgage payment, whether their health care will be ripped away in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, worried about school and their children.More than 215,000 dead because of Covid-19 and experts say “we will lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months”, he said.This is “because he refuses to follow science. Because he refuses to embrace wearing a mask. Because he refuses to practice social distancing”, Biden said.He alleged that as a consequence of Trump’s overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible actions, there are empty chairs around dinner tables.“But mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your health care,” Biden said.Trump, he alleged, is still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. “This isn’t hyperbole — this is real. As real as it gets,” Biden said.Reiterating that Trump will be the first president in modern US history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he began, Biden said he has a plan to bring the economy back.“An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs — over 7 million more jobs than the President’s economic plan, and USD 1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan,” he said. Biden assured that he is not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than USD 400,000 a year. “You won’t pay a penny more. But I’ll ask big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change,” he said. “Of Trumps’ more than USD2 trillion dollar tax cut, I’m going to roll back USD 1.5 trillion of his giveaways to the biggest companies and top one per cent. The money we raise will allow us to invest in working people and growing the middle class, and make sure everyone is included in the deal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-donald-trump-revels-in-division-chaos-says-joe-biden/story-mCisqSa6Loy6BumCVcLUyJ.html
17-10-2020||World||‘Blocking of URLs was wrong’: CEO Jack Dorsey on New York Post Biden story||Twitter was wrong to block weblinks to an unverified political story, CEO Jack Dorsey said on Friday, as the company responded to criticism over its handling of the story that had prompted cries of censorship from the right.“Straight blocking of URLs was wrong, and we updated our policy and enforcement to fix,” he tweeted. “Our goal is to attempt to add context, and now we have capabilities to do that.”Dorsey was weighing in after an executive at the social media company announced changes late Thursday to its policy on hacked content following an onslaught of criticism.Twitter will no longer remove hacked material unless it’s directly shared by hackers or those working with them, the company’s head of legal, policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde, said in a Twitter thread.And instead of blocking links from being shared, tweets will be labeled to provide context, Gadde said.“We want to address the concerns that there could be many unintended consequences to journalists, whistleblowers and others in ways that are contrary to Twitter’s purpose of serving the public conversation,” she said.Twitter and Facebook had moved quickly this week to limit the spread of the story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post, which cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son that were reportedly discovered by President Donald Trump’s allies. The story has not been confirmed by other publications.Twitter initially responded by banning users from sharing links to the article in tweets and direct messages because it violated the company’s policy prohibiting hacked content. But it didn’t alert users about why they couldn’t share the link until hours later.Dorsey had first tweeted that it was “unacceptable” the company hadn’t provided more context around its action. A little over 24 hours later, Gadde announced the company was making changes after receiving “significant feedback (from critical to supportive)” about how it enforced the policy.The company said the link to the New York Post story will still be blocked under a policy prohibiting sharing personal information. However, users were widely sharing the story on Friday and it wasn’t clear why they were able to do so.Facebook said it was “reducing” the story’s distribution on its platform while waiting for third-party fact-checkers to verify it, something it regularly does with material that’s not banned outright from its service, though it risks spreading lies or causing harm in other ways.Trump is now incorporating Twitter’s action into his campaign rallies, pleading with his supporters to send a message on Election Day to what he described as “censors.”“We’re not just running against Joe Biden. We’re running against left-wing media and we’re running against big tech,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blocking-of-urls-was-wrong-ceo-jack-dorsey-on-new-york-post-biden-story/story-a0kRlYshIQu3quTBzgwVlN.html
17-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Barack Obama to campaign for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris||Former US president Barack Obama will campaign for Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden in Pennsylvania next week, the Biden campaign has said. Biden, 77, was the vice president during Obama’s two terms. While Obama has endorsed Biden and his running mate and India-origin Senator Kamala Harris by making online campaigns for them, this would be the first time that the 59-year-old former president would be campaigning in person.Four years after he left the presidency, Obama because of his oratory skills, still remains the biggest crowd puller for the opposition Democratic party.“On Wednesday, October 21, (former) president Obama will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to campaign on behalf of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” the Biden campaign said in a statement on Friday afternoon. No other details were immediately available. Biden, as per the latest opinion polls, leads against Republican incumbent President Donald Trump by over nine points on an average. However, there are signs that the polls are tightening, especially after Trump resumed his rallies after recovering from Covid-19. He has been attracting thousands of supporters to his election rallies in the battleground states. Obama is the only Democratic leader who can attract a big crowd in his election rallies. His jumping into the campaign, with a little over a fortnight left for the presidential elections, is likely to motivate and encourage Black Americans and fence sitters to come out and vote, Biden strategists believe. A day earlier, the Democratic National Committee released a new ad featuring Obama, “The 2020 Election Is Already Here.” It highlights the stakes of this election, the importance of Americans voting now to make their voices heard and how they can find all the information they need to make their plan to vote. “Millions of Americans are already voting, make sure you stand up and join them,” Obama said in the ad. “There will always be reasons to think your vote doesn’t matter -- that’s not new. What is new is a growing movement for justice, equality and progress on so many issues. This really is a tipping point, and that momentum only continues if we win this election. But it’s gonna be close. It could come down to a handful of voters just like you. So I’m asking you to bring this thing home. Leave no doubt. Vote early,” he said. The ad is being run in all the battleground States through digital platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Hulu, and YouTube. During the Democratic National Convention this summer, Obama had launched a blistering attack against Trump. “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” he said in August. “And the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-barack-obama-to-campaign-for-joe-biden-and-kamala-harris/story-OCCxS8yFP8ljjsulmP1DuM.html

French media have identified him as Samuel Paty.The teacher had asked pupils who were Muslim to raise their hands and invited them to leave, advising them he would be showing a caricature of Mohammad that might cause offence, said Chaouadi.For Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.Chaouadi said his son, a Muslim, interpreted the teacher’s actions as done out of kindness and respect for their faith.“He did it to protect the children, not to shock them,” said Chaouadi.Some parents took offence, however. Two or three days later, they held a meeting at the school with the teacher, school principal, and an official from the education authority.“It went well. There was no shouting or talking over each other. My wife took part in it. She said it was a man who made a mistake, it happens to everyone,” Chaouadi added.One man who said his daughter was in the class gave a similar account of the lesson in a video recorded around the time of the meeting. However, he branded the history teacher a thug, and posted the video on social media. The post was shared by a Paris mosque, among others.Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate the video.In the video, the man says: “If you want to join forces and say ‘stop, don’t touch our children, then send me a message.’“This thug should not remain in the national education system, should no longer teach our children. He should go educate himself,” he continues in the recording.The school, the College du Bois d’Aulne in the middle-class suburb of Conflans-Saint-Honorine, could not immediately be reached for comment.It was unclear whether the attacker, who was shot dead by police and has not been named, had seen the video.Lawmakers and teachers’ unions hailed the slain teacher’s courage for confronting challenging taboos in French society. Freedom of expression was a core tenet of democracy, they said.Jean-Remi Girard, president of the National Union of School Teachers, told BFM TV that children needed to understand that blasphemy can shock, but is legal.Blood has been spilled before in France over satire targeting Islam. Islamist militants killed 12 in a gun rampage in the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015 after it published a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.Local centre-right lawmaker Antoine Savignat said, “If we cannot talk about the Charlie Hebdo caricatures in school, we end up in denialism... In France, the country of freedom of expression, this cannot be allowed to happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-teacher-murder-blasphemy-can-shock-but-is-legal-says-head-of-teacher-s-union/story-0VyPvS3b2DjXdhiGsl3pTM.html

You look at what he has done--it is the political class that enriches itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country,” Trump said at the re-election campaign here.“It’s a corrupt family and these people (during Thursday’s town hall in Philadelphia) did not ask him one single question about it. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden has shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders,” he added.Trump called Biden a “servant of the wealthy globalist who got rich bleeding our country dry”. The Republican candidate also attacked Biden’s son Hunter for making a “deal with a Chinese business magnet” for USD 10 million per year further adding that these deals were made “at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal our jobs.”Trump said, “IF Biden won, China would own the United States,” adding that the Bidens “got rich while America got robbed.” The US President said he “wasn’t only running against Joe Biden, but also against left-wing media and big tech.”“We are running against the left-wing media and we are running against big tech. They (the big-tech companies) were against us four years ago. Now they have gone crazy and they are doing things, they wouldn’t do; they’re getting caught,” he added.The US Presidential elections are scheduled to take place on November 3.

On Friday, during a rally in Ocala, Florida, Trump said he thinks he’ll win Minnesota in November’s election because of the representative, who was born in Somalia.“She hates our country. She comes from a place that doesn’t even have a government, and then she comes here tells us how to run our country,” he told his audience.“Thank you very much, she’s a real -- she’s a wonderful -- she’s a wonderful person,” he added, sarcastically.“If you look at the House with Pelosi and these people, it’s like they hate Israel and they believe in Omar, who came in here and married her brother or something, came in illegally,” Trump said, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “Come on, come on Justice. Let’s go Justice, Department of Justice.”Omar arrived in the US at the age of 12 in 1995 as a refugee fleeing Somalia’s civil war, according to the Associated Press. She became a citizen five years later, at the age of 17. She was elected to Congress in 2018.She has forcefully denied rumors circulated by conservative media outlets that her second husband was her brother and that she married him to commit immigration fraud, calling the allegation “absurd and offensive” in a statement issued during her congressional campaign. She has said she is the youngest of seven children but declined to identify her siblings for a 2018 AP story.No evidence has emerged that she either married her brother or migrated to the US illegally. Trump has previously promoted the rumor himself, telling reporters in July 2019 that “I’m sure somebody would be looking at that.”Omar’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/married-her-brother-came-in-illegally-trump-targets-democrat-ilhan-omar-asks-justice-department-to-probe/story-E791VrGtX6g9uSmBK6BvqM.html
17-10-2020||World||Nobel Prize winner urges billionaires to save millions from famine||The head of the World Food Program, this year’s winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, again urged billionaires to donate just a few billion to save millions of lives, saying Friday the number of people “marching toward starvation” has jumped from 135 million to 270 million since the Covid-19 pandemic.“Humanity needs the help right now,” David Beasley said. “This is a one-time request. ... The world is at a crossroads, and we need from the billionaires to step up in a way they’ve never stepped up before.”The executive director of the UN food agency told a virtual UN press conference that the global wealth of some 2,200 billionaires rose by about $2 trillion between April and July as the pandemic raged. He was referring to a study by Swiss bank UBS and accounting firm PwC published last week which said the global wealth of billionaires climbed from $8 trillion at the start of April to $10.2 trillion in July.“I just need a few billion to save millions of lives and save humanity from one of the greatest catastrophes since World War II,” Beasley said. “It’s not too much to ask.”Asked for names of some of the billionaires he was targeting Beasley replied: “I don’t get to hang around with that crowd. I’m hanging around people who are starving to death.”He said WFP is “greatly concerned about 2021” because budgets weren’t calculated to take into account the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read| Global hunger rises for first time in decade: UN agenciesBeasley said wealthy countries put $17 trillion into economic stimulus packages for their citizens to tackle the coronavirus, and “that’s $17 trillion that isn’t going to be available for 2021.”This year, he said, many governments reached deeper into their pockets while they could and gave the UN and its agencies more money, but the governments are now “tapped out.”Beasley said debts for middle- and low-income countries were put on hold or deferred until January 2021, and “that’s $8 trillion worth of debt services” coming due. In addition, remittances from overseas workers to families in developing countries have fallen, and lockdowns are adding to deteriorating economies.“It is an appalling situation,” he said.Beasley said that’s why a one-time infusion of cash from the billionaires is so essential for 2021.He said the humanitarian crises in the world are worsening, with Yemen “the worst of the worst of the worst,” Africa’s Sahel region “undoubtedly one of the worst,” Congo “just horrific” and Syria “deteriorating.” He said many other countries are also deteriorating including Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia.Beasley got Covid-19 in March and has resumed traveling, including to Niger in the Sahel where he was last week when the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Program stunned and delighted staff and the broader United Nations family.The WFP chief said he went to the Sahel because “nobody is bringing to the world the calamities that are developing in a catastrophic way, and this is a time we’ve all got to come together.”“So all hands on deck,” Beasley said. “If we don’t get the support we need, you literally can be looking at famine in several dozen countries. But if we get the support we need we’ll avert famine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-winner-urges-billionaires-to-save-millions-from-famine/story-sxuRji4NCzDtVrvD827vlI.html
17-10-2020||World||Justices to weigh Donald Trump’s census plan to exclude non-citizens||The Supreme Court agreed Friday to take up President Donald Trump’s policy, blocked by a lower court, to exclude people living in the US illegally from the census count that will be used to allocate seats in the House of Representatives.Never in US history have immigrants been excluded from the population count that determines how House seats, and by extension Electoral College votes, are divided among the states, a three-judge federal count said in September when it held Trump’s policy illegal.The justices put the case on a fast track, setting arguments for Nov. 30. A decision is expected by the end of the year or early in January, when Trump has to report census numbers to the House.Trump’s supreme court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, could take part in the case if, as seems likely, she is confirmed by then.Last year, the court by a 5-4 vote barred Trump from adding a census question asking people about their citizenship. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month, was part of that slim majority. Barrett would take Ginsburg’s seat.Trump left it to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, to figure out how many immigrants are not living legally in each state.Also Read: Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination: Judiciary panel sets October 22 for voteThe outcome of the census case could affect the distribution of political power for the next 10 years. The census also helps determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal funding annually.The administration told the court that the president retains “discretion to exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment based on their immigration status.”The American Civil Liberties Union, representing a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, said Trump’s violation of federal law is “not particularly close or complicated.”The Supreme Court separately allowed the administration to end the actual census count this week, blocking a court order that would have kept the count going until the end of the month.The court did not take action on two other administration appeals of controversial policies on asylum seekers and the border wall that also were ruled illegal by lower courts.Since early last year, the administration has made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for US court hearings, which has forced tens of thousands of people to return to Mexico.Known informally as “Remain in Mexico,” the policy became a key pillar of the administration’s response to a surge of asylum-seeking families from Central America at the southern border. It also drew criticism for having people wait in dangerous cities.The administration also is appealing a ruling that the administration can’t spend more than Congress authorized for border security. After Congress refused to give Trump all the money he wanted for the wall, he declared a national emergency at the border and Defense Department officials transferred billions of dollars to the project.Lower courts sided with states and environmental groups that challenged the transfer as a violation of the Constitution’s provision giving Congress the power to determine spending. A separate suit from members of Congress also is making its way to the court.The justices blocked the court rulings in both the asylum seekers and border wall cases, leaving the policies in effect. Arguments wouldn’t heard before next year and the issues would have much less significance if Joe Biden were to become president. He could rescind Trump’s policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, for example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justices-to-weigh-donald-trump-s-census-plan-to-exclude-non-citizens/story-I3mbr10luDvVum3eCoUWmN.html

In late June, China’s National Health Commission (NHC), under the Chinese vaccine management law, had allowed emergency vaccines to be used on people who are at a high risk of contracting the deadly virus, including medical workers, frontline pandemic control workers and customs workers – a move considered controversial by experts as the vaccines are still at a trail stage. Since July, China has administered such vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people under the programme.On September 25, a top Chinese health official said Beijing had gained the “understanding and support” from the World Health Organization (WHO) before starting the emergency use programme. In an emailed statement to HT the next day, the WHO said China’s decision to launch the programme was a domestic authorisation. “These are issued at the discretion of countries and not subject to WHO approval,” it said.Until late September, 11 Chinese Covid-19 vaccines had entered clinical trials, with four in phase 3 clinical trials.Last week, China announced it will join COVAX, an international initiative aimed at ensuring equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines, becoming the largest economy to support the initiative so far.The number of daily cases of Covid-19 in mainland China has fallen drastically from the peaks seen in February.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stands at over 85,500, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-vaccine-for-covid-offered-by-chinese-city-for-emergency-use-costs-60/story-u0FAbR5G4e91j4hBUgdyoO.html

The last round of talks was held in 2016.Turkey has also angered Cyprus with its decision to open the beachfront of the fenced-off suburb of Varosha in the divided island’s breakaway Turkish Cypriot north. At their summit in Brussels, leaders said the EU “underlines the importance of the status of Varosha and reiterates its full solidarity with Greece and Cyprus.”In the latest exchange of barbs, Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership, and Greece this week traded accusations about “provocations,” including plans to hold military drills in the Aegean Sea later this month to coincide with each other’s national public holiday.“I think that is very regrettable but also unnecessary -- we should work on the positive aspects of our agenda instead. We have an interest in being able to go down the road we had intended to with Turkey, because developing EU-Turkey relations further is in the interest of both sides,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.Tensions between the two NATO allies, neighbors and historic rivals flared over the summer and raised fears that open conflict might break out.Cyprus in particular has been pushing hard for the EU to impose sanctions on Turkey. But on Friday, the leaders said only that they would “remain seized of the matter” and assess developments at their next meeting on Dec. 10-11.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted that “Europe does not take decisions from one moment to the next. It is like an ocean liner which takes a slow turn. When it turns, it takes a course which is very stable in the new direction in which it has chosen.”“Τhe point where we will have to make decisions will be December. I still hope that we will not have to do so. But no one should doubt that Europe has the determination to do so if Turkey continues these actions. And measures will be painful, not symbolic,” he said.Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hami Aksoy accused the EU of being insincere and unconstructive instead of “encouraging a dialogue, reconciliation and an unconditional positive agenda.”“It should be known that the language of threats will have no effect on Turkey,” Aksoy said. “Instead of threatening Turkey, we expect the EU to present concrete and unbiased proposals that serve our common interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-leaders-hit-out-at-turkey-s-provocations-in-the-mediterranean/story-aYqjJXg3ogNV5QPv83SY4L.html
17-10-2020||India||‘Not an accident’: Odisha couple charred to death by nephews, nieces||A day after a middle-aged couple from western Odisha district of Jharsuguda was allegedly charred to death by a fire triggered by a coal-fired stove, the police said the couple was murdered by their nephews and nieces.On Friday morning, 40-year-old Geeta Das Panka caught fire while lighting a coal-fired stove inside her house in Rampur Punjabi Dhuda village under Brajarajnagar police station area of Jharsuguda district. Her husband, 45-year-old Giriwar Das Panka, who owned a paan shop, too was burnt to death while trying to save her. When the son of the deceased couple returned from tuition, he saw his parents burning and later informed the neighbours and relatives who reached the spot and informed the Brajrajnagar police.Though the police initially registered a case of unnatural death taking it to be an accident, subsequent investigations revealed that nephews and nieces of the couple had murdered them.Brajarajnagar sub-divisional police officer Dilip Das said the couple was first murdered by their nephews and nieces and then set on fire to make it look like an accident. “It was a case of pre-meditated murder. The five nephews and nieces of the deceased couple had killed them as they were unhappy over Giriwar allegedly cornering a huge chunk of the retirement benefits of their grandfather who worked in Mahanadi Coalfields Limited,” said Das.Police said the accused have been arrested and identified as Deepak Das Panka (28), Rahul Das Panka, Supriya Das Panka (25), Miran Das Panka (24), and Sunita Das Panka (27). They were forwarded to the court soon after their arrest.Also read: Nine killed, 32 injured in bus-SUV collision in Uttar Pradesh’s PilibhitOn Friday morning, after Giriwar’s son and daughter left for their tuition, their mother went to the toilet. When Giriwar returned home in the morning, the accused hit him with an iron rod and then attacked with an axe. The accused killed Gita in the same fashion. “The accused then poured kerosene over the dead bodies and set them afire to make it look like a case of accident. When their children returned, the accused pretended as if they had tried to save the couple,” said Jharsuguda SP Rahul PR.According to the police, Giriwar Das’s father retired and most of his retirement benefits were allegedly cornered by him. “A day before the incident, the Giriwar’s nephews and nieces had requested him to give some money for the treatment of their ailing mother. Resentment was already brewing in the family over Giriwar enjoying their grandfather’s post-retirement benefits. The accused then decided to bump off the couple,” said Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-an-accident-odisha-couple-charred-to-death-by-nephews-nieces/story-cZU6Szh8TyK6iHD2WstQ1I.html
17-10-2020||India||In Telangana, sudden surge of water from Krishna River submerges Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Scheme||Sudden gushing of water from the Krishna River and from the backwaters of Srisailam Reservoir led to complete submergence of the pump house of the Mahatma Gandhi Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project at Yellur village of Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district on Friday evening. There were no casualties due to the incident, as all the engineering staff working in the pump house ran out, but there has been huge material loss to the project, officials said. State minister for agriculture S Niranjan Reddy who rushed to the project site late on Friday night said the accident occurred when the project engineers switched on the pumps to supply drinking water under the Mission Bhagiratha scheme. “The first motor of the pump house was switched on at 2.54 pm and the second one at 3.45pm for drinking water (Mission Bhagiratha) purposes. However, within three minutes, the flood water entered the pump house from the adjacent surge pool making a huge noise and within 20 minutes the entire pump house was submerged,” he said. The minister, however, said the engineering staff of the pump house immediately closed the surge pool gates and prevented more water from entering the pump house. They also initiated the dewatering process to pump the water from the submerged pump house. “We don’t know what exactly happened and the extent of damage unless we remove the entire water from the pump house. We shall take all measures and see that the pump house is restored within a month,” Reddy said. A project worker on the spot, who refused to be named, said the basement of the pump house had broken open suddenly with a deafening sound as the water from surge pool gushed into the pump house. “We were seven people on the spot and all of us rushed out,” he said. Due to the impact of the gushing water, the foundation bolts that fixed the motors to the basement also came off with a huge sound and within minutes the entire pump house got submerged, he said. Engineering-in-Chief of irrigation department Ch Muralidhar said the gushing of water from the surge pool into the pump house could be due to the failure of a discharging valve joint. Meanwhile, the police on Saturday arrested several Congress leaders including Pradesh Congress Committee working president and MP A Revanth Reddy, while they were on their way to Yellur village to inspect the submerged pump house of Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project. They were lodged at the Uppununthala police station before being released later in the evening. Police personnel were deployed in large numbers to prevent the Congress leaders and even media from going to the project. Speaking to reporters later, Revanth demanded a high level inquiry into the incident. He alleged that the accident at the Kalwakurthy lift scheme occurred due to blasting of rocks for a tunnel for the construction of the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy Lift Irrigation project a couple of kilometres away, much against the advice of irrigation experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-telangana-sudden-surge-of-water-from-krishna-river-submerges-kalwakurthy-lift-irrigation-scheme/story-kpeuH6ZkhLwXZ3S9fvZ5IO.html

I left home just after Class X to reach Delhi and get on with the real, big stage of acting. After all these years, I have come very close to traditional theatre and I want to continue working for it, in order to do my bit to save it from fading away,” said National School of Drama, alumnus Vivek. He was last seen in the play ‘Zoon: A tale of Kashmir.’ Hailing from Bihar, Vivek played pivotal roles in Sanjay Dutt-starrer ‘Bhoomi’ and TV series ‘Surajya Sanhita’. “When I was offered these roles the perception of both directors was so amazing that instantly I wanted to be part of the projects. And thankfully, my characters were so meaningful that it made my choices worthwhile.”The young actor remembers when he did a crime thriller for Lucknow Doordarshan almost a decade back. “Yes, it was a show called ‘Satyamev Jayate’ and I had started getting a bit of work and this show was truly a memorable experience for a beginner,” he shared. Currently, Vivek is glad with the kind of response his latest release is garnering, “Written and directed by Gunveen Kaur and Robin Sikarwar, ‘376D’ is a hard-hitting film with the story revolving around the aftermaths of rape attempt. I’m portraying is Sanju, an ordinary man with whom everyone can easily relate. Though playing a common man is not an easy task.”His next project will be ‘Love at 5th Floor,’ a web-series which is currently being shown in a few international film festivals and will soon be released on an OTT platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/playing-a-common-man-is-not-an-easy-task/story-EjRVjopkOWul4K5M77SYOK.html

Had no idea at all that what I’ll be doing. But the minute I came in front of the camera, for some random reason, I was like…this is it! I have studied in British school were dance and drama was a part of our curriculum. Camera was just an extension to it,” Shreya said. Talking about her journey, Shreya shared, “A part of me always wanted to be an actor but it never occurred to me that someone like me, from a normal background, can join the industry. I also feel there are many who work extremely hard but still can’t make it — so luck too does matter.” Shreya’s father hails from Lucknow and Mathura. “My father was from aviation industry so I had a chance to live in seven different countries later, returned for my engineering. Since ‘Why Cheat India’ was my first project so everything about the film has been special for me. As the film was all shot in Lucknow that gave me lots of time to shop till I drop. I bought chikankari stuff and attar (perfume) from there.” Currently featuring in the series ‘Scam 1992’, Shreya plays a journalist. “The story is based on Harshad Mehta scam and I’m thrilled to play a pivotal role. I researched a lot but director Hansal Mehta asked me not to copy instead be real…hope I have done justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/need-luck-perseverance-to-make-it-in-the-industry/story-QbUIGAM9EzaeSUG6W3DzYL.html

The police have arrested four people including the main accused Mahibul Mollah, 50. He is a LPG dealer in the locality. A senior officer of Kashipur police station said that Mollah had accused the woman’s husband Ali Hossain of stealing money. An argument followed and Mollah and his associates assaulted Hossain. “When Hossain’s wife Sufia Bibi tried to intervene, she was also beaten up. Villagers rescued the two and rushed them to a local hospital from where they were referred to a state-run hospital in Kolkata. The woman was declared dead when she reached the hospital in Kolkata,” said the officer.

Hearing a writ petition filed by the rape survivor seeking the registration of a case against culprits, a division bench comprising Justice Shashi Kant Gupta and Justice Pankaj Bhatia observed that “the present petition highlights the laxity shown by the officers in triggering the criminal justice system”. “The sequence of the evidence on the basis of instructions received highlights the sheer callousness of the police authorities in lodging the FIR after about three months of the alleged incident that too only after this court had intervened and had called for instructions,” the court said. “It is well settled that the information disclosing a cognizable offence should be initiated with all expedition, the same is also necessary so as to bring the prosecution to its logical conclusion fairly,” it said. The Allahabad HC, in an order passed on Thursday said, “In the present case, the laxity, which has been done at the behest of the police authorities, has not been explained at all.” The court said there is no explanation as to why so much time was taken for lodging the FIR and for proceeding in accordance with the complaint made by the petitioner for such a long time. It said there is nothing on record as to what action was taken by the senior superintendent of police (SSP) except merely forwarding the application of the petitioner before the station house officer. “On a prima facie consideration, this court is of the view that on account of the laxity of the police officials, the prosecution may be seriously affected, the action taken by the SHO the form of lodging of the FIR on October 13, 2020 and the subsequent medico legal examination of the petitioner on October 14, 2020, are prima facie a hogwash,” the order said. “Considering the facts, which prima facie disclose the laxity on the part of the police authorities, this court is of the view that the matter needs to be taken seriously,” it said. The petitioner has alleged that she was raped by four people on July 11, 2020 and she lodged a complaint but an FIR was not registered in the matter. Thereafter, the petitioner claims to have submitted an application before the SSP on July 22, highlighting that despite her best efforts, the case was not being registered. She again filed an application on July 23 informing the SSP that the case was still not filed. Ultimately, the petitioner approached the court. The state counsel informed the court that a complaint dated July 23 was forwarded by the petitioner to the SSP. The complaint was then forwarded by the SSP to the Phoolpur police station for further action. The FIR was finally registered at Phoolpur police station on October 13 under relevant sections of the IPC.The woman’s statement was also recorded on October 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-hc-orders-ssp-sho-to-appear-before-court-for-3-month-delay-in-filing-fir-in-rape-case/story-NtcILxZE5LiMPNzS0jQGJN.html

17-10-2020||India||From PM Modi’s clarion call on vaccine to Sputnik V trial in India: Top developments||With three vaccine trials going on at present and the fourth one getting approval on Saturday, India’s quest for an effective Covid-19 vaccine is on the right track. The government has also started making logistical arrangement for the storage of vaccines — a crucial aspect in vaccine delivery. About 1 lakh refrigerators will be required to store vaccines, a report has said. The Centre has begun identifying both government and private facilities to create hubs for vaccine storage. Here are the top developments regarding India’s vaccine preparation1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has suggested an efficient mechanism like that of Indian elections — to distribute vaccines.2. Speedy delivery of vaccines, once approved, should be the focus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.3. The vaccine delivery system must be IT-enabled, the PM has said. 4. Catering to the population of the country is not enough. Bangladesh, Myanmar, Qatar and Bhutan have requested for clinical trials of Indian vaccines in their countries, PM Modi has said.5. The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has allowed Dr Reddy’s to conduct clinical trial of Russia’s Sputnik V. The vaccine — the first registered vaccine against Covid-19 in the world — was seen with doubt as its clinical trial was conducted on a small population.6. Bharat Biotech, which is developing an indigenous vaccine in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, is cutting the trial size of phase 2 so that it can move to phase 3. The results so far have been positive.7. Pune’s Serum Institute of India, which is conducting the phase 2 and phase 3 trials of Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, hopes to produce 60 to 70 million vaccine doses by December. By March, the vaccines are likely to hit the market after which the vaccine-maker will scale up the production.8. Meanwhile, the Centre has said that no major mutation was found in Covid-19 virus in India. There have been two pan-India researches, Centre has said.9. For the first time in September, the number of active Covid-19 cases in India dipped below 800,000 on Friday.10. However, the dip should not lead to complacency, experts and minister have warned, as a spike is apprehended in the upcoming festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-pm-modi-s-clarion-call-on-vaccine-to-sputnik-v-trial-in-india-top-developments/story-6GBdCa8qFGm23LYIihLDsK.html

Each of them will have to remain in contact with the health department and periodic testing will be conducted in these institutes, Sarma said.The government has no objection if the private schools want to continue with online classes, the minister said.Joining school will, however, be a voluntary exercise on the part of the students. Their guardians will take the decision on sending them to school or not, and the necessary attendance required will not be applicable this year, he said.The ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines of the ministry of home affairs have allowed the schools to reopen across the country after October 15 in a graded manner. The decision will, however, be taken by the state governments and the administration of the Union territories.Sarma said the Assam government will not issue any directive regarding the restarting of classes at the postgraduate level. The university executive council concerned will decide on it and the rules to be followed.The education minister said all government polytechnics and engineering institutions will have “normal face-to-face classes from November 2 but hostels will not reopen”.Those who are unable to attend classes due to lack of hostel facilities can continue with online classes and as such there will be a blend of classroom and online teaching, he said.Undergraduate classes will also begin from November 2 with each section having not more than 25 students. If the classes are held in halls, the number of students can be proportionately increased.For the first semester students, classes will be held twice a week on Monday and Thursday, for the third on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, for the fifth on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Classes will be held in two batches in the morning and afternoon.Results are yet to be announced for second and final semesters.As hostels will remain closed, undergraduate students will be allowed to enrol temporarily for a month in a college in their respective home towns and attend classes.The decision regarding reopening of hostels will be taken on December 1, he said.At the school level, classes will be held in two batches - from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm and the next from 1:30 pm to 4:30 pm with not more than 25 students in each section.Examinations will be held only for class eight which will be conducted by schools, while board examinations will be held for those in classes 10 and 12. Students of other classes will be promoted to the next higher class without any examination, Sarma said.The syllabus will be reduced by the State Council of Education, Research and Training and this will be notified within 15 days, the minister said.Students of lower primary schools in rural areas can go to institutions to get their midday meals and the teachers can engage with them in informal academic discussions, but no classes will be held, he said. The children are currently being provided with dry food and the school authorities can slowly move to cooked meals depending on the situation, the minister said. The decision to reopen residential schools will be taken in December, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/educational-institutions-in-assam-to-reopen-on-november-2/story-gZRZaJ8pmVvOyxyBdp7DMP.html

The time between December and March will be required for licensing, Dr Suresh Jadav, executive director of SII has said taking part at the India Vaccine Accessibility e-Summit HEAL-Thy Samvaad, organised by an NGO.Once it is released in the market, the world’s largest vaccine company by the number of doses produced will continue manufacturing more vaccines.At present, SII is conducting phase 2 and 3 trials of the vaccine. Reports said the vaccine maker wants to be more inclusive as far as the variety of participants is concerned. The pharma company wants to cover older individual and people with health conditions. Logistics preparation for Covid-19 vaccine is going on in full swing. The Centre had earlier asked states to prioritise populations who should receive the vaccine, once registered, first. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held back-to-back review meetings and asked government officials to ensure speedy delivery of vaccines. In a meeting on Saturday, PM Modi suggested taking help of election mechanism to ensure well-managed delivery of vaccines.The government is targetting to vaccinate approximately 25 crore people by July 2021. This will include the three vaccines which are presently under trial in India and also the ones that India will get under other agreements, like WHO’s COVAX, Dr Reddy’s agreement with Russia for Sputnik V etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-ready-by-december-in-market-by-march-serum-institute-reveals-covid-19-vaccine-planning/story-KWBryK3euM7dbWa06GYZfJ.html

But conditions apply||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said that gyms and fitness centres in the state will be allowed to restart operations after Dusshera but only if they strictly follow the Standard Operation Procedures (SOP). Going by this, the gyms which have been shut since March when the nationwide lockdown was announced to combat the spread of Covid-19 are likely to open from October 25.Maharashtra — with the highest Covid-19 cases in the country — is following a strict unlocking, separate from the other states. The Centre had allowed gyms and fitness centres to reopen across the country in the last phase of unlocking. But Maharashtra didn’t allow gyms to reopen. Cinema halls, religious places, swimming pools — which have been allowed to resume functioning elsewhere — are still closed in Maharashtra. Though gyms will be opened, activities like steam bath, sauna, Zumba and Yoga, which either involve group activities or water which can increase the possibility of infection, will remain suspended.The issue of what will be reopening has become a contentious one in the wake of mounting pressure to reopen temples in the state. Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari questioned Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s “secularism” as he is not allowing temples in the state to open. The Maharashtra government has recently allowed weekly markets, monorails, metro rails, business-to-business exhibitions to gradually start functioning. Monorails will start running from October 17 while Mumbai metro will start from October 19. The number of Mumbai locals has been increased from October 15. Women are also allowed to travel now in Mumbai local trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gyms-in-maharashtra-will-open-after-dusshera-but-conditions-apply/story-w7AghTEn6hQobefpv3HnwJ.html

We understand that’s a very complicated, very difficult issue. There have been many negotiations on this at different levels over a different period. That’s a very high bar for a relationship,” Jaishankar said.“I’m talking of a much more basic bar, which is [that] there must be peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the border areas and that has been the case since the late 1980s. If peace and tranquillity is deeply disturbed then, obviously, there will be an impact on the relationship and that is what we are seeing.”The standoff, currently in its sixth month, has taken India-China ties to a new low, with troops firing warning shots at friction points – the first time guns have been used along the LAC since 1975. The two sides have also been unable to push forward a disengagement and de-escalation process despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks.Also read: Pak role in Kashmir violence, terror and killings since 1947 to be highlighted on Oct 22Jaishankar said the “big question” in the current scenario was how two large and developing countries such as India and China could find equilibrium. India had sought to normalise “what was a very difficult relationship” by developing cooperation with China since the late 1980s “on the premise that there will be peace and tranquillity in the border areas”, he pointed out.Asked if India could learn from China’s rise, Jaishankar said there were basic differences in the governance, polity and society of the two countries. In recent years, India had depended on imports and failed to create support systems that would boost manufacturing and industrial activity, he said. India will have to expand small and medium enterprises and strengthen its industrial base, innovation and manufacturing, he said, adding that looking to the services sector to solve all problems “is a fantasy”.A turning point in the modern era was 2008, marked by the global financial crisis and the rise of China, India and ASEAN, which led to economic rebalancing, he said. This process took an even sharper turn in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which accelerated trendlines and led to greater multi-polarity, he said.India’s ability to “step up and assume global responsibility to do good” is a very important part of the country’s rise, Jaishankar said. It is also in India’s strategic interest to facilitate and partner in the rise of Africa. “If Africa becomes one of the poles of the global polity, it is better for us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-and-tranquillity-on-lac-deeply-disturbed-jaishankar/story-AN3jogLhtqc9Fg7Ii8OMVO.html

It was 239 on Friday and 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 when the AQI was 320.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Winds were blowing from the northwest, bringing pollutants from farm fires, according to an India Meteorological Department official.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count around Haryana, Punjab and its nearby regions across the International Border on Saturday was 882.“Since transport-level wind direction is favourable for intrusion, stubble contribution in PM2.5 is around 19 per cent on Saturday,” it said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed -- was 10,000 metre square per second on Saturday -- favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The impact of stubble burning on the national capital’s air quality is likely to “increase significantly” by Monday, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said.Punjab and Haryana have recorded more incidents of stubble burning this season so far compared to last year, largely due to early harvesting of paddy and unavailability of farm labour due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said on Saturday.According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 4,585 farm fires this season so far compared to 1,631 such incidents during the corresponding period last year.Haryana has also recorded an increase in farm fires -- from around 1,200 incidents till October 16 last year to 2,016 this year.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Friday said meteorological conditions in Delhi have been “extremely unfavourable” for dispersion of pollutants since this September as compared to last year.With less area under non-basmati paddy cultivation this time, CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava hoped the number of stubble burning incidents will be fewer this year compared to 2019.Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content and so farmers burn it.Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-air-quality-poor-share-of-stubble-burning-in-city-s-pollution-increases/story-KCTXhjzQtSxYBjdheexDWM.html

The state government claimed that the construction and community activities could deteriorate law and order.The restrictions have been imposed since October 16 until further orders, according to which, four or more people could not assemble in the village and the surrounding areas of Phuldungsei Zampi and Zomuantlang of Mizoram’s Mamit district. If anyone is found violating the order, they would be charged under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) that would imprison them for one month or fine them Rs. 200 or both. The imprisonment might be extended to six months if the violation of the order poses threat to law or human life, safety and health, the provision says. Mizoram’s Mamit district magistrate Dr Lalrozama, in the prohibitory order served on Friday, said that an organisation named SONGRONGMA planned to construct a Shiv temple at Thaidaw Ylang falling in the same district. Lalrozama said that the organisation did not have any permission from the Mizoram government for the construction. Lalrozama said the plan would go against the interest of the local community and could disturb peace and tranquility in the region. SONGRONGMA is a local indigenous organization in Tripura. “ . ..This has been planned without the permission of the Govt of Mizoram and is against the interest of the local community and could harm peace and tranquility in the region... it is necessary to prohibit people from assembling in groups to prevent any untoward incident which is likely to disrupt or adversely affect peace and tranquility prevailing in the region,” the notification read. “Phuldungsei village is disputed by Mizoram but it remains under Tripura’s administrative control. The Tripura government already discussed the matter with Mizoram,” said a higher administrative official on the condition of anonymity. Despite the eastern side of Phuldungsei village falling into Mizoram, the village, traditionally has been accepted as part of Tripura.Phuldungsei village has a population of around 600 residents. The village is located in Kanchanpur sub division in North district of Tripura.In August, Kanchanpur sub divisional magistrate Chandni Chandran informed her higher officials that 130 residents of the village, who have Tripura’s ration cards, were found in Mizoram’s voters’ list.Mizoram home secretary Lalbiaksangi wrote to Tripura home secretary BK Sahu on October 10 seeking stoppage of construction of the temple and all kinds of activities within the disputed interstate border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-govt-objects-to-temple-construction-at-disputed-border-with-tripura-imposes-prohibitory-orders/story-2YjzHvi3zkxA8huR2MSFzL.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting on the Covid-19 pandemic situation and vaccine delivery, distribution and administration.Earlier, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had said that the Indian Council of Medical Research has been conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus collected for several months over different time periods.Also Read: Potential Covid-19 vaccines not affected by recent mutations: StudyThe minister had said there was no significant or drastic mutation in the strains. Reports said about 12,000 mutations have been documented in over 3.2 crore cases globally. Mutation is evolution that the virus goes through to adapt to various barriers.A recent study has revealed that mutation is the reason why Covid-19 death rates are different in various states. An international team, led by researchers at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Uttar Pradesh, analysed mutations in the gene responsible for the expression of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein on the surface of cells which is believed to act as a gateway for the novel coronavirus into the human body.Their spatial analysis showed that in India, frequency of this haplotype, or a combination of mutations, varied between 33-100 per cent across different regions.The researchers, for the first time, also ascertained a significant positive correlation for the mutation with the lower infection and case-fatality ratio (CFR) among Indian populations.“If in a region more people with this haplotype will be present, the infectiousness of the virus would likely be lesser,” Professor Chaubey, who led the study, told news agency PTI. For example, he noted that state-wise Maharashtra and Gujarat have the lowest frequency of the gene mutation of about 30-40 per cent while the Northeastern region with a 75-100 per cent mutation in the gene has the highest frequency.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-major-mutation-in-covid-19-virus-in-india-confirms-pmo/story-sTJ8yIY70DwY9EbgiY8M5H.html

A weakness of any one of them will spoil the beauty of the bride. Sir Syed’s thoughts and vision have contributed to the success of Indians during British rule and after independence,” he said.Malik, in his speech, counted AMU’s achievements in education and sports as he wished well to the university for completing 100 years. The governor also conferred Sir Syed Excellency Awards to historian Dr Gail Minault in the international category and to the Anjuman-I-Islam, Mumbai-based educational conglomerate, in the national category.Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, the chancellor of the university, will inaugurate the Centenary Gate at the northern side of the Aligarh Muslim University campus to commemorate the 100 years of the varsity. AMU marked its 100 years as a university on September 14 this year. One of the oldest universities in India, AMU started as the Muhammadan-Anglo Oriental (MAO) College which eventually became Aligarh Muslim University in 1920 by the act of Parliament.AMU VC Tariq Mansoor also inaugurated a virtual ‘Exhibition of Books and Photographs’ pertaining to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan at Maulana Azad library. The exhibition will demonstrate Sir Syed’s hand-written articles and essays including his notable works— ‘Loyal Mohammedan of India’ and ‘Asbab e Baghawat e Hind’ (Causes of 1857 revolution). Sir Syed wrote 40 books and more than thousands of articles on contemporary issues. Mansoor also proposed a PhD programme on Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s life to further his vision and works.Sir Syed Ahmad Khan was born on October 17, 1817. He is believed to be the first pioneer of Muslim education in India. In 1864, he initiated the Scientific Society to translate western knowledge into vernacular. He was one of many religious and social reformers in 18th century along with Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Dayanand Saraswati. He was the forerunner of Aligarh movement which undertook to modernise Muslims’ education by adapting English as a medium of learning and western education rather than just focusing on traditional teachings vehemently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amu-students-are-serving-india-fulfilling-sir-syed-ahmad-khan-s-dream-satyapal-malik/story-cTb9vFwarVuEHxsgCV6c1K.html

Expressing concern over the scenario, the experts and foresters have recommended elephant-catching as the best possible way to curb the menace and have also approached the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) demanding lifting of the ban on elephant catching, also known locally as ‘mela shikaar’ and ‘khedda’, a dying art.“No doubt, we have excelled in saving elephants, as a result of which the elephant population in the country is set to cross the mark of 30,000 (according to MoEF). Despite having belonged to a generation of forest officers, who devoted their life to the protection of wildlife, I believe that now it’s time to think and re-think if our forests are ready to handle such a huge population of elephants,” asks a letter written to the Central ministry by RS Bhadauria, a retired officer of the Indian Forest Services (IFS).He says it is time to check the fast-increasing population of elephants, which he claims will also minimise man-elephant conflicts. Bhadauria is ex-principal chief conservator of forests and former chief wildlife warden of Uttar Pradesh.Bhadauria also says the wild elephant population has crossed the threshold limit and, as a result, elephants often enter into human habitations in search of food. Watch: Rescue tale of Roho the orphaned baby elephant melts people’s heartsAs per the data recently released by MoEF, at least 500 people and 100 elephants are killed every year due to man-elephant conflicts.“Indeed, the figure is depressing. And it is for the same reason that I believe that the government should lift the ban from elephant catching,” says Bhadauria, who has also served as a volunteer forester for the last 24 years post retirement in 1996.Bhadauria says catching elephants is perhaps the sole solution to the problem. “Castration of such huge creatures is out of the question. Hence, catching is the only possible way to check elephant populations in jungles. Once captured, the wild elephants should be tamed and put to different uses in various departments, similar to what the forest department does,” Bhadauria further argued.Interview: Stephen Alter, author, Feral Dreams; Mowgli and his MothersBhadauria’s letter to the MoEF further recommends reverting back to former system of capture, training, taming and reopening private ownership of elephants, allowing riding them in zoos, and their export to zoos abroad where there is a great demand for Asian elephants, because it trains better and quicker than African elephant.UP’s lone elephant catcher Kamaal Sheikh, too, echoed similar views, saying lifting the ban on elephant catching-- imposed in 1977 under Wildlife Protection Act 1972-- will not only keep a check on the increasing population of elephants, but will also revive an over 3000-year old art in India.“I am sure, the government would give a thought to it, which in return would keep the population under control and revive the dying art of Mela Shikaar,” says Kamaal Sheikh, who is well versed with the rare art of elephant catching.Mahendra Singh, who headed UP’s last elephant catching operation in UP in 1977, says, “I strongly believe that the government should assess the carrying capacity of the forest area and should allow elephant capture in the areas that are overpopulated. Also, it should find out the demand of elephants in different sectors in order to accommodate the elephants captured from the forest area.” Singh is a former wildlife warden of the forest department, UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lift-ban-on-elephant-catching-to-curb-man-jumbo-conflict-wildlife-experts/story-4LIX8V9yah5kkJL8GpiljK.html

17-10-2020||India||‘If we had security, this would not have happened,’ says Balwinder Singh’s wife as family allows last rites||A day after Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu was assassinated in Punjab, his wife blamed the government and intelligence agencies for not paying heed to the several appeals that they made for security. “There are 42 registered FIRs on attacks on our family and countless other attacks have taken place which are not on record. Withdrawal of security was wrong,” news agency ANI quoted Jagdish Kaur, wife of Balwinder Singh, as saying.“Those who treat security cover as a status symbol have been provided with it. We actually needed it but were not given,” She said, as reported by ANI.“If we had security then this would not have happened, as killers would have feared retaliation. We had sent several emails, written applications and also met officials, but we did not get any security,” Kaur added.The family members conducted the last rites of Singh on Saturday. Earlier the family had refused to cremate the body unless the accused are arrested.Months after the government withdrew security, two men on a motorcycle shot 62-year-old Singh on Friday when he was at his office adjoining his home at Bhikhiwind. He was taken to the hospital where doctors declared him “brought dead”.The family agreed for the cremation rituals after the administration ensured that the perpetrators will be arrested at the earliest.Justifying the security withdrawal, Tarn Taran’s Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Rajesh Sharma said it was done during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The situation arose suddenly and gunmen provided to everyone were called back by the police department,” he said.“Now three gunmen have been provided to the family,” he added.Sandhu had fought against terrorism in the state for years, facing scores of terror attacks during the height of Khalistani militancy.Meanwhile, a special investigation team has been formed to probe the killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-we-had-security-this-would-not-have-happened-says-balwinder-singh-s-wife-as-family-allows-last-rites/story-k7dnCw5NgHNL5vxFP1W2FM.html
17-10-2020||India||Pak role in Kashmir violence, terror and killings since 1947 to be highlighted on Oct 22||India will spotlight Pakistan’s role in instigating violence and terror in Kashmir and the destruction of its culture on October 22, a day when Jammu and Kashmir was attacked in 1947 after which a big part of the erstwhile princely state was occupied by Pakistan and thousands of Hindus and Sikhs had to migrate to the Indian side, according to officials familiar with the development.According to senior officials, the day will be observed to protest against Pakistan, who used the tribal militia and army to wreak rape and mayhem in Kashmir in 1947, with protests in the Valley and in Delhi. After the nullification of Article 370 and formation of Jammu and Kashmir as Union territory on August 5, 2019, the day will see demonstrations in Jammu and Srinagar as the UT will be under security dragnet. Every year, October 22 is also observed as Black Day by Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) refugees in India. It was on this day that Pakistan had launched Operation Gulmarg to attack Jammu and Kashmir and which left thousands of people dead. Operation Gulmarg was conceived under the command of Major General Akbar Khan, who has spoken about this in a book and admits to Pakistan’s role in the conflicts in the Kashmir Valley.“On October 26 (1947), the Pakistani forces captured Baramula where only 3,000 survived out of 14,000. The troops were now only 35 miles from Srinagar when the Maharaja (Hari Singh) sent his papers of accession to Delhi asking for help,” Khan has written in the recently-re-published book, Raiders in Kashmir.Khan has said in his book, as he gives out minute details of Pakistan’s aggression in Kashmir, that the plan was hatched and formulated in Lahore and Rawalpindi. He has said he was asked by Mian Iftikharuddin, then a leader in the ruling Muslim League, at the beginning of September 1947 to prepare a plan to take over Kashmir. “Ultimately, I wrote a plan under the title of “Armed Revolt inside Kashmir”. As open interference or aggression by Pakistan was obviously undesirable, it was proposed that our efforts should be concentrated upon strengthening the Kashmiris themselves internally -- and at the same time taking steps to prevent the arrival of armed civilians or military assistance from India into Kashmir,” Khan said.“On October 22, the operation began with Pakistani forces crossing the border and attacking Muzaffarabad and Domel on October 24 from where the Dogra troops had to withdraw. The next day these troops moved forward on the Srinagar road and again took on the Dogras at Uri... On October 27, India intervened and sent troops to Kashmir,” he has written.Khan also writes in Raiders in Kashmir how the Pakistani army had worked with the tribal forces in various incursions in Kashmir. He had “rushed back to Pindi to ensure that the tribesmen received their ammunition in time” after being appointed as the military adviser to the prime minister on October 28, 1947.About 11,000 residents of Baramulla were killed on October 26, 1947, alone, and the Mohra power station that supplied electricity to Srinagar was destroyed in the attack. “The raiders came to our land, massacred thousands of people -- mostly Hindus and Sikhs, but Muslims, too -- abducted thousands of girls, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims alike, looted our property and almost reached the gates of our summer capital, Srinagar,” Sheikh Abdullah, the first prime minister of J-K, described the invasion at the UN in 1948.Maharaja Hari Singh appealed to India for help in a letter dated October 26, 1947. “With the conditions obtaining at present in my state and to the great emergency of the situation as it exists, I have no option but to ask for help from the Indian Dominion. Naturally, they cannot send the help asked for without my state acceding to the Domination of India. I have accordingly decided to do so and I attach the Instrument of Accession for acceptance by your government,” he wrote.European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), a think-tank, has said the intervening night of October 21-22, 1947, was the darkest day in the history of Jammu and Kashmir when Operation Gulmarg was launched and that Pakistan’s template has remained the same till date.“Pakistan has perpetuated the myth that the tribal raiders were liberators and came to Kashmir to fulfil their religious obligation of jihad because Muslims were being killed in Jammu in communal riots. However, the reality was that it was not as if Muslims had been spared (by them),” it has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-role-in-kashmir-violence-terror-and-killings-since-1947-to-be-highlighted-on-oct-22/story-S0kUd51UHy3LoEcGCgGHbO.html

It also showed the country recorded a 37.4% stunting rate among children under five and a wasting rate of 17.3%. The under-five mortality rate stood at 3.7%.The Global Hunger Index is a tool for comprehensively measuring and tracking hunger at global, regional, and national levels. Check full list here: GHI scores are based on the values of four component indicators: undernourishment (share of the population with insufficient caloric intake), child wasting (share of children under age five who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition), child stunting (share of children under age five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition), and child mortality (mortality rate of children under age five, partly reflecting the fatal mix of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments).Based on the values of the four indicators, the GHI determines hunger on a 100-point scale where 0 is the best possible score (no hunger) and 100 is the worst. Each country’s GHI score is classified by severity, from low to extremely alarming.For the 2020 GHI report, data were assessed for 132 countries. Out of these, there were sufficient data to calculate 2020 GHI scores for and rank 107 countries (by way of comparison, data availability allowed for the ranking of 117 countries in the 2019 report). For 25 countries, individual scores could not be calculated and ranks could not be determined owing to lack of data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ranks-94-in-global-hunger-index-full-list-here/story-wXo7eOCL0xj5P2iAJ3R7PL.html

The Governor spoke while inaugurating the ‘Safe City Project’, a 180-day-long campaign under which the police and other departments will work towards safety of women. In a statement issued here, the UP Raj Bhavan said the Governor flagged off 100 pink scooties and 10 four-wheeler police vehicles. Lucknow is among eight cities in the country selected for the ‘Safe City Project’. The central government has approved the project for Lucknow at a total cost of Rs 194 crore with an aim to strengthen security of women in public places. Patel said, “Crime against women is increasing, and in this scenario, the responsibility of society increases. If the schemes meant for woman are not properly implemented, they will lose their importance. Till such time that women are dependent on others socially or monetarily, they will be exploited. The women have to become empowered.” She also said, “There are people with criminal and perverted mindset, who derive pleasure by committing crime. Girls are harassed while going to schools. It is because of these people that women do not feel safe in the family. Police must identify these people, and act before they could commit crime.” The UP Governor also said that the responsibility of the universities and educational institutes is not confined only to admission, teaching, examination and results. “Discussions should also be held as to whether the daughters are safe or not, and whether they have information about their rights,” she said. Throwing light on the ‘Safe City Project’, Additional Director General of Police (Women and Child Security) Neera Rawat said, “The cost of the projects is shared between the Centre and the state in 60:40 ratio. These vehicles have first-aid kit, flashlights and other facilities. The women personnel will combat crimes against women, which will make them feel secured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-governor-launches-safe-city-project-a-women-s-safety-campaign-in-lucknow/story-mmUKJB1xPZvXxrnRmw4X3K.html

He was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of BJP office in Uttarakhand through video-conferencing.“You must have seen that the other parties have become the party of the family, whereas in the BJP the party is the family,” Nadda added.“BJP, the world’s largest party with 18 crore members, stands as a family today,” he also said.Also Read | ‘Dirty tricks before Bihar elections’: JP Nadda berates Congress over tweetsTargeting Sonia Gandhi led-Congress and other family-ruled regional parties, Nadda said, “People are busy in protecting brother-sister, mother-son, or the son.

17-10-2020||India||Under criticism over Hathras case, UP launches ‘Mission Shakti’ for women’s safety||Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari on Saturday launched a government campaign on focusing on women’s safety, saying the Yogi Adityanath-led administration was working to ensure a secure environment for women and was open to introducing a new law, if needed.The ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign -- which will run from October 17-25 in its first phase and will involve awareness programmes -- comes in the wake of criticism against the UP government and the police for its handling of the case related to the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras last month. Police have been accused of hurriedly cremating the woman’s body without consent, not reacting in a timely manner, raising doubts on the rape allegation and blocking the woman’s family from speaking to the media -- triggering nationwide outrage and protests.  “The government has made up its mind to be unsparing in dealing with sex offenders, molesters... a lot of things are under consideration in this regard. The government may even think of bringing a new law for this purpose, if needed at all,” Tiwari said on Saturday, adding that the 180-day statewide campaign launched on the first day of the Navratri festival was a significant step in empowering women. Tiwari said the state government would ensure that the laws related to sexual offences were implemented in letter and spirit, and that the victims got justice in a time-bound manner.“We will also ensure that medical check-up of every rape victim is necessarily done within 24 hours of the crime and FIRs are lodged in every rape case reported to the police, failing which an FIR will be lodged against the concerning police personnel for dereliction,” he said.Experts had previously pointed out the Hathras victim’s forensic report -- which was cited by the UP police to say that the sexual assault allegation could not be verified -- may not have confirmed rape as the medical samples were taken days after the alleged incident. The chief secretary also spoke of the advisory that the BJP-led central government issued to all states and Union territories on the mandatory actions to be taken in cases pertaining to crimes against women. “We will strictly follow the advisory, besides enforcing the state’s own laws to protect women from sexual crimes,” Tiwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-criticism-over-hathras-case-up-launches-mission-shakti-for-women-s-safety/story-va2oIh4zO9baoA7T4Syn5L.html
17-10-2020||India||India ranks 94 in Hunger Index; experts blame poor implementation, siloed approach||India ranked 94 among 107 nations in the Global Hunger Index 2020 and is in the ‘serious’ hunger category with experts blaming poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring, siloed approach in tackling malnutrition and poor performance by large states behind the low ranking.Last year, India’s rank was 102 out of 117 countries.The neighbouring Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan too are in the ‘serious’ category but ranked higher than India in this year’s hunger index. While Bangladesh ranked 75, Myanmar and Pakistan are in the 78th and 88th position.Nepal in 73rd and Sri Lanka in 64th position are in ‘moderate’ hunger category, the report showed.Seventeen nations, including China, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Cuba and Kuwait, shared the top rank with GHI scores of less than five, the website of the Global Hunger Index, that tracks hunger and malnutrition, said on Friday.According to the report, 14 per cent of India’s population is undernourished.It also showed the country recorded a 37.4 per cent stunting rate among children under five and a wasting rate of 17.3 per cent. The under-five mortality rate stood at 3.7 per cent.Wasting is children who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition. Stunting is children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition.Data from 1991 through 2014 for Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan showed that stunting is concentrated among children from households facing multiple forms of deprivation, including poor dietary diversity, low levels of maternal education, and household poverty.During this period, India experienced a decline in under-five mortality, driven largely by a decrease in deaths from birth asphyxia or trauma, neonatal infections, pneumonia, and diarrhoea, the report stated.“However, child mortality, caused by prematurity and low birth weight, increased particularly in poorer states and rural areas. Prevention of prematurity and low birthweight is identified as a key factor with the potential to reduce under-five mortality in India, through actions such as better antenatal care, education, and nutrition as well as reductions in anaemia and oral tobacco use,” it said.Experts think that poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring and siloed approaches to tackling malnutrition often result in poor nutrition indices.Purnima Menon, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, New Delhi, said the performance of large states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh need to be improved to see an overall change of India’s ranking.“The national average is affected a lot by the states like UP and Bihar... the states which actually have a combination of high levels of malnutrition and they contribute a lot to the population of the country.“Every fifth child born in India is in Uttar Pradesh. So if you have a high level of malnutrition in a state that has a high population, it contributes a lot to India’s average. Obviously, then, India’s average will be slow to move,” she told PTI.Menon said big states with large population and a high burden of malnutrition are those which are actually affecting India’s average.“So, if we want a change in India then we would also need a change in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar,” she said.Shweta Khandelwal, the head of Nutrition Research and Additional Professor at Public Health Foundation of India, said the country has one of the most impressive portfolios of programmes and policies in nutrition in the books.“However, the ground realities are quite dismal.” “Research shows that our top-down approach, poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring and siloed approaches in tackling malnutrition (missing convergence) often result in poor nutrition indices. We must integrate actions to make public health and nutrition a priority across each sector,” she told PTI.Khandelwal suggested five measures to prevent exacerbation of hunger because of the pandemic.“Safeguard and promote access to nutritious, safe and affordable diets; invest in improving maternal and child nutrition through pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood; re-activate and scale-up services for the early detection and treatment of child wasting; maintain the provision of nutritious and safe school meals for vulnerable children and expand social protection to safeguard access to nutritious diets and essential service,” she said.She said it is important to aim at curbing multiple forms of malnutrition holistically in a concerted manner rather than single short-sighted fixes. “Hunger and undernutrition cannot and should not be fixed by mere calorie provision. All stakeholders steered by robust leadership must pay attention to making balanced healthy diets which are climate-friendly, affordable and accessible to all,” she added.GHI score is calculated on four indicators -- undernourishment; child wasting, the share of children under the age of five who are wasted-- who have low weight for their height reflecting acute undernutrition); child stunting, children under the age of five who have low height for their age reflecting chronic undernutrition; and child mortality -- the mortality rate of children under the age of five.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ranks-94-in-hunger-index-experts-blame-poor-implementation-siloed-approach/story-EP7DxFziMP9V0OOyhJMguI.html

The 14.15km long tunnel will be built at an altitude of about 3000 m under Zojila pass (presently motorable only for 6 months in a year) on NH-1 connecting Srinagar and Leh through Dras & Kargil. The stretch is one of the most dangerous in the world to drive and so the project is also geo-strategically sensitive.2. While Zojila Tunnel will be 14.15m long, the approach road’s length will be 18.63km which means the entire project’s length is 32.78 km.3. Gadkari said this will be the longest tunnel of Asia and added that it will improve the socio-economic scenario in the region.4. The project will make the travel on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh Section of NH-1 free from avalanches and enhance safety. It will also reduce the travel time from more than 3 hours to 15 minutes, the government said in a statement.5. The Kargil administration has said that the tunnel will also benefit the Indian Army. The remarks come in the backdrop of India’s standoff with China People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Kargil district commissioner (DC) Baseer-ul-Haq Choudhary said the tunnel will add more teeth to the army’s defence operations in the strategic region. “It will be of great importance to the defence forces. This project shall bring to fruition 70 years of overwhelming public demand of Ladakh region,” he added.6. Choudhary also pointed to the importance of the tunnel from tourism point of view saying, “Ladakh being a tourist destination, the tunnel will give impetus to tourism, winter sports like ice hockey, skiing and other activities.”7. “It was a long pending demand of the people of Ladakh. It will be a strategic tunnel that will keep the region connected with the rest of India all year, not just physically, but emotionally too,” he said.8.Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone at Leh in May 2018 but work could not progress after July 2019 as IL&FS, the firm which was given the contract, ran into financial problems. The project was terminated on January 15, 2019. In February this year, Gadkari reviewed the project and approved it afresh in May and the contract was given to Megha Engineering & Infrastructure Ltd (MEIL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-weather-zojila-tunnel-connects-srinagar-and-leh-all-you-need-to-know/story-SSZL5R5tvdIyONwJktOJWO.html

Akanksha Singh, from Delhi, has also scored 720 marks but bagged All India Rank (AIR) 2 as she is younger to Soyeb.In line with the criteria for the exam, Soyeb was ranked first while Akanksha was ranked second. Age is the last on a list of factors used to break a tie -- the elder of the two candidates gets the higher rank, according to National Testing Agency’s (NTA) policy. According to officials, the tie-breaking policy takes into account factors such as age, subject-wise marks and number of incorrect answers.“Soyeb Aftab of Odisha and Akanksha Singh of Delhi have both scored perfect 720 score in the NEET examination. However, as Aftab is older, he has been ranked at the top in the national ranking,” an official said, according to news agency PTI.The official added that the ranking of the candidate is initially determined based on the scores obtained in biology and chemistry. “Following these, in cases where the candidates cannot be shortlisted using the scores obtained in the examination, candidates are further shortlisted taking into consideration the number of answers that are incorrect, following which they are then shortlisted depending on their age. The elder one gets the preference,” the official said.Tummala Snikitha from Telangana, Vineet Sharma from Rajasthan, Amrisha Khaitan from Haryana and Guthi Chaitanya Sindhu from Andhra Pradesh have scored 715 out of 720 marks. However, they have been ranked third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively. Those ranked from 7th to 20th have scored 710 marks and those ranked from 25th to 50th have scored 705 out of 720 marks. The same tie-breaking policy has been used for deciding further ranks.The NEET exam was conducted on September 13 amid strict precautions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana came two days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that attempts to finish off the Hindi film industry in Mumbai or to shift it from the state capital will not be tolerated.“Attempts are made to defame and demoralise Bollywood. In a way, it is an attempt from behind the curtains to finish off Mumbai and Maharashtra’s identity. It’s not as easy as moving the International Financial Service Centre out of Mumbai. Mumbai is not only the financial capital but also the entertainment capital. The chief minister has spoken to prominent people from the industry and has assured them,” said the Saamana.Maharashtra government had planned IFSC at Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai. However, the Center gave permission for an international finance center at Dholera near Ahmedabad in Gujarat. Sena was referring to the move while alleging a conspiracy to shift or kill the Hindi film industry from Mumbai as stated first by Uddhav. “Bollywood enjoys a following across the globe. The film industry generates huge employment, while actors get popular because of the movies. However, in the past few days, attempts have been made to malign the image of the film industry by certain quarters, which is painful. Moves to finish-off the Bollywood (film industry) or shift it elsewhere will never be tolerated,” Thackeray had said on Thursday.Also Read: Delhi advocate arrested for abusive tweets against Maharashtra CM, AadityaThe Sena mouthpiece stated that the attempts to discredit the film industry started after actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in Mumbai.“Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide was shocking as well as unfortunate.

17-10-2020||India||China turns Indian proposal on its head, wants de-escalation first and then disengagement||The India-China military and diplomatic talks over resolving the Ladakh stand-off remain confidential, but HT learns that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has turned the dis-engagement, then de-escalation formulation on its head by proposing that tanks and artillery support should be mutually withdrawn first so that vertical escalation is averted in case of an accident.The Indian position on the other hand is that there should be comprehensive disengagement of troops through a phased withdrawal, a verification process, and then a de-escalation. The disengagement, New Delhi has maintained, should involve troops going back to their pre-April 2020 positions along the 1597 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Once this happens, de-escalation can follow. Experts say that in pure military terms, thinning out of artillery and tank support from the friction points does not work in favour of the Indian Army as the PLA has built roads right up to Beijing’s perception of LAC and has the capacity and capability to deploy much faster than Indian armour.According to senior officials, the Indian Army will have to remain deployed in the heights of East Ladakh through the winter, till the PLA decides in favour of disengagement and restoring status quo ante. “ The Indian Army has been trained in high altitude deployments and will be on guard till the situation is mutually resolved. The Indian position is comfortable and well-defended,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity. While the PLA has come up to its perception of the LAC on the north banks of Pangong Tso and Gogra-Hot Springs, the Indian Army has come up to its perception of the LAC on the south bank of the high altitude salt lake with troops sitting on the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline.India’s national security planners are debating how the tense situation will play out in the future. One school of thought is that the PLA will try and placate India though talks till the November 3 US presidential election but then increase hostilities all along the 3488 km LAC if President Trump does not return to White House. Essentially this means that right now, China is focused on US moves vis-a-vis Taiwan and will focus on India after the result in the US Presidential elections.The other school of thought among is that the PLA aggression on LAC has nothing to do with the US Presidential elections as the friction started in Galwan-Gogra-Hot Springs in April, when the American elections were not even on the horizon. People believe that the PLA move on LAC is aimed at restoring the November 7, 1959 line and punishing India for publishing the Ladakh map on November 2, 2019. The aggression has partly to do with the internal situation in China with the spread of coronavirus from Wuhan, the resulting impact on the economy, and the ensuing political ferment. While China’s internal political situation is expected to ease rather than exacerbate, the pressure on LAC will continue for time to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-turns-indian-proposal-on-its-head-wants-de-escalation-first-and-then-disengagement/story-QfovDFhWPRjDKvGw5eyHQI.html
17-10-2020||India||Kerala softens stand on GST issue after Centre’s decision on borrowing||The Kerala government on Saturday cancelled its high-level meeting to discuss a legal option to resolve the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess issue, days after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the central government will borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the market on behalf of states and pass the same as a loan to them. The move indicates that the Kerala government -- one of the seven dissenting states that had objected to the Centre’s previous borrowing options for meeting the GST shortfall and had threatened to approach the Supreme Court over the matter -- is softening its stand on the issue. HT reported on Saturday that with the Centre agreeing to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore from a special window of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and on-lend it to the states, some of the seven states that disagreed to the initial plan might now sign on. The Union government’s move, announced on Saturday, was expected to allay the primary concern of paying higher interest costs if states had to individually approach the market.“Kerala’s CM puts away scheduled high level meeting to discuss approaching SC [Supreme Court] on GST issue, in the light of new initiative by Union FM. Having amicably settled question of who should borrow, we hope she will address question of how much to borrow through dialogue with state FMs,” Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said in a tweet on Saturday.A Union finance ministry official said the Centre and the GST Council, the apex federal body for the indirect tax, are open for discussions. “Members can raise any issue in the Council that would be discussed. But, stopping willing states from borrowing was not possible under Article 293,” the official said requesting anonymity.On August 27, the Centre had given states the choice of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore (the shortfall resulting from GST implementation issues) without having to pay principal or interest or the entire estimated Rs 2.35 lakh crore revenue deficit from the indirect tax (including that arising from the Covid-19 pandemic) projected for this fiscal year. The Rs 97,000 crore amount was subsequently raised to Rs 1.1 lakh crore on October 5. Some states objected and insisted the borrowing would have to be done by the Centre. While 10 states originally opposed the plan, this number came down to seven by Wednesday, with some saying they would consider legal options. The seven dissenting states were: Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal. Puducherry had earlier indicated its preference for the borrowing option, but the Department of Expenditure is yet to receive a formal communication, the official said.The official said all states would eventually agree as there is “no dispute” and the GST council is committed to resolve “all differences”.“Borrowing of Rs 1.1 lakh crore is in progress, which will help cash-strapped states. Meanwhile, GST collection is expected to improve in coming months. It will not only reduce the revenue shortfall, but also increase compensation cess collection. A review of financial position in the Council after the third quarter [December] could see significant reduction in the need for further borrowing. This is a dynamic situation and will be reviewed,” the official said. HT reported it on Saturday.The GST Council is a federal body, chaired by the Union finance minister, and whose members include the finance ministers of states.This is the body that decides tax rates and other issues related to GST. Until the recent controversy, all its decisions had been arrived on the basis of a consensus.The Centre’s decision on Thursday followed by Sitharaman’s letter to states softened the stand of some dissenting states on the issue of compensation cess, a state government official said requesting anonymity.Sitharaman on Thursday wrote to the states, saying: “I am also sensitive to the fact that States need to be protected from the adverse consequences of higher borrowing in the form of interest liability and addition to debt. Under Option-I the Union Government will arrange the borrowing in such a manner that the cost will be at, or close to, interest rate of the Union Government.”The finance minister’s letter said the Central government faces “very serious” budgetary constraints. “Long-term macroeconomic stability is the responsibility of the Centre; but it is also in the interest of the States who are partners in our system of cooperative federalism. The bona fide opinion of the Central government on this macroeconomic issue is that borrowing on the books of Centre will not be optimal in the national interest,” Sitharaman wrote.Commenting on the single window borrowing mechanism announced on Thursday, she said, “We have now worked out some key aspects of the special window. Based on suggestions of many States, it has now been decided that the Central government will initially receive the amount, and then pass it on back-to-back to the States as loan. This will enable ease of coordination and simplicity in borrowing, apart from ensuring a favourable interest rate.” She assured state governments that the entire arrears of compensation will “eventually” be paid to states. She thanked states for their “collaborative” approach that resulted in a “constructive and practical solution” to this issue of compensation cess.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-softens-stand-on-gst-issue-after-centre-s-decision-on-borrowing/story-ldgPmjrkUP6BLMIbNQ6UhP.html
17-10-2020||India||73 years since Operation Gulmarg, Pak continues its attempt to seize J-K: Report||The darkest day in the history of Jammu and Kashmir was the intervening night of October 21-22, 1947, when Operation Gulmarg was launched in a bid to seize and destroy the territory, and 73 years have gone by, but Pakistan’s template has remained the same, according to a European think tank.European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), in a commentary, recalled the horrors of the tribal invasion that left between 35,000 and 40,000 dead, besides, a grim mark on the fate of J-K. “The day marked the first and most critical step in the erosion of the Kashmiri identity with the state and its people being torn apart by an UN-drawn LoC (Line of Control) that divides the erstwhile princely state and its inhabitants,” EFSAS said.According to the think tank, the Operation Gulmarg had been conceived as early as August 1947 under the command of Major General Akbar Khan (who recently spoke about this in a book).Washington DC-based political and strategic analyst Shuja Nawaz has listed 22 Pashtun tribes that were involved in the invasion.Besides General Khan, the other prominent person who planned and led the operation was Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan, a close aid of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.Shaukat, later in a book, The Nation that Lost its Soul, accepted that he had been appointed supervisor of the Kashmir operation, adding that Rs 300,000 were given from the Pakistani treasury by then finance minister Ghulam Muhammad for this operation.“Major General Akbar Khan fixed October 22, 1947, as the date on which the attack on J-K would be launched. All lashkars were asked to converge at Abbottabad near the border with J-K by October 18. They were moved in civilian buses and trucks that had been commandeered for this purpose... under the cover of night,” the EFSAS said.According to the European think-tank, “Pakistan has perpetuated the myth that the tribal raiders were liberators and came to Kashmir to fulfill their religious obligation of jihad because Muslims were being killed in Jammu in communal riots. However, the reality was that it was not as if Muslims had been spared (by them).”The intruders massacred about 11,000 residents of Baramulla on October 26, 1947, alone, and destroyed the Mohra power station that supplied electricity to Srinagar.Sheikh Abdullah, the first Prime Minister of J-K, described the invasion at the UN in 1948, saying: “The raiders came to our land, massacred thousands of people -- mostly Hindus and Sikhs, but Muslims, too -- abducted thousands of girls, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims alike, looted our property and almost reached the gates of our summer capital, Srinagar”.As a result of the trampling of lives running in thousands, Maharaja Hari Singh appealed to India in a letter dated October 26, 1947, “With the conditions obtaining at present in my state and to the great emergency of the situation as it exists, I have no option but to ask for help from the Indian Dominion. Naturally, they cannot send the help asked for without my state acceding to the Domination of India. I have accordingly decided to do so and I attach the Instrument of Accession for acceptance by your government.”“The other alternative is to leave my state and my people to diabolical killers and beasts. On the basis of this, no civilised government can exist or be maintained. The alternative I will never allow to happen as long as I am the ruler of the state and I have a life to defend my country”.In conclusion, the EFSAS called out those who tend to go for the Pakistani propaganda and its concern about the welfare of the Muslims in J-K: “They must not forget the policy adopted by Islamabad in October 1947, attempting to grab the territory by force, which dealt the greatest blow possible to the existence of J-K.”“The planners and perpetrators of the tribal invasion were, and remain, without doubt the foremost enemies of the Kashmiri people. The day the invasion began on October 22, 1947, has to be the darkest day in the history of the J-K,” the European think tank said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/73-years-since-operation-gulmarg-pak-continues-its-attempt-to-seize-j-k-report/story-OqAm2ekqYeNAkcvNvEDWfN.html
17-10-2020||India||Dasara festivities begin in Mysuru amid Covid-19 shadow||The famous 10-day long Dasara festivities commenced in this palace city on Saturday with religious fervour, amid the shadow of Covid-19 pandemic.Celebrated as ‘Nada Habba’ (state festival), the festivities began with Dr C N Manjunath, Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru and Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa showering flowers on the idol of goddess Chamundeshwari, the presiding deity of Mysuru royals, atop Chamundi Hill.Dr Manjunath, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 testing was chosen for Dasara inauguration, in recognition of the service of doctors and front line Covid-19 warriors.Six coronavirus warriors were also honoured at the inaugural to recognise their service in the fight against the pandemic.With Covid-19 pandemic casting shadow, the government had decided to organise the 410th Dasara festivities in a “simple” way, by and large restricting it to keep up with the traditions.The 10 day event that every year showcases Karnataka’s cultural heritage resplendent with folk art forms, and attracts large crowds and tourists, has been scaled down this time due to Covid-19.The Mysuru administration has restricted people at most of the events and has arranged for live telecasts.With Mysuru having a large number of cases, the focus is on strict enforcement of SOPs for controlling the spread of virus and to mark safe Dasara.‘Jumbo Sawari’ or procession of well decorated elephants carrying the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari placed in a golden Howdah on Vijayadashmi or the 10th day of the festival, which marks the culmination of celebrations on October 26, has been restricted to the palace premises.At the palace too, the royal family has decided to hold the celebrations in the simple way with select gathering, due to Covid-19 pandemic.The Navaratri celebrations at the palace include several rituals, most remarkably Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, the scion of Mysuru royal family, dressed in grand attire, conducting Khasagi durbar (private durbar) by ascending the golden throne, amid chanting vedic hymns.The royal palace and several parts of Mysuru city will be illuminated with thousands of bulbs glowing during the evenings, all through the festival.Dasara was celebrated by the rulers of the Vijayanagar empire and the tradition was inherited by the Wadiyars.Festivities were first started in Mysuru by the Wadiyar King, Raja Wadiyar I in the year 1610.However, with the abolition of the institution of the kings and the announcement of privy purse, the state government took over the mantle of celebrating Dasara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dasara-festivities-begin-in-mysuru-amid-covid-19-shadow/story-YXOnmPYlTMMsLuinyacwBP.html

The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which runs the hill shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, opened the temple on Friday for a five-day monthly pooja.The temple, one of the richest in the country, was closed for devotees on March 18, days before the first national lockdown was enforced. There were plans to reopen in June but many organisations and tantri (chief priest) of the temple were against it.The temple trust has said it will allow pilgrims to offer prayers from Saturday, the first day of Malayalam month of Thulam, till October 21. As many as 246 devotees, only 250 people will be allowed inside the temple in a day, have booked through the virtual queue system for darshan on Saturday. TDB has said all pilgrims will have to carry Covid-19 negative certificates obtained just 48 hours before reaching Pambha.Devotees can forego masks while trekking with experts warning that masks cause breathing problems for pilgrims scaling heights. Pilgrims below 10 and above 60 years of age are still not allowed on the trek and will have to wait for the Covid-19 situation to improve, said the TDB. The pilgrims will not be allowed to stay at Sannidhanam, Nilackkal or Pamba due to the pandemic.Special showers have been set up as customary bathing at Pamba river will not be allowed this time. Devotees will be allowed to enter through the Vadasserikara and Erumeli routes and all other forest routes will be sealed, TDB has said.The shrine will be closed after ‘Hari Varasanam’ rendition on October 21. Devotees from five south Indian states throng the temple and 500,000-800,000 visit the shrine on a day during peak season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-sabarimala-temple-reopens-covid-19-negative-proof-online-booking-must-for-entry/story-eeUDbKq6zYSaz62ldJWKVJ.html
17-10-2020||India||Grand Alliance releases manifesto for Bihar election; focus on employment, farm laws||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Grand Alliance (GA) on Saturday released its joint manifesto — titled ‘Badlav Ka Sankalp’ (commitment to change) — for the upcoming assembly elections in the state, promising to offer jobs to thousands of youngsters and repealing the new farm laws recently enacted by the central government if they are elected to power. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, at the press conference on Saturday, launched a campaign of party nominees in the fray for the first phase of polling on October 28. As many as 71 seats out of 243 are going to the polls in the first phase. Releasing the manifesto in the presence of All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and other GA leaders, Tejashwi said that their government, if elected, would first approve the process for appointments on about 1000,000 jobs in the government. “Contractual teachers would be entitled for same pay for same work, for which they have been agitating for long,” said Yadav, who is the alliance’s chief ministerial candidate. Assuring the people that the alliance will stand by its commitments, Tejashwi said that they were not leaders who conveniently forget their promises and that the state has still not been accorded a special status -- a demand echoed for years by political parties in Bihar. “Trump will not come to accord special status to Bihar, which was once promised by the Prime Minister,” said Yadav, in an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ties with US President Donald Trump. Congress leader Surjewala too said that the first assembly sitting of the GA government would see annulment of the three controversial farm acts that, he alleged, defeat the objectives of green revolution in the state. “Where would the farmers get the minimum support price (MSP) of their produce if there is a market,” the Congress leader questions, saying that the people of Bihar might forgive everything but not betrayal. “If we form the government, under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav, we will pass a Bill in the first Vidhan Sabha session to scrap the three anti-farm laws. Can PM Modi and Nitish tell us that if all mandis are destroyed then how will the farmers get MSP,” Surjewala asked. The Centre last month enacted three farm reforms to liberalise agricultural markets and end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees by opening up to private competition. Assurances by the Centre that the new measures give farmers the options to sell their produce to private buyers while the government would continue to purchase staples at MSPs have done little to dissipate concerns. Big farmers’ groups, who usually produce substantial surpluses, fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses. Focusing on crimes against women and children in the state, the GA leaders said many perpetrators of gang rape against minors at Muzaffarpur shelter home were still at large. Waiver of fee for competitive examination for jobs and helpline for migrant workers have also been promised in the manifesto. Countering charges of “inexperience”, Yadav said that the vision for development did not necessarily come with age. “As the deputy CM, we have laid the foundation of development with great vision. I ,as a minister of road construction department, proposed development of dedicated expressway to connect the Bihta airport. Many state highways were converted as the national highways (NHs),” said the RJD leader who was the deputy CM before JD(U) left the Mahagathbandhan grouping. Yadav further alleged that more than 60 scams have taken place under chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government in Bihar and that the Janata Dal (United)-BJP combine had stabbed the state’s people on their backs. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, chairman of BPCC campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Yadav, national RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha and CPI(ML) leader Shashi Yadav were also present during the release of manifesto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grand-alliance-releases-manifesto-for-bihar-elections-focus-on-employment-farm-laws/story-ZfmcOecnHmLfeFQX54ZFvM.html

The killing triggered outrage as it allegedly took place in the presence of top district and police officers.Additional director general of police, Brij Bhushan, said Narendra Pratap Singh, the brother of the main accused, Dheerendra Pratap Singh, is among the five arrested on Friday.Jaiprakash Pal was shot dead after officials decided to cancel the meeting because of a dispute.Dheerendra Pratap Singh, who is on the run, is the Ballia unit president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Sainik Prakosht (servicemen’s cell), according to BJP lawmaker Surendra Singh, who represents Bairia constituency in Ballia. The lawmaker described the incident as “a casualty” and said the law will take its own course.The two brothers have been named in the First Information Report (FIR) filed in the case. A police officer said raids were being conducted to arrest the accused, which include 22 unnamed people.Tej Pratap Pal, the brother of the 46-year-old, on Friday said there were 10 policemen on the spot, who were saving the culprits and beating them. “When Dheerendra Pratap Singh was fleeing after firing, the police caught him... But they later took him to a nearby embankment and let him go,” news agency Press Trust of India quoted him as saying.Ballia district magistrate Hari Pratap Shahi said the process of cancellation of arms licences of the accused was underway.Additional police superintendent Sanjay Kumar Singh said nine police personnel have been suspended for inaction in the case.Police said the meeting was held for the allocation of two fair price shops at Durjanpur and Hanumanganj villages. Two women self-help groups, Maa Shayar Jagdamba and Shivshakti Sahayata Samuh, had applied for the right to operate the shops. At the meeting, it was decided that voting will be held to determine the allocation of the shops.Police said officials arranged for only people with Aadhaar or other valid identity cards to participate in the voting. The meeting turned chaotic as even those without the ID cards insisted on voting. The meeting was then cancelled. Police said both the parties shouted slogans against the administration and one person opened fire in which the 46-year-old was killed.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-five-including-brother-of-main-accused-held-for-firing-at-ballia-meeting/story-9LZLKLLIuthIQpP7u1nxhJ.html

This week, India recorded the lowest number of daily cases on October 13 with 55,342 infections, according to daily data released by the Union health ministry.A number of states across the country have shown a dip in the number of cases--Haryana, Mizoram, Nagaland, Goa and Sikkim among them. However, a few states continue to record a high number of cases and have not followed the national trend. Kerala, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have not been able to lower the number of Covid-19 cases. Even though the nation’s doubling rate of cases has increased, these few states are finding it difficult to lower the number of cases.Deaths due to Covid-19 have also remained lower this week. The highest number of deaths were recorded on October 11 and October 16 with 918 and 895 fatalities respectively. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have seen a spike in fatalities.Government has asked citizens to exercise caution as elections, festive season and winters pose a risk and can lead to a surge in the number of cases of the coronavirus disease. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has reiterated that people need to follow Covid-19 preventative measures to ensure that the infection does not spread.As winter sets in the United States and across Europe, several states and cities in the US have recorded spikes in cases. Germany, France and the United Kingdom have seen a rise in the number of cases as well indicating that lower temperatures could lead to the spread of infections.Authorities continued to ramp up testing throughout the last two weeks. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) told news agency PTI that 9,22,54,927 samples have been tested up to October 15 and 10,28,622 samples were tested as of October 16.India has recorded 7,370,468 Covid-19 cases and 112,161 people across the country have died due to the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-daily-coronavirus-cases-reflect-slight-rise-but-remain-below-70-000-mark/story-cZIMsHBjnIQAb6bFemWRdJ.html
17-10-2020||India||Odisha opposition slams Naveen Patnaik govt for ‘harassing’ OTV reporter||A day after Odisha police picked up a journalist employed with Odisha Television Ltd (OTV) from near his residence in Bhubaneswar in connection with a viral video case, opposition leaders from BJP and Congress decried the action calling it a case of political vendetta. Editor’s guild of India has also condemned the police action, calling it an act of “harassment” of OTV.On Thursday, Ramesh Rath, a senior reporter with OTV in Bhubaneswar was summoned by a team of police from Keonjhar district over his alleged involvement in a 2019 case of obscene viral video allegedly involving a female BJD MP.The police team took away the journalist’s mobile phone and later went to the OTV office in the city to confiscate his workstation in connection with the investigation of the viral video case.Rath was later released and asked to report to a police station in Keonjhar district on October 21. However, a team of police from Keonjhar as well as Bhubaneswar commissionerate was deployed inside the OTV office campus since Thursday.Leader of the Opposition in the Odisha assembly and BJP leader Pradipta Naik said the action smacked of intolerance. “Media has a big role to play in a healthy democracy. However, the present trend of intolerance by the government against the media in our state was never seen before. OTV which is highlighting the loopholes of the government is being targeted. This is a blatant misuse of power by a dictatorial regime and it seems the whole machinery is against the media house for breaking stories that do not favour the government. They should have the patience to tolerate the criticism and accordingly correct its course if the media brings its drawbacks to the fore,” said Naik.Similarly, BJP MLA from Paralakhemundi, K Narayana Rao said the TV channel was being targeted at the direction of CM Naveen Patnaik. Senior Congress MLA Sura Routray also slammed the CM for harassing OTV.The editors guild of India, too, expressed its dismay over police action against OTV reporter saying it threatened as well as undermined the independent functioning of the media organisation. The case, in which the OTV reporter was picked up, dates back to April last year, when five persons including a web portal journalist were arrested over their alleged involvement in uploading an obscene video on social media platforms alleged to be that of a female BJD MP. The video had gone viral just before last year’s Lok Sabha polls. Police had registered a case under section 292-A, 354-A, 500, 509, 465, 469, 120-B, 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 66D, 67 and 67-A of Information Technology Act, 2000 and Representation of Peoples Act.The BJD MP said OTV owner Jagi Mangat Panda and her husband and BJP leader Baijayant Jay Panda had no valid reason to call police action on Rath an attack on OTV and its journalists.Also Read: Odisha’s new bill to define norms for hospitality industry “I am an unmarried lady who has been mentally harassed and tortured by OTV reporters and others who had made a morphed, obscene video of mine viral on social media with a malicious intent to defame, harass and mentally torture me.

As a tribal lady, my honour and dignity were defamed in public. When will I get justice,” she asked.Keonjhar SP Mitrabhanu Mohapatra said the name of OTV journalist who was picked up yesterday had come up during the investigation of the case last year. “When we examined his ex-colleague who was arrested in the cases, we got more information about the involvement of Ramesh Rath and that’s why he was picked up. We are doing the investigation as per CrPC procedures. We have filed a charge sheet in the case against those who were already arrested and kept the investigation in the case open,” said the SP.Also Read: NEET Results 2020: Odisha’s Soyeb Aftab is the topper, scores 720 out of 720OTV’s chief operating officer Litisha Mangat said the TV channel was being harassed for the last 3 months, ever since it broke the story of alleged corruption in the Odisha government’s handling of Covid funds.“Baseless allegations and FIRs are being filed. The senior journalist was picked up without any notice or warrant. We have been co-operative towards investigation but if they’re going to attack our journalists and our office without any reason, we should not be taken advantage of. We refused to let them search or ransack our office without any grounds.He refused to say anything about the viral video case stating that the law should take its own course in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-opposition-slams-naveen-patnaik-govt-for-arresting-otv-reporter/story-iYIPXpJhigq3MacepmO0TL.html

Speaking at the 36th raising day function of the NSG, Deswal, who is currently holding additional charge of the force, also said that the elite force has most modern weapons and equipment to distinguish itself as a world class zero-error force. “The NSG close protection force has trained 21 personnel of Sri Lanka’s PM security division in close protection skills. The honourable Prime Minister of Sri Lanka wrote to the honourable Indian PM and praised the training,” Deswal said. Deswal, however, didn’t go into the specifics as to when these Sri Lankan personnel were trained by the NSG. Popularly known as ‘black cat’ commandos, NSG was raised as a federal contingency force in 1984 to undertake specialist counter-terrorist, counter-hijack and hostage rescue operations. It has a special component called the CPF (close protection force) that provides security to high-risk VIPs under the top category Z+ cover including defence minister Rajnath Singh, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah. Also Read: Drones being used to drop arms, drugs from across international border: NSG DGDeswal said the CPF, during the Covid-19 outbreak, provided security to its VIPs in about 4,000 events held in various states. “The force has enhanced its mobility, training, weaponry and equipment by many times as terrorism is a complex and global problem in this century and the tactics of terrorists were changing and terror groups were possessing modern weapons. We are determined to adopt modern technology and specialisation,” Deswal said. He added that NSG was training special combat units of state police forces so that they are better prepared to combat terrorist incidents.

17-10-2020||India||SC appoints ex-judge to monitor stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, UP||The Supreme Court on Friday appointed a one-man monitoring committee headed by former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B Lokur to address the issue of air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), giving him wide powers to direct states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh to take additional measures to control stubble burning , a significant contributor to the capital’s bad air. It also put him in charge of other bodies and agencies trying to do this — such as the statutory authority assisting the Court, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority or EPCA.Lokur, who has heard several cases on the capital’s bad air during his tenure in the apex court has also been given powers to inspect farmland where incidence of stubble burning is likely to take place. He is expected to file a report on October 26, when the matter will be heard next.In effect, the former judge is Delhi’s informal Air Commissioner. The annual issue about the bad air in NCR usually gets bounced around various state governments and the Centre, with each blaming the other. This year, for instance, Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar attributed the rise in pollution over the Capital to local factors, following which Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that “staying in denial will not help”. Speaking to HT, Justice Lokur said, “I am yet to go through the order. I will only comment after reading the Court’s decision.”Also Read: Farm fires increase in Punjab, Haryana despite assurancesAir Quality in the capital entered the poor category with the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 207 on October 6, and very poor category (304) on October 14. On Friday, the AQI was 235 (poor), according to the System of Air Quality, Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). Data from the Indian weather office shows a sharp increase in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, with 3,517 incidents till October 15 in this harvest season, compared to a third that number last year.The Supreme Court’s decision was welcomed by the Delhi government with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj saying at a press conference: “We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision in the matter. The formation of the panel proves...stubble burning is the main cause of pollution in Delhi.” On Friday, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said: “It is necessary that there must be some monitoring of stubble burning with a view to its prevention before it assumes abnormal proportions. We accordingly appoint Justice Madan Lokur, a former Judge of this Court, to act as the one-man Monitoring Committee to monitor the measures taken by the States to prevent stubble burning.” So far, this function was being carried out by EPCA. According to senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, who is a regular practitioner in environment-related laws, the step from the Court is one in positive direction. “With the appointment of Justice Madan Lokur, the Court will be ably assisted in tackling the issue of stubble burning. But experience has shown that states hardly cooperate in such efforts. We already saw today Solicitor General opposing the Court’s decision to appoint Justice Lokur.”The bench directed the Chief Secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to render all assistance to Justice Lokur to enable physical surveillance of fields where stubble is likely to be burnt and devise additional means and methods for preventing the burning of stubble.For carrying out surveillance, the Court left it open to the one-man Committee to engage services of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme (NSS), and Bharat Scouts and Guides to be deployed for assisting in the monitoring of stubble burning . However, the constitution of the Committee will not mean that other authorities in the state and EPCA will remain muted.Also Read| Behind Delhi’s polluted air: Early stubble fires, weatherThe bench said, “Teams already in existence in the States, which are meant for the purpose of preventing stubble burning shall report to and take instructions from Justice Lokur.”EPCA as well as state and Central authorities working on stubble burning will continue their functions and provide assistance to the Committee, the order said.The order was passed by the court while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two young environmental activists who demanded ban on stubble burning due to its harmful effects on health of citizens. Senior advocate Vikas Singh who argued the petition suggested the name of Justice Lokur. “A person of that stature who has dealt with the issue of stubble burning while a judge can be given powers to direct states to enforce Supreme Court’s past orders,” he said. Punjab filed an affidavit detailing how the state had employed a mobile app to track stubble burning through satellites. Senior advocate PS Narsimha appearing for Punjab government said, “We have 8000 nodal officers on the field to respond to any communication received about stubble fires.” Uttar Pradesh was not a party to the petition and hence did not appear but Haryana argued that sufficient steps were in place in the state to prevent stubble burning as compared to previous years.VIkas Singh pointed out : “On the contrary, crop burning has increased by five times this year. There is a grave concern about the quality of air in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the quality is dropping rapidly. If urgent steps are not taken, the situation will become unmanageable.”As the Court was breaking for Dusshera holidays on October 17 and will reopen on October 26, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati representing the Centre urged it to have the matter posted then along with the MC Mehta case where the issue of stubble burning has been dealt with over the past six years. She pointed out that a statutory authority appointed by Central Government , EPCA , is monitoring the issue with states. After the order was passed, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta tried convincing the court to change its mind but the bench stuck to its order.The bench, which also comprised Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said: “We are concerned that citizens of Delhi-NCR should breathe good, clean air. Since we will not be in session for about nine days, we do not want the situation to get worse. The object of appointing a committee is more to facilitate and coordinate the activities of different authorities so that the problem is resolved.”The order made it mandatory for states to extend all facilities to the committee, including transportation for physical surveillance, security of committee and mobile inspection teams, and secretarial assistance for preparing fortnightly reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-appoints-ex-judge-to-monitor-stubble-burning-in-punjab-haryana-up/story-w3qMgflJkOG62uo8DnWi3N.html

17-10-2020||India||4 states that are defying dip in India’s Covid-19 cases||As daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across India continue to dip, states such as Kerala, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have been bucking the national trend, shows data analysed by HT. These four states all have fast-rising case numbers, rising positivity rates and the last three also test poorly.To analyse the intensity of the outbreak and identify regions that are still displaying characteristics of growing outbreaks, HT analysed data from India’s 20 most populous regions, looking for three factors — a rising positivity rate, a high growth rate of daily cases, and low tests per million residents — that have marked all hot spots regions globally.With the festive season starting and the winter approaching, it becomes all the more crucial that states across the country (and in particular states that face the immediate danger of becoming the next hot spots) monitor infection rates to stop the curve from rising again if people let their guard down during the celebrations.RATE OF NEW INFECTIONS The rate of increase in cases for a region is generally measured by what is known as doubling rate — the number of days it takes for the total infections in the region to double (the higher the number, the better). All states analysed have improved their doubling rate over between September 1 and October 15 – a statistic that is a reflection of how the national case curve has turned over the last month. But Kerala, which has seen a massive spurt in new cases over this period, not only has the worst doubling rate in the country (24 days as on October 15), it also is the state which has improved the least (doubling rate improved by only a day). For context, the national average of doubling rate is 74 days as on October 15, an improvement of 43 days from September 1. Other than Kerala, six states have performed worse than the national doubling rate average. At 37 days, Chhattisgarh has the second worst doubling rate and is followed by Madhya Pradesh (50 days), Rajasthan and Karnataka (53 days), West Bengal (57 days) and Odisha (69 days).Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayDelhi’s doubling rate of 75 days is slightly better than the national average, but it features among the states with the least improvement (11 days). Only Kerala has improved less than the national capital. In early September, a similar analysis by HT found that Delhi had the highest doubling rate in the country (59 days).POSITIVITY RATE AND TESTING In six of the 20 states, the average positivity rate – the proportion of people testing positive to those tested – increased in the last month. The higher the positivity rate of a region, the more widespread the virus . According to WHO recommendations, the positivity rate in a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control there.Kerala again features as the worst performing states with 15.9% of all tests conducted in the last week coming back positive. The state’s seven-day average of positivity rate has worsened by 8.4 percentage points from September 1 – again the highest rise in the country. Maharashtra, which had consistently been reporting the highest positivity rate in the country over the past three months, has seen the figure drop by 7.3 percentage points (from 21.1% to 13.8%). The western state, which has the highest number of cases in the country, still has the second highest proportion of tests returning positive in the last week.Rajasthan saw the third highest positivity rate in the last week — 11.3%. For the week ending September 1, 6.1% of tests returned positive in the state. In Madhya Pradesh, the positivity rate worsened by 2 percentage point (from 5.7% on September 1 to 7.7% on October 15), while it worsened by 1.6 percentage points in West Bengal (from 7% to 8.6%).On average, 6.1% of all tests in the country have come back positive over the past week. Although the positivity rate has improved over the past 45 days in three states – Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh – all of them still have an average positivity rate over the last week higher than the national average: 9.5%, 8.9% and 6.4% respectively.Also Read: India decides to reassess Covid-19 treatment protocolIn terms of testing, Madhya Pradesh remains the worst-performing state in the country, with 30,507 tests performed per million of the population, followed by West Bengal (39,844) against the national average of 71,892. Rajasthan comes third from the bottom (44,472 tests per million) followed by Chhattisgarh (51049 tests per million) and Uttar Pradesh (55,602).Interestingly, the testing rate of Maharashtra (64,793 per million residents) has dropped below the national average – an alarming trend for a state with such a high caseload and one that has the worst positivity rate in the country.Kerala, meanwhile, had performed well in this front with 107,527 tests performed per million residents in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-states-that-are-defying-dip-in-india-s-covid-19-cases/story-Os1IcdvpjYdHE3bYRyDTIO.html

He is admitted to Intensive Care Unit and customs officials are also in the hospital.Earlier on Thursday the Kerala High Court had directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) not to arrest Sivasankar till October 23 in connection with the gold smuggling case.A single-judge bench of Justice Ashok Menon issued the interim order on the anticipatory bail plea filed by Sivasankar seeking protection from arrest in the ED case.The counsel appearing for Sivasankar submitted before the court that the applicant is willing to appear before the agency and cooperate with the investigation in the case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the alleged smuggling of gold through diplomatic channels.Sivasankar had filed the anticipatory bail application after the ED submitted a chargesheet in the case before the special PMLA court. He submitted that the central agency’s chargesheet had allegations and imputations against him, making him apprehensive of an arrest.The case, which is currently being probed by the ED, NIA and the Customs department, pertains to the smuggling of gold in the state through diplomatic channels.The matter had come to light after 30 kg gold worth Rs 14.82 crores smuggled in a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage was busted by the Customs in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5.

Thereafter, the SEC had directed the pharma company to apply with a revised protocol along with more information.The Indian drug maker has joined hands with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine as well as its distribution.As per RDIF, it will supply 100 million doses of its potential Covid-19 vaccine to India drug company Dr Reddy’s Lab.“Before giving permission, the drugs regulator will conduct a technical evaluation of the application submitted by Dr Reddy’s lab to conduct phase 2,3 clinical trial in India of Russian Covid-19 vaccine ,” said the official.Last month, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, RDIF informed that Russia is in close dialogue with the Indian government and drug manufacturers of India regarding localization of production of its Sputnik V vaccine in India.Also, a prestigious medical journal The Lancet had published the results of clinical trials of Phase I-II of the Russian vaccine demonstrating its safety and efficacy.On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine candidate developed jointly by RDIF and the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19.According to Russian researchers, Sputnik V is a human adenoviral vector vaccine that fights against coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-recommends-dcgi-to-permit-dr-reddy-s-lab-to-conduct-phase-2-3-clinical-trial-of-russian-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/story-Up81KgpbH1Vefak74P5Y7K.html
17-10-2020||India||India has involved people, motivated them to deal with Covid-19 challenge: Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday said that the Indian government had dealt with the challenge posed by Covid-19 pandemic in many ways like a people’s movement by involving people and motivating them.“In many countries, people look at it like a public health response or a governance challenge. We have actually dealt with it in many ways like a people’s movement, that you actually get people involved and motivate them,” he said an event hosted by Asia Society.The minister said that the Indian government had done right things such as stopping international travel and a nationwide lockdown in the early stages of the pandemic.“When it came initially, we did all the right things, we stopped international travel much before most countries did, and we had our lockdown much before most countries did. When the pandemic hit India, there was not a single producer of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), there were about two producers of masks, and there were no producers of ventilators. So if you look at typically the kind of equipment you regard as critical to COVID-19 response, it just wasn’t there,” he told Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) President Kevin Rudd, a former Australian Prime Minister.  “Today, we have more than 100 major producers of PPE, there are 25 plus companies producing ventilators, and there are 10 big domestic manufacturers of N95,” Jaishankar added.He mentioned that in the initial weeks and months, India was looking for equipment, and today it was exporting a lot of this equipment to the world.“We have set up almost 15,000 COVID-19 centres by converting hospitals and other public buildings as dedicated facilities for COVID-19 treatment,” he said.Jaishankar lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling him a great motivator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-involved-people-motivated-them-to-deal-with-covid-19-challenge-jaishankar/story-WWsA5yLPeNQaMtmOBoaOUL.html
17-10-2020||India||Jharkhand rejects Centre’s loan offer in lieu of GST compensation||The Jharkhand government on Friday rejected the Centre’s latest offer of borrowing an estimated ₹1.1 lakh crore shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess and passing it on to the states, even as it hit out at the Centre over its direction to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to auto-debit Rs 1,417 crore from the state’s account. A statement issued by chief minister Hemant Soren’s office said the central government was trying to trap the Jharkhand government to increase borrowings from markets in the times of economic instability. The central government has asked RBI to auto-debit Rs 1,417.50 crore as the first installment from Jharkhand’s account towards Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) dues.The remarks came a day after the Union finance ministry said that the ₹1.1 lakh crore estimated shortfall in GST compensation cess will be borrowed by the central government and “passed on to the states as a back-to-back loan”.Hitting out at the offer after a state cabinet meet, Soren said he will write and speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue. “This is first instance in my knowledge that the Centre has invoked such a rule to directly deduct money from consolidated fund of a state. Our condition financially is grim due to the pandemic and the Centre knows about it. This act is an attack on the federal structure,” Soren said.Also Read: Dissenting states likely to accept GST solution“Yesterday the Union finance minister wrote to us and also called up to consider the loan offer. This is a strange situation. On the one hand they are deducting our funds and on other they are pressuring us to accept loan. Things won’t work this way. The cabinet today has decided to outrightly reject the loan offer,” the CM added.The finance ministry’s statement on Thursday said that the borrowing will “not have any impact on the fiscal deficit of the Government of India” and “be reflected as capital receipts of the state government as part of the financing of the respective fiscal deficits”. As a result, this borrowing doesn’t go into what is called general government borrowings (the debt of the Centre and the states).“We will be deliberating on the next possible steps in the best interest of the state. We need to understand in detail what could be potential fiscal implications of this proposal on our state coffers which is facing severe onslaught both from pandemic and of non-clearance of multiple dues, central share dues, GST dues etc by Centre, including the unilateral decision to deduct Rs 1,417 crore from the state govt’s account with RBI,” the CM said in a separate statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-rejects-centre-s-loan-offer-in-lieu-of-gst-compensation/story-CcE4vOzn6UWhUGizpeS0uN.html

The Prime Minister, while addressing a video conference after releasing a commemorative coin of ₹75 denomination on the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, highlighted the efforts taken by the central government over the last six year for maintaining the health of women and all-round development of girl children. “Discussion is underway to decide the right age for marriage of our daughters. From across the country, daughters have written to me asking why the concerned committee has not given its decision yet. I assure you that as soon as the report comes, the government will act on it,” the PM said. The central government on September 22 had said that a task force has been constituted to examine the issues pertaining to the age of marriage, motherhood and imperatives of lowering maternal mortality rate.“The recommendations have been formulated and are in the process of being compiled,” said a person familiar with the matter. “Nearly 15 meetings, including conversations with experts, townhalls with stakeholders and even questionnaires sent to students across universities have been held.The report is likely to be submitted by the end of this month,” this person added. Co-founder of HAQ Centre of Child Rights, Enakshi Ganguly, said, “This will just result in an increase in the number of penal provisions. The focus should be on women empowerment and creating a conducive environment where women can make their own decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-take-call-on-legal-age-of-marriage-for-women-pm-modi/story-WOWvXfx1E1ufDrBUAGmFUO.html

17-10-2020||India||Sanjay Bhandari tried to alienate assets in UK, says ED||Fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, after fleeing to the UK in 2016, met certain people in London and tried to alienate (or transfer ownership of) his foreign assets and companies by creating backdated documents in the name of a trust in the UAE, according to the charge sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him. His Chartered Accountant, Sanjeev Kapoor, even travelled to London in February 2017 along with Sumit Chadha to meet Bhandari and get his signatures on the documents so that his assets could be linked to the trust, identified as Alrahma Trust, the charge sheet adds. A Delhi court on Thursday took the cognizance of charge sheet, filed by ED on June 1, and directed the anti-money laundering probe agency to expedite extradition proceedings against Bhandari in the UK so that he can be brought to India to face trial. Bhandari is under investigation by multiple agencies – including ED, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Income Tax department, and Delhi Police for money laundering , violation of the foreign exchange , black money, and official secrets laws (he had access to sensitive defence documents). He fled to the UK via Nepal in December 2016. UK authorities arrested him on July 15 on India’s extradition request after which he secured bail. A UK court has set June 7, 2021 as the date for the start of proceedings for Bhandari’s extradition. Proceedings to declare him as Fugitive Economic Offender (FEO) are also pending in an Indian court. According to the ED charge sheet, details of which have been accessed by HT, companies linked to Bhandari – including Offset India Solutions FZC, Santech International FZC and others -- were receiving foreign income and owned foreign assets. “Bhandari intentionally didn’t disclose his foreign income and assets before the Income Tax department including the fact that he held shares worth 1,17,000 dirham, in Santech International,” says the ED charge sheet. Undisclosed foreign properties such as those at C-303 Maurya Grandeur, Palm Jumeirahm, Dubai and 6 Grosvenor Hill Court, 15 Bourdon Street London were found to be in his name, the charge sheet added. “Sanjay Bhandari tried to alienate these properties from those foreign assets owned by him and the company in which he is beneficial owner and controlled by him creating certain back dated documents related to a trust,” it added. ED says that Bhandari was trying to use the trust structure in order to alienate his foreign assets and properties to conceal proceeds of crime and to project that those foreign assets were held by him in fiduciary capacity as a trustee of the trust. For this purpose, Alrahma Trust in the UAE was identified, it said. Bhandari is also under the scanner for allegedly laundering money related to properties allegedly linked to Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra in London, an investigation in which a NRI businessman C C Thampi was arrested by the ED in January this year. Vadra, who was questioned by ED in May last year, has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him.CBI is also probing Bhandari’s roles in the Rs 2,895 crore deal for acquiring Pilatus basic trainer aircraft for the Indian Air Force in 2009. An Interpol red notice is also pending against him. Legal representatives of Bhandari, Kapoor, and Chadha could not be located by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-bhandari-tried-to-alienate-assets-in-uk-says-ed/story-uyoEmkwo4E0y5GvIa6whkM.html
17-10-2020||India||‘Diversity Built Britain’: New coin to honour non-white contribution||The Boris Johnson government will release 2.5 million 50 pence coins on Monday with the words ‘Diversity Built Britain’ to mark what is described as ‘profound contribution’ of minority communities to the history of the United Kingdom, and a shift in the nature of coinage.It is the first of a series of such coins to be issued. Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s office previously confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi’s image is being considered by the Royal Mint on one of the coins. There is also a demand to so honour Indian-origin World War II British spy, Noor Inayat Khan.The background of the new coin features a geodome with a series of interconnecting lines and triangles that form a network. Each part is equal, and symbolises a community of connection and strength.Sunak said: “I have seen first-hand the contribution made by ethnic minority communities to Britain’s history…This coin, and the rest of the series, will act as a fitting tribute to the very profound impact ethnic minority communities have made on Britain”.,Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: “Congratulations to Dominique Evans the designer of The Royal Mint’s new 50 pence coin…Her design is the first in a series of coins The Mint will be producing, celebrating those who have helped shape our national history and culture”.Officials said that the new coin signals the intent of the Royal Mint and Sunak to include a wider range of people on coins and notes in the future. Sunak commissioned the coin following talks with ‘We Too Built Britain’ campaign, which seeks fair representation of minority communities’ contributions across all walks of life. Anne Jessopp, CEO of the Royal Mint, said: “This is one of the most significant coins produced by The Royal Mint, and signals a change in our nation’s coinage”.“For over 1000 years the nation’s story has been told on coins struck by The Royal Mint, but often the contribution of ethnic minority communities has been unrecognised – this marks the beginning of a new chapter with more coins to follow”, she added.Zehra Zaidi of the ‘We Too Built Britain’ campaign said: “Ethnic minority people, as well as all under-represented groups, need to see themselves represented in British institutions. They need to see their contributions to Britain recognized”.“It is a part of an invisible social contract and it can build cohesion, promote a sense of belonging, inspire young people and unite us as a nation, showing that we all have an equal stake in society. We are a diverse, modern and global Britain – let’s show that. This coin helps bridge our nation’s past, its diverse present and its future, looking outward, positively, together”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diversity-built-britain-new-coin-to-honour-non-white-contribution/story-WUR1QbMfyFKBI1c6tz5ZbN.html
17-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India completed its 100 millionth test for Covid sometime on Friday, according to the HT dashboard. By the Indian Council of Medical Research’s count, the number was marginally lower, 92.25 million tests (ICMR has a counting protocol that isn’t followed by all states), which means that the 100-million mark will be crossed in a week, maybe sooner.Still, I’m going to stick with the 100-million-on-Friday mark because the test numbers on the HT dashboard are the ones we use for measuring the positivity rate.Only the US (around 122 million) and China (160 million) have done more tests than India. Even in terms of tests per million, at 100 million tests, India has conducted around 77,000 tests per million of the population. That translates into 7.7% of the population — adequate according to most experts if the trace-isolate-treat protocol that follows the tests is stringent enough. Unfortunately, it rarely is, not just in India, but in most parts of the world. Also Read| Covid: Daily RT-PCR tests touch record 15,000-mark, cases above 3,000 in DelhiThe 100 million number also includes retests. And it includes not just molecular tests such as the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests but also rapid antigen tests (RATs). I’ve written extensively about the indiscriminate use of the latter, in contexts in which it doesn’t make sense for them to be used, and in huge numbers (especially in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where they account for most of the tests conducted; even Delhi uses far too many rapid tests for its own good — and for the good of its people). Still, 100 million is 100 million, and for a country that started with the capacity of a few laboratories and a few thousand tests in late February and March, the number marks a tremendous achievement. India, as Dispatch 176 on October 7 pointed out first, has seen off the first wave and is in the lull between that and the sure-to-come second wave. Given this, and the testing milestone, how are Indian states doing?The table accompanying this piece lists 11 states that together account for 79% of India’s cases, 82% of its tests and 70% of its tests as of Thursday evening. Sure, 10 is a better number but I picked 11 because Bihar is the 11th on the list in terms of number of cases and its numbers are interesting.Of the 11, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have the lowest positivity rates — the number of people testing positive to tests conducted, 2.3% and 3.6%, respectively. The average of these 11 states is 8.3%, a number skewed upward by Maharashtra’s high case number and positivity rate. The national average is 7.4% (according to the HT dashboard). Interestingly, if the case fatality rate is a proxy of the quality of a state’s health system — it should be — then Bihar, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana are more similar than most people would expect. Kerala has the lowest case fatality rate of 0.34%; Odisha’s is 0.43%; Bihar’s is 0.48%; and Telangana’s 0.57%. The only other state among the 11 with a case fatality rate lower than 1% is Telangana. The case fatality rate of these 11 states is 1.56%, marginally higher than India’s 1.52%. Uttar Pradesh’s case fatality rate, at 1.46%, is actually lower than the national number.It’s difficult to explain Uttar Pradesh and Bihar’s low positivity rate (and we won’t try to). There might be a possible explanation for the low case fatality rates in Kerala because the state does have an excellent public health system. And there might be a possible explanation for the low case fatality rates in Bihar because the infections started showing up in the state well after they did in many others, and both nationally and internationally, health care systems have become better at saving lives as the pandemic has progressed. Does that explain rates as low as 0.34% and 0.48%? Uttar Pradesh’s numbers are at least internally consistent — it has few cases, but the proportion of deaths is almost the same as the national number.Just like the mystery surrounding Africa’s numbers — I wrote about this in Dispatch 154 on September 10 — that surrounding Uttar Pradesh and Bihar’s extremely low positivity rate and Bihar’s low case fatality rate need studying, for it could hold answers on managing the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-2qMdKRSm4XrDaHOg0Gcd1L.html
17-10-2020||India||Construction of New Parliament building unlikely to start this year: Officials||The construction of the new Parliament building proposed to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate may not begin this year, officials familiar with the development said.Tata Projects Limited emerged as the lower bidder for the tender to construct the new Parliament complex by quoting a bid of ₹861.90 crore when the financial bids for the project opened on September 16 and it was awarded the contract to construct the building on September 29. Officials involved in overseeing the project say the construction may begin by early next year around January or February after the winter session of Parliament .The winter session of Parliament is usually held around mid-November to mid- December.“Construction work is yet to begin. Tata Projects has just been awarded the contract and the work for civil construction will take time. It will take at least two months for them to mobilise labour and begin construction work on the site. As per the order, at least 60 days are provided for mobilising. We will work on shifting the reception area of the Parliament building to clear space and some small structures and offices will also have to be shifted,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.Tata Projects did not respond to a request for comment on the issue. The deadline for completing the new Parliament complex is 2022. According to Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) order, the construction is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the “highest standards of quality and workmanship”.CPWD has specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled in stone masonry, carving, and fresco, and adequate health and safety measures will need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.CPWD, which is the project implementation arm of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, specified that the existing Parliament building shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project.The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with a large number of workers, supervisors and professional engineers, the bid document had said. “In view of high degree of security concerns at site and the work itself, stringent access control measures shall be exercised for entry and exit of manpower, material and construction equipment,” it stated.The new Parliament building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures. The design for the ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building is also in its final stages.India’s national emblem is likely to sit atop the new Parliament building, according to the latest design iteration prepared for the tendering process, replacing a spire that was meant to come up in an earlier version, HT reported on September 16.The central foyer will have a Constitution Hall that will display an original copy of the Constitution for public viewing. A library will also come up near the central foyer.The triangular complex is designed to include 120 offices with six separate entrances for members of the public, MPs and VIPs, including the Speaker and the vice president. The new Parliament will house larger chambers for the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha; the latter has been designed to accommodate 1,350 MPs in case of joint sessions. The public gallery will seat more than 336 persons.The Centre will also begin work on construction of a common secretariat proposed under the Central Vista redevelopment plan by next year, officials said. A plot of 15 acres has been identified by the Centre to relocate IGNCA near Jamnagar House work on which will begin soon.Experts also cautioned against construction as the air quality deteriorates in the region. “The environment clearance for the Parliament was not based on a detailed environment impact assessment... More than any other project, the construction of Parliament should have taken into account air quality concerns before initiating construction activity. Both the project proponents and government are aware of air quality concerns in the country, and in this particular case, Delhi-NCR. Yet they have risked initiating construction only based on a pre-determined timeline that is economically fragile, environmentally unsound and socially unjust,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-of-new-parliament-building-unlikely-to-start-this-year-officials/story-7MkyHv9qAcQXHZygZpMb9L.html
17-10-2020||India||Farm fires increase in Punjab, Haryana despite assurances||New Delhi/Karnal/Chandigarh: This year, the stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has gone unabated primarily because of the reluctance of the local administration to act against offenders due to ongoing farmer protests in the two states. The result: Delhi and its neighbouring areas are grappling with deteriorating air quality that could aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic in the region, officials said.On Thursday, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh claimed that Delhi’s air pollution problem was because of local factors, but data from the Punjab University’s Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, shows a three-fold spike in stubble burning incidents in Punjab as compared to 2019 (3,996 incidents from September 21 to October 15 as compared 1,266 in same period last year), with just six farmers booked for farm fires. These numbers are higher than the India Meteorological Department’s own, but are directionally similar -- that too points to a three-fold increase in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana this harvest season. Haryana has done slightly better that Punjab with 71% more stubble burning incidents for same period. According to Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), until October 15, 1,835 active fire locations (AFL) were reported from the state against 1,072 during the same period last year.Officials in the two states also said on condition of anonymity said stubble burning started at the time farmer bodies were protesting against three farm bills approved in the winter session of Parliament and any action against the stubble burners could have aggravated the situation on the ground.Also Read: AAP, BJP trade charges over farm fires, pollution“We have to act with caution as tempers were high,” explained a Punjab government official, when asked that why not many farmers were booked for stubble burning. A Haryana government official added that there was reluctance to act against the farmers as it could have added “fuel” to the farmers’ ongoing agitation.Farmers burn paddy stubble to clear the fields for sowing of winter wheat crop, 90% of which is procured by the government to sustain the Public Distribution System (PDS). The fires send fumes into air causing massive pollution across the entire northern plains.Also Read| Residue to riches: Stubble no trouble for Punjab’s change agents Almost all of south Punjab, which includes districts such as Bathinda, Mansa and Fazilka, and Haryana’s Rohtak, Sonepat and Panipat districts, abutting Delhi, showed a spurt in farm fires on the fire map of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration . According to air pollution experts, the north easterly winds brings pollutants from farm fires in the two states and smoke, which mix with local emissions causing a spike in pollution levels in the National Capital Region. “We are seeing a spurt as local emission load in area within a 70 km radius of Delhi is also very high,” said an air pollution scientist at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, who asked not to be named. He added that the stubble burning has resulted in an increase in pollution levels across northern plains.On Friday, several NCR towns such as Baghpat, Rohtak, Faridabad, and Gurugram reported poor to very poor air quality. This was actually a marginal improvement from Thursday, as wind speed improved helping in quicker dispersal of pollutants. Delhi has been in the poor or very poor category for the past week.There are several reasons for the spurt in farm fires this year. The paddy harvest season this year in the two food bowl states of India started earlier than in 2019 because of long dry period that started in early September. Last year, the monsoon rains lashed the northern plains till October 15 delaying the peak harvest season to the first week of October. This year, harvest started from September 18 and procurement from September 26.Paddy procurement commenced in Punjab and Haryana from September 26 due to early arrival of the crop, while in other states, it started from October 1, said a food ministry statement. Until Thursday 4.358 million tonnes of paddy had arrived in the markets of Punjab, exactly double of the last year’s corresponding arrivals In Haryana also, the paddy procurement is double of last year.The early harvest resulted in an early spike in farm fires. According to Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) the period from September 21 to October 5, saw a five-time increase in farm fires as compared to 2019. Haryana reported double the number of farm fires for same period.S Narayanan, member secretary Haryana State Pollution Control Board said the rise in farm fires was because of early harvest. “We have issued advisories to district collectors to take action against offenders,” he said.Punjab pollution board member secretary Krunesh Garg said that it is too early to reach a conclusion even though the present scenario was worrisome. “I am sure the current season will end with fewer number of cases as compared to previous year,” he said, adding that over 50,000 cases of stubble fires were reported from the state in the last two years. The reluctance of the two states to act against farmers shows in the number of those booked for stubble burning this year. In Punjab, only six farmers have been booked against 1,706 booked in 2019. According to officials, environment cess of Rs 21 lakh has been collected from 806 farmers as compared to 14,200 on whom this penalty was imposed last year. “Police is not taking any chances especially when farm bodies are agitating in state over new farm laws enacted in the Parliament last month,” said a senior agriculture department official.In Haryana, the number of farmers booked this year is about 60% less than last year. Even as 374 incidents of farm fires were reported from Karnal district, only two FIRs have been registered and around 30 farmers have been fined for Rs 68000.Local officials also said as ground level functionaries were busy in procurement of the record paddy harvest in the two states, the monitoring of farm fires was poor. Agriculture and revenue department officials are deployed to check farm fires but this year because of record harvest they were posted for quick procurement. “Farmers were protesting and procurement was becoming a political issue,” said a Haryana agriculture department official, pointing at farmer protest in Kurukshetra over delay in paddy procurement.But, then some farmers also cleared their fields quickly for growing vegetables which are fetching a good price in retail markets.“The increase in the prices of vegetables in retail markets have lured the farmers to burn the crop waste and prepare the fields to grow vegetables such as potato, cauliflower, reddish, peas and carrot,” said Rajiv Kumar, a farmer from Haryana’s Shahsbad.A farmer of Punjab’s Bathinda district, Paramjit Singh, said he has already cleared farms to grow cabbage, which is fetching a good price in the market. The price of cauliflower in Delhi’s Azadpur market on Friday was between Rs 30 to Rs 60 per kilogram and for potato it was between Rs 17 to Rs 40 per kilogram, about 40% higher than the price in the same period last year.However, officials in two states claimed that subsidised machines were provided to farmers for stubble management.Garg said the farmers were using machines supplied by the government for crop residue management to clear stubble and said the impact would be visible in the coming days. Punjab’s former secretary agriculture Kahan Singh Pannu, said 23,500 machines were supplied to the farmers this season out of which 15,000 are super seeders. “With this machine crop residue management would become very easy,” said Pannu who retired on August 31, after working on stubble management since 2010. But some officials admitted that only big farmers were getting benefit of the subsdised machines. “Providing subsidised implements will not help as most of the subsidies are being taken by the big farmers and the benefit does not reach small farmers. The government must reach out to small farmers who are around 80% (of all farmers),” said a senior official of Haryana agriculture department, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-fires-increase-in-punjab-haryana-despite-assurances/story-Mz3Rpc1l1p4tDftDoySQCK.html
17-10-2020||India||CBI, US dept unearth ₹190 crore tech fraud||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the US Justice Department cracked down on a technical support fraud scheme allegedly masterminded by an American citizen and recovered assets worth ₹190 crore in raids conducted last month on six companies involved in the fraud.Michael Brian Cotter (59) of Glendale, California, allegedly worked with accomplices in call centres in several Indian cities over the past decade on the scheme that is believed to have defrauded hundreds of elderly American citizens, the US Justice Department said in a statement. The CBI moved in parallel with the US justice department filing a complaint in a court in Florida. The anti-corruption probe agency recovered assets worth ₹190 crore apart from gold worth ₹55 lakh, ₹25 lakh cash and a plethora of digital evidence indicating alleged nefarious activities of at least six companies based in Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. These companies were raided by the CBI last month. The agency is collaborating with other friendly countries as well against the fraudsters who allegedly took control of computers remotely of the users by sending them a pop-up message of malware presence on their systems, said CBI spokesperson R K Gaur in a statement on Friday. Praising CBI, the US Justice Department described the operation as the first parallel action by the US and Indian governments against defrauding of elderly American citizens. The statement cited CBI officials as saying that the agency would continue its close collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and promote cooperation with US law enforcement agencies on cybercrime and cybersecurity. CBI has been working to identify and dismantle networks of transnational cyber fraud operated out of India, the officials said. In response to the complaint filed in the US, a federal court issued a temporary restraining order that directed Cotter and five companies to stop engaging in the technical support fraud scheme. The complaint was filed by the civil division’s consumer protection branch and the US attorney’s office for the southern district of Florida and the action was coordinated by the Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force established last year to combat foreign fraud schemes targeting American senior citizens. According to the complaint, those engaged in the scheme contacted US consumers via internet pop-up messages that falsely appeared to be security alerts from Microsoft or another reputed company. These messages fraudulently claimed the consumer’s computer was infected by a virus, and then purported to run a scan that “falsely confirmed the presence of a virus and malware”. The consumers were provided a toll-free number to call for assistance and were connected to India-based call centres allegedly participating in the fraud. Call centre employees asked the victims to give them remote access to computers and said they had detected viruses or malware. Then, the employees falsely diagnosed non-existent problems and allegedly asked the victims to pay hundreds of dollars for unnecessary services and software. Cotter allegedly facilitated the scheme through several companies, including Singapore-registered Global Digital Concierge Pte Ltd, formerly known as Tech Live Connect Pte Ltd, Nevada-registered companies Sensei Ventures Incorporated and NE Labs Inc, New York-registered Kevisoft LLC, and UK-registered Kevisoft UK Ltd. The restraining order issued by the court dismantled the US-based infrastructure, including websites and payment processing relationships. The complaint alleged that, since at least 2011, Cotter worked with co-conspirators in India to operate the scheme, including registering website domains, setting up shell companies, and entering into relationships with banks and payment processors to facilitate collection of funds from the victims. The scheme was brought to the Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force’s attention by Microsoft. Acting assistant attorney general Jeffrey Bossert Clark said: “The department of justice sincerely appreciates CBI’s efforts to disrupt and prosecute technical support fraud, government imposter fraud, and all other schemes directed at the American public.” “The FBI works with its local, state, federal and international partners to combat technical fraud schemes,” said Charles Spencer, assistant director of the international operations division, FBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-us-dept-unearth-190-crore-tech-fraud/story-YrQxV88ryuIf1dsaT8cdLJ.html
17-10-2020||India||Hathras case: STF likely to probe ‘ploy’ to incite caste violence||The Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) is likely to probe the case related to the alleged conspiracy to incite caste violence in the backdrop of the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, senior government authorities said on Friday. A state government official said on condition of anonymity that the government is considering asking UP STF to conduct a detailed investigation of the alleged conspiracy on the basis of initial findings by a three-member Special Investigation Team headed by home secretary Bhagwan Swaroop in the incident. This person added that the probe would likely focus on 19 first information reports (FIR) lodged in seven districts in connection with allegations that some political groups and other organizations were trying to incite caste-related violence. According to him, the main FIR, filed at the Chandpa police station in Hathras, invoked charges of sedition, promoting enmity, inciting caste-based violence and other sections of the Indian Penal Code against unknown people and groups.Also Read: ‘Blood-coloured’ clothes found at Hathras rape accused’s house, kin say it’s red paintThe UP government, which forcibly cremated the body of the woman , with her immediately family not present, has maintained that much of the outrage following the woman’s death from injuries sustained during the assault, and the forced cremation, was orchestrated by enemies of the state. The Allahabat High Court has already come down hard on the state for the forced cremation and said this was a violation of the human rights of the victim as well as the family. The government official claimed an initial probe into the matter has revealed that some people raised funds through a website, which had now been taken down, to foment caste violence in the backdrop of the Hathras incident. Four people including a journalist, allegedly linked to the Popular Front of India (PFI) and its associate body, Campus Front of India (CFI, were arrested in Mathura on October 5. The official said the STF probe would also focus on people and groups behind justiceforhathrasvictim.carrd.co that hosted information about date, time and location of protests that swept India over the past week. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is already probing the monetary angle and sources of illegal funds raised through the website while the case of gang rape and murder is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Central Bureau of Investigation meanwhile, found clothes with what look like blood-stains at the house of Luv Kush Sikarwar, one of the four accused in the gang rape.

The Heads of Department may mandate attendance of more than 50%, if required in public interest, while strictly ensuring that social distancing is maintained under all circumstances,” it said. HT has seen the DoPT order.The officials have been directed to follow staggered timings to avoid over-crowding in offices and been advised to follow two shifts -- from 9.00 am to 5.30 pm, and from 10.00 am to 6.30 pm. The department has exempted officials residing in containment zones from attending officer till such a zone is denotified. “Persons with Disabilities and Pregnant women employees shall continue to work from home till further orders,” the DoPT order stated. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“Those officers/staff who are not attending office shall work from home and they should be available on telephone and electronic means of communication at all times,” it added. It has also asked all heads of departments to ensure that the ‘National Directives for the Covid-19 management, which include instructions issued for regular sanitization/cleaning of working places, maintenance of social distancing norms, wearing of masks etc. are strictly complied with’. “Meetings, as far as possible, shall be conducted on video-conferencing and personal meetings with visitors, unless absolutely necessary in public interest, are to be avoided,” the order said. In pursuance with the DoPT directives, the ministry of home affairs in a separate memorandum, issued on October 9, has asked “All Divisional heads to ensure 100% attendance of the officers of the level of US & above and also to mandate the attendance of officials below the level of US as per exigencies of work subject to strict observance of Social Distancing Norms”. Until now, a 100% strength was only required from officials at the level of director and above, with other officials being asked to attend office on alternate days. The government was also considering a work from home policy, but it seems to have been put on hold over privacy concerns regarding confidential documents. “Now its practically 100% attendance in offices, everyone has returned to work,” said a government official on condition of anonymity. “The government has opened up theatres and cinema halls, there are km-long lines outside the Delhi metro. Everyone is taking precautions, sanitisers, masks and Aarogya Setu is compulsory. Work is back in full swing,” the official said.“There were a few Covid-19 cases in our ministry just last week. Since under-secretaries share spaces, it may increase the risk. But people have to return to work at some point,” a second official said, requesting anonymity.More than six months after the Centre imposed a hard lockdown to arrest the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Union home ministry on October 1 moved closer to unlocking almost all activities by allowing a graded restart of schools, partial reopening of movie theatres, and large gatherings including political and religious events.The latest easing of curbs has permitted more activities in areas outside the containment zones including opening up cinemas, theatres and multiplexes with up to 50% of their seating capacity from October 15. In the latest guidelines, the government also allowed flexibility to states and Union Territories to decide on reopening schools and coaching institutions from mid-October in a phased manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-offices-resume-in-full-force-after-order/story-UT57ZqOIQl2u9Rk3meSlaO.html
17-10-2020||Editorials||On GST, a breakthrough | HT Editorial||The Centre has decided to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore and pass it on to states as debt in lieu of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess payments. While this amount is about half the expected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current fiscal year, it is equal to the shortfall the Centre had attributed to GST implementation. The remaining Rs 1.25 lakh crore gap was described as the result of Covid-19’s economic impact. The Centre’s decision to do the borrowing is a change from its earlier stance of asking individual states to borrow their respective shortfall. Whether or not this will end the impasse in the GST Council remains to be seen. Some state governments have asked that the Centre borrow the entire shortfall in compensation cess payments. However, the Centre’s decision will definitely reduce its trust deficit with states.The Centre’s decision to change its stance and the early positive responses of state governments to this decision is welcome. Fiscal federalism is among the central pillars of India’s constitutional framework. It is essential to preserve its sanctity and spirit if India has to further its pro-reform agenda without generating a feeling of bitterness between New Delhi and state capitals. Had the Centre stuck to its earlier stand, this sense of bitterness would have got aggravated, for states believe they have done most of the heavy lifting during the pandemic, with increased expenditure and reduced revenue inflows. The fact that the Centre pulled back reflects a willingness to listen and incorporate democratic feedback. The decision will also avoid uncertainty and unnecessary chaos in financial markets. It would have been a challenge for Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal with individual states raising money on their own. This will also benefit some states, which would have otherwise not got a low interest rate. Some reports suggest that it is RBI which nudged the Centre to borrow rather than leave it to the states. While the Centre insists that the decision will not have any impact on its deficit or borrowing numbers, this seems more like an accounting innovation, which is in keeping with the now institutionalised practice of diverting some of the spending to off-budget items. Ideally, such practices are avoidable. However, this is not the time to overemphasise fiscal discipline. India needs to spend its way out of the recession, and the Centre should lead the charge on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-gst-a-breakthrough-ht-editorial/story-rIQFe9wjPU3Qhn54R96JgL.html
