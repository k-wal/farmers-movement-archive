28-10-2020||News||On digital governance, don’t repeat mistakes||The evolution of data governance is in a state of healthy flux right now. India is simultaneously juggling fundamental questions such as the nature and categories of data, while moving steadfastly on building a regulatory apparatus to govern these. There have now been two versions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, a report on non-personal data, and a variety of other proposals to regulate the digital economy from telemedicine to e-commerce to drones. At a macro-level though, two key problems may emerge. The first is of State overreach and the second is of multiple regulators. India’s past experience — particularly with industrial licensing and regulation of the financial sector — may be useful in informing the future of data governance.There is little disagreement that the State is entrenching itself excessively in the process of regulating the data economy. Both the Personal Data Protection Bill as well as the non-personal Data report contains various clauses and suggestions that mandate compulsory data-sharing with the government. We shouldn’t be surprised at this, considering India’s history with State entrenchments. The Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951, gave the State a number of regulatory powers to dictate the output and prices of industries. This led to suppressing growth and innovation for decades. Almost 70 years later, the data regime is suggesting mandatory sharing of data for businesses on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory(FRAND)-based remuneration. How will the State decide on this remuneration? The same issues that existed with price controls under the industries Act are bound to affect the data economy should we go down this route.In fact, it may be even more problematic, given the value of data changes based on its end-use, other data points available and the intelligence the underlying algorithm can generate. The 4 Vs of data — velocity, volume, veracity and variety — will amplify the problems in setting a price for the data economy. Price controls on data also reduce the incentives for companies willing to invest in the creation of databases — leading to economic and geo-political advantages for other countries. India’s past experience tells us that State-led pricing will be anything but FRAND-friendly, and, therefore, the State must step away rather than jump in.The more important issue is the creation of multiple regulators to regulate data in the country. There is a proposed regulator for non-personal data as well as for e-commerce, in addition to the Data Protection Authority (DPA) to be set up. These regulators may be aimed at different aspects of the data economy, yet the significant overlaps among them can’t be ignored. Consider an instance where non-personal data linked to an individual’s IP address, which is easily re-identifiable, could be used for targeted advertising for an e-commerce platform. This could lead to similar battles between regulators as seen in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) on regulating Unit-Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs). IRDAI had to step in because ULIPs were provided by insurance companies and SEBI had to do so because these consisted of money invested in the market generating returns. In other jurisdictions, ULIPs are transferred by insurance companies to asset management companies, and kept in check by market regulators. But this is barred in India, leading to a complex structure of financial regulation. We see ourselves making the same mistake with data governance too.Specifically, two key issues arise out of such confusion — uncertainty for businesses and increased cost of regulatory compliance. The Economic Survey (2018-19) shows that policy uncertainty in India was at its highest in 2011-12, directly affecting the input costs, especially the cost of capital or borrowings for firms. This led to the subsequent dampening of investment by businesses for the next few quarters. The digital economy is no different. Multiple regulators will exacerbate these already existing fissures — for instance, India’s draft e-commerce policy is already being criticised for bringing in uncertainty for investors.Multiple regulators also lead to the possibility of a lack of oversight, given that each authority presumes another regulator is responsible for regulating that issue. The Personal Data Protection Bill earmarks mergers and acquisitions as one area where data can be processed without user-consent — but this could have adverse competition and privacy concerns and can largely become an area overlooked by both the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and DPA. All this is due to unclear jurisdictions and no demarcation of authority across regulators. This problem was one of the contributing factors to the 2008 financial crisis, with the United States having at least nine regulators for the financial sector alone. India should applaud itself for adopting a holistic approach to economic regulation of data. But, while keeping the complexities of data in mind, it should not forget the complexities of regulation learnt from its own experience across sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-digital-governance-don-t-repeat-mistakes/story-J7XLYEzESd2Vw5FSuBzBkO.html
28-10-2020||News||How India’s economy is recovering rapidly from the pandemic||The popular story of the shepherd boy who repeatedly cried “wolf” even though there was none has been heard over many generations now. The story seems to be repeating itself in today’s India but in a different form, with the Opposition constantly painting doomsday scenarios about the economy. However, the emerging economic data, in the wake of the pandemic, tells a different story. The pandemic has led to a huge economic setbacks for many nations and India is no exception. From supply chain disruptions to reduced consumer activity, from the plunge in trade to the near-collapse of certain industries, the world is going through one of the most difficult times in collective memory. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi put human lives before the distress in the economy caused by the lockdown. After all, in a pre-lockdown poll, 64% of the people wanted the government to choose to save lives, even if it meant a slower economic revival. The philosophy of the government evolved dynamically with changing scenarios, from jaan hain toh jahan hain (if one is alive, there is a world) for the first lockdown to jaan bhi, jahan bhi (life also, world also) subsequently, and, finally, jan se lekar jag tak (from an individual to humanity), before the the Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) campaign. The government launched the world’s largest food security scheme for 800 million people coupled with cash transfers of ₹1.7 lakh crore under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme. Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) were put on hold for six months; ₹18,000 crore was released for taxpayers; foreign direct investment (FDI) norms were changed to protect Indian companies from opportunistic acquisitions; collateral-free loans and bank guarantees were announced for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); tax deadlines were increased significantly to give relief to taxpayers; and One Nation One Ration Card schemes were implemented. The overall economic package of ₹20 lakh crore, that is, 10% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) became the financial spine for a self-reliant India. The government’s effort has been to fight back and not just soldier on through the pandemic. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection is ₹95.5 thousand crore for September, a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth of 4%. Similarly, power consumption saw 4.6% Y-o-Y growth in September at 113.5 billion units. The rail freight is up 15% in comparison with the corresponding period during the previous years. The e-way bills, in terms of value, have surged past the previous year levels in September reflecting a positive Y-o-Y growth in logistics. In the first fortnight of September, petrol consumption grew by 2% and diesel consumption grew by 5.5% compared to the previous years. These numbers indicate not only a recovery of the supply chain but also a surge forward of sorts. Exports stood at $27.4 billon in September (up by 5.27% in comparison to the corresponding period last year). The Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) too jumped to an eight- year high of 56.8. The consumption of flat steel and long steel was down by only 5% and 10% respectively in August as against 43% and 15%, respectively, in June. This shows that the real estate sector is changing gears and accelerating. The aviation sector, too, has started showing much greater improvement than forecasted. The average number of weekly air travellers increased from about 38,000 in the week starting May 29 to a whopping 135,000 in the week beginning September 25. While many countries announced immediate measures to ease the strain caused by the virus, India found opportunity in adversity through the implementation of long-term goals. These numbers tell the story of belief in the human spirit over forecasting; the same human spirit which pushed India to become a global manufacturing hub for Personal Protective Equipment kits and masks. The encouraging numbers are testimony to the PM’s inspirational call to the country to go from being at a standstill to moving at warp speed.Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is Union minister, Jal Shakti ministry The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-india-s-economy-is-recovering-rapidly-from-the-pandemic/story-ny96v4BJapSkEg4BDd6xGM.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar taunts Maharashtra Governor regarding his book||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar again targeted Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over his “secular” jibe at chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray regarding the opening of temples in the state. On Wednesday, Pawar said that the coffee table book published by the Governor’s office on September 11, on completion of the first year of his five-year term has covered most of the events with photos, except the hastily-planned swearing-in ceremony for former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The NCP leader pointed out that the book also doesn’t mention his advice on secularism to Thackeray.Pawar took this dig in a letter sent to the Governor, expressing his gratitude for sending him the coffee table book titled Janrajyapal: Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The book was published by the Governor’s secretariat after Koshyari completed one year in office recently. A copy of the book was sent to various dignitaries including Pawar.“I am sincerely thankful to you for sending me the ‘self-famous’ coffee table book titled ‘Janrajyapal: Bhagat Singh Koshyari… In reality, the Constitution of India has no mention of the term ‘Janrajyapal’. Despite this, the book is being published by the state government, which throws light on your limited tenure of one year,” the letter stated.“I found out that the book has pictures from many events of your limited tenure such as reception ceremonies, convocation ceremonies, meeting with high ranking dignitaries, social and cultural programs except one or two swearing-in ceremonies,” Pawar wrote, while taunting Koshyari for the early morning swearing-in ceremony of the three-day government led by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.“Similarly, the information about your advice to the honourable chief minister of Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray) on secularism and later, honourable Union minister for home affairs’ (Amit Shah) response to it, could not be seen in the book… However, I again thank you for sending an account of your historic career,” he added.Koshyari recently stoked controversy after he wrote to the CM on October 12 about reopening places of worship in the state amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic, and asked if Thackeray, who is also the president of the ruling Shiv Sena, had “suddenly turned secular”. In response, Thackeray reminded the Governor that secularism was one of the tenets of the Constitution that he (Koshyari) swore upon while taking oath as Maharashtra Governor.When asked, Shah had said that he (Governor) could have chosen better words. “I have gone through the letter. He has made a passing reference. However, I feel he should have been more restrained in his choice of words,” Shah had told a news channel.Following it, Pawar had remarked that any person, who had self-respect, would have resigned from the position of the Governor after being publicly rebuked by the Union home minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-taunts-maharashtra-governor-regarding-his-book/story-eIXaBzCK7vobXaiUH39gIN.html

The complainant, Naresh Haran, who runs a spare vehicle parts business in Grant Road, in his statement said that was waiting for an autorickshaw near Jarimari temple in Bandra around 4pm when the incident took place. An autorickshaw came near him and the two accused got out of the vehicle with knife in hand. They asked Haran to board the autorickshaw and directed the driver to head towards Andheri. The accused threatened to kill Haran if he did not hand over his valuables, said Bandra police officers. A police officer said, “The two took him to Andheri via Milan subway. Then they stopped the autorickshaw near an ATM and asked him to withdraw all the money from his account. The accused later dropped him somewhere in Andheri (West) and escaped.” A first information report (FIR) has been registered against the two unidentified men under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 362 (abduction), 367 (kidnapping or abducting in order to subject person to grievous hurt, slavery, etc) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Bandra police have tracked the autorickshaw which was used in the crime after scanning CCTV footage. The auto driver told the police that the accused had threatened him as well and forced him to follow their instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-men-abduct-businessman-rob-him-at-knifepoint-in-mumbai/story-eiKBJnZgpiaGIKyrZ2N9xJ.html
28-10-2020||City||Delhi University V-C’s suspension evokes mixed reactions from teachers||New Delhi: The union education ministry’s decision on Wednesday to suspend Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi and order an inquiry against him for alleged misuse of power and dereliction of duties after a nod from President Ram Nath Kovind drew mixed reactions from teachers of the university’s departments and its affiliated colleges.A section of teachers said action against Tyagi was long pending, while others raised concern over the ministry’s intervention and its possible impact on the university’s autonomy. Tyagi’s tenure has been riddled with protests by the teaching community over delayed appointments, vacant posts, pending promotions and alleged administrative negligence. In December last year, thousands of DU teachers had barged into the Viceregal Lodge and later camped outside his office, demanding absorption for ad-hoc teachers. Their strike continued for more than a month. DU has more than 4,500 ad-hoc teachers who are appointed on a contractual basis for four months and absorbing them had been a longstanding demand of the teaching community.On Wednesday, the department of higher education cited these reasons to suspend Tyagi, pending a Visitorial inquiry into the allegations. Tyagi’s tenure was set to end in March and the university will initiate the process of forming a search committee for the next vice-chancellor. Rajib Ray, president of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), said the decision came in too late. “Last year, our association had submitted a white paper to the ministry and the Visitor on the same issues listed in today’s order. We had asked for the V-C’s removal, citing a total collapse of the functioning of statutory bodies, breakdown of academic growth and research, and leaving key posts vacant. Unfortunately, the ministry’s intervention came only after the ruling dispensation was divided into two factions and was fighting against one another amid a transition of power.” Despite repeated requests, Tyagi did not comment on the matter. Executive council member Rajesh Jha, who is also a member of the teachers’ group, Academics for Action and Development, pointed out the same reasons. “This situation arose out of a sheer power struggle within the ruling establishment. Huge financial sums remained unspent due to V-C’s inaction, which must be returned. The ministry, too, hasn’t done anything to implement its own December 5 letter over the absorption of ad-hoc teachers. We demand the absorption and speedy promotions for salvaging the university,” he said. Some teachers sounded a note of caution, saying the ministry’s intervention can affect the autonomous nature of the university. Pankaj Garg, convener of the teachers’ group, INTEC, said, “While a Visitorial inquiry into the administrative lapses of the V-C during four-and-a-half years is a decision in the right direction, he could have been sent on a continuous leave pending inquiry instead of being suspended as it may set a wrong precedent for the future.” Principals across affiliated colleges had mixed reactions to offer. Requesting anonymity, a principal, who has been associated with the university for over three decades, said, “DU was sent into a tail spin, which has never been seen in its history. There have been unreasonable stands by the V-C, including the recent flurry of appointments and the intervention of ministry was warranted.” An official, who wished not to be named, said, “The question of the ministry intervention is not valid since the Visitor of the University ‒ the President of India ‒ has now ordered it and suspended the V-C. As per DU’s norms, the visitor can intervene and take a call.”Another principal of a north campus college said the manner in which the V-C was suspended was unceremonious. “The head of the institute could have been sent on a leave instead of being suspended,” the principal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-university-v-c-s-suspension-evokes-mixed-reactions-from-teachers/story-YfCvs2l0qpaEGGUc3Fc0DO.html

He wrote that he wished to transfer his share to his daughter-in-law and the transfer permission for this was accorded by the estate officer.But while getting the transfer deed executed, the tehsil officer informed him that their software will only accept stamp papers for the entire property and not just his share.He wrote that he had already made several requests to the HSVP CITO for making necessary amendments to the transfer permission software to aid execution of the transfer deed.Similarly, Hemant Kinger, another resident said, “My relative wishes to register the second floor of a building. The software is picking collector rate of all three floors, increasing the registry rate.”For the past three days, I am regularly going to the deputy commissioner’s office, but got no respite, he added.Tehsildar Punyadeep Sharma said, “We have written to the IT Cell of HSVP and hopefully the issue will be solved by next week.”Sharma said the problem started after different software of the development authority and other departments were merged, but it was being rectified.Despite repeated text messages, calls and e-mails, neither Pankaj Yadav nor Sanjay Kumar reverted with their comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/glitch-in-transfer-permission-software-leaves-property-owners-in-panchkula-vexed/story-VLK0xYTkmAKosF93HpG8yN.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Mayors meet L-G, demand clearing of dues by Delhi govt||Mayors from the three municipal corporations of Delhi — led by Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and other BJP MLAs —on Wednesday met lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal over the alleged non-payment of dues by the state government to the corporations. The delegation submitted a memorandum to the L-G and sought his intervention on the issue of the payment of Rs 13,000 crore that the government allegedly owes to the civic bodies.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, south corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh and east corporation mayor Nirmal Jain were part of the delegation that met the L-G.Bidhuri said that MLAs and mayors had requested Baijal to look into the matter of payment of dues, including Rs 10,000 crore property tax, from the Delhi government.“We have requested the L-G to direct the Delhi government to immediately pay corporations their Rs 13,000 crore dues and Rs 10,000 that they owe in property tax. The rigid behaviour of the Delhi government towards non-payment of dues is adversely affecting salary disbursal of civic employees,” Bidhuri said.Jai Prakash, mayor of north corporation, said the BJP delegation sought the intervention of the L-G in solving the financial crisis as funds were being withheld by the Delhi government.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Tuesday alleged “corruption and mismanagement” in the BJP-ruled municipal corporations. Kejriwal had also claimed that his government had been paying 3-4 times more funds to the three municipal corporations since 2015, as compared to previous regimes in Delhi.Teachers and doctors of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have been protesting against non-payment of their salaries for the last 3-4 months. The north civic body, however, on Tuesday claimed to have paid salaries of doctors up to September 2020 and salaries of sanitation employees and domestic breeding checkers up to August 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayors-meet-l-g-demand-clearing-of-dues-by-delhi-govt/story-0BYVGdI3qs5qF1THEeb5qI.html

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Promote decisions of MVA government, start enrolment drive in Maharashtra: Uddhav Thackeray to Shiv Sena leaders||With the first anniversary of the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government a month away, party chief and Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray directed the Sena’s district presidents to carry forward the decisions taken by MVA government to the people. Thackeray, who held a meeting with district chiefs of the party late on Tuesday evening via video-conference, also directed them to carry out a drive to enrol a minimum of 30,000 new party members in each of the 288 assembly seats.State environment and tourism minister and Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray, in a tweet, said, “Like every month, last night Shiv Sena chief, and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray interacted with Shiv Sena district chiefs. He directed them to tackle Covid issue, give support to farmers, and take the public service done by the Maha Vikas Aghadi to every citizen.”A senior party functionary said that Thackeray, in his address to district heads, stressed on promoting the work done by the government, including loan waivers, tackling of the Covid-19 outbreak, and the recently-announced crop compensation. “A large period of the first year has gone into [handling] the pandemic, but there were several decisions taken for the people, including loan waiver, etc. Uddhav ji has asked us to spread it [information] in our district. He asked us to help out farmers for spot assessments and to avail the compensations,” the functionary said.A district functionary of the party from north Maharashtra said that the party will start campaigns to spread the word on the MVA government’s decisions. “There has been such a negative campaign by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since the government was formed, then coronavirus [pandemic] started. We will inform people in our districts of the work done by the government. There will be a publicity exercise around the first anniversary; we will put up hoardings, distribute flyers, etc,” he said.In a bid to expand the base of the party, the Sena chief has directed all leaders to start enrolment drives. The senior party functionary added that a target of minimum 30,000 new members has been set for each assembly seat. “The idea is to form a critical base in the district, which, over a period of time can translate into votes for the party. The exercise will help the party strengthen in regions it is strong, and also build on regions where traditionally it has been weak, for instance, Vidarbha,” the functionary said.A Sena district head from western Maharashtra said, “Currently, we cannot have enrolment drives in the traditional format with a pandal, etc, due to Covid-19. However, we will start a door-to-door campaign keeping Covid-19 precautions or distribute forms in a targeted manner. We are looking at 6,000-7,000 families to register in every constituency.”Reacting to Thackeray’s appeal to Shiv Sena district leaders, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said there is no need to draw any other conclusion from the statement as all have the right to strengthen their own parties. “Everyone has the right to strengthen its own party. I have been hearing the statement on waving Shiv Sena’s saffron flag on its own since last 30 years. There is no need to draw any other conclusion,” Pawar told reporters in Nashik.He said that the decision on making an alliance for local bodies will have to be taken by Thackeray, Balasaheb Thorat, state Congress chief and Jayant Patil, state NCP chief. However, the attempts to keep BJP at bay have given good results so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/promote-decisions-of-mva-government-start-enrolment-drive-in-maharashtra-uddhav-thackeray-to-shiv-sena-leaders/story-yudWXU3UMeJl5mfYkFO0WJ.html

The suspect, Manottam Tyagi who is a native of Amroha, had also fixed a GPS device in the vehicle to trace its movement, the police said, adding that Tyagi had cheated at least seven people using the same modus operandi in the past two years. Prabhat Dixit, station house officer, Sector 24 police station, said that on March 3 this year, a person named Jite Yadav had filed a complaint of vehicle theft. Yadav said he wanted to buy a used car and he found an advertisement on a website. “I contacted the seller and fixed a deal for Maruti Swift VXI for Rs 2.60 lakh. The suspect reached Mamura in Sector 66 and handed over the car. However, he withheld the vehicle’s original registration papers and one key,” Yadav had said in the FIR. According to the police, the suspect had told the victim that the original papers and the second key would be delivered later. Dixit said that Yadav paid Rs 2.10 lakh and said Rs 50,000 will be paid once the papers and key are delivered. Next day, Yadav had parked the car outside his office in Sector 12 when it was stolen. The SHO said that police received information about movement of the suspect near Greater Noida West. “A police team reached the spot and signalled the suspect to stop for checking. The police found that his vehicle had a doctored number plate. The suspect was arrested when he confessed to have stolen the vehicle,” he said. During interrogation, the suspect revealed that he had fixed a GPS device in the vehicle. “I had traced the vehicle using GPS and then stole it after selling to Yadav,” Tyagi told the police. The police have recovered the stolen car, two mobile phones, three fake Aadhar cards, three PAN cards and Rs 10,720 in cash from his possession. The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-sells-his-car-only-to-steal-it-using-duplicate-keys/story-HybngAxZ7LY8CjjV5bsysL.html

The police said that the two boys, aged 13 years and 16 years, were caught red-handed by locals and handed over to the police. According to the police, the incident took place around 8.30pm when the victim was returning from her aunt’s house which is located barely 100 metres from her house.On the basis of a complaint by the girl’s family, the police have registered an FIR under Section 376d (gang rape) of the Indian Penal Code and also levied provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. “While she was returning around 8.30pm, two boys of her neighbourhood accosted her and took her to a nearby vacant house and gang-raped her. During the incident, the girl shouted for help and locals arrived. They nabbed the two boys and handed over to the police. We have received a police complaint in this regard and registered an FIR,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The police said that the boys were known to the girl’s family. “The two were taken in custody on the same night. The girl was sent for medical examination while her statements will also be recorded before a magistrate,” Jadaun added. In the FIR, the girl’s father said that the two suspects gagged his daughter’s mouth while she was returning from her aunt’s house and took her to a room in a vacant house nearby. When locals arrived for help, the boys were in semi-naked condition while the girl was crying for help, said the FIR. In his police complaint, the girl’s father also gave the names of the two suspects. The police said that the room where the incident took place was adjacent to the girl’s house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-10-year-old-girl-gang-raped-by-two-minors/story-u2WyeYU1jCi3UogVRyGGMI.html
28-10-2020||City||Civic funds issue: AAP says BJP trying to defame Kejriwal||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of defaming chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Delhi government over the non-payment of salaries to civic body employees despite having sufficient funds to disburse their paychecks.Senior AAP leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak demanded an apology from the BJP leadership for the inconvenience caused to people due to the strike by municipal doctors and staff over the non-payment of salaries. Pathak also congratulated sanitation workers as the south Delhi municipal corporation withdrew its proposal to privatise sanitation work across Delhi after AAP workers and councillors staged a protest against the move. “For many months, doctors, sanitation workers, and other staff of the MCD are protesting against the non-payment of salaries. And whenever the media, doctors, and nurses asked the BJP leaders the reason, the BJP mayors and leadership came back saying they do not have funds to pay their salaries. But yesterday, all the doctors and workers were paid salaries by the BJP-led MCD. If they did not have funds to pay salaries, where did this money come from?” Pathak said in a press conference on Wednesday. He said this meant the BJP was heavily conspiring to defame the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government. “They just wanted to tarnish the image of the AAP government. The BJP owes the Delhi government nearly Rs 10,000 crore, and we always said we do not owe any funds to the MCD. The AAP wants the BJP leadership to apologise to doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, teachers and other MCD staff because due to their action, the people of Delhi could not get appropriate treatment, pregnant women could not find hospitals as doctors were on strike,” he said. AAP MLA Rakhi Birla said the BJP’s proposal before SDMC’s standing committee to privatise sanitation work was rejected because of the protest staged by AAP workers and MCD councillors.“If the proposal was passed in the house today, all sanitation workers, who mostly belong to Dalit and other backward classes, would become enslaved to private companies. But AAP protested along with the sanitation workers in and outside the house at the Civic Centre. As a result, the proposal was rejected,” Birla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-funds-issue-aap-says-bjp-trying-to-defame-kejriwal/story-Q3yqTRURGjHZ91Wpbjvk7L.html

In the last 24 hours, 68,846 tests were conducted and the positivity rate is 9.81%. The positivity rate for October is 14.2%.Maharashtra’s chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said, “Though there is significant drop in cases, it should not lead to complacency. We are doing our best to bring the CFR down. The number of tests is in accordance with the infection and done as per requirement.”In the last 24 hours, Mumbai (1,354 new cases) and Pune (rural) (313 new cases) were again among the highest contributors of Covid-19 cases in the state.

28-10-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Two foreign nationals arrested for cloning ATM cards, stealing ₹50 lakh||Noida: The Greater Noida police have busted a gang allegedly run by two foreign nationals involved in cloning people’s cards in ATM machines and then fraudulently withdrawing money. The suspects, Omon Benson, 30, from Nigeria and Jonson Usaro, from Kenya, allegedly fixed two cloning devices in ATMs and skimmed over 1,000 cards details and passwords, and withdrew a total of ₹50 lakh from various accounts in three months, said the police. Baljeet Singh, inspector of the Gautam Budh Nagar cyber cell, said the police had received multiple complaints of cyber fraud in recent months. The cases were registered in police stations in Ecotech III, Badalpur, Sector Beta II, Sector 24, Sector 58, areas, etc. On October 4, Arun Kumar Singh, a resident of Kasna, filed a complaint at the Sector Beta II police station alleging that someone fraudulently withdrew ₹10,000 from his bank account. “I received an SMS about the withdrawal. I had not used my debit card or cheque to withdraw money,” he said. A case was registered against unknown persons under Section 66 of the IT Act.More complaints were registered where money was fraudulently withdrawn without the account holder’s knowledge/consent. The inspector said the police team scanned CCTV footage from multiple ATM kiosks and identified two suspects who were seen tampering with the machine. Ankur Aggarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said, “After rewriting the cards, the suspects used to approach unmanned ATM kiosks to withdraw money up to ₹50,000 depending upon the cards’ withdrawal limits and available balance in the bank account. They used to spend some of the money and keep some for their expenses. Police investigation shows rest of the money was sent by them to their native country Nigeria, with the help of Nigerian hawala traders operating in NCR region,” he said.“The cyber cell on Wednesday arrested two foreign nationals from their rented accommodation in Sector Omicron in Greater Noida. We recovered 96 rewritable debit cards, two card cloning modules, two laptops, seven mobile phones, two pinhole cameras, one data card, two pen drives, one memory card, and ₹10,000,” Singh said.“During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they used to place cloning modules in the swipe machines of ATMs and also secretly fixed the pinhole camera to capture the keyboard. Once a customer swiped the card, his/her card details would be cloned. The suspects later removed these devices from ATMs and made rewritable cards for each customer’s stolen data, and then withdrew money illegally,” he said. The inspector said that the suspects had cheated about ₹50 lakh from over 1,000 people in the last six months. “The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-two-foreign-nationals-arrested-for-cloning-atm-cards-stealing-50-lakh/story-dH6aPUDy6l0HJKJlXPUjuM.html

28-10-2020||Noida||Garbage dumping, burning rampant, say Noida residents||Noida: Even as pollution levels spike and environment agencies press for curbs on emission sources, waste burning continues unabated at different places in the city.According to residents, waste dumping and burning is a persistent issue for which they have approached officials of the Noida Authority as well as the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) in the past. While the air quality index (AQI) oscillates between 300 and 400 in the ‘very poor’ category in the region, instances of waste burning have come to light from different residential areas including sectors 123, 51 and 54. “Truck-loads of solid waste are often dumped near our residential apartment complex at night and the same is often set afire. The last time was three days back and the waste also included garbage from drains, apart from horticulture and solid waste. Thick smoke from the fires enters our apartments and causes discomfort,” says Dinesh Singh, an activist and a resident of a highrise in Sector 121, Noida.He added that despite complaints, garbage dumping continues and that anyone can set it afire. “Several instances of burning have been noticed in the past 10-12 days. The issue is that the dumping still continues unabated,” added Singh.The residents of Sector 51 also said that horticulture waste was being burned near their complex. “Dry waste burning in parks is a major issue. We have also registered a complaint on Tuesday. Some days back, a huge pile of dry waste and tree trimmings were set afire in a nearby park and the smoke kept rising for days. We have been also writing to the UPPCB over the same. However the question is why is dry waste being dumped in parks, where any miscreant can set it afire. There should be separate places to dump them,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary, resident welfare association (RWA) Sector 51. He added that several blocks of the sector are affected due to the smoke as it covers the area and given the weather conditions, with negligible wind speed during night hours, it does not disperse so easily.Meanwhile, the UPPCB said that it has recommended to the Noida authority to manage the waste and act against miscreants. “We have inspected the site and asked concerned officials to take action against those responsible. Waste should not be dumped at road sides but it is mostly miscreants who set it afire. Some of the garbage burning instances were not of that big a scale, but even so, concerned officials have been alerted,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.Officials of the Noida authority did not respond to repeated calls and text messages till the time this copy went to print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/garbage-dumping-burning-rampant-say-noida-residents/story-vY0D2w8yHjXkKvg13SvrYO.html

28-10-2020||Noida||Noida: 33% in an online survey says rules are not effectively implemented to contain air pollution||Only a quarter of respondents from Noida believe the district administration was effectively implementing the graded response action plan (Grap) aimed at mitigating air pollution, according to survey of 1,362 people by website LocalCircles.The Supreme Court appointed Environmental pollution (prevention and control) authority [Epca] had drawn up Grap with a number of measures. For the purpose of the survey, the website focussed on four measures -- ban on diesel generator sets, dust control measures at construction sites, ban on garbage burning and mechanised cleaning of roads. According to the survey, of the 75% who believe that Grap was not being fully implemented, a third do not believe that any of the four measures were being effectively enforced, 9% said only two measures were followed and 8% believed that three measures were enforced. The survey was conducted between October 15 and 25 and also sought to know whether they supported the ban on sale of firecrackers.“Only 13% (of 1,416 respondents from Noida) supported the sale of crackers,” said Sachin Taparia chief executive officer of LocalCircles. “While 25% supported the complete ban, 62% said green crackers could be sold.”The so-called green firecrackers are claimed to reduce pollutants by upto 30%. Last year, Delhi-NCR was supposed to sell only these crackers. However, by midnight on the night of Diwali, the concentration of PM2.5 pollutants – the most harmful of all aerosols -- shut up almost 16 times.Dr CV Singh former senior scientist of Haryana state pollution control board and chairman of Doaba Paryavaran Samiti said, “We are failing to mitigate air pollution from Delhi-NCR because the authorities are yet to strictly implement the Grap. Water is not being sprinkled onto roads to keep the dust in check properly, loose soil is yet to covered with grass on footpaths, traffic congestion is not being addressed and burning of solid waste is rampant, hot mix plants are functional among other violations are common causing air pollution.”The Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said, “We are strictly enforcing the provisions to contain air pollution and imposing penalty for violations. Whosoever is found violating the rules is facing punishment as per law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-33-in-an-online-survey-says-rules-are-not-effectively-implemented-to-contain-air-pollution/story-L2IF6tCNKdTIztzfiLs5qO.html
28-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad’s air is health hazard for most days of the current year||For most of this year, Ghaziabad residents have been inhaling particulate matter over and above the prescribed safe limits, according to records from the central pollution control board (CPCB).HT accessed the CPCB records for the 301-day period from January 1 to October 27 and analysed the number of days the city exceeded the safe limits for coarse particulate matter (PM10, that has diameter of less than 10 microns) and ultra fine particulate matter (PM2.5, diameter less than 2.5 microns). According to the CPCB, the standard limit for PM10 is 100 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) while the limit for PM2.5 is 60μg/m³, which are in any case much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) limits of 20 μg/m³ and 10μg/m³, respectively. CPCB has four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad -- Indirapuram, Loni, Sanjay Nagar and Vasundhara. The Indirapuram station recorded 181 days when PM10 safe limits were exceeded, and 120 days when PM2.5 levels were crossed. This affected prime locality of Indirapuram and nearby residential areas of Makanpur, Kanwani etc. Likewise, the Vasundhara monitoring station (which caters to localities of Vasundhara, Vaishali, Kaushambi etc) had high PM10 levels on 191 days, while PM2.5 levels were off on 146 days. Loni was the worst of the four locations with 234 days of high PM10 levels and 156 days for PM2.5. Sanjay Nagar station caters to prime localities of Raj Nagar, Sanjay Nagar and Kavi Nagar saw PM10 levels beyond limits on 194 days while PM2.5 levels were beyond limits on 139 days. “Ghaziabad agencies have no plan to tackle pollution. Constant high levels of PM10 and PM2.5 cause severe health issues for residents and they continue to suffer silently day by day. It is only when winter arrives, officials huddle together to should show some activity and that too due to pressure of CPCB and Supreme Court appointed Environment(Pollution and Control) Authority,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. “We hardly see any activity during the major part of year other than winters when Grap is implemented. Construction works, garbage burning and vehicle emission besides industrial emission take heavy toll of environment and even the health of children, senior citizens are at risk,” said Kuldeep Saxena, coordinator of Confederation of trans-Hindon RWAs which is also contesting a case at the National Green Tribunal for shifting out of landfill site from Indirapuram. Authorities, meanwhile, say they are doing their best.“There has to be zero tolerance towards the pollution and there has to be coordinated efforts of the different cities in the Delhi-NCR region rather than cities trying to tackle pollution on their own. While keeping this in mind, we have recently written to the authorities in Delhi to work jointly to tackle e-waste issues in Loni,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. The Ghaziabad district is one of the 16 districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh which are listed as non-attainment cities in terms of having high levels of pollution. In June last year, the UPPCB has chalked out separate comprehensive action plans for the non-attainment cities including Ghaziabad. “We are taking up different measures listed under the plan. The district is located under the Indo-Gangetic plains and affected by loose soil. Besides, there is growing vehicle base and construction activities which compound pollution issues. On our part, we have ensured that industrial units are operating only when they install air pollution control systems and new ones are given consent to operate only when they have installed the systems,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The medical experts said that prolonged exposure to higher PM10 and PM2.5 levels has formed a vicious cycle which is affecting health of residents especially children and also decreasing their immunity levels in long run. “What we have observed during past 4-5 years that residents have become used to live in such conditions without knowing how much the high pollution levels is affecting them. Prolonged exposure causes respiratory illness, allergies, besides affecting lungs and also proving carcinogenic. We have patients in form of children who are getting affected with asthma and allergies and the numbers increase every year,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-s-air-is-health-hazard-for-most-days-of-the-current-year/story-eaujCdHrDpUbQPBaVZbkEP.html

28-10-2020||City||JNU students served notices, asked to vacate north gate||New Delhi: Jawaharlal Nehru University issued notices to members of the JNU students’ union (JNUSU) over “illegal occupation of the road inside the University North Gate”, eliciting a strong response from the association after one of the notices was issued to a hospitalised student on Wednesday. Since October 17, JNUSU leaders and students are camped at the north gate as a part of an indefinite round-the-clock sit-in to demand phased entry of all research scholars and restart normal academic functioning while following Covid-19 protocols. A small area inside the campus has been barricaded by the students. On Monday, the university issued notices to JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, general secretary Satish Chandra Yadav, and joint secretary Mohammad Danish. Stating that the “illegal occupation” was “causing inconvenience to residents”, the administration on Wednesday asked the students to clear the blockade failing which “strict disciplinary action” would be initiated against them. The students’ outfit, meanwhile, said that it would continue with the protest. “In the most shameful turn of events, a Cyclops security guard was sent to Safdarjung Hospital to serve the threatening notice to (JNUSU joint secretary) Danish who is admitted there on account of dengue and is being administered blood even as we speak,” JNUSU said in a statement. The notice issued by the chief proctor said that as per the report submitted by JNU’s security department, “there is prima facie evidence that Mohammad Danish, along with a group of other students, have blocked the road, erected a tent, and drawn electric connection from the control room of JNU security to the tent.” The administration, however, said the student himself had said that the notice could be delivered to him at the hospital. “The administration had not given any instruction to hand over the notices in a hospital because the administration did not even know he was hospitalised. Security officials, who were given the responsibility to hand over the notices, said they had called the said student and the student himself said that he was in the hospital and the notice could be served to him there,” said a senior JNU official, requesting anonymity. While the university had announced a phase-wise return for final-year PhD scholars of science subjects, JNUSU said it was not enough. “The October 21 circular does not address the issue of submitting research scholars, creates a false binary between science and humanities/social science and is a ploy to suspend entry of students for an indefinite period,” they said in a statement on Wednesday. The notice comes on the anniversary of the fee hike protests that had rocked the university last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jnu-students-served-notices-asked-to-vacate-north-gate/story-Cmx2ULNShy05ZlGaHQy61H.html
28-10-2020||Noida||Noida’s air quality improves, though still in very poor category||Meteorological conditions a day earlier helped improve the air of Noida and Ghaziabad on Wednesday, but Greater Noida’s dipped. Noida breathed the cleanest air since the past week for a while but as the wind speed dropped, the quality dropped again. According to the weather analysts, it’s only between October 30 and November 1 that the wind speed will rise again thereby improving the air quality. “The wind speed on Wednesday was low and around 6 to 8 kilometre per hour (kmph), however on Tuesday it was moderate at a speed of 18 to 20 kmph that had its effect today as well. This is the major reason that the air quality improved on Wednesday as well because the pollutants were dispersed. However, as the wind speed is set to drop, the pollutants may aggregate again,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the data from Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 301 against 320 a day earlier and 376 before that. The AQI for Greater Noida also saw improvement from 332 a day earlier to 324 on Wednesday. The AQI of Ghaziabad however dropped from 306 a day earlier to 317 on Wednesday. “The improvement is remarkable however it’s due to the meteorological conditions a day earlier. The wind speed helped with the dispersion of pollutant both PM2.5 and PM10,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air pollution, centre for science and environment (CSE). The average PM2.5 of Noida dropped from 166.88 microgrammes per cubic metres on Tuesday to 148.64 units. The PM10 concentration of Noida also dropped from 314.30 units on Tuesday to 327.38 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 of Greater Noida saw improvement from 172.51 units day earlier to 160.23 units on Wednesday, while the PM10 values dropped from 364.665 units to 353.37 units on Wednesday. The standard limit for PM2.5 is 40 units while that of PM10 is 60 units respectively. Meanwhile, the officials of UPPCB said that they are actively monitoring the instance of violations and imposing penalty. “In past three days we have recommended environment compensation worth Rs. 5 lakh each on two builders holding construction work at sector 76 and sector 150. There were violations including uncovered building material. Another compensation was imposed on a contractor doing underpass work at sector 152 for not taking appropriate dust control measures,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-improves-though-still-in-very-poor-category/story-HGhvrRmx8FsaBh5pNyXTbI.html
28-10-2020||Noida||Opening of ISBTs in Delhi to decongest Kaushambi||With Delhi planning to re-open its inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) soon, over seven months after they were shut due to the Covid-induced lockdown, the UP State Road Transport Corporation’s (UPSRTC’s) Kaushambi ISBT is likely to get de-congested.The UPSRTC operated about 1500 buses from the three Delhi ISBTs but was now forced to shift operations to Kaushambi, where it usually operated 600 buses, after the Delhi government decided against re-opening them. While the Kaushambi was also shut initially during the lockdown, it re-opened to ferry migrant labourers leaving the cities back to their homes in other districts of Uttar Pradesh.On Monday, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said they would re-open ISBTs at Kashmere Gate, Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar before Diwali that falls on November 14.“Since the three ISBTs were shut, we curtailed our operations. Of the 1500 buses, we shifted 800 to Kaushambi. Of the 800, most run on diesel,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC. Diesel is considered to be a polluting fuel as it burns inefficiently.The ISBT at Kaushambi for long has been under scanner of residents of adjacent Kaushambi township who say that it is one of the major pollution sources in the area.“Since the ISBTs in Delhi were shut there was surge in buses operating from Kaushambi. They parked on roadside and their movement generated a lot of dust, besides their constant honking was a constant irritant. Apart from these, there are about 200-300 unauthorised buses which also operate from near a mall. So, all these buses combined have led to rise in different pollution sources for our residents,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments residents’ welfare association (KARWA).“There is hardly any enforcement against the private buses. Since, Delhi has announced that ISBTs will be opening before Diwali, we will send our buses to three ISBTs and this will give much needed relief to our terminal. The 600 odd buses which we operate routinely from Kaushambi are presently taking up only single departure in a day due to lesser availability of passengers,” Singh said.He added that the diesel buses are in process of conversion to CNG while presently operating buses were using BS-VI type fuel and no pressure horns are used by UPSRTC buses.Combined, the two ISBTs of Anand Vihar and Kaushambi besides heavy traffic conditions on the Delhi’s ring road adds major contribution to air pollution in the Kaushambi area.“The conditions at ISBT Kaushambi are among several factors which add a major contribution to air pollution. Depending on wind directions, its pollution also affects monitoring stations at Indirapuram and Vasundhara and also the other one at Anand Vihar in Delhi. The effect will be more as more buses are operating from here due to shutdown of ISBTs in Delhi,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP pollution control board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/opening-of-isbts-in-delhi-to-decongest-kaushambi/story-QZnmUmBLJv5TMKF9wjwobM.html
28-10-2020||City||Why this hurry? IMA on government move to collect health workers’ data for vaccination||Pune: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has slammed the government’s decision to forcefully collect details, including Aadhaar and birthdates, of health workers, even non-medical staff, from private hospitals who will be prioritised for Covid vaccination. The association said that there is something fishy given that these minute details have been forcefully sought in just two days. IMA has been at loggerheads with the government as the former claims that the government has not been on talking terms with them especially when it comes to taking any medical decision during the pandemic. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, IMA Maharashtra chapter said, “We had sent about 150 letters to the government since the pandemic struck the city but we have not got any reply. These correspondences range from issues, including insurance for private doctors, shortage of drugs and oxygen, requisition of hospital beds and capping of price.” HT had reported that the Central health ministry has asked states to prepare a list of healthcare workers from all districts in order to prioritise them for the Covid-19 vaccine, whenever made available. The list will be prepared by district collectors who have been appointed as nodal officers for the task. The ministry had said that healthcare workers to be prioritised for vaccination will include front-line workers, nurses, paramedical staff and also clerical staff. The guidelines suggested by the Central ministry states that all healthcare workers, including those from private facilities, will be prioritised. Bhondwe said, “Why do they need the Aadhaar and PAN card details of class four employees and clerical staff? I have got calls from members that they have received the letter seeking database just two hours before the said deadline. Why is there so much rush when there is no clarity on the vaccine status?” Bhondwe alleged that the government is seeking this database only to have a detailed record of the health workers who could later be harassed just like doctors have been harassed. He said, “I feel that something is fishy as to why they need so much data in such a short span of time. I have told all our members that this is a voluntary task and not a mandatory one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-this-hurry-ima-on-government-move-to-collect-health-workers-data-for-vaccination/story-zAtwX859QKpnCca64RDjwO.html

28-10-2020||Gurugram||Doctor charred to death as car catches fire near Bhondsi||A 35-year-old doctor was charred to death after his car caught fire on Sohna Road near Bhondsi on Wednesday morning, police said. Police said they have launched an investigation in the case and are yet to rule out foul play in the incident.According to investigators, the incident took place around 6.40am near Ghamroj village, when the doctor — identified as Kanwar Pal Raghav alias Sonu — was returning home from a private hospital in Sohna. Raghav was a resident of Ghamroj in Bhondsi area.Police said that Raghav had been working the night shifts at Sohna’s Krishna Hospital ever since the lockdown was announced in March this year.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they received a call at around 7am from the village sarpach informing them that a man had charred to death inside his car, even though the vehicle itself was half burnt. “A team from Bhondsi police station rushed to the spot and identified the man. Preliminary investigations revealed that there was a fault in the CNG fitting of the car, due to which the doctor jammed trapping Raghav inside when the fire started,” he said. Villagers informed the family members who in turn identified the doctor’s body, said police. The police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Sangwan said the body of the doctor was taken out of his Maruti Celerio car and was sent for a postmortem examination. The family members of the deceased, in their statement, told police that they last had a word with him a little after midnight and he had informed them that he would get late as he was treating a patient admitted in the emergency ward. “The calls made by the family went unanswered in the morning following which they made a call to his hospital who said the doctor left around 6 am,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/doctor-charred-to-death-as-car-catches-fire-near-bhondsi/story-r8Ljj1B3u9gUAgEpMSoWcL.html
28-10-2020||Business||Centre must spell out stand on Maratha quota, says Congress||The Congress in Maharashtra on Wednesday sought to know the “exact” stand of the Centre over reservation for Marathas in jobs and education in the state, an issue which is pending before the Supreme Court.Addressing a press conference here, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said efforts are being made to spread “lies” about the MVA government on the sensitive issue.In this context, it was pertinent to raise questions about the Centre’s role in the Maratha reservation issue, he said.The Congress is a constituent of the Shiv Sena-led MVA government and its leader Ashok Chavan, who is also a minister, heads a cabinet sub-committee on the quota issue.“We are raising questions on the Centre’s role in the Maratha reservation issue... because questions are being raised as why the central government is not taking any stand,” Sawant said.“Today, we would like to ask a question - what is the exact stand of the Narendra Modi government on this issue?” he sought to know.Sawant said BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sambhaji Chhatrapati has written three letters, seeking a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the quota issue, but he has not got any response so far.“The BJP came to the power using the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and today they are forgetting him.It seems the Modi government is not inclined in favour of granting reservation to the the Maratha community,” the Congress spokesperson said.The apex court last month stayed the implementation of 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed.On Tuesday, the SC termed as “unfair” the submission that Maharashtra was not heard fully when it had stayed the implementation of the reservation law.After a brief hearing, a bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi listed the pleas seeking to lift the stay on the quota law for hearing after four weeks.Earlier, the Maharashtra government had filed an application, seeking vacation of the SC stay on the implementation of the Maratha quota law amidst protests by pro-reservation outfits representing the community in parts of the state over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/centre-must-spell-out-stand-on-maratha-quota-says-congress/story-kX5C8V3azsc8eXJ3DaRghI.html
28-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s air quality worsens as mercury dips||The city’s air quality continued to deteriorate on Wednesday, recording an air quality index (AQI) of 313, categorised as ‘very poor’, in the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin, which was slightly worse than Tuesday’s AQI. The city had recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 306 (‘very poor’) on Tuesday and 258 (‘poor’) on Monday. As per the CPCB’s classification, AQI reading of 201 to 300 in categorised as ‘poor’, while an AQI reading from 301 to 400 in categorised ‘very poor’ and could lead to breathlessness and respiratory illness in case of prolonged exposure.On Wednesday, two of the four air quality monitors installed in different locations of the city recorded ‘very poor’ air quality, while two recorded the quality as ‘poor’. The monitor at National Institute of Solar Energy in Gwal Pahari and Vikas Sadan recorded AQIs of 278 and 299, respectively. The TERI Gram monitor on Gurugram-Faridabad road had AQI of 324, in ‘very poor’ category. The monitor at Sector 51 recorded the worst AQI, of 375, in the city. The level of ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) was 299 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), as per the monitor at Vikas Sadan. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3Experts said that the air quality will deteriorate further due to low wind speeds and accumulation of local pollutants. The situation is likely to improve from October 30 and will continue till November 1.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said, “Compared to Tuesday, air quality has deteriorated in Gurugram on Wednesday. The downfall is due to wind speed, which, until Tuesday, was blowing at 15 kilometre per hour (kmph) and has now reduced to eight kmph on Wednesday. The condition is likely to remain same till October 29. The wind speed will again increase from October 30.”Due to changing weather conditions and wind speed, the mixing height — the vertical height at which suspended particles mix with the air — has come down to four kilometres. “With the dip in temperature, the air rising from the surface cannot reach a particular height for dispersal. It leads to accumulation of particulate matter at a lower height. The mixing height has come down to four kilometre now, which was earlier at eight or ten kilometres,” said Srivastava. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 14 degrees Celsius and the maximum was 31 degrees Celsius.Sachin Panwar, a city-based expert in air pollution monitoring, also reiterated that air quality in Gurugram has worsened as local pollutants are not getting dissipated in the air. “With the decline in temperature, dew in the air is holding the particulate matter. The air pollution peak starts from 2am (and lasts) till 7am and again from 9.30pm onwards, as the temperature drops. Due to heavy concretisation, which makes air cooler, the mixing height gets lower,” said Panwar. Grap ImplementationThe Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), assigned with the task of ensuring enforcement of Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to prevent air quality from deteriorating further, is focusing on imposing fines. On Wednesday, fines amounting to a total of Rs 32,800 was imposed for dust from construction and demolition activities and garbage dumping. So far, the HSPCB’s control room, set up to address complaints pertaining to polluting activities, has received only nine calls.Shakti Singh, regional officer (south Gurugram), HSPCB, and the nodal officer for Grap implementation, said, “We have forwarded the nine complaints related to garbage dumping, waste burning and dust due to unpaved roads to the agencies concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-air-quality-worsens-as-mercury-dips/story-9fm2hVsqEAnHElxPw7ykRP.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||1.4% patients suffer from Covid-19-related strokes, reveals study by doctors of a Mumbai hospital||Almost 1.4% of the Covid-19 patients, who were treated at Nanavati Hospital, Mumbai, suffered strokes while undergoing treatment. This is part of the findings of the four-month-long study on Covid-19 patients conducted by doctors at Nanavati Hospital. Ahead of World Stroke Day which is observed on October 29, doctors have stressed on the need for timely treatment of Covid-19 patients with stroke, as none of the patients at the hospital got admitted within golden hour.The doctors have conducted the study on 1,500 Covid-19 patients between May and August. Of these patients, 21 had developed strokes. For a comparative study, 21 non-Covid patients who suffered from stroke were also included in the study. Covid-19 infection has been found to lead to development of prothrombotic state, which means the blood of the patients have a tendency to thicken or become sticky which blocks blood vessels, thus hampering the blood supply to the brain. “When a blood supply of a particular part of a brain is cut off due to clotting, it causes strokes. The infection can cause clots in different parts of the brain,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital. As per the study, 66.7% of the Covid-19 patients who suffered strokes had hypertension, 33.3% had diabetes. Along with this, they also had other underlying health issues such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, asthma, chronic renal disease among others. However, city-based neurologists have suggested that Covid-related strokes can also happen without these risk factors.“Traditional risk factors for stroke are uncontrolled blood pressure and diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle, atrial fibrillation, etc...but studies have shown Covid-related strokes can happen without these risk factors also. Previously viruses such as influenza and herpes have been linked to heart attacks and brain strokes. However, the occurrence of stroke is more common in Covid-19 infection as per the current literature,” said Dr Sahil Kohli, consultant neurologist, Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Gurugram.According to a Lancet report named Covid-19 related stroke in young individuals, Covid-19-related strokes might also happen among younger patients without any vascular ailments. “The mean age of patients with Covid-19 who suffered strokes was 57.29 years, whereas the mean age of non-Covid patients was 60.95 years. This shows that in comparison to non-Covid patients, incidences of stroke were more common among younger patients with Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Pradyumna Oak, director and head of neurology of Nanavati Hospital and principal author of the study.Covid-19 can cause three types of strokes —haemorrhagic stroke where the blood vessel ruptures, leading to accumulation of blood in the brain; ischemic stroke where blood vessel blockage leads to brain stroke due to lack of oxygen; and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis which leads to blockage of veins in the brain, leading to brain damage.Despite the seriousness of stroke among Covid-19 patients, in the study, none of the surveyed patients reached hospitals within the golden hour. The delay in treatment resulted in the death of three of the patients while the hospital hasn’t recorded a single death of non-Covid patients with stroke.“Strokes could lead to the death of neurons in the brain, resulting in paralysis. When a person suffers from a stroke, he/she is rushed to private nursing homes which don’t even have CT scan machines, thus delaying treatment. If treatment is provided within the golden hour, the patient can be rehabilitated and saved,” said Dr Oak.The hospital is in the process of publishing the study co-authored by Dr Priyanka Prabhu and Dr Aditya Raheja in an international journal. Mumbai’s first stroke helpline:Nanavati Hospital has launched a one-of-its-kind 24-hour stroke helpline. The helpline, 8405050548, will be attended by trained neurologists who can address all queries related to signs, symptoms, detection and treatment of stroke for people at large.“For instance, if we get a call from Panvel, we will direct the patient to the nearby hospital so he/she can procure treatment immediately without wasting time,” said Dr Oak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-4-patients-suffer-from-covid-19-related-strokes-reveals-study-by-doctors-of-a-mumbai-hospital/story-O2qEggtfJFbOcIcmi0JcaJ.html
28-10-2020||Gurugram||Teams of residents to scan city for polluting activities||Civil defence teams, comprising resident volunteers, will start scanning the city from Monday for polluting activities, such as waste burning and dust pollution, and inform the civic body for necessary action.On Wednesday, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) held a meeting with the volunteers at its Sector 42 office and designated teams for checking violations of Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).“At least four teams have been formed for this task. By analysing data of our air lab, we have identified a few areas where localised pollution levels remain high. Civil defence teams would scan such areas to spot violations, such as waste burning, biomass burning, dust pollution, among others, and inform the MCG accordingly. In addition to our enforcement teams, the civil defence teams would be our eyes on the street across the city,” said Chahat Sanghvi, consultant, MCG commissioner office.During an informal meeting last week, officials of the civic body had sought permission from deputy commissioner Amit Khatri for roping in residents to check pollution and were allowed to do so. Khatri heads all civic defence teams across the city.On October 15, the MCG opened an air lab at its office in Sector 42 to monitor hourly data from 24 air quality monitors installed across the city, to spot for sudden spike in pollution levels, which may have been caused by localised polluting activities, and accordingly inform enforcement wing officials on ground to scan the area to check for violations.With enforcement wing officials having limited reach, the MCG decided to include residents in the process as well and decided on the formation of civil defence teams.MCG officials privy to the matter said the teams would visit Udyog Vihar on Monday to check for violations. Overall, the MCG has identified five areas for civil defence teams to conduct checks on priority. Officials, however, did not disclose the other four areas.Besides checking for environmental violations, the teams would also be responsible for spreading awareness in villages, construction sites and public areas, sensitising residents about polluting activities.MCG officials said that the involvement of residents would not be limited to civil defence teams solely, as they are working on a mechanism to share real-time data of all 24 air monitors with residents so that they can also spot violations in case of a sudden spike in pollution.The MCG has a toll-free number — 18001801817 — and an email address — grap@mcg.gov.in — on which residents can report Grap violations.“Civil defence teams have been successful in keeping a check on numerous activities in the city in the past. Hence, we decided to volunteer for MCG’s latest initiative. We want to help MCG in every way to reduce pollution violations. Our local knowledge will help them in a big way,” said Mohit Sharma, a resident of Sector 40.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teams-of-residents-to-scan-city-for-polluting-activities/story-3Ch4asIJYmmnFiN2Xw9mHO.html

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Reopen Mumbai local trains for everyone: Maharashtra government writes to Railways||In what could come as a big relief for Mumbaiites, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday wrote to the Railways seeking their approval to allow all commuters to travel by local trains. The government, in a letter to the general managers of Western Railway and Central Railway, proposed time slots to allow everyone to use the suburban train services. The proposal has earmarked three time slots during the day for general commuters, while two slots are meant for essential services staff. The government has also sought a ladies special train every hour. While the Railways divisions acknowledged receiving the state’s letter and issued a joint statement saying they are “working closely with the Maharashtra government to provide additional services”, there is no clarity on when all commuters will be allowed on the local trains.Mumbai’s local trains, used by around 8 million people daily pre-Covid-19, were suspended on March 23 after the state went into a lockdown. Some services resumed on July 15, with the state allowing only essential services workers, differently abled people and cancer patients to use the trains. On October 21, the government let all women board the trains during non-peak hours. The Central Railway currently operates 706 daily services, while the Western Railway runs 704 services as against their regular of 1,774 and 1,367, respectively.The letter signed by Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department of the state, said, “The state is looking to open up local train services to the general public while ensuring adherence to following all Covid-19 protocols.” The letter further said the government has proposed the resumption of services for general public in a staggered manner. Any person with a valid ticket or pass can travel in local trains from the first service of the day up to 7:30am, then between 11am and 4:30pm, and between 8pm and till the last service of the day, said the proposal, adding that the workforce involved in essential services can continue to use train services between 8am and 10:30am and between 5pm and 7:30pm. These staffers will, however, need to have a valid QR code or identity card, and a valid ticket or pass to board the trains. The letter was sent a day after state’s relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Tuesday tweeted, “We have held discussions with various stakeholders. Mumbaikars will get relief on this very soon.” His tweet was in response to a tweet by a commuter.The state government, according to officials, wants to restrict the number of commuters during morning and evening peak hours and encourage staggered workplace timings by private establishments by allowing general commuters during non-peak hours. The state has also asked the Railways to increase the frequency of train services as if the proposed schedule gets the approval of the Railway Board, additional services would be needed to meet the demands of commuters. “Inputs on increase in train services will be given by the Railways. Feasibility for operation of ladies special train every hour needs to be checked. We will be providing details,” said a senior railway official, on condition of anonymity.“Railways have always been ready to augment/enhance suburban services keeping social distancing norms. We are working closely with State Government of Maharashtra to provide these additional services after consultation with them,” read a tweet from CR.Passenger unions, however, have expressed their opposition to the stipulated timings set by the state government. “The timings will not be feasible for all passengers. General passengers are allowed to travel after 11am. What will happen to those who go for daily work and have to reach by a particular timing?” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reopen-mumbai-local-trains-for-everyone-maharashtra-government-writes-to-railways/story-beYDNhhpzwRELApOZQJWrO.html

28-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC House meet set to be a noisy affair||The Chandigarh municipal corporation General House’s first physical meeting in over seven months on Thursday is set to be a tumultuous affair.Even as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) plans to table unlisted agendas, such as a review of GPS watches for MC staffers and steep hike in water tariff, the Congress is preparing to corner it on these contentious issues as well as its alleged failure on the development front.The BJP has come under severe pressure from the opposition Congress and resident welfare associations on the threefold increase in water tariff. Protests have been staged by different resident associations against both the BJP and the MC on the issue.“This is not the right time to increase water charges,” said Arun Sood, BJP state president and a councillor, while commenting on the planned agenda. “Though charges have to be increased to cover MC’s losses, such a sharp hike wasn’t warranted.”Left out of the agenda for the October 20 meeting, revision of water tariff is said to be one of the reasons for the BJP’s sharp criticism directed at the MC commissioner and other officials in the last couple of weeks.In fact, RWAs are threatening to call protests if the hiked water charges are not rolled back. Also, the meeting comes just a couple of days after sanitation workers and garbage collectors ended their four-day strike. While the BJP is planing to confront officials on the efficacy of the GPS watches for MC staff, the Congress plans to question the introduction of watches in the first place. MC officials are not in favour of discontinuing the use of these watches that are meant to keep a track on the field staff’s attendance. The civic body pays around ₹18 lakh per month as rent for these watches.The meeting’s outcome will also decide the next course of action to be taken by the sanitation staff. The union had ended its strike on the condition that the House would decide on stopping the use of GPS watches. “Either the House should temporarily stop the use of watches till the final decision is reached or we will stop sanitation and garbage collection work,” said Om Prakash Saini, president of Chandigarh Door to Door Garbage Collectors’ Society.Cong to demand mayor’s resignationMayor Raj Bala Malik faced a major public embarrassment when 18 of 20 BJP councillors, including Arun Sood, boycotted the October 20 meeting. They had been demanding a physical meeting, but the mayor went for a virtual one.Even the party organisational secretary, Dinesh Kumar, had sided with the boycotting party councillors. Relenting under party pressure, Malik had to finally call the physical meeting.This time around, the Congress plans to demand her resignation. “The mayor has failed totally in development of the city, and even to carry her party along. We will demand her resignation. We were not even allowed to properly speak in the previous virtual meetings by the mayor and her party,” said Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition in the House.Main agendasThough not listed, review of steep water tariff hike and GPS watches for sanitation workers are likely to be prominent table agendas.In September, water charges were hiked up to 200%. RWAs and the opposition have been up in arms against it.GPS-enabled watches are mandatory for 4,000 MC workers, including sanitation staff. The workers’ salary is calculated as per their attendance, which is marked through these watches. The workers recently went on a strike against these watches, which they allege malfunction. Other agendasImposition of user charges for door-to-door garbage collectionLicence fee for parking contractor for September, October and NovemberAmendments proposed to rural building bylawsSafety measuresThermal screening of all attendeesVisitors’ entry barredTransparent shields between councillors’ seatsMedia not to be seated in the hall, but to be given access to live coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-house-meet-set-to-be-a-noisy-affair/story-4NniU8X85EoQyPBSZSiBdP.html

The Supreme Court-appointed Epca also granted permission to Information Technology (IT) and other commercial institutions to use diesel gensets as a secondary source of power. A letter was issued by Bhure Lal, chairman, Epca, stating that in 15 cases —14 residential complexes and 1 commercial complex — Epca is granting exemption as requested by the Haryana power department and this will be applicable only for the period up to November 30. Four other complexes, including a mall in Gurugram, which are fully dependent on diesel gensets due to non-compliance of electrical inadequacies, have also been granted exemption till November 30. However, Epca is awaiting affidavits in the four instances.“We have noted that DHBVN {Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam} has assured that it will resolve the matter within 8-10 days and post interim electricity supply will be given to them by November 30 and affidavits will be filed within 8-10 days positively,” reads the letter.Trilok Chand Gupta, additional chief secretary, state power department, said, “Nineteen builders have been granted exemption till November 30. The department will ensure inadequacies are resolved.”Diesel gensets are banned under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), which came into force on October 15, to tackle air pollution from slipping to ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ category during winter months.Earlier this week, the matter was reviewed by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. As reported by HT on Monday, the Haryana power department submitted affidavits and wrote to Epca seeking exemption till November 30 for 19 complexes. On October 15, Epca asked for the affidavits with schedules for each complex, which are fully and partially dependent on diesel gensets. The detailed affidavits by the builders were submitted by the power department to Epca on Monday. As per the letter, the number of exemptions has been brought down to around 20 this year, which is a big reduction from the 209 applications filed last year.Besides, the Haryana government also asked for permission to use diesel gensets as a secondary source of power in case of disruption in process industries and IT companies. Officials of the power department said that these industries run on servers, for which uninterrupted power supply is a must.Epca granted permission for the use of diesel gensets as a secondary source, but clearly stated that this could lead to misuse as generators could easily become the primary source of power without enforcement. It has asked these industries to maintain a logbook on the use of diesel gensets.“It will be verified fortnightly or monthly by the power department. The aim of this will be to ensure that in this period, there is an improvement in the power supply that diesel gensets are not required to be used. The state power department will have to submit a report to Epca at the end of December and February,” the letter stated.The pollution control body also advised all commercial set ups to move to cleaner sources of distributed power, such as gas-based generators or solar-powered systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/epca-exempts-19-complexes-from-diesel-genset-ban/story-P4GoYlNrDgNvNmBv2kcH2O.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP leader Pankaja Munde’s praise for Pawar and Thackeray sparks political speculation in Maharashtra||Maharashtra’s political circles are abuzz with speculation after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and party’s national secretary Pankaja Munde praised Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the past few days. Munde on Tuesday lauded 79-year-old Pawar for “working during the Covid-19 pandemic”, and at her Dussehra rally at Bhagwangarh in Beed on Sunday, she congratulated Thackeray for the relief package of ₹10,000 crore his government announced for flood-hit farmers. Munde, who attended a meeting with Pawar in Pune on Tuesday to discuss issues faced by sugarcane cutters, tweeted: “Hats off to Sharad Pawar… Your stamina to hold meetings, touring and working for hours even during the pandemic is simply commendable. Though I hail from different party, ideology and type of politics, Mundesaaheb [her late father Gopinath Munde] has taught me to respect the hard-workers.”Munde’s tweet, which was in Marathi, raised eyebrows, especially in the backdrop of Eknath Khadse moving from BJP to NCP.On Sunday, while praising Thackeray, Munde had indirectly slammed her detractors within BJP. “Some leaders at the state-level have vowed to finish me politically,” she said.However, Madhav Bhandari, vice-president, BJP, said, “These are baseless rumours. She has been recently appointed as national secretary of the party and will have opportunity to work in sync with national leadership. She has bright future in the party.”Munde, who is from the Vanjari community and is considered a prominent OBC face of BJP, is believed to be upset after her defeat in the 2019 Assembly elections. She had been expecting her rehabilitation as Member of the Legislative Council (MLC), but was not among the people nominated by the party to the Upper House. Instead, BJP recently appointed Munde as one of its national secretaries. Munde, just like Khadse, is one of the senior BJP leaders from Maharashtra who has been unhappy with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is at the helm of the party’s affairs in the state since 2014. Her supporters feel her detractors within the party had tried to cut her to size when she was part of the state cabinet in the Fadnavis government. Leaders close to her also claimed that her defeat in the Assembly elections from Parli in Beed district was orchestrated from within the party. She was defeated by her cousin, Dhananjay Munde, who had moved from BJP to NCP in July 2013. Munde had publicly expressed her disappointment after the results and dared BJP to remove her. She had even announced that she would not be part of the core team of the state BJP. In December last year, she put out an emotional social media post that held “party insiders responsible for her defeat”. BJP leaders in the state, however, said Munde is upset, but they don’t see her quitting the party like Khadse. “It is true that she is upset over treatment meted out her along with few other senior leaders like Khadse. She had almost revolted against the state leadership in December last year, after her defeat, but was later pacified by the leadership. After Khadse’s exit, she has become more vocal politically and has praised leaders from other parties as part of her strategy to build pressure on her detractors within party. She is unlikely to quit the party immediately, as her importance as an OBC leader has increased after the exit of Khadse, another OBC leader,” said a party leader.Vishwambhar Choudhari, political analyst, said, “Sena and Congress do not have base in Beed district, leaving only option of NCP for Munde. But, for it, she will first have to patch up with her cousin Dhananjay who has built his base in the constituency and district. Pankaja may compromise on the constituency and other Assembly segments like Pathardi, where Vanjari community is in dominance. But having said this, it will be too early to say that she will quit her party.” An NCP leader said although Munde has been trying to develop cordial relations with their leaders, Shiv Sena would be her first choice because of the local political equations. Recently, Sena leader and former minister Arjun Khotkar had said they would be more than happy to induct Munde in their party. Her father shared cordial relations with the Thackeray family despite their political differences at times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-leader-pankaja-munde-s-praise-for-pawar-and-thackeray-sparks-political-speculation-in-maharashtra/story-7OeCFg93ard2k5PSqI6LlK.html

However, only 100 students have attended the classes on an average in the last two weeks. As many as 135 students reached the venue at 10am and district authorities took all precautionary measures such as checking temperatures and sanitising their hands before allowing them to enter the hall which can accommodate more than 500 people. Social distancing was maintained inside the hall. The district and block mentors of different subjects encouraged the students to take attend the virtual classes to crack the scholarship exam. Sanjeev Taneja, district mentor (mathematics), Jasvir Singh, district mentor (science) and Subodh Kumar, district mentor (English) and SST interacted with students.Ektapreet Kaur of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bharat Nagar, and Parneet of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Hargobindpur, who had cleared the NTSE Stage 1 exam last year, spoke on how the coaching helped them.Ektapreet Kaur, 17, said, “It is necessary to be focused and time management is key. I am lucky that I was among the 40 students who were selected for free coaching and the mentors cleared my doubts. I worked hard and studied for five to six hours after coaching classes which helped me clear the NTSE Stage 1 exam.” Parneet said, “After attending the coaching classes at Senior Secondary Residential School for meritorious students, I was able to clear the exam. The coaching made a big difference as I was able to solve assignments and doubts were cleared by the teachers during the classes.”Both students were honoured by Swaranjit Kaur, district education officer (secondary). “There was a need to hold this orientation programme and we organised it after taking permission from the deputy commissioner. The scholarship exam is scheduled to be held on December 12 and to provide coaching to students, it was important to guide them. We have decided that the coaching will continue online and district and block mentors will coordinate so that more students can clear the exam this time,” Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-edu-dept-holds-orientation-to-get-more-students-for-ntse-coaching/story-V1jyH4NdxP10DV16y7rvfP.html
28-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC chief asks officials to expedite solid waste management projects||Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal has pulled up the health team and other officials of the civic body for failing to comply with timeline laid down by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to complete solid waste management projects in the city. Charing a meeting along with Puran Singh, project director, Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company (PMIDC), and additional director, Naresh Kumar, to check the status of different projects being taken up to manage solid waste, the MC chief directed the staff to start the work at war footing to ensure a good ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2021. The meetings are being conducted after the monitoring committee of the NGT had criticised the Ludhiana MC over improper solid waste management and failure to complete projects in time. Besides, the commissioner also directed the staff to ensure 100% door-to-door garbage collection and source segregation of waste. The MC commissioner warned that departmental action will be initiated against officials if any employee was found guilty of dereliction of duty. Eight Micro forest set up near Buddha Nullah: During the meeting, the MC chief was told that eight micro-forests have been set-up alongside Buddha Nullah. Sabharwal further directed the horticulture department to develop 25 more micro forest with the help of NGOs and social organisations. Civic body officials were also told to establish compost pits in over 800 parks in the city by the end of November. Besides, four walling of compost pits should also be done in the parks, the MC commissioner added. In August, the NGT had directed the MC to submit ₹15 lakh as a bank guarantee in favour of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) over its failure to take up proper solid waste management in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-chief-asks-officials-to-expedite-solid-waste-management-projects/story-DuwqWxBWv4ifDIMOrcW7SO.html
28-10-2020||City||HC dismisses plea against Bathinda varsity’s selection process for vice-chancellor||Jalandhar A bench of chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court, Ravi Shanker Jha and justice Arun Palli, on Wednesday dismissed a Letter Patents Appeal (LPA) that former Punjab Technical University, Kapurthala, dean academics, Narinder Paul Singh, had filed against a single-bench order. The single-bench order had dismissed his plea challenging the selection process for the vice-chancellor post of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University (MRSPTU), Bathinda. The Punjab government will now go ahead with the ongoing selection process. On October 16, 2020 justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu had dismissed Paul’s petition and vacated stay from the selection process of MRSPTU V-C. Paul had moved court after not being shortlisted for the interview. Justice Sindhu underlined that it is a matter of fact that averments of the petitioner qua short-listing the name of Dr Ashok Kumar Paul for the post were factually incorrect. “The vice-chancellor post is not merely a source of employment to earn livelihood, but rather to be taken as a role model. Therefore, petitioner ought to have exhibited responsible behaviour instead of making unfounded allegations and that too, supported by way of an affidavit, which concededly are not correct, thus, the petitioner has not approached this court with clean hands,” reads HC orders on October 16. The single-bench order added that the petitioner participated in the selection process, but his name did not figure on the list of seven shortlisted candidates by the search committee, and none of them had been impleaded as respondents in the present petition. “In the opinion of this court, as on today, petitioner is only a bystander and by no stretch of imagination, he could be termed as an aggrieved person for invoking the jurisdiction of this court,” the order adds. The order added that the petitioner made incorrect assertions regarding short-listing of Dr Ashok Kumar Paul and obtained interim stay on July 15, 2020 against the selection for the post of V-C, resulting in irreparable loss to the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-dismisses-plea-against-bathinda-varsity-s-selection-process-for-vice-chancellor/story-W8fSOlutyNtsRNUd3LSv7M.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Man dies, kin ransack Navi Mumbai hospital, assault staff||The relatives of a 48-year-old patient who died in the wee hours ransacked the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) hospital at Vashi early on Wednesday morning and also allegedly assaulted security guards and other staff, said police. The police have arrested two sons of the deceased and their two friends. According to police, the incident occurred around 3.45am, following the death of Venkatesh Suryavanshi, a tour operator from Juhugaon in Vashi.Dr Prashant Javade, NMMC hospital medical superintendent, said, “The patient was in critical condition when he came to us [from another hospital in Kopar Khairane] on Tuesday. He was suffering from tuberculosis and other complications. He passed away around 3am, following which the relatives turned violent and ransacked the hospital. They broke glass panes and also damaged equipment, including ventilator and dialysis machine.” The hospital authorities then called the police. In a video that has gone viral, the relatives can be seen throwing files and breaking window panes, even as a police constable is trying to stop them. A security guard who was hurt in the incident, said, “Two men armed with sharp weapons came rushing in. When we stopped them at the gate, they threatened to kill us. They went in and started ransacking the premises claiming their father had died. Some more people came later.” Sandesh, 20, and Rupesh, 21, and their friends Pankaj Jadhav, 22, and Rohit Namvad, 32, have been booked for destroying public property and assaulting the staff of the hospital. Rupesh said, “My father’s death came as a shock to us. There were obviously issues with the treatment given at the hospital, so we were upset. He couldn’t have died.” The staff refused to work after the incident, however, resumed work in a few hours. Sharda Bansode, a nurse, said, “There is very little security for us. Our CMO, security guard, cleaning staff were assaulted. How are we supposed to work under such conditions? There has to be permanent security here.” Sanjeev Dhumal, senior police inspector, said, “The deceased suffered from multiple ailments, including TB, kidney issues and some other infections. The deceased’s kin was informed by hospital authorities that he was in critical condition and should be taken to some other hospital. They, however, insisted that he be admitted. The accused were allegedly drunk. They claimed the hospital was negligent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-dies-kin-ransack-navi-mumbai-hospital-assault-staff/story-G2OHxWepZM9xz6GzXkJosN.html

28-10-2020||Mumbai||After NCW chief’s tweets, plea in Bombay HC seeking her removal from post||A writ petition has been filed in the Bombay high court seeking the removal of National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma due to her recent tweets about meeting Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and discussing the issue of love jihad. The petition has claimed that as the term love jihad is not a term used in Indian laws and is only used informally for inter-caste marriages, especially between Muslim men and women belonging to other communities. It further said that the NCW chairperson’s attempt to highlight the term is aimed at creating animosity in society. In light of this, the petition has stated that Sharma is not capable of heading a sensitive post, hence should be relieved from the responsibility. The petition filed by social activist Saket Gokhale has stated that NCW chief Sharma has been making non-partisan communal discourses by referring to her tweets about her meeting with Governor Koshyari and discussing the issue of love jihad. The petition has claimed that based on her tweets it was apparent that her mindset was not befitting someone who could prevent crime against women, hence she should be removed from the post of NCW chief. “By invoking the baseless communal concept of “love jihad”, the chairperson of NCW has interfered with the freedom of inter-faith couples to practise their faith freely, while marrying each other without the fear of persecution and targeting based on religious grounds by NCW,” the petition reads.The petition has further stated that the tweets also indicated an official’s policy of demonising inter-faith marriages as there is no term like love jihad in Indian law, nor has such cases been reported by any central agencies, by the ministry of home affairs. Hence the petition states that Sharma had engaged in ‘blatantly communal and divisive discourse’ which casts aspersions on her ability to act in a non-partisan secular manner as NCW chairperson.The petition has also referred to some old tweets of Sharma which are misogynist and sexist and made with the intention of political attacks. The petition states that as Sharma has utter disregard for fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of India as well as towards the ideas of secularism and pluralism, she should be removed from her post as NCW chairperson, under article 14 (equality before law), 21 (right to life with dignity), 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) of the Constitution of India. The matter is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-ncw-chief-s-tweets-plea-in-bombay-hc-seeking-her-removal-from-post/story-MHlD708a3W7apC5NNiPTOI.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Actor Rhea Chakraborty’s allegations against SSR sisters mostly presumptive and speculative, CBI tells Bombay HC||In an affidavit filed in Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said the allegations made by actor Rhea Chakraborty against Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, sisters of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, are mostly speculative and should not be the basis of a first information report (FIR).On June 8, 2020, Chakraborty had lodged a complaint at Bandra police station, alleging Singh had sent Rajput illegal prescriptions from cardiologist Dr Tarun Kumar, associated with Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. These prescriptions allowed Rajput to access psychotropic substances without consultation. Based on this complaint, Bandra police filed an FIR on September 7 against Singh, Dr Kumar and others. The case was immediately transferred to CBI as it was already investigating Rajput’s death based on an FIR registered in Patna. Singh and her sister Meetu approached HC on October 5, 2020, asking that the FIR registered by Bandra police be quashed. In an affidavit filed on October 26, 2020, Chakraborty reiterated the allegation that Singh and Dr Kumar had illegally prescribed psychotropic substances to Rajput and pointed out that he died by suicide within six days of receiving the prescription from Dr Kumar. On Wednesday, CBI filed a reply to Singh and Meetu’s petition, supporting their stand and criticising Mumbai Police. The agency said Bandra police’s FIR was untenable by law as, “the complaint filed by Respondent No. 2 [Chakraborty] is mostly speculative in nature and such speculation cannot be made the basis of an FIR.” The agency further said Bandra police station ought not to have registered a second FIR. “It is a fact that the CBI is already investigating the causes relating to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput based on an FIR No. 241/2020 of PS Rajiv Nagar, Patna, Bihar based on a complaint filed by Sh. KK Singh, the father of the deceased,” said CBI in its affidavit, adding that Mumbai Police should have forwarded Chakraborty’s complaint to the Central agency instead of registering another FIR. CBI also assured the court that it is probing the roles of every person involved in Rajput’s suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-actor-rhea-chakraborty-s-allegations-against-ssr-sisters-mostly-presumptive-and-speculative-cbi-tells-bombay-hc/story-6MQh3pbMu9sSnUQVBefzkO.html

However, Pancholi’s lawyer has sought action against the CBI for contempt of court over their plea for further investigation.The agency had in December last year moved the special court for permission for further investigation with regards to the dupatta used in the crime. The agency said that they need to send the dupatta for forensic analysis to a lab in Chandigarh. Further, the agency said they need to retrieve the messages exchanged between Khan and Pancholi. The actress was found dead in her room on June 3, 2013. Pancholi was arrested a week after for abetment to suicide by the Mumbai Police. Khan’s mother – Rabia claimed that it was a case of homicide and not suicide.Pancholi’s lawyer Prashant Patil on Wednesday opposed the plea and said that even the Apex court had decided the matter when Rabia sought further investigation in the case. He pleaded that when the case was being argued on Rabia’s plea, the CBI had given a negative reply, based on which her petition was rejected.“CBI had then claimed that there was no need for further investigation and now they have changed their stand, without any change in any circumstances,” Patil said pleading that CBI officers are liable for contempt of court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jiah-khan-suicide-cbi-argues-for-further-investigation-defence-lawyer-seeks-contempt-against-officers/story-WYrtilbIRtSOo903xLOImK.html

The Mohali health department had in September issued a warning that coronavirus and dengue coinfection may prove risky after detecting mosquito larvae at several places.Dayalan said that with the change in climatic conditions, fogging and door-to-door container survey had to be intensified with active challaning of households where mosquito larvae are found. “Instead of pressing each fogging vehicle into operation just once a day, they may be used twice” to cover maximum areas, the DC said. Use of disinfectant spray across the city especially in public places during the festive season, dusting with medicinal powder near drains, coupled with frequent disinfection in densely populated areas, slums and narrow lanes have been ordered.The MC has pressed into service GPS-equipped fogging machines that operate once a week in the city, which is divided into four zones; re-fogging is done after 8 to10 days.Two shoulder-mounted machines are also being used for fogging in parks, villages and settlements where big machines cannot enter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/actively-take-up-fogging-to-curb-mosquito-menace-mohali-dc/story-GMPY8TMmaSG6bTHFvnNq5O.html

The scam runs into several crores, as the gang were operating since the many months,” said inspector Jitendra Vankoti.The call centre was run in a flat in Nalla Sopara (West). The accused are linked to an international gang, who transfer them money, said Vankoti.“We raided the flat at around 2am on Wednesday. The accused spoke fluent American English. They sent bulk messages to thousands of US citizens claiming that their vehicle was found involved in a crime and that drugs and bloodstains were found inside,” said Shivade.The conmen would then convince the victims to pay hefty fines ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 US dollars as a settlement to escape jail, said Shivade.Vankoti further said, “All the accused had a script which they used while speaking to US citizens. The accused would also claim that they can their social security numbers.”The victims were asked to purchase gift cards online from a popular shopping firm, scratch the 16-digit number on the card and share it with the accused. Later the accused would share the number with the international gang to encash the cards. They then transferred a share to the Nallasopara call centre and earned crores. A possible havala racket cannot be ruled out said an officer.Police have seized nine laptops, routers and headsets from the flat. The accused have been arrested on charges of forgery and cheating of the Indian Penal Code and under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Telegraph Act. The accused will produced before the Vasai court on Thursday said Vankoti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-held-for-running-fake-call-centre-in-nallasopara-near-mumbai/story-qIMO3ltt9guUPvCheq2G6M.html

28-10-2020||City||Gurugram: Active Covid cases cross 3,000-mark for first time||Gurugram: The number of active Covid-19 cases in Gurugram has, for the first time, crossed the 3,000-mark, shows data from the district health department. With 397 new positive cases on Wednesday, the total count of Covid-19 patients, who are currently undergoing treatment in hospitals or are in home isolation, has reached 3,151 in the district. Officials said that spreading of the infection within families and lax attitude in following safety guidelines like wearing masks has resulted in the spike in the active cases. Since October 21, Gurugram has been recording more than 300 fresh Covid-19 cases per day. Since then, the highest single-day spike of 398 cases were reported on October 24. The upward trajectory of the cases has led to the record spike in active cases. The health department data shows that when cases were climbing up with positivity rate of almost 18% in June-July, active infections were still under 3,000. The active cases had been fluctuating between 2,500 and 2,900 since September, but they did not cross the 3,000-mark.Health officials said that they will continue to do more than 3,000 tests per day and focus on tracking of patients. In the last two months, testing has increased from 2,200 a day to almost 3,000 a day. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “As the infection is spreading within the families, numbers are escalating. To increase overall tests, we have started evening camps. Earlier, only 30-50 samples were being collected in evening camps, which has now increased to over 120. We might see a downfall in testing as many people due to the festive season will not come forward for testing.” Yadav said that the surge in cases is noticeable after every 21 days. According to the data, of the 3,151 active cases, at least 2,951 patients (nearly 94%) are currently under home isolation, nine are in facilities set up by the district administration for isolation and 191 seriously ill patients in various private hospitals. Although the health department administers nearly 3,000 tests every day, the positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among those tested — has been increasing constantly. From weekly positivity rate of 9% in August, it is now above 12%. On Wednesday, the positivity rate stood at 12.20%. Studies show that increasing positivity rate indicated widespread prevalence of infection, which can be addressed through increased testing.Despite the spike in cases, the fatality rate is restricted at 0.73% in Gurugram. On Wednesday, no Covid-19 death was reported in the district, whereby the toll stood at 206. Till now, 28,704 people in the district have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. When asked about the enforcement of Covid-19 protocols, Yadav said, “We can only advise people to take precautionary measures like wearing masks and maintaining social distance.” Data available with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) shows that nearly 18,000 people have been fined in August, September and October for not wearing masks in public areas. A total of 30,000 fines have been issued since April for mask violation, as per the MCG data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-active-covid-cases-cross-3-000-mark-for-first-time/story-PkseXTu4pxnKWBpQtmycwK.html

All you need to know||Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi has been suspended on the orders of President Ram Nath Kovind, who is the Visitor to the university, amid a power scuffle in DU, ministry of education said on Wednesday.The president has also called for an inquiry over accusations of dereliction of duties and lack of commitment and devotion to his responsibility as the VC.“All orders issued by or issued with the approval of Yogesh Tyagi during the period of his absence on medical ground are set aside and to be treated as null and void,” the official said, as quoted by PTI.Tyagi has been suspended to ensure that the inquiry against him is fair and that he cannot tamper with material records or coerce the witnesses in the matter, PTI reported citing a senior ministry official.‘Failed to discharge the duties entrusted on him’Tyagi has been on leave since July 2 after he was admitted to AIIMS for an emergency surgery. The government had on July 17 given Pro-VC P C Joshi the charge of Delhi University Vice Chancellor until Tyagi resumes office.The power tussle started last week after Tyagi on Thursday removed Joshi as pro-VC and appointed Geeta Bhatt in his place. Joshi had appointed a new registrar, Vikas Gupta, whose appointment was cleared by the executive council on Wednesday. The same day, Tyagi appointed P C Jha as acting registrar and director of the South Campus. As the controversy erupted, the ministry intervened and said the appointments made by Tyagi were “null and void” as he is on leave.“...he (Yogesh Tyagi ) has not attended the office and is absenting himself from official duties. He has neither sought any leave nor informed the Executive Council as per requirement contained in provision made under Clause 3(3) of Ordinance XXII made under the provisions of the Delhi University Act 1922. Further, he is not attending any meeting including “Visitor’s Conference on Implementation of NEP 2020: Higher Education”, president by Hon’ble President of India on 19.9.2020,” the order said.The order says that Tyagi failed to discharge the duties and responsibilities entrusted on him as the VC and also lists a range of issues related to governance.One of the major allegations against Tyagi was that he had not appointed officials for several key posts which remained vacant in the university despite being given reminders by the education ministry. “Despite a clear message from the ministry to fill up the teaching posts in a time bound manner, the process to fill the vacancies has been delayed,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-vice-chancellor-prof-yogesh-tyagi-suspended-all-you-need-to-know/story-oTCY0inWlrohAwEXsOJy1M.html

28-10-2020||Chandigarh||Over 70 cows die in shelter in Haryana’s Panchkula due to suspected food poisoning||Over 70 cows died due to suspected food poisoning in a shelter attached to a temple in Haryana’s Panchkula on Wednesday, officials said. Thirty other cows, who were also taken ill at the Mata Mansa Devi Gaudham, are responding to treatment, an official of Haryana’s Animal Husbandry and Dairying Department told reporters in Panchkula. “We have collected water and feed samples and we can only arrive at any conclusion when we receive the test report... but prima facie, it looks like a case of food poisoning,” he said. The General Manager (honorary) of the cow shelter, Ravinder Chihgal, said that vets were called on Tuesday evening when he came to know that some cows had fallen ill. “The reports I have got is that the cows died due to food poisoning. But one thing which is clear that food poisoning was not due to the fodder we gave them. “We suspect that some devotee who visited the temple was carrying some foodstuff which he gave to the cows causing food poisoning,” Chihgal told PTI over phone. Chihgal, who is currently out of station, said the cows which died were from two particular sheds. “We have a total of seven sheds in which nearly 1,400 cows are kept. Fatalities have been reported only in two sheds. “Had there been food poisoning due to fodder, deaths would have been much higher,” he said. Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, who is an MLA of the ruling BJP from Panchkula, visited the cow shelter and said he was deeply saddened by the incident. “We will get an inquiry done to find out if there were any lapses which led to this incident… and taking a lesson from this, we will ensure that such incidents do not happen in future. “Whatever precautions are needed, we will ensure they are taken in other gaushalas (cow shelter) also,” Gupta told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/over-70-cows-die-in-shelter-in-haryana-s-panchkula-due-to-suspected-food-poisoning/story-y0GxzILlQ2qTscPSy9p9uO.html

28-10-2020||Jaipur||3 Rajasthan civic bodies polls tomorrow, counting of votes on November 3||Polling for election to three municipal corporations of the state – Jaipur Heritage, Jodhpur North and Kota North – will be held on Thursday from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm, said the state election commissioner PS Mehra. He appealed to voters to follow the guidelines put in place to check the spread of coronavirus for safe and peaceful elections. Mehra said about 1.6 million voters will seal the fate of 951 candidates for 250 wards in the first phase of municipal elections. “We have increased the number of polling stations and increased polling time by half an hour to ensure Covid-19 guidelines are followed,” he said. The SEC appealed to everyone to wear a mask to the polling station. “People without masks will not be allowed to vote,” he said. A note from the state election department said 3,393 electronic voting machines will be used in the municipal election on Thursday, 30% of them are in reserve. The second phase of polling – for Jaipur Greater, Jodhpur South and Kota South – will be held on November 1. Counting for both phases will be done on November 3. The state government bifurcated municipal bodies in three big cities of the state in October last year, making way for two Mayors in each of these. Urban development and housing minister Shanti Dhariwal had said the three cities with population of more than a million will be split into two municipal corporations each and reconstituted. In Jaipur, the Heritage Municipal Corporation has 100 wards and a population of 1.34 million, and Greater Jaipur Municipal Corporation has 150 wards covering 1.7 million population. Jodhpur was bifurcated into Jodhpur North and Jodhpur South with 80 wards each, and Kota into Kota North (70 wards) and Kota South (80 wards). The decision increased the number of municipal corporations in Rajasthan to 10 – two each in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota, Ajmer, Bikaner, Udaipur and Bharatpur. Jaipur and Kota municipal corporations have been strongholds of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Congress is seeking to win it on the plank of development while the BJP is seeking votes over the alleged misgovernance of the Gehlot government. Campaigning in the three municipal corporations going to polls on Thursday ended on Tuesday. Five Assembly constituencies are covered in Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation and four of them are represented by Congress MLAs. Chief whip Mahesh Joshi, cabinet minister Pratap Singh Khhachariyawas, and MLAs Rafeek Khan and Ameen Kagzi are putting their weight behind Congress candidates to form a board in the newly set up civic body. In Jodhpur, where municipal council was upgraded as municipal corporation in 1994, Congress has won the civic polls thrice in the five elections held for municipal corporation. Soorsaagar MLA Suryakanta Vyas and Jodhpur City MLA Manisha Panwar started their political careers as councillors. Similarly, Bhanwar Balai and Mansingh Deora were also councillors before becoming MLAs. BJP councilor Amita Chaudhary was later elected Zila Pramukh, while Rajendra Gehlot, who was BJP councilor on the previous board, is currently a Rajya Sabha member. In Kota, KNMC falls in the home constituency of Dhariwal, who has taken the command of the civic polls. For BJP, Churu MLAs Rajendra Singh Rathore and Kiran Maheshwari are handling the campaign in Kota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/3-rajasthan-civic-bodies-polls-tomorrow-counting-of-votes-on-november-3/story-uCgmB3Fu13rRDB6Zn0jHDI.html

28-10-2020||City||Three-member panel on Punjabi University reform meets tomorrow||Patiala A three-member high-level committee constituted to suggest measures to improve the functioning of Punjabi University will hold a key meeting on October 29 (Thursday). The committee was mandated to submit its report within a month of its formation on August 11, but it missed the deadline due to covid-19 pandemic and the admission process at the varsity. The committee comprises state additional chief secretary (revenue) Viswajeet Khanna; state higher education secretary Rahul Bhandari and vice-chancellor BS Ghuman. Bhandari said the committee is compiling its report, which will soon be submitted to the state government.“We will hold a meeting on Thursday in which issues concerning the varsity will be discussed comprehensively,” Bhandari said. The committee, which was formed with the approval of the chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, is mandated to thoroughly work upon improving the fiscal health of the university, which is presently in doldrums, as it has been toiling hard to meet its committed expenditure. According to budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, with expenditure at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit. Bhandari said the committee had held several meetings and was looking minutely at the record the varsity had submitted to them. As per the notification that the state government had issued, the committee aims to suggest measures on the optimisation of salary budget, quality of staff and courses that the university offers. These steps will result in increase in revenues, rationalisation of pay scales and pension benefits for faculty and staff, based on the guidelines of the Punjab government. For other administrative areas, the committee is expected to call for a review of courses and consequent rationalisation (including redeployment) of faculty within and across departments. Reforms in the working of constituent colleges, regional centres and neighbourhood campuses is also on the agenda.The notification states that the committee will also review the system of admission and examination and suggest reform measures. It will also examine the current use of information technology in pedagogy, including digital delivery of content, and academic management of courses.NO DECISION ON SPECIAL GRANT OF Rs 20 CRORE The state government is yet to take any decision on special grant of Rs 20 crore that the varsity has sought for payment of salaries and pensions to employees.“Officials from departments of finance and higher education department are looking into the matter. This is not for the first time that the varsity has sought special grant. In July, the government provided Rs 20 crore. This was on the condition that the institution should first put its house in order before asking for funds again,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-member-panel-on-punjabi-university-reform-meets-tomorrow/story-IZf7LnNyYvdXe9IeOBywWM.html

He is using different names and so we are keeping the names guarded as the search for his Aadhar card is on,” PI Yadav said. “The other person arrested helped and guided the shooter and is aged 40. He is from Khandala. The assassin used both the weapons with ease and is professional who might have committed crimes in the past. The duo will be produced in court tomorrow,” PI Yadav said.

The PMC received Rs 85.83 crore in taxes and the total amount waived off is Rs 49.03 crore.” Kanade said, “This scheme is only for the period between October 2nd to November 30th. It is a usual experience that maximum citizens took advantage of any scheme in the last few weeks when the deadlines are near. PMC is hoping for a handsome amount from the month of November.” According to Kanade, in 25 days, 36,443 residents took benefit without a campaign. “This is a great sign to get more revenue. Citizens should come forward and pay the tax within a stipulated time frame is the appeal from the civic body,” he added. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “Pune is the city, which receives maximum property tax in the Maharashtra state. We are even ahead of Mumbai. Despite lockdown, citizens pay tax to the civic body. As some citizens were not able to pay property tax, the elected members launched the amnesty scheme and gave relief to the citizens.”Rasne said, “Citizens having dues less than Rs 50 lakh can take benefit of this scheme. I am hoping that around Rs 1,000 crore additional revenue would be generated through this amnesty scheme.” Rasne appealed to the citizens to take maximum benefit of this scheme and clear any outstanding taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/amnesty-scheme-pmc-collects-85-83cr-in-taxes/story-RDN5Eh5drmmbQmf2Ss7OoK.html
28-10-2020||Pune||Positivity rate drops in Pune during Navratri; experts advise caution till December||Pune The city continued to see decline in fresh Covid cases even during the ten days of Navratri and Dussehra festival, a pattern evident since the beginning of October. Experts, however, caution that the decline should be consistent at least till December for a clear picture of Covid situation. The city’s average positivity rate fell from 22.56% as of October 17 to 11.8% as of October 26. Positivity rate indicates the number of fresh cases being reported for every 100 tests conducted for Covid-19 During the ten days from October 17 to October 25, 27,863 tests were conducted of which 3,212 were reported positive which took the positivity rate to 11.52% for the ten-day period. The figure is a significant decline as compared to the average positivity rate record of 22.56% as of October 15. Decline in positivity rate was also seen in the state during the same period. As per the state health department, as of October 15, of the 79.14 lakh samples tested for Covid-19, 15.64 lakh tested positive which took the average positivity rate of the state at 19.77%. As of October 26, of the 86.45 lakh samples tested in the state, over 16.48 lakh tested positive which brought down the average positivity rate to 19.07%. During these days (October 15 to October 26), the state tested 7.30 lakh samples out of which 84,050 tested positive for the infection which took the positivity rate to 11.50% for the ten days. With the administration taking adequate steps to tackle a possible second wave because of the festive season, the decline in fresh cases during the ten days of Navratri and Dussehra is a positive news. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, epidemiologist and chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “It is evident that there is a decline in the number of fresh cases reported from Pune. Not just positivity rate, but all indicators, including vacant beds and demand for drugs, shows the decline. However, the decline needs to be consistent. Dussehra just got over and for at least the next 14 days people need to be aware about the possible virus spread. By mid-November, we would be celebrating Diwali and then we will have to make sure that the decline continues for the next 28 days at least till the festival season is over. Hence, the decline needs to be consistent till December end.” Salunkhe said that at least 60-70% of people should follow the norms to successfully break the virus chain. “Masks must be mandatorily worn by people and we must avoid touching our face. Currently this is the only weapon we have against the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/positivity-rate-drops-during-navratri-experts-advise-caution-till-dec/story-2EzWkLBSYYCwvlWKBJZtuN.html

28-10-2020||Election:||PM does not talk about unemployment in his speeches: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he talks about other countries in his speeches but not about the problems facing India such as unemployment.Gandhi, who arrived in West Champaran district for his second round of campaigning in the ongoing state elections, also attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over unemployment and the issue of migration.Addressing his rally at Valmiki Nagar, the former Congress president said he was pained to see that Prime Minister Modis effigy was burnt in Punjab on the occasion of Dusshera, and added that it reflected the “anger” of youths and farmers.“Youths and farmers of Punjab and Bihar and youths of Uttar Pradesh are angry that our PM keeps making speeches with Bihar Chief Minister and talks about other countries, but not the problems confronting our country such as unemployment,” he said.He said the prime minister and the Bihar chief minister used to raise the issue of unemployment earlier but no longer now. “Now, the PM does not say in his speeches that he would give two crore jobs. Because the people of Bihar have realised that he had lied. “I can guarantee that if the PM comes today and promises two crore jobs to youths, perhaps the crowd would shoo him off, telling him that he had lied,” Gandhi said.The Congress knows how to run a country, how to stand with farmers and give employment, but “we don’t know how to lie”, he said.Criticising the Centre over the three recently passed farm laws, he said its “pilot project” was implemented in Bihar in 2006 when the mandi system was abolished in the state.“What Nitish Kumar did in Bihar in 2006, Narendra Modi is doing in Punjab, Haryana and across the country,” Gandhi said.The Congress has fielded Pravesh Kumar Mishra for the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha bye-election, while Rajesh Singh has been nominated for the assembly poll from there.The by-poll to Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha constituency has been necessitated due to death of JD(U) MP Baidyanath Mahto.The Lok Sabha by-poll will be held on November 7 and the results will be announced on November 10 alongside the results of Bihar assembly elections.Later in the day, Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to address a rally at Kusheswar Asthan in Darbhanga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/pm-does-not-talk-about-unemployment-in-his-speeches-rahul-gandhi/story-GyE1caT8oqsW7rGTr7F94H.html
28-10-2020||Lucknow||Five BSP MLAs withdraw support for party’s Rajya Sabha nominee||In an apparent U-turn, five of the 10 BSP MLAs who had proposed Ramji Gautam as the party candidate for the Rajya Sabha withdrew their support on Wednesday, saying their signatures were forged.The five Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs have given in writing that their signatures on the senior leader’s nomination papers were forged, Vidhan Sabha secretariat sources said.But the dramatic development, a day after Gautam had filed nomination for next month’s Rajya Sabha elections, triggered speculation that the five Uttar Pradesh MLAs are planning to switch sides.The five MLAs are Aslam Raini, Aslam Chaudhary, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind and Hargovind Bhargava.The scrutiny of nominations is being undertaken Wednesday for the election on November 9.The returning officer will look into the complaint about the forged signatures and take a decision, sources said.On Monday, Mayawati’s party had fielded its national coordinator and Bihar in-charge Ramji Gautam for the Rajya Sabha elections even though it did not have the number to ensure his victory.BSP leaders had indicated that they expected the other non-BJP parties to support his candidature, Altogether, 11 candidates, including eight from the BJP, have filed their papers for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh going to the polls in the biennial elections.Given the overwhelming strength of the BJP in the UP Assembly, all eight candidates – including Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri – fielded by the ruling party are expected to be elected.Of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant, three were earlier held by the BJP, four by the Samajwadi Party, two by the BSP and one by the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/five-bsp-mlas-withdraw-support-for-party-s-rajya-sabha-nominee/story-rAvieT1tFFKS0JmP1IosRJ.html

The project is expected to begin by the end of the current financial year.“We have appointed DIMTS our consultant to suggest which technology to use, how to integrate VLTS with the control and command centre, and how to execute the overall project to achieve the best results,” transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu said. “We want to roll out the project within the next six months as a long-term measure to ensure women’s safety in public transport vehicles.”Also read | Gorakhpur Sainik School to incorporate modern technology and Indian heritage: UP CMIn January 2018, the Centre issued a notification making it mandatory for all public transport vehicles, including buses and taxis, to have VLTS devices and panic buttons to especially ensure the safety of women passengers.As per the notification, all new public transport vehicles, except autorickshaws and e-rickshaws, registered on or after January 2019, were to be equipped with VLTS. Respective states were supposed to notify the date of installing VLTS devices and emergency buttons in the older vehicles registered up to December 31, 2018.Officials said the project has been delayed in Uttar Pradesh because of the lack of control and command centre to keep real-time track of the movement of vehicles and to generate alerts for police to act when a passenger is in trouble.They added the transport department is now speeding up the project in view of the state government’s increased focus on women safety as a part of the ongoing 180-day Mission Shakti. The Centre will provide the state money to implement the project.A proposed control and command centre is expected to be integrated with the police’s dial 112 for quick response to passengers in distress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-vehicle-tracking-panic-buttons-to-boost-safety-of-women-passengers/story-gPOWG7SISA2EOVs4eGCYlM.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records most delayed south-west monsoon withdrawal since 1975||Mumbai reported the most-delayed withdrawal of monsoon since the India Meteorological Department (IMD) started maintaining records in 1975.The IMD declared the south-west monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai, the rest of Maharashtra and the country on Wednesday (October 28).Prior to this year, the most delayed withdrawal of monsoon from Mumbai was recorded on October 26 in 2010. Monsoon had withdrawn from the city on October 24 in 2011 and 2017.“This is definitely one of the most delayed withdrawal of monsoon from the country. It is also the most delayed withdrawal from Mumbai and Maharashtra,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES).Also Read: Mumbai’s minimum temperature drops slightly but winter still a month away, says IMDHe attributed the reason to the presence of La Niña. La Niña is a weather pattern, where the western Pacific Ocean warms up creating a low pressure near Australia, pulling winds from the Indian Ocean and strengthening equatorial dynamics while keeping south-west monsoon circulation active.“During La Niña years, we tend to get extended monsoon and more rainfall. Conditions were favourable for sustaining those conditions for a longer time. Both the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean were very active this year,” said Rajeevan. In April, the IMD had announced the new monsoon onset date for Mumbai as June 11, against June 10, and the new withdrawal date as October 8, against September 29.The normal duration of the monsoon season over Mumbai this year was expected to span over 120 days -- from June 11 to October 8 -- as opposed to 112 days – from June 10 to September 29. The forecast turned out to be wrong as monsoon spanned over 136 days --from June 14 to October 28. This year, the onset of monsoon was declared on June 14, three days later than the prediction.Last year, monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai was declared on October 14. In 2018, it was on October 6.“In view of significant reduction in rainfall activity over most parts of the country, the south-west monsoon has withdrawn from the entire country on Wednesday. Simultaneously, with the setting in of north-easterly winds in the lower levels of troposphere, the north-east monsoon rainfall commenced over extreme southern peninsular India on Wednesday (October 28),” an IMD release stated. Rajeevan said delayed withdrawals and late monsoon onset have emerged as a pattern. “In June, when we revised the onset and withdrawal dates, it was done keeping in mind an extension of the monsoon season. The onset and delayed withdrawal of monsoon has become a recurring phenomenon,” he said. Over 136 days this monsoon, Mumbai recorded a total rainfall of 3,857.1 millimetres (mm) against the annual average of 2,514 mm.According to IMD, this is the highest rainfall recorded in at least a decade for the June–October period. It was the second-highest rainfall (3,687mm) for the June-September period since readings were started to be collated in 1944. The highest all-time seasonal rainfall was recorded at 3,759.7 mm in 1958 . The official four months of the monsoon season ended just 70 mm short of the all-time record this year.Maximum rainfall was recorded in July at 1,502.7mm -- the highest since 1944 -- followed by the highest in August at 1,247.6mm since 1959. However, June recorded the lowest rainfall in five years at 395 mm. But in September, 60% of excess rainfall was recorded at 549.1 mm. Mumbai recorded the second-highest October rainfall in 10 years at 170.1 mm -- 27.6 mm short of the decades’ monthly high of 197.7 mm that was recorded in 2012. Mumbai and Maharashtra recorded 67% and 16% of excess rainfall, respectively, between June and September. Mumbai and Maharashtra recorded 103% and 75% of excess rainfall, respectively, from October 1 to October 28.“Mumbai and Maharashtra have reported an exceptional performance as far as rainfall this monsoon is concerned. Now, it’s high time for the monsoon to withdraw,” Rajeevan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-most-delayed-south-west-monsoon-withdrawal-since-1975/story-dnsREhl2zXaYX6C6lVx0UN.html

Shiv Sena, Maharashtra’s ruling party, has also demanded that Bigg Boss’ shooting permit be cancelled. Jaan, the son of Bollywood playback singer Kumar Sanu, reportedly asked his fellow contestants to not talk in Marathi on the show. Following this, the two political parties that were formed to protect the rights of Marathi manoos have demanded action. Also Read: Maharashtra’s Covid-19 mortality rate continues to remain high even as national rate reducesMNS film workers’ union chief Ameya Khopkar has warmed that the MNS will not allow Bigg Boss to be filmed if both Jaan and Colors Channel do not apologise within 24 hours. “We will not allow the shooting of Bigg Boss to take place if both of them don’t apologise within 24 hours,” threatened Khopkar. He added, “We will see how Jaan gets work in Mumbai. Anyone who hates the Marathi language should get out of Maharashtra.” In the scene, Jaan is seen deriding his fellow contestant who spoke in Marathi, saying she should not speak in Marathi in front of him. He tells her he gets irritated with the language and if she has the courage, she should speak in Hindi. In a tweet, Shiv Sena secretary and the head of the party’s Chitrapat Sena Aadesh Bandekar said, “Bigg Boss showrunners and the person [Jaan Kumar Sanu] must immediately apologise to Maharashtra and the people of Maharashtra. The person should be immediately evicted [from the show]...

28-10-2020||Mumbai||How is unfurling national flag a crime in J&K? Sena asks Centre||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Wednesday slammed the Centre while asking it what has changed in Jammu & Kashmir after the end to the region’s special status that the Indian flag cannot be hoisted in the Union Territory. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena called it a defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government at the Centre.The editorial comes in the backdrop of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s statement on Friday that the members of her party would not hoist the Indian tricolour unless they are allowed to raise the flag of Jammu & Kashmir. Constitution’s Article 370, which was nullified last year to strip Jammu & Kashmir of its special status, provided for a separate flag for the erstwhile state.Also read | Shiv Sena takes potshots at PM Narendra Modi’s address to nation, calls it ‘best in last 7-8 months’“There is President’s rule in Kashmir, meaning Delhi controls it. But unfurling the tricolour has become a crime. Then what has changed after repealing Article 370?... The nation wants to know,” the editorial said.The editorial added the situation in Kashmir remains the same it was before the nullification. “The situation in Kashmir still has not changed. The improvements that seem are merely cosmetic,” it added.The editorial criticised Mufti for her statement. It called another former chief minister Farooq Abdullah’s purported comment that they will seek China’s help to restore Article 370 treasonous.Abdullah’s son, Omar Abdullah, has maintained his father’s comments were distorted and he never said they will seek China’s help.The Sena, which parted ways with the BJP last year to form the government in Maharashtra with Congress’s and Nationalist Congress Party’s help, accused Mufti and Farooq Abdullah of speaking the separatists’ language. “...opponents in Kashmir have come together and they have resolved to bring back Article 370,” the editorial said, referring to Mufti, Abdullah and other political forces who have joined hands in Kashmir against the changes to the region’s constitutional status.Sena leader and Saamana executive editor Sanjay Raut asked the Centre to take action against Abdullah and Mufti, who were among thousands of people detained last year to stem protests against the nullification of Constitution’s Article 370. “If Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and others want to impose Article 370 in Kashmir with help of China, then the central government should take strict steps. If any person who wants to unfurl tricolour in Kashmir is stopped, then I consider it as treason.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-is-unfurling-national-flag-a-crime-in-j-k-sena-asks-centre/story-buaQVb8O1IRZc5dtmNsh2M.html

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Pankaja Munde praises Sharad Pawar, triggers speculation about her exit from BJP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pankaja Munde on Tuesday shared the stage with Sharad Pawar, 79, at a meeting in Pune to discuss the issues faced by sugarcane cutters and later praised the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader in a tweet, triggering fresh speculation about the possibility of her exit from her party. “Hats off to Sharad Pawar…Your stamina in hold meetings, touring, and working for hours even during the pandemic is simply commendable. Though I come from a different party, ideology, and type of politics, Mundesaaheb [her father late Gopinath Munde] taught me to respect the hard workers,” she tweeted in Marathi on Tuesday night.Munde’s praise for Pawar comes a week after another BJP leader Eknath Khadse joined the NCP. She is considered the BJP’s Other Backward Class (OBC) face and is believed to be upset as after her loss in the 2019 assembly elections, she was expecting to be nominated to Maharashtra’s Legislative Council. Instead of her nomination to the upper House of the state legislature, she was named as one of the BJP’s national secretaries.Also Read: A year on, Maharashtra election results that caused drama; political uncertainty continuesMunde is seen as a rival of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who has helmed the party in Maharashtra since 2014, within the BJP. Her supporters feel her detractors within the party tried to cut her to size when she was part of Fadnavis’s cabinet. Leaders close to her also say her 2019 election defeat was orchestrated from within the party. She lost to her cousin, NCP’s Dhananjay Munde.Pankaja Munde has publicly expressed her disappointment and dared her party to remove her. She earlier announced she will not be part of the BJP’s core team in the state.At a Dussehra rally in Beed on Sunday, she indirectly hit out at her detractors within the BJP. “Some leaders at the state level have vowed to finish me politically.” She also praised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for the Rs 10,000 crore package for the flood-hit farmers.BJP leaders admitted Pankaja Munde is upset with the party but said they do not expect her to quit like Khadse. “It is true that she is upset over the treatment meted out her along with a few other senior leaders like Khadse. She almost revolted against the state leadership in December last year after her defeat, but was later pacified,” said a BJP leader on condition of anonymity. “After Khadse’s exit, she has become vocal politically and has praised leaders from other parties as part of her strategy to build pressure on her detractors within the party. She is unlikely to quit the party immediately, as her importance as an OBC leader has increased after the exit of Khadse...”An NCP leader said that though she has been trying to develop cordial relations with their leaders, Shiv Sena would be her first choice because of the local political equations if she decides to shift her loyalties.Shiv Sena leader Arjun Khotkar has said they would be happy to induct her in their party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-pankaja-munde-praises-sharad-pawar-triggers-speculation-about-her-exit-from-bjp/story-jwznWVcu8izjLR9QWslsvJ.html

Though Vijayan and the ruling CPI(M) distanced themselves from Sivasankar after the smuggling case came to light, the senior IAS officer ’s detention is a major embarrassment to the government. The Opposition Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stepped up the pressure, seeking Vijayan’s resignation.Also read | Role of elusive businessman in Kerala smuggling racket baffles probe teamSivasankar’s is a major detention in the four-month-old case. Taken to Kochi, he will be produced in the economic offences court later, a senior officer part of the multi-agency probe said. Earlier in the day, both the ED and the Customs opposed Sivasankar’s anticipatory bail petition, saying that he knew about the smuggling and accrued financial benefits from some of the deals brokered by Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the case. Opposing his bail plea, additional solicitor general of India S V Raju contended that investigation so far had given enough indications that he was aware of the activities of Swapna Suresh and custodial interrogation was necessary to unearth these aspects. Later, a single bench headed of justice Ashok Menon dismissed his plea, observing that he should have been more careful while dealing with such people and directed him to cooperate with the ongoing probe. Earlier, the court had stayed his arrest till October 28. The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of the yellow metal was seized by the Customs from a diplomatic consignment addressed to the UAE Consulate. Later P S Sarith Kumar, a former public relations officer of the consulate who came to receive the luggage, was arrested by the Customs. Two other suspects, Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Sivasankar was suspended after his alleged links with Swapna Suresh surfaced. A multi-agency team comprising NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax is probing the case and 32 people have been arrested so far. There are reports that smuggling was going on for over a year through the UAE Consulate and they smuggled at least 400 kg gold in several consignments. State high education minister K T Jaleel was also grilled in connection with one of the consignments that came in last March. But the minister said consignment carried only religious books. Grilled twice, probe agencies are yet to give him a clean chit. Soon after Sivasankar’s arrest, the Opposition upped the ante seeking the CM’s resignation. “Pinarayi Vijayan knew about the smuggling. He can’t get away by sacrificing his secretary. We want him to resign,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. But the ruling CPI(M) put up a brave face, saying the government had disowned Sivasankar him long back. “The Opposition is playing dirty politics. The government has nothing to do with his arrest. The CM had made it clear that if Sivasankar committed any wrong he will have to face repercussion also,” said party leader A N Shamseer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-ed-takes-cm-s-ex-secretary-into-custody-minutes-after-his-bail-plea-is-rejected/story-5Zc636E2D8GMZd5jy31mXK.html

The death rate of other states and the nation overall has been steadily coming down.Maharashtra has witnessed a significant reduction in the daily caseload. The state’s positivity rate in October dropped to 14.20% from over 20% last month. The case fatality rate of the state has, however, only dropped to 2.63% from 2.65% a month ago on September 27.Meanwhile, the national rate reduced to 1.5% from 1.57% over a month. Gujarat, which has ranked closer to Maharashtra in mortality rate over the last few months, has been able to reduce its CFR to 2.20% now from 2.57% on September 27.Also Read: ‘17% Covid deaths linked to pollution’“We had set the target of bringing the CFR below 1% in the beginning of July and had directed all district authorities accordingly. Despite hard efforts, we have not been able to achieve the target. Our tracing of contacts is still poor in several districts, besides the inferior quality of the health infrastructure. The machinery has not been able to bring infected people to health facilities and test them early. Proper tracing and awareness to remove stigma could have helped achieve this,” said an official from the health department, requesting anonymity.The official added that a few districts like Solapur, Chandrapur have been, however, able to bring down the CFR below 4% from over 6% two months ago.“We have been trying our level best to bring down the CFR. People report late to health facilities after having developed symptoms leading to the complications.

It is true that the daily testing has reduced, but tests are being administered as per the requirement,” said Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary, Maharashtra.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said that the CFR is high also because of the poor facilities in ICUs and shortage of oxygen and ventilators in many districts. “The focus of the state machinery should now be more on the ICUs than the Covid care centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-mortality-rate-continues-to-remain-high-even-as-national-rate-reduces/story-FjK2mgnE5n1DVbInKjqTBL.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Poor hygiene, unsanitary conditions could lead to fewer deaths due to Covid-19: Study||Poor hygiene, unsanitary conditions, and lack of clean drinking water could result in fewer deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new study by Indian researchers suggests.The study by researchers from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, and the Chennai Mathematical Institute, seems to support the hygiene hypothesis wherein improved immunity is said to be behind people developing a less severe form of the viral disease.Bihar, which faces issues like a lack of clean drinking water facilities, has the Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.5%, as opposed to 1.5% nationally.CFR is defined as the number of deaths due to a particular disease as compared to the number of people suffering from it.Also Read: ‘17% Covid deaths linked to pollution’Kerala and Assam have a CFR of 0.4%, Telangana 0.5, and Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh 0.9%. CFR of 1% or less is what the Central government is also targeting nationally.In contrast, the researchers’ have highlighted that more developed states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Punjab have a CFR of 2% or more.Various developmental parameters were looked at as part of the study that includes quality of water and sanitation, and Covid-19 deaths per million population in at least 100 countries. The researchers found that the poorer the water-sanitation quality, the fewer were deaths per million population due to the viral disease as these conditions impacted a person’s overall immunity.Several experts have also been saying that there could be a correlation between lower Covid-19 fatality rate and improved immunity due to the living conditions as a person gets exposed to a variety of disease-causing microbes.“In India, the severity of infection seems to be low because our immunity levels are better modulated to fight off any infections as compared to Europeans and Americans. In fact, other viruses kill more. However, the infectivity rate of this virus is quite high so infections could go up in the future. Deaths will remain low,” said Dr NK Mehra, former head, transplant, immunology and immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Science, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/poor-hygiene-unsanitary-conditions-could-lead-to-fewer-deaths-due-to-covid-19-study/story-hdKdhdVC4JLdr8scHG8d9I.html

Kerala had topped the chart with 4,287 cases, and Maharashtra (3.645) was ranked third. “The state government had made the use of masks mandatory in April. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been urging the public to wear masks. At least 3,270 people were booked between Sasthi (October 22) and Dashami (October 26) for not wearing masks in public places,” said a Kolkata Police official.

Kolkata, which was reporting around 500 new Covid-19 cases a day in the first week of September, is recording around 900 fresh viral infections daily.Kolkata Police had purportedly lowered its guard in early October against those who were not wearing masks in public places. On an average, 160 people were booked daily between October 5 and October 11. More than 300 people were booked daily between September 5 and September 11. Around 410 violators were booked daily in August. The vigil against such violators was increased ahead of the Durga pujas, when Kolkata started reporting a spike in Covid-19 cases. Kolkata Police had booked at least 2,631 people between October 16 and 20. In the preceding six days, another 787 violators were booked. The state government had given a grant of Rs 50,000 each to around 34,000 Durga puja committees in a bid to rein in the spread of the contagion. The Calcutta high court (HC) had directed the Durga puja committee to use the money to distribute masks and sanitisers among revellers. A doctors’ forum had warned the Bengal government that any laxity during the festive season could lead up to a four-fold spike in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-over-3-200-people-booked-for-not-wearing-masks-during-durga-puja/story-TQBSFjf8UX9GEWVrsbm1uO.html

He cited a Supreme Court (SC) ruling in a bid to bolster his argument.Also Read | Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters, fearing arrest by CBI, request Bombay HC for early hearingPonda stated that the company was under the control of an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP), which was empowered to represent it in court.The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had acceded to a plea from a consortium of banks and in June 2018 admitted insolvency proceedings against VIL, which once was a multi-billion global conglomerate and the world’s largest picture tube manufacturer. NCLT had appointed the IRP to take charge of VIL’s affairs and from that date the board of directors surrendered its control. Ponda argued that the interim compensation order was infructuous since Dhoot did not plead guilty to the bounced cheque charge.Bank of Maharashtra lodged the complaint regarding the bounced cheque and Dhoot filed the petition through advocate Akash Menon.The petition stated that in October 2014, VIL had approached the bank for a working capital term loan of Rs 450 crore. The proposal was approved by the bank on October 22, when the loan agreement was signed by the two parties concerned.Dhoot claimed that VIL authorities were made to submit blank and signed cheques to the bank at the time of execution of the loan agreement. Later in April 2017, the bank declared VIL’s loan account a non-performing asset (NPA).Dhoot claimed that in June 2018, the bank made a bid to encash Rs 33.50 crore through a cheque.The bank initiated proceedings under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 after the cheque bounced, following which the metropolitan magistrate court passed the order on February 24.Advocate Menon said the HC has issued a notice to the bank.HC will hear the case next on December 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-stays-order-asking-videocon-founder-venugopal-dhoot-to-deposit-rs-6-75-crore-in-a-cheque-bouncing-case/story-pVoHJjfJoPRdvtNsro2thJ.html

28-10-2020||Gurugram||Woman shot dead by stalker, murder caught on camera||A 20-year-old college student was shot dead on Monday by her stalker and his friend after a botched abduction attempt outside her college in Haryana’s Ballabhgarh, police said, in a chilling incident that sent shock waves across the state and triggered protests by her classmates. Images of the two suspects — officials said one of them is politically connected — were caught in CCTV footage of daylight murder; the duo was arrested from Nuh on Tuesday after a massive search operation, according to police.On Monday afternoon, Touseef Ahmad, a resident of Kabeer Nagar in Sohna, and his friend, Rehaan (who goes by one name only), a resident of Riwasan in Nuh, arrived in a Hyundai i20 and tried to force Nikita Tomar, a B Com final-year student, into the vehicle as she came out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam, police added.After their attempt failed, Touseef chased her down and shot her in the head from a close range around 3.48pm, even as people passed by, showed the video. The suspects escaped from the crime scene, leaving Tomar, who was accompanied by a friend, in a pool of blood. She was rushed to a government hospital, where she was declared brought dead.The woman’s family said that Touseef, who district officials said is the son of a former legislator, had been harassing her for the last two years and asking her to marry him.They added that he had also been persuading her to convert to Islam. Police identified the suspects, tracked their mobile phones and traced them to Nuh. Both of them are third-year students of physiotherapy at Gurugram University. OP Singh, Faridabad police commissioner, said the suspects were arrested after a five-hour search operation. “After the murder, they fled to Nuh and did not reveal the incident to their family members. Their mobile phones were traced to different villages and were arrested,” he said. Haryana chief minister ML Khattar said he asked police to book the suspects under all relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and ensure that they received maximum punishment for the crime. State home minister Anil Vij said the murder weapon (a country-made pistol) has been recovered. “A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed; it is led by Anil Kumar, the assistant commissioner of police (crime) who would ensure quick investigation to ensure justice to the family of the victim,” he said.Anil Yadav, Faridabad assistant commissioner of police (crime), said a case under section 302 (murder) and relevant sections of the Arms Act was registered at the Ballabhgarh city police station. “The brother of the deceased, Naveen Tomar, has told police in a statement that the main accused (Touseef) was known to his sister and had been harassing her; he was forcing her to convert to Islam. The brother lodged a complaint against him a few months ago for harassment and molestation, but a compromise was reached”. That wasn’t the first complaint though. “An incident of abduction was reported on August 3, 2018, against the suspect, and the victim was recovered from Nuh…after his family members and relatives apologised, the families had an agreement… Touseef was warned against repeating any such incident,” he added. According to the police, the woman wrote to officials after she returned from Nuh in 2018, saying she went there with her friends and could not inform her parents before leaving in what she termed a misunderstanding.Police said the woman and Touseef were in the same school — he was her senior — and that she had been turning down his advances since 2018. The incident triggered protests and students and local residents blocked the Sohna-Ballabgarh road for several hours on Tuesday.Officials in the district administration, who did not want to be named, said Touseef is the son of a former Congress legislator from Nuh. But Nikita Arora, a Haryana Congress spokesperson, denied any links between the suspect and the party.“The slogans of “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (a central government campaign)” are hollow and the government has failed to ensure the safety and security of women. The accused has no relationship with Congress party,” Arora said. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, too, criticised the Khattar government over the law and order situation in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-shot-dead-by-stalker-murder-caught-on-camera/story-4R9q5aMZbStUqehoZ7JkiJ.html

28-10-2020||Patna||1 killed, 27 injured in Munger clash||An 18-year-old man was killed and 27 others injured in a clash during the immersion of Durga idols late on Monday night in Munger town, police said. The injured include 20 policemen, they added.While people present on the spot said that the police opened fire to control the crowd, officials alleged that the devotees participating in the procession fired at the security personnel.Prakash Bhagat, a member of the Durga idol immersion committee said that over 50 idols were installed in the town out of which devotees took 15 for immersion at the Deendayal Chowk on Monday night. Traditionally, the idols are immersed three days after Vijayadashami. However, in view of the first phase of assembly polls scheduled for Wednesday, the administration insisted on the immersion by 5 am on Tuesday.According to people present on the spot, police personnel allegedly beat up devotees participating in the procession around midnight which sparked off a protest with the organisers and devotees demanding action against the personnel.The devotees started pelting stones on the police which prompted a lathi charge, the locals in the area said. Munger’s superintendent of police Lipi Singh, however, said, “The mob pelted stones and opened fire on police which led to the death of one person and injured 27 people including 20 policemen.” The deceased was identified as Anurag Kumar. One of his relatives, Sadhna Kumar, said that he was shot in the head. At least 20 policemen, including SHOs of Sangarmpur, Kotwali, Kasim Bazar, Basudeopur police stations, were also injured, police officials said.“Seven other persons received bullet injuries. One of them was rushed to Bhagalpur in critical condition,” the deputy superintendent of Munger Sadar hospital, Dr Niranjan, said.The situation in the town and surrounding areas continued to be tense on Tuesday even after deployment of personnel from the Bihar Military Police (BMP) and paramilitary forces, apart from the district police officials.“The police later took the help of public representatives to facilitate the immersion. We are seeking video footage from local residents,” Munger district magistrate Rajesh Meena said. The Munger SP said police recovered three firearms, live cartridges and empty bullets from the scene of the clash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/1-killed-27-injured-in-munger-clash/story-SMgw5GoAkiU1XWwZcvWZIP.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Single-day Covid-19 cases in Capital touch new peak||The Capital on Tuesday added 4,853 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) — the most cases reported in a single-day so far since the first case was detected in the city on March 2. Before this, 4,473 new cases reported on September 16 was the previous single-day case record. The city had seen the first surge in cases in June-July.An expert committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had, earlier this month, warned that Delhi could see up to 15,000 Covid-19 a day during the winter months.  The number of cases picked up after a dip on Sunday when fewer people had been tested. The positivity rate – proportion of samples that returned positive among those tested — however remained well over 8%. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday claimed the positivity rate spike was down to testing the contacts of patients in a “targeted manner”. “If one person tests positive, we are looking for all their family members and contacts and getting them tested. This strategy is being closely monitored. What we have seen is that if one person tests positive, usually several members of the same family test positive,” Jain contended. But experts have also blamed the spike on poor adherence to safety norms such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, as “pandemic fatigue” appears to have kicked in, particularly during the festive season.To be sure, the rise in daily cases coincides with an increase in the number of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. On average, over 15,200 RT-PCR tests were conducted over the last seven days in Delhi, up from 13,900 the week before, and 10,471 the week before that. RT-PCR tests are more accurate than rapid antigen tests, which constitute about 72% of the tests conducted in the Capital over the last seven days and miss several positive cases. The Centre on Tuesday praised the Capital’s containment efforts, saying nearly 50% of all cases being reported in the city were coming from containment zones. “We have seen the efforts that were being made to contain the disease spread in Delhi that has led to about 50% of the cases being reported from designated containment zones,” said Dr VK Paul during a Union health ministry briefing on Tuesday. Delhi has 3,032 containment zones,as of Tuesday.New cases being reported across the country have declined gradually since September-end, dipping below 50,000 new cases a day this week. But Delhi has witnessed a spike, putting it among the top five states and Union territories reporting the highest number of cases. The Capital also reported 44 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, taking the toll in the city to 6,356. The number of deaths brought Delhi’s seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – to 1.01% on Tuesday. The cumulative CFR – based on the total number of cases and deaths reported in the city so far – stands at 1.74%, which is higher than the national average of 1.50%. With the increase in the number of cases over the last two weeks, the number of hospitalisations have also started increasing. There were over 5,400 people admitted to city hospitals with the infection as on Monday, up from about 5,100 admissions during the week. However, over 10,000 beds earmarked for the treatment of the pandemic infection continue to be vacant, as per data from the Delhi Corona app. Almost, 60% of the intensive care unit (ICU) beds, however, are occupied.“We are trying to put in more Bipap and non invasive ventilation on our existing beds in the wards to create more intensive care beds,” said a senior Delhi government official. “Delhi has been showing an up and down trend — this is the third time numbers are going up. Delhi is a mixing pot of people, and this non-steady-state is expected. There has been a lot of in-migration from other states — with some bringing the infection. That, coupled with the relaxation of discipline has led to a rise in cases,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/single-day-covid-19-cases-in-capital-touch-new-peak/story-ElSBfxzY0kCYFxkCOAsPAO.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Hotel Broadway checks out||The friendly doorman is nowhere to be seen. A printed notice slapped on the glass door says that Hotel Broadway is closed —“Since the running of... is no longer economically viable, the management is constrained to close down the same with effect from 21st May... workmen are being paid closure compensation...”A piece of Delhi is now history.Broadway’s closure was not reported until now. It shut down so noiselessly that the news would have gone unnoticed but for a chance occasion of coming face-to-face with its locked door. Like many businesses these days, the landmark fell victim to Covid-19. “It was heavily dependent on foreign tourists,” said Mukta Kapoor, Group Head - Communications of Old World Hospitality Group that owns the property. “With the social distancing norms and lack of tourist inflow expected to continue in the foreseeable future, it was thought best to shut down,” she added.The destination will, however, continue to live in outdated guidebooks. It finds a quaint mention in the Lonely Planet India, 2019 edition—“Five-storey Hotel Broadway was Delhi’s first “high-rise”, when it opened in 1956, with single room going for 15 rupees. Today, it’s comfortable, charming, quirky and slightly more expensive. It’s worth staying here for the restaurant Chor Bizarre and Thugs Bar. Some rooms have old-fashioned wood panelling, while others have been kitted out by French designer Catherine Levy.”Opened with 26 rooms, Broadway enjoyed a unique location among hotels — it stood at the point where New Delhi gives way to the old city, on Asaf Ali Road, just a picturesque stroll from the Walled City. For many Delhiwale, it was the hotel’s Kashmiri speciality restaurant, Chor Bizarre, that was the stuff memories were made of. Late actor Shashi Kapoor often dropped by during his visits to the Capital, according to many anecdotes told to this reporter by the restaurant waiters in the recent past. Shashi Kapoor would always say in Hindustani that “Janab (sir), what will you serve me today… Give me whatever you feel like, but please give it from the heart.” Pakistani leader Nawaz Sharif had a lunch here in 1991 when he was in town to attend Rajiv Gandhi’s funeral.Stepping into the dimly lit restaurant was like entering into a black-and-white Bollywood classic. Old Hindi songs played in a loop. It was impossible to finish the delicious Tabaak Maaz and Haakh without hearing the same Mohammed Rafi song from the Dev Anand film Guide at least twice. The restaurant’s decor had all the madcap curios you’d expect from a place whose name puns on “chor bazaar”, or thief market. Each table was different. One had sewing machine pedals. Another had Kashmiri jewellery displayed under its glass top. A staircase that went up to nowhere was a showstopper. The buffet’s salads and chaat would be arranged on a 1927 Fiat Balilla. The buffet was discontinued some years ago, but the car remained, and diners would get photographs taken by the stewards, some of whom were long-time servers who gave the restaurant its courtesy, class, and gravitas.Chor Bizarre came up only in 1990 though. Earlier, the Broadway’s in-house guests dined upstairs in a no-frills hall. Upstairs was also home to Thugs, the bar famous for its portraits of iconic Hindi film villains. As the only watering hole in this part of the city where one could while away an afternoon with whiskey or vodka, it was truly special. One often spotted the same set of middle-aged gloomy men sitting on their regular tables, alone and self-immersed.This morning the hotel’s exterior is looking as morose. A lone bicycle is parked by the hotel sign. Meanwhile, there is no decision on what use the building will be put to in the future, according to the owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-hotel-broadway-checks-out/story-qq7DyQ6QEfOVtmKBEqsUTJ.html
28-10-2020||Chandigarh||New land laws strengthen idea of India: J&K BJP chief||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday welcomed new land laws announced by the Centre for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and dismissed allegations of Kashmir-centric parties that the BJP was selling out Jammu and Kashmir to outsiders. Reacting to the claims of the Opposition, Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina called it a ‘propaganda of the unholy Gupkar Alliance’. “If people from Jammu and Kashmir can purchase land and settle in other parts of India then why cannot people from other parts settle in J&K? India is one nation and the new land laws strengthen the idea of India,” Raina said. “J&K is an integral part of India. If a citizen of J&K can purchase land, establish businesses and live in any part of the country then why cannot a citizen of India live in J&K? Any citizen of India is entitled to live in J&K because J&K is an integral and inseparable part of India. There is nothing wrong in it,” he said, adding that Article 370 and 35-A were a stumbling block against the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir. “The Opposition is trying to create a controversy out of the new land laws,” he said. Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta also welcomed the new land laws and said, “If we can go and settle anywhere and purchase land then why cannot they? It has strengthened our slogan of ‘one India. Earlier, when Article 370 existed, our daughters getting married to outsiders were deprived of their right to property in J&K”. Gupta also said that the new laws will also give an impetus to the investment and business in J&K and in turn will provide employment to the youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-land-laws-strengthen-idea-of-india-j-k-bjp-chief/story-txXwrkGrGEULmsbdOqRY1H.html

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Ghatkopar death: Mumbai civic body report inconclusive as manhole lid found in place, no eyewitnesses||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) inquiry into the death of woman who fell into a drain at Ghatkopar on October 3, remains inconclusive. The inquiry report submitted on Friday last week, states that the old manhole cover was in place when the civic body staff visited the site for inspection, and no eyewitness came forward to recount the incident or own up that they had removed or replaced the drain cover.In absence of such evidence, the report claims it is unable to conclude what happened on October 3. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has now directed the ward office to lodge a first information report (FIR) with Mumbai Police to continue with the inquiry, check CCTV footage of the area, or find eyewitnesses to the incident and record their statements.A 32-year-old woman, identified as Sheetal Dama, had died after falling into an open manhole near Global Hospital in Ghatkopar (East) on the evening of October 3. On October 4, locals spotted a bag of wheat flour near an open drain and the members of Dama’s family were informed. The fire brigade and BMC staff from the stormwater drains department conducted rescue and search operations for the missing person, but called it off after having no success by the end of the day. Dama’s body was later recovered by the locals near Haji Ali in Worli on the morning of October 5. BMC then set up an inquiry under deputy municipal commissioner (infrastructure) with a 15-day deadline to submit the report.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the stormwater drains department said, “When a team of civic body officials visited the spot for inquiry, the original cover was in place, but the BMC had not replaced it. No one came forward to own up that they had replaced the cover. There were no eyewitnesses to the incident either. No one saw the woman falling into the manhole. We have been unable to determine what happened.”BMC also said, the fact that the woman fell into the drain can be established circumstantially, as a bag of groceries she was carrying was found lying near the manhole the next morning, whereas it is not possible to conclude the events in the absence of above facts.“There is no question of taking action against anybody as we have not been able to conclude what happened. Police can determine if an element of mischief is involved in the incident,” Velarasu said.In 2017, renowned doctor Deepak Amrapurkar died after falling down an open manhole near Elphinstone Road when the area was inundated after heavy rain. It was later investigated that a local had removed the manhole cover to quicken the pace of water draining out of a waterlogged street. Following this, BMC had decided to install protective grills under the manhole covers.As per data available with Hindustan Times, until June this year, BMC has installed 2,772 protective grills under manhole covers across Mumbai, of which 2,008 are in the island city, 203 in the western suburbs, and 399 in the eastern suburbs. Velarasu said, “After that incident, BMC has been issuing strict instructions to all ward staff to regularly inspect manhole covers. We receive a monthly report about it. This is a very sensitive issue and is taken seriously by the civic body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ghatkopar-death-mumbai-civic-body-report-inconclusive-as-manhole-lid-found-in-place-no-eyewitnesses/story-8vH0fjZfXVIsLzFPH7w5gO.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s minimum temperature drops slightly but winter still a month away, says IMD||The Mumbai suburbs on Tuesday experienced a nip in the air as minimum temperatures dropped to 22 degrees Celsius, a three-degree drop from 25 degrees Celsius the previous day. The Santacruz weather station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum temperature of 33.5 degree Celsius, and minimum temperature of 22.2 degrees Celsius – one degree below the normal temperature of 23 degrees Celsius. The Colaba station recorded a maximum temperature of 32.2 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Minimum temperature of around 23 degree Celsius with partly cloudy sky is expected over the next two days, according to IMD’s forecast.The meteorological bureau clarified that while temperatures have dropped and may remain low for the next couple of days, winter is still at least a month away. “Temperature dropped slightly on Tuesday, but it is not an indication of the onset of winter. As monsoon will start withdrawing from Mumbai, it is expected that humidity will decrease and temperatures will be recorded around 22-23 degrees. Low temperatures may continue for a couple more days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. However, the onset of winter will begin only in December, as per usual, he added. There was no change in the withdrawal line of monsoon from north Maharashtra. IMD had declared the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from north Maharashtra on Monday. Withdrawal is likely to start on Wednesday. The line of withdrawal passes through Dahanu in north Konkan, Nashik, north-central Maharashtra, parts of Marathwada and entire Vidarbha. Monsoon withdrawal from other parts of the Konkan coast including Mumbai is expected over the next 24 hours, the IMD said. This is expected to be one of the most delayed withdrawals from the city in the past 10 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-minimum-temperature-drops-slightly-winter-still-a-month-away-says-imd/story-0Hxwk9GRJzZVVvsTjlAsTL.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sessions court rejects pre-arrest bail plea of retired bank manager||The sessions court rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a 63-year-old retired bank manager who was arrested for ‘casually’ sanctioning a loan worth ₹2.50 crores to property without proper verification of a company, which later turned out to be fake.Balkrishna Vyas, a resident of Indore, was the bank manager of Bank of India when the alleged fraud took place in 2014. As per the complaint lodged with Mahim police on May 26, 2018, by Rafiq Maniyar, one Sunil Gupta had availed the loan of ₹2.50 crore by mortgaging his property illegally to Bank of India, Kalbadevi branch. According to an informant, in the year 2014, due to financial issues, he approached co-accused Sharad Rochlani through mediator for selling his property situated at Dasai Naka, Murbad. Rochlani gave him ₹8 lakh as a token amount and informant gave him documents of his property. In the year 2016, he received notice of Bank of India. On enquiry, he learnt that his property is mortgaged by Rochlani for availing the loan in the name of Sunil Gupta.On the complaint, the Mahim police summoned the bank manager to join the investigation. Fearing arrest, Vyas approached the court for pre-arrest bail and claimed after receipt of the loan application, a necessary procedure like spot inspection, search report from registrar office and other miscellaneous things were done with due diligence. He has no concern with the fraud committed by the co-accused.The prosecution objected to the plea and claimed the loan which is sanctioned for expansion of Gayatri Export Company is a fictitious company. The applicant has misused his authority and caused wrongful loss to the bank and wrongful gain to the co-accused. It is further contended that the applicant and other bank employees are also involved in the alleged scam.The court while rejecting the plea observed that, “Survey of the application and appended documents indicates that applicant being custodian has processed the loan proposal hastily without verifying the loan documents. The co-accused who are bank employees had visited the spot and submitted a fake report at the connivance of the applicant. Though the loan was sanctioned for expansion of Gayatri Export Company, all the documents are found false and fabricated. The loan of ₹2.5 crore is sanctioned casually.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sessions-court-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-plea-of-retired-bank-manager/story-oL8B7wsMrOahCwOJguQllM.html
28-10-2020||City||350 project-hit people detained for protest against Navi Mumbai airport project||A large number of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) of Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) project marched to Cidco Bhavan on Tuesday with their long-standing demands for jobs and extension of rents.Around 350 protestors who had planned a gherao at the Cidco building were forcefully stopped by the police and were detained at various police stations. Cidco authorities claimed that it has fulfilled all the commitments made by it.Even as Cidco claimed that the airport project was on track with more than 90 per cent land having been acquired and the local villagers supporting the project, there have been protests over the years with PAPs of the 10 villages acquired, claiming that Cidco has not been fulfilling its promises.The protest on Tuesday was the latest in the series and comprised large number of women PAPs who raised slogans against Cidco and demanded justice. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) trustee and leader of the PAPs, Bhushan Patil, said “Cidco has been taking all of us for a ride. It has not fulfilled several promises made. Today (Tuesday) the police prevented us from protesting. Protests are taking place all over the country. Why are we not being allowed our right?”Speaking of the demands, Patil stated, “The PAPs want jobs for their children as they have lost their livelihood of agriculture, salt pans among others due to the land acquisition and the project. The house rent given for 18 months should also be extended till the project is completed and the PAPs are rehabilitated. Several PAPs are not getting the rent.”Patil added that the Navi Mumbai NMIA committee under the banner of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha had protested for 38 days in December-January last for the demands and had been assured by Cidco that they would be met, but nothing was fulfilled.Ashok Mhatre, a PAP, said, “The 12 Balutedar communities in the villages that have been acquired rendered various services in the villages and did not have land. Cidco should rehabilitate them as they have no other option left in the absence of the villages now. The farmers and the fisher folk have lost their livelihood. So, we all should be compensated well by Cidco. The construction package for the houses should also be increased as the costs have increased over the years.”Krishna Patil, a woman protestor, claimed that Cidco made false claims. She said Cidco made tall claims in its relief and rehabilitation package but most of them are only on paper. She added, “We still have not been accommodated in the new areas that were being developed for us. We have been left in a lurch. We have lost our land and livelihood. We did not go to Cidco, but it came to us seeking our land.”When contacted, Cidco public relations officer Priya Ratambe said, “There is nothing to add to what we have repeatedly stated. Cidco has fulfilled all the demands of the PAPs as per the instructions of the state government and its approved R&R package. We have not gone back on any commitment and, in fact, fulfilled all of them. We are now awaiting the construction of the terminal building of the project.”Dinkar Mohite, senior inspector at CBD Belapur police station, said, “We have detained 350 persons as they had gathered without permission. After bringing them here at the police station, the persons have been sent to different police stations where they are currently detained. As of now, we have booked them for unlawful assembly and violation of orders under the Indian Penal Code.”Officials said they have not decided yet if any of the protestors on Tuesday against Cidco would be placed under arrest.(With inputs by Farhan Shaikh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/350-project-hit-people-detained-for-protest-against-navi-mumbai-airport/story-24x4sOmjm098ohVxxfniAL.html

As of September, there have been 41,337 cases in Mumbai, which is the lowest recorded in nine months since 2001. Doctors have warned of increased cases with restrictions being eased.According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai recorded 24,285 cases of dog bites this year between March and September. Compared to this year’s daily average of 90 cases of dog bites in this period, the daily average in the corresponding period in 2019 was 180 cases. Between March and September 2019, the city had recorded 48,706 cases of dog bites. “As the movement of people was restricted, cases of dog bites decreased drastically. Last year, we had recorded over 85,000 cases [in total]. So far, in the last nine months, we have just got around 41,000 cases,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health official, BMC. The civic body’s data shows 6,466 cases of dog bites in March, followed by 3,504 in April; 2,880 in May; 2,809 in June; and 2,622 in July. In August, there was a marginal increase to 2,700 and September saw a spike, with 3,284 reported cases. Children and rag pickers make up the majority of dog bite cases. “These cases of bites include pets. Dogs often get agitated during their breeding period and they tend to bite in retaliation,” said Gomare.Bite cases are treated at the 100 anti-rabies vaccination (ARV) centres in Mumbai, located in various civic hospitals. The vaccines are provided free of cost. “As a precautionary measure, even when a dog scratches a person, they take ARV. So all registered cases are genuine,” said Dr Yogesh Shetye, general manager of Deonar Abattoir.Cases registered as dog bites include bites or scratches from cats, rats and monkeys. Animal bites can be dangerous because they can transmit rabies, a virus spread to humans from the saliva of infected animals. “In 99% of the cases, rabies is fatal. It takes 12 days to a few months for the virus to reach the brain, depending on the location of virus entry and viral load. As the virus spreads to the central nervous system, it leads to fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There is no specific treatment for rabies except a preventive vaccination,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital.Last year, there was one case of an eight-year-old boy who contracted rabies and died but had no history of a dog bite. Doctors suspected he may have contracted the virus by being licked or scratched by an infected street dog.During the lockdown, vaccination of animals was impacted. “The number of daily vaccinations at our hospital fell by more than 60%. However, the situation has improved in the last month,” said Colonel (retired) Dr JC Khanna, of Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals, in Parel. He added, “With the relaxation in the lockdown, cases of dog bite might increase as more people will step out.”Khanna said many street animals have developed malnutrition during the lockdown and advised people to exercise caution around them. “Hundreds of street animals were left hungry. Even though several NGOs [non-governmental organisations] are providing food, we are still receiving dogs and cats with malnutrition. Also, hunger often makes these animals irritated, and when they see humans with masks, they get suspicious and start barking,” he said.For 24 wards in Mumbai, BMC has 12 dog-catching vans and four NGOs work with animal vaccination in Malad, Bandra, Mahalaxmi and Mulund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dog-bite-cases-in-mumbai-drop-by-50-during-the-lockdown-doctors-warn-of-rise-of-cases-with-ease-in-restrictions/story-whfmRaQvyOjIKvL1p3ZXBL.html

Patole in a joint meeting of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and state government officials on Tuesday asked RBI to keep in mind the interest of the depositors and chalk out a plan similar to the one made to bail out Yes Bank depositors. The speaker also directed authorities to provide fortnightly status reports on the website for the depositors. Patole, in the meeting held at Vidhan Bhavan, said, “The appointed administrator, arbitrators and RBI must take immediate steps to sell off the properties [seized of the accused in the case] and the sum raised [from them] be used in the functioning of the bank. Like RBI bailed out Yes Bank when it was in trouble, they must prepare an action plan to give respite to 9 lakh depositors of PMC Bank too.” The meeting was attended by RBI’s assistant general manager Abhinav Pushp, state chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, co-operative department principal secretary Abha Shukla, and Siddhesh Pandey and Nikhil Vora who were representatives of a committee of PMC Bank’s depositors. Over a year since the RBI superseded the board of the Mumbai-based PMC Bank after discovering major financial irregularities and fraud by the financial institutions board members, the RBI-appointed administrator is yet to succeed in finding a resolution plan for the bank. According to a statement by the speaker’s office, Pushp acknowledged during the meeting that several transactions of PMC Bank were not recorded at all. Account-holders and depositors of PMC bank have alleged that the sense of urgency shown by the central bank in the bailout of the private bank was not shown to give relief to depositors of PMC Bank. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena legislator Ravindra Waikar wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union financial minister Nirmala Sitharaman to restart the activities of PMC Bank. Waikar in his letters said that it has been over a year that the accounts of “innocent investors” have been frozen for “no fault of theirs”. He argued that depositors are unable to withdraw their life’s savings in cases of medical emergency and for festivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prepare-action-plan-for-pmc-bank-similar-to-the-one-made-for-yes-bank-maharashtra-speaker-tells-rbi/story-Yn6b5nGUqhDZavrxlUseiJ.html

One of the accused was having a dispute as the latter asked him to return a borrowed loan amount of ₹26,000. The victim Chandrakant Bhosale, a resident of Rabale, was at home when the accused duo Amol Khare, 32, and Kalpesh Tambe, 24, showed up at his house around 7.15pm on Sunday. The duo told Bhosale they need to talk to him about money and asked him to walk outside with them. The men got into a heated argument, during which the accused held Bhosale and stabbed him on the neck. The accused men used a sharp blade to attack Bhosale, said police. “Khare had taken ₹26,000 on loan from Bhosale’s friend Rahul Ghadsi. However, he was not returning the money on time over which Bhosale had been asking him repeatedly to repay the amount soon,” said Sandeep Patil, assistant inspector at Rabale police station. Around 8pm, an injured Bhosale bleeding from his neck landed at Rabale police station. The police then shifted him to a nearby hospital where he was admitted. Following the incident, and based on preliminary details from Bhosale, the police began to hunt for Khare and his accomplice. Within an hour, the police managed to trace the duo with the help of informant network in Ghansoli, from where they were arrested. The duo has been booked on charges of attempt to murder. They were produced before a magistrate and have been remanded in police custody till Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-stab-man-in-navi-mumbai-over-borrowed-money-arrested/story-EBoJ5aIVHz8nlUvNbuY2bN.html

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Man stabs TV actor in Mumbai for turning down proposal||Television actor Malvi Malhotra, 29, was stabbed with a knife thrice allegedly by a producer, Yogeshkumar Singh, whose marriage proposal she had rejected in the past, in Versova on Monday night. An attempt to murder case has been registered at Versova police station. The actor is currently undergoing treatment at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Andheri (West) for injuries to her back and hands. Prashant Bajaj, Malhotra’s friend, said, “She was in Dubai for a shoot and had returned to Mumbai on October 25. As she had given her car for service, she decided to go walking to a nearby coffee shop at Versova for a meeting on Monday. Around 9 pm, as was walking back after finishing her meeting, Singh came from behind in his car and offered to drop her. She refused and continued to walk.” Singh then parked his car, came out and attacked her with a knife, said Bajaj. “He tried to attack her face. She suffered injuries to her back and hands. The accused fled after which Malvi called me. She was asking me to save her,” said Bajaj. The accused had introduced himself as a movie producer and befriended Malhotra on Facebook in 2019. They became friends and met about three to four times in coffee shops, said Versova police officials. Malhotra told Versova police that later Singh proposed to marry her, which she refused, after which Singh started following her everywhere. Later, the television actor also stopped taking his calls and even blocked him on social media, said police. “We have identified the accused’s possible hideout and will arrest him soon,” said an officer. Chaitanya S, deputy commissioner of police (operation), said, “We have registered a case under section 307 (attempt to Murder) and 354 (D) (stalking) of Indian Penal Code and section 37 (1), 135 of Maharashtra Police Act and are investigating the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-stabs-tv-actor-in-mumbai-for-turning-down-proposal/story-KunKhHT80rcfS7EFHcd0IO.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Maratha quota: Supreme Court adjourns hearing on stay on reservation for 4 weeks||As the Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned the hearing on vacation of the interim stay on Maratha reservation for four weeks, the community accused the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of lack of strategy, demanding steps to expedite the procedure to safeguard the interest of Maratha students seeking admissions. The Marathas were given reservations of 12% and 13% in employment and admissions respectively under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. A three-judge bench, on September 9, transferred the case to the constitution bench, putting interim stay on the reservation. Challenging the stay, the state government and respondent representing the community on Tuesday requested the three-judge bench to hold the hearing before a constitution bench, after which the hearing was adjourned for four weeks. The adjournment will lead to further delay in college admissions and the appointment of community members whose recruitment has been completed. The state had put the admission process of junior college and medical courses on hold, anticipating the vacation of the stay. It has also deferred written exams for Maharashtra Public Services Commission for more than 200 posts of officers in various government departments. The state cabinet is expected to discuss the issue in its meeting on Thursday. “The adjournment is the result of lack of strategy and coordination from the state government. We brought it to their notice, but the state delayed taking steps to constitute the larger bench. There were legal lacunae in the applications made by the government. The state government did not even present the side properly on Tuesday. We had requested the state to seek the court’s guidance on prolonged admissions due to stay during Tuesday’s hearing, but in vain. The state should now take necessary decisions to begin the admission process,” said BJP legislator and chief of Shiv Sangram Party Vinayak Mete. He has also demanded replacement of public works department minister Ashok Chavan as head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation. Vinod Patil, one of the respondents in the Supreme Court in the reservation petition, said, “The state should have intimated the court that it wants the hearing before the constitution bench when it was listed 10 days ago. We are wasting our time for want of coordination and strategy. Students are left in the lurch.” Chavan, however, rubbished the allegations. “We filed an application in the apex court on the constitution bench on October 7 and we were informed on October 10 that it is before the larger bench. Despite this, the hearing was listed before the three-judge bench which stayed the reservation. The state government’s counsel could not attend the hearing initially only because of technical reasons, but later put forth our stand very effectively. The state will again approach the chief justice of India to constitute the bench at the earliest,” he said. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said the MVA government failed to make adequate preparations for the SC hearing and the adjournment was a result of it. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the BJP was politicising the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-supreme-court-adjourns-hearing-on-stay-on-reservation-for-4-weeks/story-8JGtDVzC92rMYnyvcgW4LI.html

The woman was found dead on October 1 in a Chembur pond. According to RCF police, the man and the victim were in a relationship since 2018. The woman became pregnant on twice during the course of their relationship and both the times, the accused had forced her to terminate the pregnancies, said the police. The victim’s father had told the police in his statement that the accused used to assault his daughter and had also threatened to kill her if she forced him to marry her. Police officers said that on September 30, around 8pm, the woman left her home without informing anyone. Later, her body was fished out from a pond in Chembur. “Initially, we registered an accidental death report (ADR). But during the course of our investigation, we got to know about the man’s involvement. The victim had messaged the accused on WhatsApp and told him about that he was the reason behind her taking the drastic step. Once we found the evidence, we immediately arrested him,” said Sopan Nighot, senior inspector, RCF police station. The accused has been booked under sections 306 (abetment of suicide), 376 (punishment for rape), 313 (causing miscarriage without woman’s consent) and 506 (2) [punishment for criminal intimidation] of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/26-year-old-from-mumbai-arrested-for-rape-abetting-suicide-of-woman/story-KYGnlghJxaLuiMz0PTp3fP.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees less than 10,000 Covid-19 cases for tenth day in row||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 5,363 Covid-19 cases, making it the 10th consecutive day where the daily count was less than 10,000 cases, bringing the tally to 1,654,028. The number of active cases continued to fall, coming down to 131,544 – 7.95% of the total cases reported so far. The toll has reached 43,463, with 115 casualties in the past 24 hours, health officials said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said the next two months are very crucial. “We have to be very cautious. We have seen a decline in countries such as Germany, Italy and Spain, but after some time, it resulted in a sudden spurt in cases, which is known as ‘second wave’. We should be prepared for any resurgence, believing that this could be a deceptive decline.” Apart from ongoing festivals, winter is another reason to keep the guard up. “There is a possibility of rise in cases in the coming season, which is favourable to respiratory diseases. We have to watch the situation in November and December. We also have to stock medicines, oxygen supply and keep hospitals ready for any situation. If a constant drop in cases continues till January, it would mean things are getting better,” Dr Salunkhe said. The total number of cases recorded from October 1-27 is 270,736, compared to 593,192 cases reported in September. Last month saw the highest number of cases in the state since March, when the first Covid-19 case was detected. Mumbai, however, continues to record the highest number of cases in the state with 801 fresh infections on Tuesday. Its case count is 252,886, and the number of active cases 18,633. The city’s toll touched 10,165, with 23 casualties. Nashik city contributed to the second highest infections in the daily caseload, as it recorded 337 cases, taking its tally to 63,890. Ahmednagar district recorded 250 cases, third highest, pushing its case count to 36,999. Although there is a decline in cases, the number of deaths has not reduced in proportion, so the case fatality rate (CFR) is yet to come down. The state has maintained second position after Punjab in the country, with CFR at 2.63%. Punjab’s CFR was 3.14% (with 4,125 deaths) on Monday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department. The state is also far away from its target of CFR of 1%. “The drop in casualties is not significant. It means that there are issues that need to be addressed,” Dr Salukhe said. The state has completed 87 lakh Covid tests, with 54,838 conducted on Tuesday. The positivity rate for the day was 9.77%, against the overall positivity rate of the state that stood at 19.01%. The number of recovered patients also reached 1,478,496 as 7,836 recoveries were recorded in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate was 89.39%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-less-than-10-000-covid-19-cases-for-tenth-day-in-row/story-yi78nKvCadaY80p3b9EZ0K.html
28-10-2020||City||Maharashtra education department to develop 300 ‘model schools’; none from Mumbai make the cut||The state education department will develop 300 zilla parishad schools in the state as ‘model schools’ as a part of its initiative to improve the quality of learning in state schools. On Monday, the department released a list of schools which will be developed as model schools. From the neighbouring region, eight zilla parishad schools from Palghar and three from Thane are part of the list. “The initiative will consist of ensuring quality infrastructure, good quality of education and desired learning outcomes in these schools. These schools will be at par with the 21st-century teaching needs – with critical thinking, creative thinking, collaboration and communication being key,” stated the circular issued by the department. The list released by the education department does not include any schools run by the municipal corporations across the state. As a result, none of the schools from Mumbai and Navi Mumbai made it to the list. “The government should have included civic body schools because even in cities, there is a need to build model schools for providing quality education to the underprivileged students. It is very disappointing that the government has ignored the category of civic body schools altogether,” said the principal of a civic school from the western suburbs. An official from the education department said, “The said project is for zilla parishad schools and is only the first phase of the larger project of strengthening public schools in the state.” Schools which will be developed as model schools will have teachers working for at least five years at a stretch and will have to adopt innovative teaching methods including activity-based learning. Government officials from every district have been asked to approve the list of 300 schools and the department has asked them to convey any suggestions and objections in this regard by November 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-education-department-to-develop-300-model-schools-none-from-mumbai-make-the-cut/story-ox3FN2KDxhqSD4LYsLzOxN.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||Sea as source of drinking water? Mumbai civic body mulls plant||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities plan to set up a desalination plant near Gorai beach, amid the growing need for an alternative potable water source due to changing patterns of rainfall.The desalination plant will purify seawater into potable water.Maharashtra minister for environment Aaditya Thackeray on Monday gave a go-ahead to the project and has directed the BMC to prepare a feasibility report by reviving the civic body’s 2007 plan.The 2007 desalination proposal was meant to provide an alternative water source owing to poor rainfall in the catchment areas of the dams that supply water to Mumbai.Later in 2016-17, the BMC had initiated the process to set up two desalination plants – one in south Mumbai and another either in the suburbs or anywhere in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The plants were supposed to have a capacity of processing 100 million litres per day (MLD) of seawater into potable water. However, later, the project was put on hold due to high cost.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC, said, “The cost for a desalination plant has been optimised because of evolution of technology. The cost of construction of the plant is the same as that of a dam. It is estimated to cost around Rs 1,800 crore to construct a 200 MLD plant.”“We had to find a sustainable solution because of changing patterns of rainfall. We cannot go on constructing dams by cutting trees. We need a back-up plan,” he added.At present, seven lakes such as Bhatsa, Vaitarna, Middle Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tulsi, Tansa and Vehar supply drinking water to Mumbai. The lakes are located in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The civic body supplies 3,750 million (m) litres (l) of water daily, as compared to the demand of 4,200 ml.BMC officials said they would collect seawater samples from the west coast in north Mumbai for setting up the desalination plant.Initially, a pilot project will be undertaken, which will cater to 5% of Mumbai’s drinking water needs, and later the capacity will be successfully augmented to 200 MLD.“A suitable plot will be considered for the project on the west coast as the Port Trust authorities own land on the east coast. We plan to acquire a plot owned by the government owing to the cost factor,” said a BMC official, requesting anonymity.The BMC has zeroed in on a plot near Gorai beach for the project. However, a final call will be taken after the submission of the feasibility report.“An Israeli company has been tasked to submit the feasibility report, which was involved in a similar 650 MLD-capacity plant in Israel. It will take around three years to construct the plant,” said Velrasu.Dubai is the first city in the world to construct a desalination plant.Chennai, which has three such plants, had constructed its first project in 2003 that supplies 90 MLD of water to the city.Rakesh Kumar, director of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), said, “If it is possible to have desalination plant to convert seawater into potable water worldwide, it is certainly possible in Mumbai also. This is the future if we have to deal with shortage of water. However, these are costlier options, and it again brings back to the problem of how we handle our water resources. This does brings us back to the discussion of how we should be doing water conservation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sea-as-source-of-drinking-water-mumbai-civic-body-mulls-plant/story-UJK8Q4Dt0YzFvJxAqtxFxJ.html
28-10-2020||Mumbai||In a first for west coast, 3 Olive Ridley turtles in Maharashtra to be satellite-tagged to understand their migratory route||In a first for Maharashtra and the west coast, three Olive Ridley turtles along south Konkan will be satellite-tagged to understand their migratory pattern and nesting. The project at a cost of ₹9.87 lakh will be undertaken by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun and was sanctioned during the third governing body meeting of the Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation on Tuesday chaired by forest minister Sanjay Rathod. “The satellite telemetry study will commence soon since the final nod has been received. Presently, we have no information about how turtles migrate along the west coast of India whether they move towards the Middle East, Pakistan or towards Sri Lanka,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) adding, “This study will help us get access to authentic scientific information on their movement, which would be followed up with more conservation-based studies.” Olive Ridleys are endangered sea turtles found in warm tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. They travel thousands of kilometres into the ocean and only the females return to the original breeding sites within a minimum of two years. According to the mangrove cell, approximately 600 Olive Ridley turtles find their way to nesting sites across prominent beaches in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad districts of Maharashtra. “We are yet to finalise which district the study will be undertaken. We will be selecting three turtles from maximum turtle movement observed,” said Manas Manjrekar, deputy director, Mangrove Foundation adding, “Platform transmitter terminal (PTTs) will be used, which will be fitted with epoxy resin and fixed on the carapace (hard shell) of the turtle. The project duration is 12-14 months, and once the turtle is tagged, the study will depend on the life of the satellite tag and how long we will receive the data.” Manjrekar added that there have been similar studies from the east coast. “This is the first time it is happening on the west coast and will give us an insight into where they migrate and information on the west coast population of Olive Ridley turtles. We hope to get valuable data over the next two years,” he said. Meanwhile, a string of other decisions were taken on Tuesday by the Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation constituted by the state in 2015. It is an autonomous body that assists the mangrove cell in coastal marine conservation through research projects. Over five years, the foundation has undertaken numerous research projects to improve the livelihood of coastal communities as well as increase awareness and capacity building through marine biodiversity research along the Konkan coast. The governing body approved the deployment of 183 guards of Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC) for the protection of mangrove areas in Mumbai suburban and Thane districts. Both districts had 117 guards so far since 2017. On Tuesday, the foundation’s governing body approved a ₹21 crore budget for the financial year 2020-21 for various activities including mangrove protection and conservation, sustainable livelihood projects, research activities, capacity building, awareness programs, coastal and marine biodiversity conservation measures, management of marine animal strandings etc. The meeting approved expenditure of ₹17.27 crore for the previous financial year. “The protection and conservation of mangroves is our focus and all efforts for this coming financial year are focused towards this especially considering the impacts of climate change and sea level rise,” said forest minister Sanjay Rathod adding, “I have instructed the foundation to prepare a detailed plan for maximum coastal mangrove plantation, and the project shall be jointly implemented by the fisheries and forest departments.” The governing body also approved the country’s first solar powered marine mammal museum - Giants of the Sea – at the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre at Airoli, Navi Mumbai at a cost of ₹10 crore. The museum will house skeletal remains of endangered marine species. “The body approved the appointment of a project management consultant on Tuesday,” said Tiwari. Other approved projects by the governing body on Tuesday Other approved projects include: · A study of dolphin population and monitoring along the Sindhudurg district. · A fresh exercise to assess the exact boundary of the Malvan Marine Sanctuary protected area at a cost of ₹40.05 lakh by WII · Overall approval to establish a multi-species hatchery at Vengurla, Sindhudurg for ₹21.14 crore with a ₹12 crore grant by the foundation and remaining cost by the fisheries department and various national level funding agencies.

On the complaint of a villager, Balram, police booked Bhupinder, Anil, Sachin and Ram under sections 323, 506 and 34 of the IPC and Arms Act. Arjun Singh, however, rubbished the charges against his son as politically motivated.Some villagers of Damohpura in Jagadhari area had gathered on a road to protest against mining where Bhupinder and his friends reportedly had an argument with them in the presence of police officials, including in-charge of Buria police station Lajjaram. “Bhupinder had a gun in his hand, but didn’t point it on anyone. It will be investigated if he has a licence or not. The accused seemed to be under the influence of alcohol,” Lajjaram said. Yamunanagar SP Kamaldeep Goyal said the matter is being investigated.Arjun Singh said his son has a pistol for his personal safety. “I accept that he was drunk, but he didn’t point gun at anybody. He didn’t even flash it or fired it, but just gave it to the police officer so that it is not misused by anyone from the crowd,” Singh told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jjp-leader-s-son-booked-for-assault-villagers-say-he-flashed-gun-at-them/story-Y34gMfVoLFZut5eanL9qxM.html
28-10-2020||Chandigarh||CBI court issues notice to Hooda, Vora in AJL plot allotment case||The special court of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has issued a notice to former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and senior Congress leader Moti Lal Vora for joining proceedings through video conferencing in the Associated Journal Limited (AJL) plot allotment case.In the order, special judge, CBI, Jagdeep Singh said, “Since the case involves legislators and proceedings in such cases are to be conducted expeditiously, so, notices be issued to the accused as well as their counsel to explore the possibility of conducting further proceedings through video-conferencing, if the physical hearing of the matters does not get fully functional till the adjourned date.”The order further said : “In case physical hearing of the matters is made mandatory in the meanwhile, then all the accused shall be present on the adjourned date. It is made clear that effective hearing is to be started in such matters and accordingly all parties are directed to ensure participation in the proceedings of the matter either through physical mode or through virtual mode.”The issue is about an institutional plot number C-17 in Sector 6, Panchkula. It was allotted by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to the AJL in 1982, but because the construction was not carried out in 10 years, so it was taken back in 1992. In 1995 and in 1996, appeal and revision were filed by the AJL against resumption of plot but these were also dismissed by HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner, town and country planning. However, when Hooda became the chief minister in 2005, he allowed re-allotment of the plot to the AJL.The ED had said that Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the then CM and HUDA chairman, “blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to the AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of the rules, causing loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL”. In December 2018, the CBI filed chargesheet against Hooda, Vora and Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of the National Herald newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbi-court-issues-notice-to-hooda-vora-in-ajl-plot-allotment-case/story-qYgQneFTQG1wqxXDaMRDAJ.html
28-10-2020||Chandigarh||Project opening, stone-laying-spree marks year of Haryana’s BJP-JJP govt||Grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic that had hit when the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition regime was struggling to take-off four months after assuming office, Haryana government on Tuesday marked one year in office by inaugurating and laying foundation stones of 306 developmental projects. In what was a less than 10-minute oath ceremony held at Haryana Raj Bhawan, Khattar was sworn in as CM on October 27, 2019, on a public holiday on account of Diwali for a second successive term as the Haryana chief minister. Dushyant Chautala of Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) was sworn in as the deputy chief minister. The BJP had entered into a post-poll alliance with Dushyant’s JJP having 10 MLAs to form the government after the saffron party won 40 seats in the October 2019 assembly elections and was short of a simple majority in the 90-member Vidhan Sabha. Even after one year the fate of the much-talked about common minimum programme (CMP) for which the JJP had been pushing is still unknown. A committee was set up to give final shape to the CMP that is yet to see the light of the day. Meanwhile, the state government held functions at district level, while chief minister Khattar along with his deputy CM attended a state-level function in Hisar where a ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony was held for the expansion of Hisar airport runway. Coinciding with the importance of the occasion, the government on Tuesday resorted to inauguration and foundation stone-laying spree. As per the claims of the government, as many as 306 projects worth ₹1,848 crore across 21 districts of the state were either inaugurated or foundation stones were laid. “While 140 projects completed at a cost of Rs 889 crore were inaugurated, the foundation stone was laid for 166 projects worth Rs 959 crore,” an official spokesperson said. In his address, Khattar took digs at opposition parties for their remarks over the fate of BJP-JJP government in the state. “The leaders of Congress party had been issuing statements that BJP-JJP coalition government would collapse within three or six months. Nowadays, they are saying that the government would fall after the Baroda by-elections. I would like to thank the Congress party for making such remarks as they help us to remain more cautious while running the government,” Khatttar said, pointing out that such statements put a question mark on the credibility of the Congress party. The CM said Hisar airport will be developed to enable it handle international flights. Deputy CM Chautala was among other dignitaries present on this occasion at Hisar, while the ministers, MPs, MLAs and other prominent people joined the programme in the 20 other districts through video-conferencing. On the recent farm laws introduced by the Centre, he said the Congress has been misguiding the farmers. “The farmers are innocent, but no one can deceive them,” Khattar said.

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Male tiger, suspected of killing 8 people, captured from Maharashtra’s Chandrapur district||The Maharashtra forest department on Tuesday captured an elusive male tiger, aged about five to six years, near Sindhi village in Rajura forest at Central Chanda, Chandrapur. The tiger, RT1, is suspected to have killed eight people and injured three others since January 2019. RT1 had evaded all the capture efforts since February this year, when the chief wildlife warden had issued orders to capture the wild cat. Forest officials said the tiger was captured in a two-hour operation with a special-designed trapping cage placed under a narrow railway underpass where a bait had been kept at compartment number 179 in the Rajura forest area. “The animal was captured between 3pm and 4pm within the culvert. Once the tiger entered the cage, the automatic trap doors were shut, and a team of veterinarians were deployed to the site. One of the veterinarians darted the animal and by 5pm, the tiger was shifted to a separate (transport) cage that was transported to Chandrapur transit treatment centre. The animal will be shifted to Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur on Tuesday night,” said MK Rao, acting principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF -wildlife), Maharashtra forest department, adding, “The entire process was followed as per the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).” The trapping team headed by deputy conservator of forest (Central Chanda) Arvind Mundhe consisted of around 150 people, with 25 Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) officers, employees from the Central Chanda forest division and four veterinarians assisted by staff members, along with 35 volunteers from 14 villages in the region. “Teams were equipped with night vision and CCTV cameras and were well-versed with the landscape. There had been fear in the minds of the villagers as the tiger had become a threat to human life. The trapping team swiftly carried out the operation,” said Rao. The range of the tiger’s movement was 15 to 20 square kilometres (sq km) in the Rajura forest area, said officials. Chandrapur chief conservator of forest NR Praveen said, “This trap had been placed around 15 days back. We had been monitoring the tiger’s movement and had tracked it to this special cage set up with automatic trap doors on either sides of the culvert. Once the tiger entered, the automatic trap doors from both sides dropped and a team headed by Dr Kundan Podshelwar darted the animal soon after reaching the spot. Collective effort by all persons involved ensured success of the operation.” Praveen added that as per the preliminary examination, the tiger was healthy. Forest officials said the tiger had eaten close to 30 baits during the course of various capture operations. Last week, the tiger had entered another cage set up in compartment number 170 in Rajura forest under a bridge but escaped by breaking the cage. “Forest staff was holding onto ropes pulling up the steel gate of the main cage. Unfortunately, we failed then but ensured we managed to trap the animal much before the capture tenure that would lapse on December 31,” said Praveen. The first permission to capture the tiger was issued by the PCCF-Wildlife on February 14 by invoking section 11 (1) (a) of the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), 1972, in which the PCCF of a state can declare a wild animal protected under Schedule 1 of WLPA a threat to human life. Since then, the permissions have been extended four times as the tiger evaded all the capture efforts over eight months. Activists, however, had written to the state government on Monday requesting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to avoid the tiger’s capture until there was proof that the tiger had been involved in killing all the eight people. RT1’s last kill was reported from the Khambada forest area in Rajura on September 28. “All the kills cannot be attributed to RT1. Of the eight deaths, samples of five cases were sent for DNA analysis. Results had confirmed that two cases were due to a large male tiger. However, in other incidents, the gender could not be established,” said Mundhe. Six tigers captured from Maharashtra this year This is the sixth tiger involved in human-animal conflict captured from Maharashtra and fourth from Chandrapur district alone this year. Maharashtra has witnessed the highest number of human deaths (33) owing to tiger attacks in 2020 in at least two decades, with over 85% of cases recorded in Chandrapur district. An approximately two-year-old sub-adult tigress (T2C1) was tranquilised and captured by the Maharashtra forest department near the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) in Yavatmal district on September 23. Another tiger that killed four people was captured in Gondia in May. In June, forest officials had captured a sub-adult male tiger that killed five people from the buffer area of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, and an adult tigress that had entered a house in Nagbhid range of Brahmapuri. However, both died at the Gorewada Rescue Centre due to old age and septicaemia. In July, a three-year-old male tiger (NT-1) was captured at Talodi range, Bramhapuri forest division in Chandrapur. It is said to be responsible for the death of three people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/male-tiger-suspected-of-killing-8-people-captured-from-maharashtra-s-chandrapur-district/story-2sfO22LRCqnjrH3Jw1tWbK.html

28-10-2020||Chandigarh||Multilevel basement parking lot near Punjab and Haryana high court likely to get green signal||The proposed multilevel basement parking in the vicinity of Punjab and Haryana high court (HC), which falls within the Sukhna eco-sensitive zone (SESZ), is likely to get a green signal as it falls within the “regulated” zone of the SESZ where construction is allowed.The UT environment department has communicated to the UT engineering department that even though the project falls within the SESZ, construction is allowed there as per the SESZ norms and court orders.Confirming the development, Debendra Dalai, director environment, said, “The site of construction is located 1.66 km from the boundary of the Sukhna wildlife sanctuary, where construction is a regulated activity.”Up to 0.5 km from the sanctuary, there can not be any construction. From 0.5 km to 1.25 km, a construction up to 15 ft is permitted. Beyond 1.25 km, construction is allowed and it is to be regulated as per the building bylaws.A ‘regulated’ zone means that “whatever building laws and rules are applicable for any other area are also applicable for this area. So far as eco-sensitive zone is concerned it does not come under the restricted zone but only a regulated zone, so the proposed parking can be constructed,” said a senior UT official who didn’t want to be named.The engineering department had recently shared the exact location and size of the proposed site with the environment department. A meeting had also taken place between the two departments on October 23, in which UT urban planning department officials had also participated. The engineering department has also sought the exact geographical coordinates from the environment department of the SESZ in relation to the site.On December 20, 2019, the HC had directed the UT administration to submit the layout plan for the proposed multi-level underground parking lot opposite the high court museum within four weeks.The HC directions had come after the administration official had submitted that the site falls within the SESZ. The bench, however, was of the view that if parking can’t be constructed, how could a tourist information centre come up on the same site. It further observed that amendments could be made in the master plan and questioned as to how a green belt could come under heritage status.Other concernsThe proposed site also “slightly” falls within the Sukhna catchment area where all construction activity is prohibited. “As the court has ordered no construction in the catchment area, the administration will have to approach it for clarification on this issue,” the official said.The site falls in the buffer zone of UNESCO World Heritage Site of Capitol Complex. “UT administration may have to apprise and take consent from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to undertake the construction work in Sector 1,” the official said.In the Chandigarh Master Plan-2031, the site is earmarked as a green belt.The parking planAs per the layout plan submitted with the HC in January this year, three underground floors are planned. In the first phase, the parking lot will have space for over 2,800 cars. In the second phase, installation of stacks has been proposed. With that, the parking could be expandable to over 5,000 cars. The ground level of the parking lot will be a green area. Ramps for exit and entry of vehicles to the basement parking spaces will be the only construction on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multilevel-basement-parking-lot-near-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-likely-to-get-green-signal/story-lzyiUxX2CYSluUBAPmq8nI.html

State’s relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Tuesday tweeted, “We have held discussions with various stakeholders. Mumbaikars will get relief on this very soon.” His tweet was in response to a tweet by a commuter. Mumbai’s local trains, used by around 8 million people daily pre-Covid-19, were suspended on March 23 after the state went into a lockdown to stop the spread of the virus. Some services, however, resumed on July 15, with the state allowing only essential services workers, differently abled people and cancer patients to use the trains. On October 21, the government even let all women board the trains during non-peak hours. The Central Railway currently operates 706 daily services, while the Western Railway runs 700 services as against their regular of 1,774 and 1,367 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decision-to-allow-all-to-travel-on-mumbai-local-trains-very-soon-says-maharashtra-minister/story-xZCchbAqxVQmFvU005zkNN.html
28-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Sahibabad underpass, Dasna flyover temporarily shut||Ghaziabad: Commuters in Ghaziabad city will have to travel more now due to the closure of two major road stretches – an underpass near the Sahibabad railway station and the Dasna flyover which connect city commuters to the National Highway 9. The traffic department said that commuters will now have to take alternate routes.The officials of the municipal corporation said that they have, on recommendation of the traffic police, shut the Sahibabad underpass due to repair works being undertaken at the Saur Urja Marg in Sahibabad Site IV industrial area. The underpass caters to a large number of motorists from Lajpat Nagar, Shalimar Garden, Rajendra Nagar, etc., to the Vasundhara intersection, from where they move to Delhi, Noida or NH 9.“The underpass will be closed for about 28 days as we are constructing a cement-concrete road over a stretch of 500 metres. Since it is a low-lying area, water gets collected here which often results in damage. The road will be dry in a period of about 28 days,” said Deshraj Singh, executive engineer from the corporation.Due to closure of the underpass, drivers will now have to use the Mohan Nagar intersection to get to the Vasundhara crossing, which would mean an extra travel of five to seven kilometres.The second site which has been shut down is the Dasna flyover, which also caters to large number of vehicles travelling from the city to NH-9 near Dasna. “We have shut down the flyover till October 30 as we are placing segments over the pillars, which cross the elevated section of the flyover. The work will be completed by October 30 and the flyover will open the next day. However, we have decided that the work will be taken up during the day and the flyover can remain open during night,” said Mudit Garg, project director of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The segments are being placed as part of the Phase 4 of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) project. Phase 4 is scheduled to be completed by the end of December. The Phase 4 will be connected to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.Due to the shut down, from 8am to 6pm, commuters will have to use an alternate route, via the Diamond flyover, to move to NH 9. This will increase travel by about 10-12 kilometres. “The NHAI has sought permission for three days as they have launched major works for the DME project. The Dasna flyover will remain open in the night. For the Sahibabad underpass, we have asked the civic agency to complete the works in phases of five days. Otherwise, it will create a lot of traffic movement at Mohan Nagar close to Diwali,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-sahibabad-underpass-dasna-flyover-temporarily-shut/story-cjDXOIQYdUSNfp9MKuQAwI.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||AAP versus BJP: Explaining the municipal funds crisis||The dispute over allocation of funds for the municipal corporation in Delhi stems from the unique constitutional position of Delhi -- a Union Territory with a legislative assembly, the trifurcation of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the flow of grants from the Centre to the Delhi government, experts have said. While the Delhi government says that it has paid all dues to the three BJP-ruled MCDs, the municipal leaders claim that the AAP dispensation still owes thousands of crores to the civic bodies. The cash-strapped corporations have been facing protests by their employees who have not been paid for months. The Delhi government on Monday said that the Centre owes the corporations Rs 12,000 crores. On Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal reiterated his government’s stand. “The Centre gives grants to all municipal corporations across the country, based a formula of Rs 485 per person of the population. However, it is not paying grants to the three MCDs for the last 10 years.”However, North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said there was no such provision in the current financial rules. “When there is no such financial provision currently, how can the Centre release the funds? The CM is diverting from the issue. As per provisions, the Delhi government has to pay Rs 13,500 crore to municipal corporations as per the recommendations of the Delhi finance commission (DFC).”The government’s position is based on the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission’s report in which the Centre gives a grant of Rs 2.87 lakh crore to state governments of which Rs 87,144 crore is meant for municipalities.But Delhi doesn’t get a share from this fund as it is a Union Territory, said a senior official with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.A senior East DMC official explained that the Delhi government releases funds to the civic bodies under the Basic Tax Assignment (BTA), which is meant to pay salaries. According to him, the Delhi government was yet to pay the funds under BTA for the second quarter. The official said while East civic body has got only Rs 94 crore of the total Rs 961 crore, the north corporation has got only Rs 212 crore of the total Rs 850 crore allocation. Experts said what has worsened the situation this year is the fact that the government has slashed the BTA component by 57% due to a drop in revenue collection because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Kejriwal also said on Tuesday the three corporations owed the government Rs 3,800 crore in the form of a loan.The corporations said that the East and North corporations had to take loan to streamline its functioning post-trifurcation in 2012. Former Delhi chief secretary Rakesh Mehta, who was also the commissioner of erstwhile unified MCD from 2002 to 2007, said, “The Centre has never paid directly for the functioning of the civic bodies in the past. It used to give funds for various schemes such as education, health etc. but that fund used to come via the Delhi government.”The devolution of funds till 2019 was based on the recommendations of the 3rd Delhi Finance Commission (DFC), which had no provision for a trifurcated municipal corporation. While the municipalities are demanding implementation of the recommendations of the 4th DFC, a government spokesperson said that it could be done only after the Centre increases Delhi’s share in the central pool of taxes. Calling the current crisis unfortunate and avoidable, Mehra said, “It is unfair that the corporations were paid funds for a long time as per the 3rd DFC. The fund allocation to the corporations has to be reviewed and revised every five years, as the cost of providing municipal services increases due to inflation and increase in rate of material.”He also said that the corporations have to do their bit to boost their revenue. “The municipal corporations also have to think of revamping the revenue model to boost collection. They have to look for new sources of revenue and increase the taxes on services. For example, areas where the Metro network is there, the property tax rates should be hiked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-versus-bjp-explaining-the-municipal-funds-crisis/story-qkkvJtwNTUfUA3Ngi4avfK.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Shameful that MCD doctors have to protest for their salaries: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said it is “shameful” that doctors of hospitals run by municipal corporations in the Capital are forced to protest for their salaries and urged the Centre to disburse funds so that they could be paid. Kejriwal’s criticism of the three MCDs, ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), came a day after mayors of the civic bodies staged a sit-in protest outside the chief minister’s residence on Monday, demanding immediate release of dues to the tune of Rs13,500 crore they claimed the Delhi government owed them. However, on Tuesday, the chief minister’s office called this number “completely fictitious” and asked the MCDs to show how they arrived at the figure. “The MCD doctors are on strike due to non-payment of salaries for many months now. This is utterly shameful. They are the ones who risked their lives to protect, treat, and serve us and our families. This is a very sensitive matter, and there should be no politics on the issue,” Kejriwal said at an event in east Delhi’s Ghazipur on Tuesday, even as doctors working in municipal hospitals continued to protest over non-payment of their salaries since June. Rebutting claims by MCDs that they were not paid enough money in the current financial year, a government spokesperson said the Delhi government has already disbursed over Rs 1,750 crore to the three civic bodies between April 1 and October 26 this year.“The Delhi government’s total amount due to the three civic bodies in this fiscal is Rs 1,965.91 crore, of which Rs 1,752.61 crore has been given. The remaining amount has been sanctioned and is under the disbursal process. The MCD should tell us where this money was used. Usually, the Delhi government disburses around Rs 4,500 crore each year to the MCDs, but it has been slightly lower this because our own tax collection has nosedived,” the government spokesperson said. Kejriwal instead asserted that MCDs owe the Delhi government Rs 3,800 crore loaned to them. Apart from this, he added that the civic bodies also owe Rs 3,000 crore as bills to the Delhi Jal Board (DJB).“The MCD cannot run with such mismanagement and blatant corruption. Let me give you an example. I inaugurated the Seelampur-Shastri Park flyovers day before yesterday. They were to be completed at a cost of ₹303 crore, but we completed them in one-and-a-half years at a cost of Rs 250 crore. On the other hand, the Rani Jhansi flyover, work on which was started in 2006 and was to be completed by 2010 by the MCD. But it took 14 years and got completed in 2018. The cost of the project was Rs 178 crore, but it took Rs 750 crore for the project. The time has come to stop this corruption in MCDs,” the chief minister said. MCD elections are scheduled to be held April 2022. The chief minister also urged the Centre to pay the ‘grant-in-aid to the local bodies’ as mandated under the 14th Central finance commission, which the MCDs claimed Delhi was never eligible for because it is a union territory. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “We have the detailed break-up of Rs 13,500 crore. This amount is due as the government has not paid funds as per 3rd, 4th and 5th Delhi finance commission’s recommendations. To hide their failure to release funds on time, they are diverting the issue and blaming the Centre for it. I want to ask Kejriwal, why didn’t your government ask for this fund earlier?”A government spokesperson said the recommendations of the fourth Delhi finance commission could not be implemented because the Centre refused to pay the state government from its central pool of taxes, from which Delhi was supposed to give more funds to the MCDs. “But, the Centre did not even respond to our plea and hence, the 4th DFC was not enforced,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shameful-that-mcd-doctors-have-to-protest-for-their-salaries-kejriwal/story-ecTTjXyo2VqHU38gmlOcSN.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Centre invites applications for new JNU V-C||With the tenure of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar coming to an end in January 2021, the Union government has initiated the process for choosing his successor.An advertisement by the Union education ministry on Saturday said that the vice-chancellor, being the academic and administrative head of the institution, is expected to be a person possessing the highest level of competence, integrity, morals, and institutional commitment.According to the advertisement, a distinguished academician with a minimum of 10 years’ of experience as professor in a University, or 10 years’ of experience in a reputed research or academic administrative organisation with proof of having demonstrated academic leadership, can apply for the post.The tenure of Kumar, who came to JNU from the department of electrical engineering of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 2016, has been marked by multiple protests and controversies.Among them was a 2019 disagreement between the administration and its student and teacher unions over a hike in hostel fee that snowballed into a protest and led to demands for his removal. The protests went on for weeks, and could be quelled only after the education ministry stepped in and the hike was also rolled back.In January this year, the varsity also saw a violent incident where masked persons armed with sticks and rods attacked students inside the campus. Many students received serious injuries. There were allegations that the police and the administration did not do enough to stop the perpetrators. Kumar, however, maintained that his administration had responded with urgency.Kumar also made headlines when he suggested in 2017 that a battle tank be installed in the varsity, reportedly, to instil a love for the army. The request is yet to be fulfilled.Vice-chancellor Kumar did not respond to calls and text messages requesting comment.During Kumar’s tenure, the university opened several new departments, including a management and engineering school. It has drew up plans to contruct new buildings for these departments. But the moves were criticised because several faculty members and students feel it has come at the cost of preserving JNU’s liberal arts focus.He was also blamed for alleged irregularities in appointments of faculty members.Commenting on the developments, JNU Teachers’ Association president DK Lobiyal said, “The process should be transparent and someone with a good academic vision should be appointed. The appointment should be based purely on academics. The present V-C has already undermined the democratic processes of decision making in JNU.”JNU students’ union vice-president Saket Moon said the selection process for the next V-C should be free of bias. “The vice-chancellor should be selected on the basis of her or his academic credentials and have the required experience to run a University like JNU. The present V-C lacks both the values,” he said.According to the advertisement by the education ministry, the applicant for the post should not be more than 65 years of age. The post carries a monthly salary of ₹2,10,000, with Special Allowance of ₹11,250, and some other usual allowances.Appointment will be made from a panel of names recommended by a Committee constituted under the provisions of Jawaharlal Nehru University Act, 1966, the advertisement said.Apart from the JNU V-C, the education ministry has initiated the process of filling up several posts or finding replacements where the incumbent is set to complete his or her term soon.One such post is that of the director of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), with Hrushikesh Senapaty, the present director, completing his term later this year.

28-10-2020||Delhi||North MCD doctors refuse to withdraw strike||Doctors of North Delhi municipal corporation-run hospitals, dispensaries and clinics on Tuesday refused to call off their strike even as the civic body said salaries till the month of September had been released for all doctors. Resident doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital, which was the only Covid-19 facility under the north corporation, began the strike over delayed salaries 23 days ago. Their counterparts from all north MCD-run hospitals as well as senior faculty and doctors later joined them. Some resident doctors also began a hunger strike five days ago, which was joined by four senior doctors on Tuesday. The doctors are now looking for a permanent solution to ensure timely payment of salaried. A decision on the strike will be taken after a general body meeting of senior and the resident doctors at 10 am on Wednesday after checking if everybody has received their salaries. Dr Sagardeep Bawa, vice-president of the resident doctors’ association of Hindu Rao, said, “Since the senior doctors joined the strike, we will convene a general body meeting tomorrow morning where a decision will be taken together.” “We will not call of the strike till we ensure that each and every doctor, including those in dispensaries and clinics, have been paid. We are trying to look for a permanent solution so that doctors do not have to get on the road and protest every few months,” said Dr RR Gautam, president of the municipal corporation doctors’ association. Meanwhile, the National Board of Examination -- which governs the Diplomate National Board postgraduate training of doctors -- has threatened to withdraw accreditation of Hindu Rao hospital for not paying salaries to the trainees on time. “The hospital is required to release the pending stipend of the trainees immediately, failing which NBE shall be constrained to take appropriate action, including but not limited to withdrawal of accreditation of Hindu Rao hospital, Delhi,” read a letter signed by Dr Pawanindra Lal, executive director of the board.Earlier on Tuesday morning, north corporation mayor Jai Prakash had called a meeting with doctors in his office . “We requested him to come to Hindu Rao hospital where all the doctors were present and give his solution. If the solution was acceptable to all, we would call off the strike. No permanent solution was offered by him,” said Dr Gautam. Doctors from several government hospitals in Delhi stopped routine work for two hours or worked with a black ribbon in solidarity with the doctors from the north corporation on Tuesday morning. The three mayors had also protested outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Monday, demanding that the Delhi government pay “R 13,500 crore it owed to the MCDs” so that they could pay the doctors. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday morning, “Whatever we had to pay as per the finance commission, we are paying it on time. But MCD does not run on that money alone. Their tax collection is about Rs 18 to 20,000 crore. What the Delhi government pays is just 15 to 20% of their funds. What about the rest?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-doctors-refuse-to-withdraw-strike/story-Etgk0620dQ1tlX5qG09MRN.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||MoU signed to build multi-level bus depots in Delhi||More than a decade after it was first ideated, the Delhi government has finally moved ahead with its long-delayed plan to create multi-level parking depots with commercial facilities for buses run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). The step is significant as the lack of parking has been one of the primary reasons for the delay in strengthening Delhi’s bus fleet, especially now when the government is in the process of procuring nearly 3,000 more buses. On Tuesday, the state-run DTC and NBCC India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for constructing these one-of-a-kind depots in Hari Nagar and Vasant Vihar. At present, Delhi has a combined strength of around 6,600 DTC and cluster scheme buses. Taking to Twitter to announce the move, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “DTC and NBCC have signed MOUs today to build multi-level bus depots at Hari Nagar and Vasant Vihar -- the first such depots in the country, with all modern facilities. More buses could now be parked in limited available space. The parking cost per bus will be much lower now.”The MoU was signed in the presence of Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot, the commissioner of transport and the managing directors of DTC and NBCC along with other senior officials.Gahlot said this would hopefully become India’s first multi-level bus depot. “NBCC will also redevelop a few other DTC properties. I am really happy to note that these projects will be developed on a zero-waste, self-sustainable model. With more buses set to arrive in the next few months, increasing the capacity of its depots is a very crucial step in ensuring effective utilisation of available land,” Gahlot said.A senior government official said the DTC will rent out space for commercial activities at some locations.The plan to construct multi-level depots for state-run buses was first conceived by the Congress government under former chief minister Sheila Dikshit in June 2008. Later, when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power in 2015, it took over the same proposal and started working on it in 2016, but nothing concrete materialised back then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mou-signed-to-build-multi-level-bus-depots-in-delhi/story-cH5T7i7XAz4vkPELbVWFJN.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||New sensors by IIT-Kanpur to give local data on pollution to residents||The Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, in partnership with a Mumbai-based start-up, has developed and installed first-of-its-kind, low-cost air quality monitoring sensors at 30 locations across Delhi and the neighbouring satellite towns to provide local data on the sources of pollution. The data from the sensors, which have been designed to measure particulate matter of size 10 microns (PM10) and 2.5 microns (PM2.5), will not only be available to anti-pollution agencies but local residents as well, the developers said. IIT-Kanpur scientists explained that the sensors gathers and transmit data more effectively than air quality monitoring stations in Delhi-NCR. Delhi has 36 monitoring stations run by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Scientists said it is a collaboration between IIT-Kanpur, Mumbai-based Respirer Living Sciences and Ericsson (India), which for the first time in has used Narrow Bandwidth-Internet of Things technology in India.The project is led by Sachchida Nand Tripathi, head of department (civil engineering) who is also a member of the National Clean Air Programme and professor Abhay Karandika, director, IIT-Kanpur. Data generated from these sensors will be shared on a common platform to help community groups in understanding air quality situation in their areas. The first batch of these sensors have been installed at 30 locations, including Dhaula Kuan, RK Puram, Mundka, Rohini, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Noida.“This is a patent-pending technology that IIT-Kanpur has developed. These sensors are low-cost but they are very well calibrated. This will not only provide a clear picture of which local sources are acting up, but also provide information of how much contribution is coming from outside,” said Tripathi. Ronak Sutaria, founder and CEO of Respirer Living Sciences, which is the industry partner in this project, said that these sensors cost just 1/20th the price of reference grade stations that are currently installed in Delhi. Setting up a reference grade station may cost ₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh per station, but these new sensors cost around ₹50,000, with an accuracy of over 90%. “One of the objectives of these sensors is to provide local residents information about what his happening in their neighbourhood. Also, when you are taking certain actions to improve the air quality you need such hyper-local air quality data, which is presently not available in the country. This device can also run on a single charge battery for at least six months,” Sutaria said. Experts and residents both welcomed the concept. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, “Data access is the first step of solving the problem of pollution in the region. Hyper-local data will also help government agencies make dedicated plans for each area and address the sources more efficiently.,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-cost-air-quality-sensors-to-provide-pollution-data-to-residents/story-A9lcN1LuXB0YwylOHN6E3L.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Air quality may worsen from today, stubble burning to add to Delhi’s woes||Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) improved a few notches on Tuesday from a day before on account of a higher wind speed, but remained in the “very poor” category, with scientists warning of a further deterioration from Wednesday as stubble fires in Punjab have peaked.On Monday, 2,047 fires were observed over Punjab and crop residue burning may have already crossed the peak in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, according to scientists. Farmers said the impact of stubble fires may wane by the time Diwali festivities begin. The Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin on Tuesday reported an overall AQI of 312. This was several points below the AQI of 353 recorded on Monday in Delhi. Forecasts by various air monitoring agencies, however, said the respite would be short-lived and Delhi’s air quality may start deteriorating again from Wednesday as the high stubble burning count in Punjab and Haryana, and the continuation of northwesterly winds are likely to make things worse for Delhi. Lower temperatures expected over the next few days will also trap pollutants closer to the surface, experts said. On Tuesday, a maximum temperature of 32.4 degrees Celsius was recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather. The minimum temperature settled at 14.4 degree Celsius, two degrees below normal.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), showed that the impact of stubble fires was 23% on Monday but Delhi’s air quality improved because of favourable meteorological conditions. “Favourable winds aided dispersion of pollutants in Delhi, otherwise air quality would have deteriorated. On October 24, there were 900 fires in Punjab; on October 25, there were 1,400 fires and on October 26, it had crossed 2,000. But we expect some deterioration in air quality on Wednesday as wind speed is likely to decline marginally,” warned Vijay Soni, scientist at India Meteorological Department (air quality management division). “Every year, there are around 60,000 stubble fires cumulatively. This year, there have been over 16,000 fires in total until now. It appears like fires are peaking now,” Soni said. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, Punjab, said fires may have peaked already or ar about to peak in a day or so. “Harvesting will be complete by November 10-15. This is the peak of stubble fires, pollution has increased in Punjab where fires are burning. This year fires are high because farmers are agitating together against the farm bills.” “Wind speed increased to about 18 kmph on Tuesday at Safdarjung and so the impact of stubble fires was not felt as much. Wind speed will reduce from Wednesday and the direction will remain northwesterly, so the air quality is likely to deteriorate,” Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, added. The ventilation index was 12000 m2/s on October 27. It is likely to be 4000 m2/s on October 28 and 8000 m2/s on October 29. The ventilation index is a function of mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-may-worsen-again-from-wednesday-stubble-burning-to-add-to-delhi-s-woes/story-amfAsjxOKCdk6urWSVRgrN.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Green Delhi mobile app ready, likely to be launched by CM Kejriwal on Thursday||The government’s Green Delhi mobile application – which will enable users to register complaints about violation of anti-pollution norms – is ready and scheduled to be launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, a government official said.The mobile application is part of the government’s seven-point action plan to fight air pollution, which was announced by chief minister Kejriwal on October 6. The action plan includes dust-control strategies, a tree transplantation policy and schemes to encourage electric vehicles among other measures.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday held a review meeting with officials of various departments regarding the grievance redressal mechanism in connection with the new mobile application.Users of the Green Delhi app will be able to upload photos and videos and send them along with their complaints. Each complainant will get a unique code to track the status of the complaint and action taken.The departments that sent representatives for the meeting includeed police, public works department, Delhi Development Authority, the National Highways Authority of India, the three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council, the revenue department, and the environment department, Rai’s office said in a statement, adding all these departments are to appoint nodal officers.“Failure to address the issue on time will result in action against the concerned nodal officers. The nodal officers are also provided training to address issues. Through the Green Delhi application, people will be able to notify the government about burning waste, industrial pollution, dust, etc., by registering complaints online,” the statement said.Delhi battles high levels of pollution every winter because of factors such as stubble and garbage burning, dust, local industrial and vehicular emission, which are compounded by unfavourable weather conditions. The air quality in Delhi remained in the “very poor” category on Tuesday, with the overall AQI settling at 312.The statement said, “There will be a time limit for redressal of complaints received through the Green Delhi application, under which the departments concerned will have to work towards resolving the complaints. All departments concerned will be connected to the app and a complaint lodged through the app will be received and addressed by the departments. Nodal officers of the concerned departments and other officers subordinate to them will remain connected to the app. The Green Delhi app will be a photo and a video-based app.”The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), environment department, the Central Pollution Control Board and the Union environment ministry also operate helpline numbers for pollution-related complaints. Those helplines numbers would continue to function, the senior government official said, adding, “The idea of the Delhi government’s app is to conveniently bring complaint registration and tracking mechanism under one platform for convenience of the complainant and better accountability on part of agencies handling each case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/green-delhi-mobile-app-ready-likely-to-be-launched-by-kejriwal-on-thursday/story-IngIVrLAOHI6PMEc7OM28J.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Waste-to-energy unit inaugurated at Ghazipur market||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday inaugurated a power plant in east Delhi’s Ghazipur in which 15 tonnes of waste generated every day at the wholesale agriculture and livestock market can be processed to produce 1,500 units of electricity.Kejriwal said, “The waste-to-power (WTP) plant is starting today. The waste generated from this mandi will be processed to convert organic waste into electricity. Delhi is the national capital of the country, and so it should be clean to be regarded as a national capital. But there are waste dumps all across, and there are three waste mountains in Delhi.”Several waste-to-power plants are needed across the city, he said. “This is a small plant that will combust only 15 tonnes of waste to produce 1,500 units of electricity. Many such small plants should be established across Delhi.” “With an existing big waste-to-power plant and the establishment of hundreds of such small plants, waste should no longer be dumped on these garbage mountains. This waste should be recycled to generate electricity or be used in brick kilns. It is only through this judicious recycling that Delhi can prosper, or these mountains will keep on increasing. The starting of this plant is a step in this direction,” he said.Kejriwal was accompanied by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and environment minister Gopal Rai at the inauguration event.The Delhi government, senior officials said, plans similar plants at the Okhla and Azadpur markets too by next year as part of an initiative to modernise the city’s wholesale agriculture and livestock markets and to ensure that the height of the landfills in Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa remain under check.The power plant inaugurated on Tuesday is located near the poultry market in Ghazipur. Another waste-to-power plant operated by the east Delhi municipal corporation in the vicinity combusts garbage from the landfill in Ghazipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waste-to-energy-unit-inaugurated-at-ghazipur-market/story-aqNSK7vt1tpTcbPKh5gtiP.html
28-10-2020||Delhi||Interim bail to continue for prisoners who were released at start of lockdown||The high-powered committee appointed by the Delhi high court has extended the interim bail of prisoners who were released at the start of the lockdown to decongest the three prison complexes in Delhi.The Delhi High Court had on October 23 ended its blanket order extending all interim bails and paroles to around 6,000 prisoners granted prior to and during the Covid-19 lockdown. That order will come in effect from October 31. All under trials, whose bail was extended, have to surrender in a phased manner between November 2 and November 13, it said.During a meeting of the committee -- BS Bhalla, principal secretary(home), Delhi prisons’s director general Sandeep Goel and Kanwal Jeet Arora, member of the Delhi State Legal Services Authority — the committee decided to extend the interim bail of those under trials who were released as per the criteria set out by the committee. Others (those arrested recently or were granted interim bail by the court in regular hearings) will have to surrender as per the timeline set by the special bench of the Delhi High Court between November 2 and 13. The dates for the return(surrender) in December of those released as per criteria set out by committee is yet to be decided.The first category of prisoners who were released as per the criteria were those who were already lodged in prison for a long time and were not involved in heinous cases. Another important criterion for release of prisoners was that they must have already served half of their sentences in non-heinous cases.According to the minutes of the meetings, the prisoners from the second category(those released on interim bail by the order of the court in regular hearings) will return in batches from November 2. They will first be kept in isolation for 14 days at the Mandoli Police Complex. The complex has already been turned into a temporary quarantine jail by the Delhi government. The new prisoners will be shifted to prison only after they complete the 14-day mandatory quarantine period. The officers also decided that they would advise prisoners to get tested for Covid-19 and also get a test report, but this will not be made mandatory.Until October 24, the three prisons -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli - had reported 89 Covid-19 cases among prisoners and 219 among jail staff. Two prisoners had succumbed to the virus. At present, there are three active cases, while the rest have recovered. Among the jail staff, 209 have recovered and there are 10 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/interim-bail-to-continue-for-prisoners-who-were-released-at-start-of-lockdown/story-crnZbaQGpi9guHYBbm86KL.html

28-10-2020||Delhi||Alleged gang members of Neeraj Bawana arrested after shoot-out in Rohini||Three men allegedly associated with the Neeraj Bawana gang were arrested early Tuesday morning after a shoot-out in Rohini, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said the arrested men have been identified as 27-year-old Manish Dabas, Deepak Katiya, 26 and Prince Panchal, 23, who were involved in several extortion cases. Yadav said, on October 2, a businessman in Model Town received an extortion call for Rs 50 lakh. The caller identified himself as a member of the Neeraj Bawana gang. The businessmen got a second call on October 21, the the caller threatened to kill him or his family members if he didn’t pay the money. Two days later, three unidentified men fired at the businessman’s house, the DCP said.“During investigation, we came to know that the three men who shot at the businessman’s house would be going to Karala Village in a Maruti Swift car. A trap was laid and around 4.30 am on Tuesday, they were intercepted near Rohini. They were asked to surrender but they instead opened fire at the police team. Our team retaliated and both Dabas and Katiya were shot in their leg. Prince was also overpowered by the police,” the DCP said.Three loaded pistols along with the car and four mobile phones were seized.Police said Dabas was involved in 10 murder cases, illegal possession of arms, attempt to murder, extortion and assault.

28-10-2020||Delhi||Online booking for HSRPs, stickers to reopen from November 1||Online booking for getting high security registration plates (HSRP) and colour coded stickers affixed in vehicles will restart from November 1, even as the Delhi government will launch home delivery of the same on a trial basis at some select locations from next month, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday. On October 1, the minister had directed that no new application should be entertained until the backlog of HSRPs is cleared and all the complaints of customers are resolved. It will be after a month that the application window for the registration plates will be reopened. The minister announced these decisions after holding a high-level meeting with stakeholders late in the evening to discuss ways to sort out the problems faced in affixation of HSRP and colour coded stickers on vehicles registered in the national capital.“The meeting had representatives of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) in attendance. It was decided that there will be a single website URL from November 1 for applying for HSRPs and stickers. The number of outlets from where these number plates can be collected have been increased from 150 to 650. It has also been decided that at every stage, the customer will be kept informed through SMS about the status of the number plate. Also, the option of Home Delivery will be provided to those who want to avail it,” Gahlot said.A spokesperson of HSRP manufacturer Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited confirmed that booking for HSRP will begin from November 1 and installation will start from November 7. “Customers will be sent a message by the automobile dealers when the number plate will be ready,” he said.Transport officials said that each vehicle owner booking HSRP online will get a receipt so that even if there is any future drive by transport department to penalise violations, they are not punished even if there is delay on the part of dealers or manufacturers.Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited also said that it will solely operate the home delivery service for which it is now expanding its call centres and also roping in companies which provide riders. “Till now our call centre was manned by only 20 people. Now we are increasing it to over 100. For home delivery, we are also creating a pool from our own staff who will be riders. Besides, we will also be roping in two companies which provide riders if there is a surge in demand,” the official from Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/online-booking-for-hsrps-stickers-to-reopen-from-november-1/story-g9XPw0YHTCPfcGOaUMKIYN.html
28-10-2020||City||Extra-curricular activities for students in Mumbai go online way||Nearly three months into the lockdown in May, Arpita Shinde (name changed), a Mumbai-based parent, was worried as her six-year-old daughter Aahana, who plays football as a hobby, was getting anxious about not being able to go out of her home to practice the sport. “Initially, she would throw tantrums but when she realised that there was no way she could go out, she began spending more time on the mobile phone. This was alarming to me as a parent, as my daughter was never someone who would sit in a place for hours,” said Shinde. In the days to come, Shinde researched a bit and found her daughter an online sports tutor. “She could meet children of her age online and play small games within the house and on our building terrace. That made her happy,” said Shinde. With schools operating classes online for the past several months owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, playing and extracurricular activities have also moved online as children remain cooped up inside their homes. Through online platforms, social media pages and activities organised by schools and non-governmental organisations, students are being offered a wide array of options to pursue their hobbies, take up an activity or learn a skill from the comfort of their homes. One such platform is KRAYON, which is an exclusive, secure online video platform for students. It features 12 different competitions including music, dance, art, writing, quiz etc for students from Class 1 to Class 12. “The platform allows students to upload pre-recorded videos of their performances and share it with their peers from across the country. We also ensure complete safety and privacy of the children. The platform offers a non-judgemental and non-competitive approach, and children can just have fun and learn from each other,” said Dr Syed Sultan Ahmed, managing director and chief learner, LXL Ideas, which runs the platform. Students from nearly 1,000 schools across India are a part of the platform. For younger children, online platform KLAY offers in-person teaching and care-giving services at home. “The learning environment for children shifted away from physical classrooms to the online space overnight. While schools and teachers have harnessed their innovative best to ensure continuity in learning for children online, some parents and children are still getting used to the new format. To serve such parents, we have built KARE@Home as the next best alternative,” said AK Srikanth, CEO, KLAY. So far, more than 250 families have subscribed to the platform and the packages for calling a teacher and caregiver at home begin from ₹10,000. In order to cater to the developmental needs of underprivileged children in Mumbai, NGO Salaam Bombay Foundation began ‘Masti ki Paathshaala’, an initiative that encouraged children to play games and display their talent before their peers. “A large number of children in Mumbai live in 10x10 rooms with very little space to move around. The lockdown had caused a lot of anxiety in their families as many had to fight for daily survival. To help such children stay positive in these tough times, our facilitators would make video calls to them, hold game sessions, ask them to perform and boost their confidence. This had a huge impact not just on the child but on the entire family. Over 1,000 students attended these sessions in the city,” said Aditi Parikh, vice-president, communications, Salaam Bombay Foundation. Ruchita Dar Shah, a parent from Mumbai who runs online parenting platform First Moms Club, said that the past few months have been challenging for children as well as their parents. “My older son is an avid footballer while my younger one is into theatre. Not getting to go to school or pursue their hobbies was disappointing. But slowly, as a family, we came up with alternatives for them to spend some quality time at home. For instance, we encouraged them to buy lots of books, read and discussed them together. Also, my younger one draws up quizzes for us and we play as a family. While a lot of online options exist for pursuing extra-curricular activities, parents should not pressure their children on accomplishing something from a hobby or a talent. Then the whole purpose of the exercise is lost,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/extra-curricular-activities-for-students-in-mumbai-go-online-way/story-5cbCITjNSrqEhiQKVHvS2L.html
28-10-2020||World||Blowout US economic growth in summer is already fading||Americans may feel whiplashed by a report Thursday on the economy’s growth this summer, when an explosive rebound followed an epic collapse. The government will likely estimate that the economy grew faster on an annualized basis last quarter than in any such period since record-keeping began in 1947. Just be forewarned: The sizzling pace won’t last. The economy is weakening and facing renewed threats. Confirmed viral cases are surging. Hiring has sagged. Government stimulus has run out. And even last quarter’s outsize growth will leave the economy far below its level before the pandemic struck in March. “The strength of this figure is an optical illusion,” Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note. “Growth has since slowed, and we expect markedly weaker activity” in the October-December quarter and beyond In the last major report on the U.S. economy before Election Day, economists have forecast that growth in the July-September quarter soared to a 31 per cent annual rate, according to data provider FactSet. That would follow a plunge of 31.4 per cent in the April-June period — by far the worst quarterly drop ever — when the eruption of the coronavirus closed businesses and threw tens of millions out of work. If the analysts’ outlook proves roughly accurate, the economy, as of last quarter, will have recovered only a bit more than two-thirds of the output it lost to the pandemic recession. The economy shrank 5 per cent in the first three months of the year. Mathematically, a bounce-back that equals or even slightly exceeds an earlier drop doesn’t mean the economy has fully recovered. The reason is that the rebound comes off a smaller numerical base. To use a simple example: A drop from 100 to 70 is a 30 per cent fall. Yet a 30 per cent rebound from 70 gets you only back to 91. You’d need a 43 per cent gain to get back to 100. There are deeper reasons, too, for viewing Thursday’s report on gross domestic product with skepticism. It reflects huge gains last quarter that resulted from simply reopening many businesses after the virus had paralysed the economy in March and April. Since August, the economic outlook has darkened as hiring has slowed. Consumers may spend warily during winter. And if the rise in Covid cases were to cause widespread business shutdowns or restrictions, the economy would struggle to sustain a solid recovery. Economists at Goldman Sachs have already slashed their growth forecast for the fourth quarter to a 3 per cent annual rate from 6 per cent. The seven-day rolling average for confirmed new cases in the US soared over the past two weeks from 51,161 to 71,832, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and confirmed infections are rising in 47 states. “The basic reality is that the virus remains out of control, and the risks of social and economic activity are maybe even higher than in the spring,” said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota. Americans are showing growing concern about the economy. Consumer confidence slipped in October after having risen sharply in September. Consumers’ outlook for the economy over the next six months fell particularly hard, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. “There is little to suggest that consumers foresee the economy gaining momentum in the final months of 2020, especially with COVID-19 cases on the rise and unemployment still high,” said Lynn Franco, the board’s senior director of economic indicators. The unemployment rate is 7.9 per cent, down significantly from 14.7 per cent at the outset of pandemic recession but still historically high. And hiring has slowed sharply, from a peak of 4.8 million in June to 661,000 in September. The economy is still roughly 10.7 million jobs short of recovering all the 22 million jobs that were lost to the pandemic. “We bounced off the bottom really aggressively, but since then, there is this deceleration,” said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS. “The big issue is not how big the third quarter rebound is, but how fast is the next phase of the recovery coming?” Carpenter said he thinks growth is slowing to just a 2.5 per cent annual rate in the current quarter, and that the economy won’t return to its pre-pandemic levels of output until late next year or early 2022. The job market may take longer to fully recover, Carpenter said. Millions have dropped out of the work force and are no longer looking for work, artificially reducing the unemployment rate. They includes many women who have had to leave jobs to care for children now attending school online from home. The proportion of Americans who are either working or looking for work has sunk to 61.4 per cent, the lowest level since 1976. “That’s the real measure from my perspective as to whether we’re recovered,” Carpenter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blowout-us-economic-growth-in-summer-is-already-fading/story-0pEH5LxGGcniq3hJ2uOoiN.html
28-10-2020||World||Social media CEOs get earful on bias, warning of new limits||With next week’s election looming, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google were scolded by Republicans at a Senate hearing Wednesday for alleged anti-conservative bias in the companies’ social media platforms and received a warning of coming restrictions from Congress.Lawmakers of both parties are assessing the companies’ tremendous power to disseminate speech and ideas, and are looking to challenge their long-enjoyed bedrock legal protections for online speech.The Trump administration, seizing on unfounded accusations of bias against conservative views, has asked Congress to strip some of the protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.“The time has come for that free pass to end,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Wicker, R-Miss., said the laws governing online speech must be updated because “the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack.”He spoke at the opening of the hearing as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai waited to testify via video.Wicker cited the move this month by Facebook and Twitter to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.Republicans led by President Donald Trump have accused the social media platforms, without evidence, of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.In their prepared testimony, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Critics in both parties say that immunity under Section 230 enables the social media companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.Zuckerberg acknowledged that Congress “should update the law to make sure it’s working as intended.”Dorsey and Pichai urged caution in making any changes. “Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,” Dorsey said.Pichai appealed to lawmakers “to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers.”The session lacked the in-person drama of star-witness proceedings before the coronavirus. The hearing room was nearly empty except for Wicker and a few colleagues, but their questioning was sharp as tempers flared among members.“Twitter’s conduct has by far been the most egregious,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Dorsey. Cruz cited Twitter’s limitations on the newspaper story as part of “a pattern of censorship and silencing Americans with whom Twitter disagrees.”Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, went after Republicans, saying the hearing was a “sham.”“This is bullying,” Schatz told the CEOs. “Do not let US senators bully you into carrying the water” for politicians seeking to discredit their opponents. With their questions, Schatz said, the Republicans “are trying to bully the heads of private companies into making a hit job” on political leadersTrump earlier this year signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under the 1996 telecommunications law.Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent, and said the restrictions by Twitter and Facebook related to the newspaper story was “quite concerning.”Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections — an about-face from the agency’s previous position.Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have imposed a misinformation label on content from the president, who has about 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.Starting Tuesday, Facebook didn’t accept any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close Nov. 3, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the US.Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views — a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump’s presidential campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-media-ceos-get-earful-on-bias-warning-of-new-limits/story-fW18rs6ie4MnV8B6C1mlKI.html

The other three are believed to be in China.The arrests are among a series of recent actions the Trump administration has taken against China, a country President Donald Trump regards as a prime adversary.In July, for instance, the Justice Department charged hackers working with the Chinese government with targeting firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.“China is violating laws and norms left and right,” FBI Director Chris Wray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-8-in-alleged-chinese-surveillance-effort-in-us/story-TIRm8KuYyDBwL8itFlV4gJ.html
28-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: President Donald Trump’s campaign website briefly hacked, defaced||US President Donald Trump’s campaign website was briefly hacked on Tuesday, just a week before the presidential elections.The spokesman for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, said in a statement that the website was “defaced.” “We are working with law enforcement authorities to investigate the source of the attack. There was no exposure to sensitive data because none of it is actually stored on the site. The website has been restored,” Murtaugh said.A report in The New York Times said Trump’s campaign website was briefly taken over by hackers and the hack lasted less than 30 minutes. The paper said in a screen posted to Trump’s website - donaldjtrump.com - the hackers claimed to have compromised “multiple devices” that gave them access to the president and his relatives “most internal and secret conversations,” including classified information.The hackers also accused the Trump administration of having a hand in the origins of the coronavirus and cooperating with “foreign actors manipulating the 2020 elections.” The NYT added that the hackers appeared to be looking to generate cryptocurrency and invited visitors to donate cryptocurrency to one of two funds - ‘Yes, share the data’ and the other labeled ‘No, Do not share the data’. “After the deadline, we will compare the funds and execute the will of the world,” the hackers wrote, without specifying a deadline. The hackers also posted what they said was their encryption key to Trumps’ campaign site.With less than a week left for the elections, the defacement highlighted cybersecurity risks facing the election campaigns.The report said intelligence agencies have been closely monitoring hacking groups, including teams backed by Iran and Russia, that have tried to break into election-related systems and have been involved in influence operations in recent weeks.Last week, the director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe had identified Iran and Russia as two nations responsible for disinformation and some limited intrusions into voter registration databases.Trump last week told a campaign rally in Arizona that “Nobody gets hacked. To get hacked you need somebody with 197 I.Q. and he needs about 15 percent of your password.” PTI YAS ZH ZH||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-president-donald-trump-s-campaign-website-briefly-hacked-defaced/story-ZFgT6y6Wz5MfxMaTYm4cgM.html
28-10-2020||World||Kept out of traditional jobs, transgender people see hope in tech world||As a transgender woman living in Russia, where LGBT+ people often face abuse and state repression, Chloe Golovleva said she felt like an animal trapped in a cage.“There was no life for me,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Two years ago, Golovleva left Russia and sought asylum in Argentina where trans people have greater legal protections, but she still felt her co-workers did not accept her.“It’s very difficult to start a new life,” the 40-year-old said. “There’s transphobia and homophobia, just like everywhere else in the world.”Golovleva’s experience is common across the Americas, where conservative social norms often leave trans people locked out of formal work and pushed to the margins of society.But increasingly, LGBT+ advocates and tech entrepreneurs are teaming up to offer training and employment in one of the world’s fastest growing industries:Information Technology.With relatively well-paid jobs, a disruptive attitude toward traditional work environments, and an emphasis on innovation, advocates say the tech industry offers opportunities for trans people who are often left out in the cold.“There’s a lot of trans folks ... who are working in the tech space and who are also leveraging their access to resources to help other trans folks,” said US tech entrepreneur and academic Kortney Ziegler.Because the industry “is focused on innovation and the next big thing, there’s a lot of room for people of all identities,” Ziegler said.Representation in techIn countries such as the United States, Brazil and Argentina, LGBT+ rights have become increasingly accepted in recent years, despite resistance from conservative groups.In June, the US Supreme Court ruled that workers could not be discriminated against for being LGBT+, while Brazil’s highest court made homophobia and transphobia a crime last year.Argentina established a quota system in September under which at least 1% of public sector jobs are reserved for trans workers.Despite these strides, trans people are often left out of the workforce.In the United States, 16% of trans people reported losing a job due to their gender identity, according to the National Centre for Transgender Equality, a non-profit, while in Brazil, some 90% of trans women work in prostitution.But in the tech industry, often centered in liberal, LGBT+-friendly urban centres like San Francisco in the United States or Buenos Aires in Argentina, acceptance of gay and trans people tends to be higher, experts say.“The representation in tech is genuinely higher than it is in a lot of more old-school industries,” said Vivienne Ming, a US-based researcher and tech entrepreneur.According to Ming’s research, nearly 7% of people in the US tech industry identify as LGBT+, compared with about 4% of Americans overall, according to polling firm Gallup.Despite the greater openness, trans people may face discrimination in the industry, especially in the recruitment process, Ming said.As a result, many trans people in tech have taken it upon themselves to make the industry more inclusive.Ziegler had a doctorate degree and was living near San Francisco, but as a Black trans man struggled to find work.So in 2013, Ziegler founded Trans*H4CK, an organization to provide training and support for trans and non-binary people, meaning those who don’t identify as male or female, in the tech industry.“I was inspired by this space of innovation, this idea of folks of different backgrounds and skills coming together to build something that’s tangible and usable and can save lives.”In its three years of operation, the organization said it helped more than 100 transgender developers to create mobile apps for other trans people to find work, health care, and friends.Ziegler admits the industry has a long way to go toward trans inclusion, and research from Trans*H4CK suggests trans tech workers often are paid less than are their non-transgender peers.But Ziegler said Trans*H4CK’s impact has been long lasting.“In our existence we birthed so many different organizations focused on trans folks,” he said. “So many different ideas and platforms that are still in operation to this day have come out of that.” ‘Profound Impact’ Initiatives like Trans*H4CK have become more and more common. In 2014, US transgender actor and entrepreneur Angelica Ross founded TransTech Social Enterprises, providing training and co-working spaces for trans people in tech.“I wanted to create a program that was really powered by the community,” Ross said on a recent Facebook live.“I wanted to make sure that folks had access to community, to mentorship, to resources, job opportunities.”In Brazil, Noah Scheffel runs EducaTRANSforma, an organization which provides training for trans people as well as inclusion training for potential employers in the tech industry.The organization began in 2019 with 16 students taking in-person classes, although with the coronavirus pandemic shutting down much of the country, Scheffel moved courses online and hopes to train 200 trans people by August next year.“(My dream) is to give them an opportunity that they’ve never had in their lives,” Scheffel said via WhatsApp message.In Argentina, Daniel Coletti founded Trans-TI two years ago, providing coaching and jobs for trans people, helping them prepare for tasks like online software testing.According to Coletti, jobs in tech do not necessarily require formal education, so trans people with few prospects can quickly learn the skills they need.“A lot of times, the impact can be quite profound,” he said. “It’s not that we’re giving them charity, we’re giving them a job.”Among the trans people employed by Trans-TI is Russian refugee Golovleva, who started working at the organization in March.It’s been a steep learning curve, she said, but after two years in Argentina, she said she finally feels at home.“I have formal work, and in this job, there’s no transphobia,” she said. “In that sense, I’m happy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kept-out-of-traditional-jobs-transgender-people-see-hope-in-tech-world/story-wbOpap1qlA3xpF6mPqPtNL.html
28-10-2020||World||Singapore takes small step in easing controls on migrant workers||Singapore will allow some migrant workers, who have largely been confined to dormitories, to visit recreation centres as the city-state gradually relaxes measures to stem the spread of Covid-19.The more than 300,000 overseas workers have been confined to their living quarters since April, and have only been allowed out in recent months to go to work and for essential errands, after the coronavirus ripped through the tightly packed dormitories. That’s even as life has been slowly returning to normal for local Singaporeans and white-collar expatriates.They will also be allowed to visit restaurants, mini marts and other outlets at selected recreation centres on their days off from Oct. 31, the Ministry of Manpower said in a statement. Visits must be booked in advance via a smartphone application with dormitory operators checking that workers have valid passes before being allowed to leave.The relaxation of controls on the workers comes after more than two months of trials and with infection rates in the community and dormitories having stayed at low levels, the ministry said. Around 30,000 workers have already booked exit passes as part of the trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-takes-small-step-in-easing-controls-on-migrant-workers/story-IbkXeDqKMblu9GvlG0eLKN.html
28-10-2020||World||Germany moves to shutter bars and restaurants for one month||Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing for a partial lockdown in Germany that would include closing bars, restaurants and leisure facilities through the end of November, as coronavirus infections continue to surge across Europe.Merkel is also urging citizens to keep private contacts to an absolute minimum, and to avoid all non-essential private travel, according to a draft federal government briefing paper obtained by Bloomberg.She’ll discuss the proposals with regional premiers starting at 1 p.m. in Berlin in what is likely to be contentious meeting, with some state leaders already signalling opposition to the measures.Like many of her European counterparts, the German leader’s hand has been forced by a spike in virus cases that has been gathering pace since the start of August, fuelled by travellers and people failing to observe hygiene and distancing rules at social or family gatherings. French President Emmanuel Macron is also set to announce tighter restrictions when he addresses the nation on Wednesday evening.Merkel has pledged to do all she can to avoid imposing another lockdown as strict as the one that hammered Europe’s biggest economy in the second quarter.The latest steps, which would take effect Nov. 4, are designed to stem the spread of the disease while broadly allowing activity to continue. They’re likely to provoke protests from industry groups and from citizens already weary of what they see as government intrusion into their private lives.Economists at Commerzbank estimated the measures will depress German output by almost 1% in the fourth quarter, leading to “at best stagnation,” with a “considerable risk” of a second recession. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank more than 2%, with auto and construction shares seeing the steepest declines. Haven assets, such as Treasuries and the yen, rose.Some states may refuse to back all of Merkel’s proposals, and they have already prompted a Vice President of the Lower House of Parliament to declare on national radio that he won’t follow the new rules.“I urgently warn against alarmism, which can also lead to erroneous decisions,” Wolfgang Kubicki, a Bundestag Vice President from the opposition Free Democrats, said on Deutschlandfunk(DLF).The government briefing document notes that effective contact tracing has become impossible in many parts of Germany, and that without further restrictions, exponential growth in the number of infections would overburden the health system within a few weeks and lead to a significant rise in serious cases and deaths.Merkel’s government is also planning to extend and enhance assistance for sectors especially hard hit by the restrictions, such as hotels and restaurants. Aid for the self-employed and those working in the arts will also be made available.“We’re in a very difficult situation, the infection numbers are exploding,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in an interview with ARD TV. “It’s a threat to the health system and therefore to human life and that’s why policy makers must act.”Germany’s new coronavirus cases rose Wednesday by a record 14,964 to a total of 464,239, according to data from the RKI public health institute.“We are currently in a critical phase of the pandemic,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said after the cabinet approved new measures including expanding laboratory testing capacity and support for working parents. “The situation is serious.”While the situation in Germany is deteriorating rapidly, governments elsewhere in Europe are faced with even more alarming increases in infections and deaths.French officials favour a one-month lockdown starting midnight Thursday, BFMTV reported, without identifying the source of its information. It will be more flexible than the initial shutdown in the spring, the report said.French deaths linked to the virus jumped by 523 to 35,541, health authorities reported Tuesday, the biggest daily increase since April 22.As governments grapple for an effective response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will step in with a set of proposals later on Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s conference call with European Union leaders.The measures include improving the flow of real-time data between member states, implementing rapid testing, expanding the use of mobile tracing apps, nudging countries to speed up vaccination strategies and creating common protocols to restore safe travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-to-shutter-bars-and-restaurants-for-one-month/story-KybHXJpRAEicvgDOyDeZgI.html
28-10-2020||World||Pak seethes at India-US statement asking it to rein in terror||Pakistan is seething at a strong India-US joint statement asking it to take irreversible action to ensure its territory is not used as a launch pad for terrorist attacks, with its foreign ministry calling the document “unwarranted and misleading”.“We take strong exception to Pakistan-related assertions made in the selective and one-sided Joint Statement, devoid of meeting the objectivity criteria,” the country’s foreign office said in a statement on Wednesday.The joint statement issued on Tuesday in New Delhi after the 2+2 ministerial dialogue between foreign and defence ministers of India and the US reiterated their call for Pakistan “to take irreversible action to ensure its territory is not used for terror attacks and to speedily prosecute the perpetrators and planners of the attacks in Mumbai, Uri and Pathankot.”The statement , issued after talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh and their US counterparts Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper, also called for “concerted action” against terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Six American citizens were among the 166 people killed in the 2008 Mumbai attacks carried out by a 10-member LeT team from Pakistan. The 2016 Uri attack and the Pathankot attack in 2016 were blamed on Pakistan-based JeM.In its response on Wednesday, a Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement that failing to take cognizance of the “grave humanitarian and human rights situation” in Kashmir is “tantamount to abdication of international responsibility.”it said “gratuitous and self-serving references” in joint statements “cannot mask the fact that it is India that continues to be the nerve centre of state-terrorism, besides being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and Islamophobia.”It claimed that the international community “recognizes Pakistan’s efforts, sacrifices and success in the fight against terrorism.”“As a country that has suffered the most from cross-border terrorism, Pakistan would continue to contribute constructively to regional and global efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.“It is important that partner countries take an objective view of the issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-seethes-at-india-us-statement-asking-it-to-rein-in-terror/story-qsegWdxRz1vokpb0WFg1LJ.html
28-10-2020||World||Pak opposes changes to India’s land ownership laws in J&K||Pakistan on Wednesday said it “categorically rejects” amendments to Indian laws that allow outsiders to buy non-farm land in Kashmir, calling them “illegal”. In a gazette notification on Tuesday, the home ministry had omitted the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with the disposal of land in the Union Territory. The new rules allow outsiders to buy non-agricultural land in Jammu & Kashmir.The Pakistan foreign office termed this a “highly condemnable Indian action and yet another clear violation of the UN Security Council resolutions, bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India, and international law.”“India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019, and subsequent measures, particularly the domicile law and now the land ownership laws, are aimed at changing the demographic structure” to convert the Kashmiris into a minority in their own land, it claimed in a statement. Changing the demographic structure “is a violation of the 4th Geneva Convention and constitutes war crime,” it said.All these measures and laws, “lacking legal and moral legitimacy are forced upon the oppressed people” through the barrel of the gun, it claimed.The statement said such steps can neither change the disputed nature of Kashmir or “prejudice the inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people.”It asked the United Nations and the international community to take immediate action to stop India from changing the demography and distinct identity Kashmir “and facilitate resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute as per the relevant UNSC Resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-opposes-changes-to-india-s-land-ownership-laws-in-j-k/story-0bj6lQuH2kAJFnZeQZeubL.html
28-10-2020||World||Japan PM says plan to release Fukushima water coming soon||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday that his government is working on the final details of a plan to release massive amounts of radioactive water being stored at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, a decision that has been delayed by protests.More than nine years after the disaster, the government still hasn’t made clear what it will do with the water at the plant, though a release into the ocean has been largely speculated on in recent years.“We cannot put off our decision forever without making a plan,” Suga told a parliamentary session Wednesday, saying the plant is running out of storage space. “Based on discussions and expertise we’ve had, we will further deepen our discussion and responsibly make a decision at an appropriate time.”A government panel in February issued a report recommending releasing the water into the ocean as the most realistic plan. The government and the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., or TEPCO, say all radioactive materials but tritium can be safely removed, and that tritium is largely harmless.The plant now has more than 1.2 million tons of the water stored in 1,000 huge tanks that occupy a large amount of space at the plant. TEPCO says that it will run out of space in the summer of 2022 and that the tanks hamper the decommissioning process.Suga did not give a timeline, though a decision is expected in weeks, if not months. An actual release would be about two years away because TEPCO still has to set up a facility for a release and have it authorized by the Nuclear Regulation Authority, officials said. A controlled release of the water will take decades.The plant suffered a triple meltdown in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and is undergoing decades-long decommissioning. The contaminated water, a mixture of injected cooling water and groundwater that flows into the reactor area, has accumulated since the accident.The government and TEPCO say water treatment systems can remove all but water-soluble tritium, though currently 70% of the water contains other radioactive materials exceeding allowable limits. TEPCO says it can meet the safety standard by running the water for a second round of treatment before releasing it.Suga visited the Fukushima plant last month and said he hoped to make a decision as soon as possible.Government officials said they need more time to discuss ways to mitigate reputational damage to the local industries and gain public understanding. Fishermen especially have opposed a release, saying their already badly hurt business would die. Their local and national representatives visited Tokyo last week to protest to environment and agriculture ministers.On Wednesday, Japanese officials from the foreign and industry ministries provided an online session for foreign diplomats to provide updates on the water situation.Nuclear officials inside and outside of Japan have said a controlled release of the water into the ocean is the only realistic way of getting rid of the water safely.Nuclear Regulation Authority chairman Toyoshi Fuketa recently said that tritium below allowable limits is routinely released from nuclear plants around the world. He said he is not concerned about safety, but understands psychological and reputational concerns about the water associated with the Fukushima disaster. He said careful monitoring of the water samples is crucial to gain public understanding.But some scientists say the long-term environmental impact from radioactive water is unknown and could pose higher risks than explained. Ken Buesseler, a marine biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in a recent article that not only tritium but how other isotopes affect marine life should be carefully examined.___Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-says-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-coming-soon/story-6ezSlAxHbZGhv0a5CLxbZI.html
28-10-2020||World||Covid-19-hit Heathrow no longer Europe’s biggest airport||The Heathrow airport has lost its status as the largest European airport after the Covid-19 pandemic and lack of testing at airport hit passenger numbers, besides losing £1.5 billion in nine months this year until September, results released on Wednesday showed.Heathrow, with 18.97 million passengers during the period, has been overtaken by the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, which had 19.27mn. Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt airports are close behind, Heathrow said, adding that in 2019 it had 81mn passengers.The company said the forecast for demand has been revised down: Passenger numbers are now forecast to be 22.6mn in 2020 and 37.1mn in 2021, compared to its June forecast of 29.2mn in 2020 and 62.8mn in 2021.“The reduction is caused by the second wave of Covid and slow progress on introducing testing by the UK government to reopen borders with ‘high risk’ countries…The UK Government has announced an intention to introduce testing for passengers from high risk countries by 1st December to help restart the UK economy,” the company said.Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “Britain is falling behind because we’ve been too slow to embrace passenger testing. European leaders acted quicker and now their economies are reaping the benefits.”“Paris has overtaken Heathrow as Europe’s largest airport for the first time ever…Bringing in pre-departure Covid tests and partnering with our US allies to open a pilot airbridge to America will kickstart our economic recovery and put the UK back ahead of our European rivals.” The company added that its finances remained robust. Liquidity at the end of September was boosted in October to £4.5 billion. Cash reserves, it said, were sufficient for the next year even under an extreme scenario with no revenue, and well into 2023 under its current forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hit-heathrow-no-longer-europe-s-biggest-airport/story-cHvAWtYXxCjATz5e1gEZIJ.html
28-10-2020||World||Spike in Covid-19 cases at worst possible time for Donald Trump||Record-setting levels of U.S. coronavirus cases are coming at the worst possible time politically for Donald Trump.The president, who has spent months attacking mail-in voting, needs a dramatic turnout on Election Day to have any hope of overcoming his sagging poll numbers and the advantage Democrats have with mail-in voting. But the spiking cases numbers and rising hospitalizations in key battleground states could deter some Republicans from voting, even though the party insists that Trump’s supporters remain fiercely motivated to show up.The surge in cases also puts Trump on the defensive and keeps the focus at the end of the race on his handling of the pandemic, which Democrat Joe Biden has made a central part of his campaign, with the president spending the past eight months downplaying the virus and insisting it would go away.“To a certain extent, it’s going to cost him some votes,” said Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who’s chairman of the pro-Trump Great America political action committee. “Our vote will hopefully turn out, but I’d much rather have them in the box than waiting for them to come.”The Covid spikes will make it more difficult for Republicans to execute their voter turnout plans, especially with polls showing Trump trailing Biden, said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.The concern for Trump isn’t just turnout but also the economic anxiety the pandemic has spawned, how it has affected older voters who are an important constituency for the president as well as working-class and rural voters who backed him in 2016 and may “have a bit of buyers’ remorse,” Madden said.“If a voter walks into the polling place thinking about the coronavirus pandemic, they’ll leave having cast a ballot for Joe Biden,” said Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, a state recording record highs in hospitalizations and cases.At the same time, there are risks for Biden too. Black voters, some of Biden’s strongest supporters, also have been hard-hit by Covid cases in the weeks leading up to the election in the key swing state of North Carolina. Experts say that could depress turnout. But that state is an outlier: Nationwide, the largest Black communities have never had fewer virus cases relative to other counties.Rising cases also could cause a shortage of poll workers that reduces the number of polling locations in urban areas, disproportionately affecting Democratic voters. And there are concerns that large numbers of mail-in ballots being cast by Democrats in response to the pandemic could be rejected because of delays in U.S. Postal Service delivery or on technical grounds.Any political impact of the coronavirus is already baked into the race after eight months, so a spike now isn’t likely to make much of a difference, said Republican strategist Bryan Lanza, deputy communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign. While the heavy Democratic early voting is a concern if they’re new voters and wouldn’t have voted anyway on Election Day, Trump’s supporters will be there for him, Lanza said.“His voters are going to show up on Election Day irrespective of what’s happening in the world,” Lanza said. “Whatever the fears are of Covid, I don’t think it’s going to be enough to scare his voters away.”Another factor is that a record number of Americans have voted early. More than 69 million Americans have cast mail-in or in-person ballots -- far exceeding the early vote total from 2016 and accounting for more than half of the total vote count in 2016, according to the U.S. Elections Project.Of the more than 33 million votes cast so far in states that report party registration data, Democrats account for 48% of the total and Republicans 29%, according to the same data.U.S. Early-Voter Turnout Surges Past 50% of All Ballots in 2016At the same time, the virus statistics are worsening each day. The U.S. reported 73,096 new Covid-19 cases Tuesday, bringing the seven-day average to a record 71,532, according to the Covid Tracking Project. More than 226,000 people have died, Johns Hopkins University data show.Despite Trump blaming rising cases on increased testing, current hospitalizations with Covid-19 have climbed 36% to 44,212 in the past three weeks, after months of decline and a brief plateau. About 6% of America’s inpatient beds are now occupied by Covid-19 patients, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.The coronavirus spike is being driven by sharp increases in the Midwest and adjacent states, including in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- three states that Trump won by a combined 77,744 votes in 2016 and he needs to carry this year to win re-election.Wisconsin now has the third-worst number of per-capita cases in the U.S. in the past week, and it’s getting worse, with the seven-day average rising 23% in the past week. Weekly cases per capita jumped 25% in Michigan and 33% in Pennsylvania in the past seven days, and current hospitalizations rose 27% in Pennsylvania, 10th-most in the U.S.No swing state has been immune as cases and hospitalizations have been rising in most states, including Florida and Arizona. The pandemic is now hitting rural areas and white voters -- key for Trump’s re-election -- harder relative to other groups, and the record Covid-19 surge that started with young Americans is increasingly reaching the older communities at elevated risk of severe outcomes.Even after a first outbreak hit Trump and White House staffers, a second outbreak came to light over the weekend when the chief of staff and other members of the inner circle for Vice President Mike Pence -- who leads the coronavirus task force that has been largely marginalized in recent months -- contracted the virus. That hasn’t stopped Trump from saying the U.S. is “rounding the turn” on the pandemic and that the surge is part of a “fake news media conspiracy.”“You turn on MSDNC, you turn on this network, it’s Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Trump said at a rally Friday in Florida. “They want to scare you to try to make you vote for Biden.”While Biden has held limited events without big crowds to contrast his response to the pandemic to Trump’s, the president has continued to hold boisterous rallies with supporters packed together and few wearing masks -- despite Trump being only weeks removed from his own battle with the virus. Health experts fear the rallies could be super-spreader events.“The bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to try to lead us through this pandemic,” Biden said during a campaign event Monday in Pennsylvania.There are challenges with Covid that other countries are also facing, but Trump’s approach will soon defeat the virus, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, said on “Fox & Friends” on Monday. Politically, Trump’s campaign is designed to turn out the vote, and state directors feel more confident about where they are now than in 2016, he said.Still, some analysts say Trump is pursuing a risky strategy depending on a strong Election Day vote to overcome Democrats’ advantage with early voting -- especially if some voters stay home and any uncommitted voters want to hold him responsible for an unchecked coronavirus.In Wisconsin, Trump’s handling of the coronavirus has gone from 51% approval in March to 56% disapproval in early October in the Marquette Law School poll -- even as a majority still support him on the economy. If the virus surge does impact the race, it probably affects Trump more because more Republicans plan to vote on Election Day, said Charles Franklin, the poll’s director.“I really think it’s an issue,” David Axelrod, the former chief strategist for President Barack Obama, said on his “Hacks on Tap” podcast on Friday. “The virus has defined this election, and it may define Election Day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spike-in-covid-19-cases-at-worst-possible-time-for-donald-trump/story-rwBngChBIukGFLZDNvEktK.html
28-10-2020||World||US Supreme Court lays out path to help Donald Trump win a contested race||The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservatives started carving a path that could let President Donald Trump win a contested election, issuing a far-reaching set of opinions just as Amy Coney Barrett was getting Senate confirmation to provide what could be a crucial additional vote.In a 5-3 decision released minutes before the Senate vote Monday night, the court rejected Democratic calls to reinstate a six-day extension for the receipt of mail ballots in Wisconsin, a hotly contested state that is experiencing a surge of Covid-19 cases. The Supreme Court as a whole gave no explanation for the decision.The outcome was bad enough for Democrats, but an opinion by Trump-appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh bordered on catastrophic. Kavanaugh suggested sympathy for Trump’s unsubstantiated contentions that votes received after Election Day would be tainted by fraud, warning that “charges of a rigged election could explode” if late-arriving ballots change the perceived outcome.Most states “want to avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election,” Kavanaugh wrote. “And those states also want to be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night, or as soon as possible thereafter.”Although Trump is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in national polls, the race is tighter in Wisconsin and other swing states that will determine who wins and are the focus of the two campaigns. Two other pivotal states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, are awaiting Supreme Court action in cases raising similar issues.Kavanaugh’s vote -- and those of fellow Trump appointees Barrett and Neil Gorsuch -- could be crucial in any post-election dispute. With Chief Justice John Roberts showing less willingness to second-guess state election decisions, Trump could need the support of all three of his appointed justices to overturn election results that seem to favor Biden.All three Democratic appointees dissented Monday night. Writing for the group, Justice Elena Kagan blasted Kavanaugh’s word choice, as well as his reasoning.“There are no results to ‘flip’ until all valid votes are counted,” Kagan wrote for herself and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. “And nothing could be more suspicious or improper than refusing to tally votes once the clock strikes 12 on election night.”The court’s decision Monday means ballots must be received by Election Day to count in Wisconsin. Democrats were seeking to revive an extension that had been ordered by a federal trial judge because of the Covid outbreak and then blocked by an appeals court.Kagan said the worsening pandemic in Wisconsin means that without the extension voters would have to “opt between braving the polls, with all the risk that entails, and losing their right to vote.” Kavanaugh countered that the high court order wouldn’t disenfranchise any voter who had adequately planned ahead.The dueling opinions, however, went well beyond the Wisconsin circumstances. Kavanaugh embraced a legal theory that could let Republican-controlled state legislatures override results certified by Democratic officials. That argument, developed by three conservative justices in the 2000 Bush v. Gore case, says the Supreme Court should intervene in a presidential election dispute even when a state court is interpreting its own laws.Citing that opinion, Kavanaugh pointed to a constitutional provision that says state legislatures get to determine how electors are appointed to the Electoral College, the body that formally selects the U.S. president.“The text of the Constitution requires federal courts to ensure that state courts do not rewrite state election laws,” Kavanaugh wrote. He was one of three current justices, including Roberts and Barrett, who worked as lawyers for Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 election fight.Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan all have Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors, creating the possibility those states could send duelling slates of electors to the Electoral College in the event of a disputed election.Kavanaugh’s opinion doesn’t necessarily mean he would invalidate votes that arrive after Election Day in states where extensions are in place, said Edward Foley, director of the election law program at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law.“There’s a due process principle, at least that’s recognized by lower courts,” Foley said. “You’re not supposed to change rules governing elections after ballots have been cast. That might come into play.”The Kavanaugh opinion nonetheless left many liberals alarmed at the growing possibility of a replay of Bush v. Gore, when the Supreme Court reversed the Florida Supreme Court and stopped ballot recounts that might have led to Democrat Al Gore’s election.Kavanaugh “signaled that at least some of the conservative justices are willing to stop both state and federal courts, and state agencies, from easing voting restrictions and fixing voting problems when doing so deviates from the wishes of the state legislature,” said Rick Hasen, a election-law expert who teaches at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.Gorsuch expressed views similar to Kavanaugh’s, if in less detail. “The Constitution provides that state legislatures -- not federal judges, not state judges, not state governors, not other state officials -- bear primary responsibility for setting election rules,” Gorsuch wrote in an opinion Kavanaugh joined.Kavanaugh’s and Gorsuch’s opinions distinguished them from Roberts. Although Roberts joined the majority in the Wisconsin case, he wrote his own opinion to explain why he previously voted to allow an extra three days for ballots to arrive in Pennsylvania. The court split 4-4 in that case last week, leaving the extension intact for the time being.Roberts said the difference was that the Pennsylvania case involved a state court applying its own constitution.“Different bodies of law and different precedents govern these two situations and require, in these particular circumstances, that we allow the modification of election rules in Pennsylvania but not Wisconsin,” he wrote Monday.Pennsylvania Republicans have now filed a new request to block the extension, aiming to take advantage of Barrett’s arrival on the court.Barrett, who began work as a justice Tuesday after taking the second of two required oaths, could now be positioned to cast the deciding vote in a 2020 version of Bush v. Gore. The dynamic “is putting Justice Barrett on the spot to make that decision,” Foley said.Although Democrats have called on Barrett to disqualify herself from Trump-related election cases, she has given no indication she will do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-lays-out-path-to-help-donald-trump-win-a-contested-race/story-vUKDqVk8PZ3yBPNxBWA6MP.html
28-10-2020||World||China: Coronavirus epicenter Hubei lags as regional growth picks up||Most Chinese provincial economies regained the ground they lost in the first half of the year, with the notable exception of Hubei, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged in its capital Wuhan.Hubei’s gross domestic product shrank 10.4% in the first three quarters compared with the same period last year, according to data released by the provincial statistics bureau. It was among only four of China’s 29 provinces that reported year-to-date contractions in the nine-month period.China’s recovery from the pandemic picked up pace in the third quarter, taking GDP in the nine-month period to 0.7% as the economy regained the ground it lost in the early months of the year. The regions largely mirror that outcome, with inland provinces like Guizhou and Gansu posting the strongest recoveries.Hubei’s economy -- which in the first quarter plunged 39.2% from a year ago as Wuhan was placed under quarantine -- has a long way to go to reach full-year growth. But momentum is clearly picking up, with GDP expanding sequentially about 74% and 11% in the second and third quarters, respectively, according to Bloomberg calculations.​Authorities have rolled out measures to stimulate growth in Hubei, including giving out 500 million yuan ($74.5 million) in shopping vouchers, doling out cash to some households, and providing tax breaks until the end of the year. The national government also promised to expand free-trade zones in Hubei province to lure investment back to the region.​Inner Mongolia, northeastern Liaoning and Heilongjiang were the other three provinces to post contractions in the nine months through September from a year earlier. The city of Tianjin, a key port city in the north, made up all its GDP losses in the first half of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-coronavirus-epicenter-hubei-lags-as-regional-growth-picks-up/story-FLQ5dvC5GJcHQ6ay8k9AgK.html
28-10-2020||World||Satellite photos show construction at Iran nuclear site||Iran has begun construction at its Natanz nuclear facility, satellite images released Wednesday show, just as the United Nation’s(UN) nuclear agency acknowledged Tehran is building an underground advanced centrifuge assembly plant after its last one exploded in a reported sabotage attack last summer.The construction comes as the US nears Election Day in a campaign pitting President Donald Trump, whose maximum pressure campaign against Iran has led Tehran to abandon all limits on its atomic program, and Joe Biden, who has expressed a willingness to return to the accord. The outcome of the vote is likely to decide which approach America takes. Heightened tensions between Iran and the US nearly ignited a war at the start of the year.Since August, Iran has built a new or regraded road to the south of Natanz toward what analysts believe is a former firing range for security forces at the enrichment facility, images from San Francisco-based Planet Labs show. A satellite image Monday shows the site cleared away with what appears to be construction equipment there.Analysts from the James Martin Centre for Non-Proliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies say they believe that site is undergoing excavation.“That road also goes into the mountains so it may be the fact that they’re digging some kind of structure that’s going to be out in front and that there’s going to be a tunnel in the mountains,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert at the institute who studies Iran’s nuclear program. “Or maybe that they’re just going to bury it there.”Iran’s mission to the UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television last month that the destroyed above ground facility was being replaced with one “in the heart of the mountains around Natanz.”Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA), told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his inspectors were aware of the construction. He said Iran had previously informed IAEA inspectors, who continue to have access to Iran’s sites despite the collapse of the nuclear deal.“It means that they have started, but it’s not completed. It’s a long process,” Grossi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-photos-show-construction-at-iran-nuclear-site/story-wJP6wnIl1zHeNZvrqEI9yK.html

India has formed such pacts with approximately 18 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-bars-air-india-flights-for-fourth-time-as-passengers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-c5AKvRinHeLgCxBVwY1xKL.html
28-10-2020||World||Sex cult founder Keith Raniere sentenced to 120 years in prison||Keith Raniere, the founder of the cult-like group NXIVM where women were kept on starvation diets, branded with his initials, and ordered to have sex with him, was sentenced on Tuesday to 120 years in prison following his conviction for sex trafficking and other crimes.The sentence was imposed by US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, after a hearing where 15 former NXIVM members spoke out against Raniere, 60. Garaufis said “no words can adequately express the lasting pain” Raniere caused his victims.He also fined Raniere $1.75 million, the maximum allowed by the law.“I do believe strongly that I’m innocent of these crimes,” Raniere said before being sentenced. He said some of the victims’ statements were false, but that he was “truly sorry” for causing them pain.“It is our sincere hope that today’s sentence does deliver some measure of justice to those victims,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme, whose office prosecuted the case, said after the sentencing. “Keith Raniere will not be able to victimize people anymore.”Federal prosecutors had sought a life sentence for Raniere for crimes he committed as the leader of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based near Albany, New York.Marc Agnifilo, Raniere’s attorney, asked for just 20 years, saying his client did not mean to hurt anyone. Agnifilo said the sentence should take into account Raniere’s “perspective,” drawing a sharp rebuke from Garaufis. “We’re not sentencing him based on a perspective,” the judge said. “We’re sentencing him based on his behavior.”The victims, most of whom were women, described what they called Raniere’s devastating impact on their lives. The first speaker, identified in court only as Camila, recounted a 12-year sexual relationship with Raniere starting when she was 15 and he was 45.“He screwed with my mind for so long that trying to find the strength and clarity to tell my story has been a slow and painful journey,” Camila said.Her sister Daniela, who testified at the trial about her own abusive relationship with Raniere, called Raniere “pathetic” and said he “deserves no mercy.”Their brother Adrian and mother Adriana, who were also part of NXIVM, lamented how his father and oldest sister remained loyal to Raniere.“Before being part of NXIVM, my family was close,” Adrian said. “He destroyed my family.”Another former member, the actress India Oxenberg, told Raniere at the hearing: “You stole seven years of my life that I’ll never get back.”Jurors convicted Raniere in June 2019 of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and possession of child pornography in the form of photos of 15-year-old Camila, among other crimes, following extensive testimony from former NXIVM members.Prosecutors said Raniere created a secret sorority within NXIVM called DOS, where female “slaves” turned over nude photos and other compromising materials that could be used for blackmail if they tried to leave.More than 50 people wrote letters to Garaufis urging leniency for Raniere, including Camila’s and Daniela’s father, Hector. Many said NXIVM classes, which could cost thousands of dollars, had greatly improved their lives.“I find Hector’s letter in support of the man who abused his own daughters a disgrace,” Garaufis said.Several other people affiliated with NXIVM have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.They included Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, actress Allison Mack, former NXIVM President Nancy Salzman and her daughter Lauren Salzman, who became a star prosecution witness.Bronfman was accused of helping bankroll NXIVM, and was sentenced last month to more than six years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sex-cult-founder-keith-raniere-sentenced-to-120-years-in-prison/story-Cyv8hquZrcKCBML6UiKxDN.html
28-10-2020||World||China snaps at US, says LAC faceoff with India is a bilateral issue||China on Wednesday said the Sino-India boundary dispute is a bilateral matter under negotiation and described Washington’s efforts to push the Indo-Pacific policy as an “outdated cold war strategy”.The Chinese foreign ministry was reacting to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s remarks in New Delhi on Tuesday that the US stands with India on the ongoing military faceoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The border affairs between China and India are things between the two countries. Now the situation across the border is generally stable and the two sides are in resolving relevant issues through consultations and negotiations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said at the regular ministry briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.Wang was responding to a question on Pompeo pushing for closer ties with India in the backdrop of the Sino-India border conflict.On Tuesday, referring to the Indian soldiers who were killed in Galwan Valley on June 15, Pompeo said Washington will stand with New Delhi to protect its sovereignty.Actual numbers are hard to come by but both militaries are said to have deployed thousands of soldiers at multiple friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh in the longest – since May – and worst military faceoff in decades.Criticising, and focusing on, Washington rather than on India, Wang said: “We always believe that the development of bilateral relations between any countries should be conducive to peace and stability and development of the region. It should not harm the interests of a third party.”“In meantime, any concept for regional development should be in line with the trend of the times for peaceful development and win-win cooperation. The Indo-Pacific strategy proposed by the US is preaching outdated cold war mentality and preaching confrontation and geopolitical game.”Beijing perceives the Indo-Pacific strategy, involving the US, India, Japan and Australia and aimed at freedom of maritime navigation, as a move to counter its influence in the region, critical because of sea trade routes. Wang added: “It is aimed to uphold the hegemony of the US. This runs counter to the common interest of the region and we urge the US to stop this.”Wang continued to criticise the US when asked about Pompeo’s visit to Sri Lanka where he is expected to influence the leadership in Colombo against Beijing.“I just responded to a question concerning Pompeo’s remarks in India. I want to add that forcing small and medium-sized countries to pick sides is a habitual behaviour of certain US politicians.”The spokesperson referred to a Lankan foreign ministry statement that said Colombo will handle its foreign relations in accordance with the wishes of its citizens and relevant laws and not of foreign powers.“Sri Lanka and China are traditional friendly neighbours. We have been conducting friendly cooperation on the basis of equal-footed negotiations and mutual benefit which brings tangible benefits to the two people. This will never be altered by any smears or slanders by other people or other countries.”“We will work with Sri Lanka to expand and deepen our strategic cooperative partnership, to bring more benefits for our people and to contribute to regional peace, stability and development,” Wang added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-snaps-at-us-says-lac-faceoff-with-india-is-bilateral-issue/story-ZXRv4faHBIXo2li1vpgUbI.html
28-10-2020||World||Donald Trump slams media for ‘blocking’ alleged graft cases against his rival Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump has slammed the mainstream American media and big tech companies for blocking the alleged corruption charges against his opponent Democratic challenger Joe Biden.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020They have accused each other of serious corruption charges during the election campaigning, with the president alleging that Biden got USD 3.5 million from Russia and it came through Russian President Vladimir Putin because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow. Biden has denied the allegations. Trump, before leaving for a campaign trail on Tuesday, told reporters at the White House that the mainstream media was not showing corruption against Biden. “Nobody has ever seen anything like we’re witnessing right now. I think it’s a very sad time and it’ll go down as a very sad era for the media and certainly for big tech (companies). “I think what is going on with all of those companies -- I think they’ve hurt themselves very badly because they’ve been so restrictive… when they don’t want to show corruption, like you have with Biden -- that’s totally corruption and everybody knows it -- and they’re trying to protect, because he can make them wealthier, whereas they understand me,” Trump said. “They understand where I’m coming from. It’s very unfair. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It’s not freedom of the press… it’s the opposite. And, of course, the media is in the same bag,” said the president. At a separate election rally in the battleground State of Wisconsin, his eldest son Donald Trump Jr alleged that the media and the big tech companies are now campaigning on behalf of Biden and the Democratic Party.Also read | Twitter flags Donald Trump’s tweet on mail-in ballots over ‘disputed’ content The mainstream media today is indulging in censorship, he said, alleging that they are not letting any negative news against Biden and his family getting out. “Your First Amendment is on the table. They will do everything they can to silence you. It is a point of no return,” he said, accusing social media of backing Democrats. The president’s son said that the Democratic Party no longer represents America’s hard-working men and women as it is now pushing for socialism and Marxism. Launching a scathing attack on the opposition party and Biden and his running mate California senator Kamala Harris, he urged the Republican supporters to help re-elect his father. “And when we win, we can not only make ‘America Great Again’, but also we can make ‘liberals cry again’,” he told hundreds of cheering supporters in this small city of Wisconsin on Tuesday. Trump Jr has been campaigning across the states, making multiple stops seeking vote for his father. Like his father, his talking points remains the same such as the achievement of the Trump administration, Covid-19, corruption and the left liberals that now dominate the Democratic Party. He prominently compares himself with Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who has been facing serious corruption charges. It is in this context that he launched a scathing attack against the mainstream media and the big tech companies who he alleges have double standards: one for the Trump family and the other for the Biden family. “Our freedom is under attack. The Democratic Party used to represent the hard-working men and women across the country. That Party is no more. That party is gone. We think of the things that they’re pushing these days. What other than socialism and Marxism? What are their priorities? It’s not that hard-working men and women of this country. “This is not your grand-parents Democratic Party. This is not your parents Democratic Party. It’s a party of AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ), Rasheeda Talib, Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris. Who’s going to be in charge folks. You realise they want to use Joe Biden as the camouflage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-slams-media-for-blocking-alleged-graft-cases-against-his-rival-joe-biden/story-u2aMQaT0DcJ0Chxkz3aAIJ.html
28-10-2020||World||London’s Heathrow Airport no longer Europe’s busiest air hub||London’s Heathrow Airport says it has lost its place as Europe’s busiest air hub to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris after the Covid-19 pandemic grounded flights and Britain failed to approve passenger testing that could scale back quarantine requirements.Heathrow said Wednesday that it expects passenger numbers to fall more than previously forecast this year and rebound more slowly in 2021.The airport now expects to serve 22.6 million passengers this year and 37.1 million in 2021, down from a June forecast of 29.2 million and 62.8 million. The forecast for this year represents at 72% drop from 2019.Commercial aviation plunged this year as governments implemented travel restrictions and passengers cancelled flights amid efforts to control the spread of Covid-19. Some countries have sought to revive the market by implementing passenger testing regimes that reduce or eliminate the need for quarantines.Despite pressure from the travel industry, Britain still requires travellers from most countries to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival, making most business and leisure travel impractical.“The UK’s hub airport is no longer the busiest airport in Europe, competitors such as Charles de Gaulle have exceeded us in terms of passenger numbers as they benefit from a testing regime,” Heathrow said in a statement. “Without a rapid move to testing, the UK will fall even further behind its European competitors and the economic recovery will fail to get off the ground.”Heathrow on Wednesday reported a pre-tax loss of 1.52 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) for the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of 76 million pounds in the same period of 2019. Revenue plunged 59% to 2.3 billion pounds.The number of passengers using Heathrow during those nine months fell 69% to 19 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heathrow-loses-claim-to-being-europe-s-biggest-airport/story-4zKyqWRDFM6C8PNrwufuJJ.html

28-10-2020||World||Covid: Japan PM Suga to announce plan for new stimulus package to ease pandemic pain||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will announce next week a plan for fresh stimulus to help the recession-stricken economy shake off the coronavirus crisis, four government and ruling party sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Although the size of the package has yet to be decided, some ruling party lawmakers have already called for one of about 10 trillion yen ($95.51 billion) to cushion the blow from the pandemic.The bulk of the package will consist of about 7 trillion yen left over from a 10 trillion yen pool set aside to meet emergency needs to combat the pandemic, the sources told Reuters. The rest will be made up of new spending, they added.The total size of the package will likely be smaller than a combined $2.2 trillion rolled out in two earlier stimulus packages this year, they said.“It’s better to avoid making Japan’s fiscal cliff even steeper” by ramping up near-term spending too much, one of the sources said.The package is likely to include extensions to existing programmes offering subsidies to help companies keep jobs and address funding strains, the sources said.The government is also expected to extend past January a campaign offering discounts to domestic travel to rescue the country’s tourism industry, the sources said.A third extra budget will be compiled around mid-December to fund part of the package, they added.After posting its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, Japan’s economy is expected to have rebounded in the three months through September.But the recovery has been patchy and fragile, as continued weakness in consumption and capital expenditure offset a rebound in exports and output, keeping policymakers under pressure to top up fiscal and monetary support.Analysts, however, say the expected new stimulus package will have only a limited effect in boosting growth.“The size of the package isn’t expected to be that large,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “That means the measures will likely focus on putting a floor on growth, rather than stimulating the economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-japan-pm-suga-to-announce-plan-for-new-stimulus-package-to-ease-pandemic-pain/story-hdwGuwmiRgdVXPh1vIxdeO.html
28-10-2020||World||Early Covid-19 vaccines may be imperfect: UK Vaccine Taskforce||UK Vaccine Taskforce Chair Kate Bingham said on Tuesday that the first generation of Covid-19 vaccines “is likely to be imperfect” and that they “might not work for everyone”.“However, we do not know that we will ever have a vaccine at all. It is important to guard against complacency and over-optimism”, Bingham wrote in a piece published in The Lancet medical journal. Also Read: Genes may decide the coronavirus disease path | Opinion“The first generation of vaccines is likely to be imperfect, and we should be prepared that they might not prevent infection but rather reduce symptoms, and, even then, might not work for everyone or for long,” she added.Bingham wrote that the Vaccine Taskforce recognises that “many, and possibly all, of these vaccines could fail”, adding the focus has been on vaccines that are expected to elicit immune responses in the population older than 65 years.She said that the global manufacturing capacity for vaccines is vastly inadequate for the billions of doses that are needed and that the United Kingdom’s manufacturing capability to date has been “equally scarce”.Earlier on Tuesday, a study by scientists at Imperial College London found that antibodies against the novel coronavirus declined rapidly in the British population during the summer, suggesting protection after infection may not be long lasting and raising the prospect of waning immunity in the community.The Telegraph newspaper reported that the British government is working on the assumption that the second wave of coronavirus will be more deadly than the first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-covid-19-vaccines-may-be-imperfect-uk-vaccine-taskforce/story-4TOkSKowTIi6e5aQ2zzO1L.html
28-10-2020||World||Australia’s second-largest city ends 111-day Covid-19 lockdown||Coffee business owner Darren Silverman pulled his van over and wept when he heard on the radio that Melbourne’s pandemic lockdown would be largely lifted on Wednesday after 111 days.Silverman was making a home delivery Monday when the announcement was made that restrictions in Australia’s second-largest city would be relaxed. He was overwhelmed with emotions and a sense of relief.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“The difficulty over the journey, when you’ve put 30 years of your life into something that’s suddenly taken away with the prospect of not returning through no fault of your own — I felt like I could be forgiven for pulling over and having a bit of a sob to myself,” he said.According to the Victoria state government the lockdown changes will allow 6,200 retail stores, 5,800 cafés and restaurants, 1,000 beauty salons and 800 pubs to reopen, impacting 180,000 jobs.Crowds on the city’s streets — where mask wearing remains compulsory — were still thin Wednesday since Melbourne residents are still restricted to travelling no more than 25 kilometers (16 miles) from home and most of the city’s office blocks remain empty as work-from-home orders continue.And while there were pedestrians on the downtown Bourke Street Mall, it was also clear from the number of now empty shops that many retail outlets and eateries did not survive the lockdown, the city’s second since the pandemic began.But many that are left are reporting record demand from the city’s pandemic weary residents, with some restaurants already fully booked a month in advance now that they are no longer restricted to takeout.“People are anxious to get out, to be able to sit outside at a table and have a cup of a coffee or something to eat,” café owner Maria Iatrou said. “People are really enjoying it and it’s going to be a bit of a crush for the next few weeks while people get that out of their system.”The lockdown had been particularly tough on those in Melbourne because the rest of Australia beyond Victoria successfully contained second waves of infections without increasing restrictions. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews faced enormous pressure from businesses and the federal government to reopen for the sake of the economy.Andrews resisted until Monday, when he announced the relaxation hours after the state recorded no new infections in the latest 24-hour period. It was the first time Melbourne had gone a day without a new infection since June 9 and the milestone was celebrated on social media as Donut Day.Tuesday was another Donut Day, Melbourne’s first consecutive days with no new infections since March 5 and 6. Two new cases were reported on Wednesday, but they were infected by known cases and were already in isolation.Andrews thanked the retail and hospitality industries for working with his government to safely reopen.“They know and understand deep down that we’ve all got to be Covid-safe, we’ve all got to follow the rules to protect staff, to protect customers, but also to protect this fragile thing that we’ve all built,” Andrews said, referring to containment of the virus.Iatrou said the lockdown was difficult both professionally and personally. Her café struggled through by selling takeout and delivery. Even worse, she lost her uncle and godmother to Covid-19 and could not attend their funerals because of pandemic restrictions.They were in aged care, where most of Victoria’s 819 coronavirus deaths have been recorded. Only 88 people have died of Covid-19 elsewhere in Australia.“Unless you were here, it’s difficult to understand what kind of a toll it does have on you,” Iatrou said of the lockdown. “It’s a strain to get through most days.”Mary Poulakis said she’s thrilled to have reopened the upscale clothing boutique she’s owned for 35 years in suburban Coburg. She also said there’s no way she would obey a third lockdown.“It’s been tumultuous. It’s been like a roller coaster. You’re up, you’re down. You’re open, you’re closed. You’re on, you’re off,” Poulakis said.“I’m staying open. I cannot close my doors again,“ she added.Silverman, the coffee business owner, said he was pleased to be open again not just for business reasons, but for the mental well-being of staff, some of whom had been isolating alone at home for months.His business has been able to sell wholesale coffee to cafes and online, but he says his downtown café though now open will struggle until office workers return.“We’re told that stay-at-home order in terms of office workers will probably be in place for the foreseeable future, certainly into the New Year, which is going to make life in the C.B.D. for retailers and hospitality very, very difficult,” he said, referring to Melbourne’s central business district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-second-largest-city-ends-111-day-covid-19-lockdown/story-mE7gG6p8ZKhxu7efQz7s4K.html
28-10-2020||World||Louisiana braces for third hurricane strike this year as ‘Zeta’ approaches||Louisiana braced Wednesday for what is expected to be its third hurricane strike this year as Zeta, the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season, headed toward an expected landfall south of New Orleans.Zeta raked across the Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday, striking as a hurricane, before weakening to a tropical storm. It’s forecast to regain hurricane strength before hitting the Gulf Coast sometime Wednesday evening.Hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, along the Mississippi coast to the Alabama state line. Late Tuesday, the storm had sustained winds of 65 mph (105 kph) and was centered 410 miles (655 kilometers) south-southwest of the Mississippi River’s mouth.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards asked President Donald Trump for a disaster declaration ahead of the storm. He and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey both declared emergencies, as did Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich in Biloxi, Mississippi. Trump declared an emergency for Louisiana Tuesday evening.“There’s no doubt that we’ve seen a lot this year, with Covid and so many threats from so many storms,” Gilich said in a news release, “but this storm shows that we haven’t seen it all yet.” The storm approached as New Orleans officials announced that a turbine that generates power to the city’s aging drainage pump system broke down Sunday, with no quick repair in sight. There was enough power to keep the pumps operating if needed but it left authorities with little excess power to tap should a breakdown of other turbines occur, officials said at a news conference with Mayor LaToya Cantrell.Officials said they were running through contingencies to provide power and make repairs where needed should there be other equipment problems. Forecasts, meanwhile, called for anywhere from 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the New Orleans area. Officials noted that Zeta is expected to be a relatively fast-moving storm, possibly mitigating the flood threat.Zeta broke the record for the previous earliest 27th Atlantic named storm that formed Nov. 29, 2005. It’s also the 11th hurricane of the season. An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms.The extraordinarily busy hurricane season has focused attention on the role of climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.Louisiana has been hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes: Laura, blamed for at least 27 Louisiana deaths after it struck in August, and Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area just weeks later. New Orleans has been in the warning area for potential tropical cyclones seven times this year but has seen them veer to the east or west.“I don’t think we’re going to be as lucky with this one,” city emergency director Colin Arnold said.Another approaching storm piled on more worries for evacuees from previous hurricanes. The state is sheltering about 3,600 evacuees from Laura and Delta, most in New Orleans area hotels.“I’m physically and mentally tired,” a distraught Yolanda Lockett of Lake Charles said, standing outside a New Orleans hotel.Meanwhile, many along the coast renewed an unwanted ritual of preparation.On Dauphin Island, off the Alabama coast, workers at Dauphin Island Marina prepared for Zeta, although there was little left to protect after Hurricane Sally hit in September.“We don’t have any docks or fuel pumps at this point. Sally took it all out,” employee Jess Dwaileebe said.In Louisiana’s coastal St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, Robert Campo readied his marina, again, for an approaching storm. “We’re down for four or five days, that’s four or five days nobody’s fishing. That’s four or five days nobody is shrimping. That’s four or five days, no economic wheels are turning,” he said.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Thomas Hymel, an extension agent in Jeanerette with the LSU Agricultural Center, said of this year’s series of storms and other troubles. He said the storms have meant more than a month of down time for seafood harvesters, many of whom are suffering a drop in demand from restaurants due to the coronavirus pandemic.

28-10-2020||World||Turkish leaders condemn Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Erdogan||Turkish officials on Wednesday railed against French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo over its cover-page cartoon mocking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and accused it of sowing “the seeds of hatred and animosity.”The cartoon could further heighten tensions between Turkey and France, which erupted over French President Emmanuel Macron’s firm stance against Islamism following the beheading of a teacher who showed his class caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad for a free speech class.The Prophet cartoons upset many in the Muslim world. But it was Erdogan who led the charge against France and questioned Macron’s mental state. France then recalled its ambassador to Turkey for consultations, a first in French-Turkish diplomatic relations.“We strongly condemn the publication concerning our president of the French magazine, which has no respect to faith, the sacred and values,” Erdogan’s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, wrote on Twitter.Kalin said: “The aim of these publications, that are devoid of morality and decency, is to sow seeds of hatred and animosity. To turn freedom of expression into hostility towards religion and belief can only be the product of a sick mentality.”The cartoon depicted Erdogan in his underwear holding a drink and lifting the skirt of a woman wearing an Islamic dress.“I condemn this incorrigible French rag’s immoral publication concerning our president,” Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. “I call on the moral and conscientious international community to speak out against this disgrace.”Macron’s stance sparked anti-France protests in Turkey and in other Muslim countries as well as calls for the boycott of French good.Tensions between France and Turkey have mounted in recent months over Turkish actions in Syria, Libya and the Caucasus Mountains region of Nagorno-Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-leaders-condemn-charlie-hebdo-cartoon-of-erdogan/story-Q3sxYvHBwOtudNdzgwr03K.html
28-10-2020||World||Mike Pompeo brings Trump administration’s ‘anti-China’ campaign to Sri Lanka, Maldives||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday brought the Trump administration’s anti-China campaign to two Indian Ocean island nations considered particularly at risk for what American officials allege is Chinese exploitation.Pompeo is visiting Sri Lanka and the Maldives to press the two countries to be on guard against potential predatory lending and investment by China. He was making the case less than a week before the American election in which President Donald Trump is seeking to paint his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as weak on China and beholden to it.Even before Pompeo arrived in Sri Lanka, China had fired back at the US message, accusing Washington of bullying smaller nations. Pompeo, who will also visit the Maldives and Indonesia, will press each nation to push back against increasing Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.US officials complain development and infrastructure projects benefit China more than the presumed recipients — a refrain Pompeo repeated with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. Pompeo said the country could be “a beacon” for freedom and democracy in the region as long as it retained its “full sovereignty.”“That is quite a contrast to what China seeks,” Pompeo said. “The Chinese Communist Party is a predator. The United States comes in a different way. We come as a friend and a partner.”Gunawardena appeared unwilling to get involved in the spat with China, and said Sri Lanka is willing to cooperate with all friendly countries.“Sri Lanka is a neutral, non-aligned country committed to peace,” he said. “We hope to continue in our relations with the United States and with other parties.”Earlier this month, Beijing announced it would provide Sri Lanka with a $90-million grant to help rural development, after President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa sought help from a visiting Chinese delegation in disproving a perception that China-funded megaprojects are “debt traps.”China considers Sri Lanka to be a critical link in its massive “Belt and Road” global infrastructure building initiative and has provided billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade. The projects include a seaport, airport, port-city, highways and power stations.Critics like the US say that the Chinese-funded projects are not financially viable and that Sri Lanka will face difficulties in repaying the loans.In 2017, Sri Lanka leased out a Chinese-built port located near busy shipping routes to a Chinese company for 99 years to recover from the heavy burden of repaying the Chinese loan the country received to build it.Ahead of Pompeo’s arrival in Colombo, the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka denounced his visit, accusing one of his top aides of making unacceptable threats against the country. In those comments, the top U.S. diplomat for South Asia, Dean Thompson, urged Sri Lanka “to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity.”The Chinese Embassy said the comments were a “blatant violation” of diplomatic protocols and also chided the US for organizing Pompeo’s 24-hour visit and imposing a major logistical burden on the country, which. like much of the rest of the world is in the midst of a spiraling surge in coronavirus cases.“Does this approach truly prove your respect to the host country? Is it helpful to local epidemic prevention and control? Is it in the interests of the Sri Lankan people?” the embassy said in a statement.The US-China tug-of-war plays out against concerns that the Sri Lankan government is backsliding on democratic reforms. Last week, Parliament by a large majority approved a constitutional amendment concentrating powers under Rajapaksa and reversing efforts a previous government had made to curb authoritarianism.With the change, Rajapaksa will be able to hold ministries, as well as appoint and sack ministers. He will also be the appointing authority of the elections, public service, police, human rights, bribery or corruption investigation commissions.In his meeting with Rajapaska, Pompeo “stressed the importance of strengthening democratic governance, human rights protections, and of fundamental freedoms to ensure long-term stability and prosperity,” the State Department said in a statement.Sri Lanka has been ruled under a powerful executive presidential system since 1978, but a reformist government in 2015 clipped much of the president’s powers and gave them over to Parliament and independent commissions, saying successive presidents had been more authoritarian.Pompeo arrived in Sri Lanka late Tuesday from India, where he and Defense Secretary Mark Esper had stepped up the Trump administration’s anti-China message by playing on Indian suspicions about the Chinese to shore up a regional front against Beijing in the Indo-Pacific.Just hours before the meetings in New Delhi began, the Trump administration notified Congress of plans for a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan — the second major arms sale in two weeks to the democratic island that Beijing regards as a renegade province. China angrily reacted to the first sale by announcing sanctions on US defense contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-brings-trump-administration-s-anti-china-campaign-to-sri-lanka-maldives/story-K8IvFU3eI0uVfJnQTjFAiP.html

A baby girl had earlier been found in a trash can at the airport, concealed in a plastic bag in what “appeared to be a shocking and appalling attempt to kill her,” the Qatari government’s communications office said in a statement.“While the aim of the urgently decided search was to prevent the perpetrators of the horrible crime from escaping, the State of Qatar regrets any distress or infringement on the personal freedoms of any traveler caused by this action,” the statement said. The baby, whose mother has not been located, is safe and receiving medical care in Doha, it added.Australian officials told a government committee hearing in Canberra on Wednesday that in addition to 18 women on a Qatar Airways flight to Sydney, another nine flights had been searched and Australia was working closely with other countries on the issue, without naming the countries.“Other countries affected absolutely share Australia’s views and the strength of Australia’s views,” said Frances Adamson, secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. “This is not by any standard normal behaviour and the Qataris recognise that, are appalled by it, do not want it to happen again.”Australia was notified of the incident by a female Australian diplomat who was on the flight and was “shocked at what happened”, Adamson added. The Australian diplomat was not searched. The results of the investigation will be shared with international partners, the Qatari statement said.“The Qatari investigation is to determine which laws might have been violated, any individuals responsible, and recommend disciplinary and prosecutorial action where appropriate,” a source with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters.Human Rights Watch said in a statement Qatar should prohibit forced gynecological exams, and it was also concerned at the circumstances that may have led to a baby being abandoned. Sexual relations outside of wedlock are criminalised in Qatar, with hospitals required to report pregnant women to authorities.Human Rights Watch senior researcher Rothna Begum said the alleged actions of Qatari authorities had “failed many women – the unknown woman apparently forced to give birth in an airport toilet, unable to ask for assistance with her labour or on what to do with the baby, and the multiple women reportedly pulled off the plane for examinations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-expresses-regret-as-australia-says-women-on-10-flights-searched/story-OC6FIdRysvPNNIFgslIeKI.html
28-10-2020||World||Trump campaign shifts Florida ad spending burden to Republican National Committee||Donald Trump’s campaign has slashed its advertising budget in Florida, relying on the Republican National Committee to carry the message there as the president’s re-election effort moves resources to the industrial northern states that carried him to victory in 2016.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020Since Labor Day, Trump has cut $24 million from his national ad budget, while former Vice President Joe Biden has added $197 million. Biden has outspent Trump three-to-one over that time nationally, according to data compiled from ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics.The president’s campaign still has $350,275 budgeted to spend on ads in Florida through Election Day, but has cancelled $5.5 million in the final two weeks of the campaign, the data showed.The RNC is picking up some of that slack, buying $4 million in ads beginning last week. It’s now airing an ad in Florida attacking Biden on Medicare, falsely claiming that the Biden health care plan would eliminate private health insurance.By comparison, Biden has booked $16.7 million in ads in Florida for the last 15 days of the campaign, compared with $4.3 million for Trump and the RNC, according to Advertising Analytics.The Trump campaign held a call with reporters on Tuesday to discuss Biden’s positions on fracking and the state of play in Pennsylvania. Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said the campaign’s organizational strength in Florida would carry the state into Trump’s column on Election Night as Republicans get more in-person voters to the polls.“We are spending more in Florida, and we are winning big in Florida,” Trump said in a tweet late Tuesday night after a campaign rally in Nebraska.‘Ground Game’“You have to have a ground game. Joe Biden does not have one. The president does,” Murtaugh said. “That’s why you saw the president close the gap in Florida.”Campaigns often lock in advertising time early in the campaign, reserving the best time slots at the lowest rates. They often move that time to other states, stations or time slots as they adjust their strategies.The Trump campaign said publicly available data doesn’t account for all its television spending, which includes local cable systems not included in Advertising Analytics data. The campaign said it has $61 million of television ads already booked through the election.Kaelan Dorr, the Trump campaign’s chief marketing officer, said it is spending six figures on Spanish-language ads, six figures on cable and six figures on radio in Florida.“Our TV budget in the state has remained consistent week by week. We have invested seven figures in the state this week alone. We’re up 4 points in polls, we’re up consistently and we kind of look forward to celebrating with the people on November,” Dorr said.The RNC, however, is now paying for those ads.Biden and Trump are effectively tied in the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the state.About 312,000 more registered Republicans have voted in person in Florida than registered Democrats since early voting began a week ago. But Democrats lead by more than 615,000 votes in mail-in voting, according to the US Elections Project, giving Democrats a 41.8% to 37.1% overall advantage.“Florida is going to go the president’s way,” Murtaugh said.The Trump campaign itself is now placing most of his advertising budget on just four battleground states: Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania, with advertising buys of more than $1 million in each state. Polls show he’s behind in all those states but Ohio, where he and Biden are effectively tied.The Biden campaign has added $41 million to its ad budget in the home stretch, pouring more money into every battleground state except Texas. Through Election Day, the campaign has budgeted $8.3 million in Florida, $7.1 million in Pennsylvania, $5.3 million in Michigan and $4.9 million in North Carolina.In the final week, Biden is set to outspend Trump in every battleground state except for Minnesota and Ohio, where Biden still maintains an overall advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-shifts-florida-ad-spending-burden-to-republican-national-committee/story-aA2zZI07mOudlSr1acM6uK.html
28-10-2020||World||Canada passes 10,000 deaths due to Covid-19 pandemic||Canada’s death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic has crossed 10,000, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warning that if the current trajectory of the winter surge continues, it may well impact family gatherings during the upcoming Christmas season.Fatalities reached 10,000 on Tuesday, with an additional 28 deaths reported in the country, while the total confirmed cases spiked to 222,654, an increase of over 20% over the past fortnight. Some of that was attributed by public health officials to the gatherings to celebrate Thanksgiving in the country on October 12, with the virus being spread during the period and reflecting in the latest uptick in numbers.The Canadian PM said the current second wave conditions in the country “sucks”. Given that context, Trudeau underscored that people’s behaviour in the weeks ahead could dictate how Christmas is observed this year. “Unless we’re really, really careful, there may not be the kinds of family gatherings we want to have at Christmas,” he said, during a media interaction.“It’s going to be a tough winter,” he said, even as the tallies for new infections have recorded new highs in several provinces like Ontario and Quebec in recent days, surpassing single-day numbers during the peak of the coronavirus crisis in spring this year. However, even as cases mount, deaths remain relatively low when compared with March and April.The spike is partly being driven by Covid “fatigue” among younger Canadians, with those in the 20 to 29 bracket accounting for 18% of new cases, the largest group, with nearly 50% of fresh infections being reported from those below the age of 40.However, authorities have also said that more restrictive measures like the sort of lockdowns seen earlier this year are not under consideration at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-passes-10-000-deaths-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-He3OmQGNaM5yahkIZL8d5M.html
28-10-2020||World||Turkey condemns French illustration of Erdogan as tensions flare between two presidents||Top Turkish officials condemned a caricature scorning President Tayyip Erdogan in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, calling it a “disgusting effort” to “spread its cultural racism and hatred”.Turkish anger at the caricature added fuel to a row between Turkey and France about cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, which flared after a teacher who had shown pupils the cartoons in a lesson on freedom of speech was beheaded in France this month.“We strongly condemn the publication concerning our President in the French magazine which has no respect for any belief, sacredness and values,” presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin wrote on Twitter.“They are just showing their own vulgarity and immorality. An attack on personal rights is not humour and freedom expression,” he said.The cartoon on the cover of Charlie Hebdo, showed Erdogan sitting in a white T-shirt and underpants, holding a canned drink along with a woman wearing an Islamic hijab.Turkish presidential communications director Fahrettin Altun said “Macron’s anti-Muslim agenda is bearing fruit!”.“We condemn this most disgusting effort by this publication to spread its cultural racism and hatred,” Altun wrote on Twitter.Erdogan sharply criticised Macron at the weekend, saying the French leader needed a mental health check, prompting France to recall its ambassador from Ankara. On Monday, Erdogan urged a boycott of French products.The Prophet Mohammad cartoons, considered blasphemous by Muslims, have been displayed in France in solidarity and Macron has said he would redouble efforts to stop conservative Islamic beliefs subverting French values, angering many Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-condemns-french-illustration-of-erdogan-as-tensions-flare-between-two-presidents/story-dVb5YCgs98KyAIZn5iLjJK.html
28-10-2020||World||Biden goes on the offensive in Republican country, Trump seeks to defend turf||Democratic candidate Joe Biden went on the offensive on Tuesday with rallies in Georgia, hoping to breach the Republican stronghold and expand the battle ground as President Donald Trump played defence, holding rallies in key states that won him the presidency in 2016.“You know, there aren’t a lot of pundits who would have guessed four years ago that the Democratic candidate for president in 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia one week before Election Day,” Biden told supporters at a drive-in rally in Atlanta, the second of his Georgia rallies.He added: “But we do—because something is happening.”FiveThirtyEight has Biden ahead of Trump by 1.1 percentage points, in the average of polls in Georgia, but RealClearPolitics has him trailing the president by 0.4 points. It’s a tie, in effect, but in a state that has not voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1992, when Bill Clinton took it in a three-way fight in which an independent had split the Republican votes with sitting President George H W Bush.The former vice-president believes he has a chance in Georgia, with down-ballot implications for two Senate races. And as a sign of his growing confidence, he plans to also campaign in Iowa, on Friday, just three days before close of polling — Trump won the state by 9.5 percentage points in 2016 but now trails by a thin margin.The American president held rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin — the two states that won him the presidency in 2016 with Pennsylvania — and Nebraska, a conservative state that comes into play because of its unique system (which it shares only with Maine) of granting electoral college votes by congressional districts, not winner-takes-all.The rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin came amidst a surge in Covid-19 there. The president delivered the same narrative that he has before — he diminished the epidemic claiming it is waning and ridiculed the coverage in the media saying it will be over the day after polling.It’s all about “Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid …” on television now, he said at a rally in Lansing, Michigan, venting his frustration with the epidemic. He also framed the election as a choice between the “Trump recovery” and “Biden depression”, claiming his Democratic rival will shut down the country again, pushing it into depression.Trump is trailing Biden in both Wisconsin and Michigan — by 7.1 percentage points and 8.3 points respectively in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls and by 5.5 points and 9 points in the RealClearPolitics average. His path to victory will shrink dramatically without these states.With just seven days to the close of polling, both candidates deployed their surrogates across the battleground states to keep up the momentum. First Lady Melania Trump addressed her first rally this cycle in Chester, Pennsylvania, the most critical of the key states this election.And former President Barack Obama was in Orlando, Florida, where he launched a scathing attack on Trump. “What’s his closing argument? That people are too focused on Covid,” he said at a rally, referencing the president’s complaints about the epidemic. “He said this at one of his rallies. ‘Covid, Covid, Covid’ he’s complaining,” Obama said. “He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-goes-on-the-offensive-in-republican-country-trump-seeks-to-defend-turf/story-T2qx7XWjQLpuyama6jIDBO.html
28-10-2020||World||Sharp spike in China Covid cases including 22 in Xinjiang||China has reported 42 new cases of Covid-19 including 22 local transmissions, recording the sharpest increase in several weeks, national health authorities said on Wednesday.Tuesday’s tally was sharply up from 16 on Monday, with all the 22 new local cases reported in the past 24 hours from the remote Xinjiang region’s Kashgar prefecture.The national health commission (NHC) and Xinjiang health authorities said the local infections were asymptomatic cases that were re-categorised as confirmed ones.All were reported in Shufu county of Kashgar, the Xinjiang health commission said, adding that 19 new asymptomatic cases were also reported on Tuesday.By Tuesday night, the autonomous region had completed Covid-19 testing for all 4.75 million people in Kashgar following the recent local cases, state media reported.Apart from the confirmed and asymptomatic cases, the remaining population had tested negative for the disease, Li Linyu from the Kashgar prefectural health commission told a press conference.Li said investigations have shown the new cases have no relation to the cluster in the regional capital of Urumqi in July and source tracing for the new cases in Shufu was underway.Experts have told Chinese state media that the origin of the latest flare-up in Kashgar remains to be determined. An official from the prefecture told the tabloid Global Times that none of the asymptomatic patients had any contact with cold-chain products or with wild animals. A virologist told the tabloid that it is not certain if the virus that caused the Kashgar outbreak was local or imported.“More epidemiological surveys need to be done to find out, such as contact with people from other countries, or international flights,” the tabloid reported.As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 85,868. Of them, 298 patients were still being treated, including four in severe condition.Altogether 80,936 patients had been discharged after recovery, and 4,634 had died of the disease on the mainland, the NHC said in its daily report on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sharp-spike-in-china-covid-cases-including-22-in-xinjiang/story-xbFPqbCWTHsjQdutiz6kyH.html
28-10-2020||World||Social media CEOs to face grilling from Republican senators||Less than a week before Election Day, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google are set to be grilled by Republican senators making unfounded allegations that the tech giants show anti-conservative bias. Democrats want to expand the discussion to include issues such as the companies’ impact on local news.The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives have agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.With the election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech’s social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.Trump, asked by reporters about the companies Tuesday as he left Washington for the campaign trail, said they are trying to suppress revelations of Joe Biden’s “corruption.”“They don’t want to show corruption, like you have with Biden. That’s totally corruption, and everybody knows it,” Trump said. “It’s very unfair. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. It’s not freedom of the press, it’s the opposite.”Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.Starting Tuesday, Facebook is not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators will examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.The tech platforms are gateways to news online. Critics say their dominant position in the advertising market has crushed the struggling US news industry, especially local news publishers.A report issued Tuesday by the committee’s Democratic staff cited the additional devastating impact of the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. About 7,000 newspaper employees are expected to be laid off this year, and newspaper revenues will be down 70% from two decades ago, according to the report.“Local news is an incredible engine for the creation of accurate information. We don’t want to lose that infrastructure,” Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the panel’s top Democrat, said in an interview.The Democrats’ report accuses the big platforms of unfairly using news content, taking news consumers’ data and diverting customers from local news websites, with little compensation. It proposes that Congress enact rules preventing tech platforms from taking local news content without fair payment.“These unfair and abusive practices should be called out,” Cantwell said.Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the USFacebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views — a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump’s presidential campaign.The Trump administration’s Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies’ limitations “quite concerning.”Trump signed an executive orde r this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law. A provision known as Section 230 has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.“For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the committee chairman, said recently.The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump’s order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency’s previous position.The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-media-ceos-to-face-grilling-from-republican-senators/story-F5jPZTaltSr3ebMrNHGPvI.html
28-10-2020||World||Joe Biden vows his unity can save United States||Joe Biden traveled Tuesday to the hot springs town where Franklin Delano Roosevelt coped with polio to declare the US is not too politically diseased to overcome its health and economic crises, pledging to be the unifying force who can “restore our soul and save this country.”The Democratic presidential nominee offered his closing argument with Election Day just one week away while attempting to go on the political offensive in Georgia, which hasn’t backed a Democrat for the White House since 1992. He promised to be a president for all Americans regardless of party, even as he said that “anger and suspicion is growing and our wounds are getting deeper.”“Has the heart of this nation turned to stone? I don’t think so,” Biden said. “I refuse to believe it.”While Biden worked to expand the electoral map in the South, President Donald Trump focused on the Democrats’ “blue wall” states that he flipped in 2016 — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — and maintained a far busier travel schedule taking him to much more of the country.At a cold, rain-soaked rally in the Michigan capital of Lansing, Trump said that Biden supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, both of which he said hurt the auto industry and other manufacturing in the state.“This election is a matter of economic survival for Michigan,” the president said, arguing that the state’s economy was strong before the coronavirus pandemic hit. “Look what I’ve done.”Trump also cheered Senate candidate John James — who may ultimately have a better chance of winning the state than the president — while attacking Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for moving aggressively to shut down much of the state’s economy to slow the virus’ spread. He even seemed to cast doubt on federal authorities breaking up what they said was a plot to kidnap her, which Whitmer has argued Trump’s “violent rhetoric” helped spark.“It was our people that helped her out with her problem. And we’ll have to see if it’s a problem. Right?” Trump said. “People are entitled to say ‘maybe it was a problem. Maybe it wasn’t.’”Biden, even as he predicted the country could rise above politics, went after his election rival, accusing Trump anew of bungling the federal response to the pandemic that has seen new cases surging in many areas, and failing to manage the economic fallout or combat institutional racism and police brutality that have sparked widespread demonstrations.“The tragic truth of our time is that Covid has left a deep and lasting wound in this country,” Biden said, scoffing at Trump’s pronouncements that the nation is turning a corner on the virus. He charged that the president has “shrugged. He’s swaggered. And he’s surrendered.”Venturing into Georgia was a sign of confidence by the Biden team, which is trying to stretch the electoral map and open up more paths to the needed 270 Electoral College votes. The former vice president plans to travel to Iowa, which Trump took by 10 points in 2016, later in the week. And his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, is hitting Arizona and deep red Texas.Besides Lansing, Trump was traveling to West Salem, Wisconsin. First lady Melania Trump was on the road, too, making her first solo campaign trip of the year in Pennsylvania. And Vice President Mike Pence was in South Carolina, maintaining his campaign schedule despite several close aides testing positive for the coronavirus last weekend. There, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is in a potentially tight reelection race.Hillary Clinton flirted with GOP territory in 2016, only to lose traditional Democratic Midwestern strongholds. But a top Biden adviser rejected the notion that the campaign is spreading itself too thin, noting that the former vice president’s visit follows weeks of paid advertising in Georgia and visits by Harris and the candidate’s wife, Jill Biden.Biden will also visit in coming days Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida, where former President Barack Obama gave a speech in Orlando on Tuesday, blistering Trump as only worrying about the virus because it was dominating news coverage.“He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage,” Obama said. “If he had been focused on Covid from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country this week.”Trump expressed his displeasure that Fox News carried his Democratic predecessor’s speech live, complaining to reporters about it and tweeting the network was “playing Obama’s no crowd, fake speech for Biden.”In Atglen, Pennsylvania, Melania Trump said she was feeling “so much better now,” just weeks after being diagnosed with the virus. She slammed Biden’s “socialist agenda,” praised her husband as “a fighter,” and also commented on the president’s use of social media.“I don’t always agree the way he says things,” she said, drawing laughter from the crowd, “but it is important to him that he speaks directly to the people he serves.”The Trumps left for their campaign trips at the same time, and the president gave the first lady a quick peck on the cheek before they boarded separate planes.The president will also visit Omaha, Nebraska, after a Sunday stop in Maine. That anticipates a razor-thin Electoral College margin since both areas offer one electoral vote by congressional district.While Biden rarely travels to more than one state per day, the Republican president has maintained a whirlwind schedule, focusing on his argument that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus pandemic upended it. Trump is planning a dizzying 11 rallies in the final 48 hours before polls close.His latest swing is also something of a victory lap after the Senate on Monday approved the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to give conservatives a commanding 6-3 advantage on the Supreme Court. Trump has sought to use the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lo animate conservative evangelical and Catholic voters, though the high court fight has been overshadowed by concerns over the coronavirus with cases surging.Biden, meanwhile, is hoping to lift Democrats running for Senate in Georgia and Iowa. He was visiting Atlanta after his address in Warm Springs, where Roosevelt sought treatment while governing a nation weathering the Great Depression and World War II.“This place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed,” Biden said. “That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.”His appearance was meant to bookend his visit earlier this month to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, when Biden used the site of the bloody Civil War battle to issue a call for putting country ahead of party. On Tuesday, he evoked Roosevelt’s New Deal sensitivities to say he could harness the power of the government to move the country forward.“If you give me the honor of serving as your president, clear the decks for action,” he said. “For we will act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-his-unity-can-save-united-states/story-xhUr1X2MYQDnfqB3teX1TN.html
28-10-2020||World||Thailand pro-democracy movement: Student protesters aim for ambitious political change||He was only 7 when he saw his first military coup. He was 15 during the second. Now 21, he is among those at the front of Thailand’s growing pro-democracy movement pushing for sweeping political reforms.And because of his activities, Bunkueanun Paothong has been charged with crimes that could see him jailed for the rest of his life.“I took a stand I know that would be risky,” Bunkueanun said. “I stand firm in my principles and beliefs. Because it’s the right thing for me to do.”Fed up with an archaic educational system and enraged by the military’s efforts to keep control over their nation, the student-led campaign that began earlier this year has shaken Thailand’s ruling establishment with the most significant campaign for political change in years.The protesters have three main demands: They want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s resignation; changes to a constitution that was drafted under military rule; and, most controversially, reforms to the constitutional monarchy.Political protest is nothing new in Thailand, and its past 15 years have been defined by it. Whether it was the red-shirted supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra or his yellow-shirted conservative opponents, some group could be counted on every few years to seize an airport, occupy a government building or blockade a key road in a bid to topple the government.And like clockwork, the courts or the military could be counted on to intervene. Prayuth, a former general, first came to power in a 2014 coup.But never before have protesters made such open calls for the reform of the monarchy in a country where reverence for the royal institution is inculcated from birth and protected by a law that makes defaming senior royals punishable by prison. The calls have infuriated some, resonated with others and most certainly complicated any solution to the latest crisis.“We won’t back down, we won’t retreat and we won’t be open for talks until the government agrees on the three demands,” said Chonticha Changrew, who at 27 is one of the more senior protest organizers.Many of those on the streets spent much of their lives living under military rule, and those old enough to vote got their first real chance last year. They flocked to a new party — Future Forward — whose smart and charismatic young leaders espoused a strong anti-military viewpoint.The party shocked the establishment by winning the third-most seats. The military’s proxy party was able to cobble together a ruling coalition that put Prayuth back in the prime minister’s post. But Future Forward looked like it had room to grow.Then in February, the Constitutional Court ruled Future Forward had violated campaign finance laws, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics for 10 years.The students, already upset at what they saw as an undemocratic constitution that shifted power away from elected politicians to appointed bodies aligned with the military, took to the streets.“What motivates the student protesters is that they see the ‘game’ of politics as being fixed,” said Chris Ankersen, an associate professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs, who previously worked with the U.N. in Bangkok.The initial protests barely had time to spread before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the students retreated. They returned in July, when the virus threat eased, and pushed their core demands of new elections, constitutional changes and an end to intimidation of activists.The protests gathered steam and took a stunning turn in August, when a few students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticized King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany. Among their calls were for greater oversight of royal budgets and an end to the practice of Thai monarchs endorsing military coups.While shocking to many, it emboldened others.Events escalated on Oct. 14 when protesters heckled a royal motorcade that unexpectedly passed nearby. Security personnel stood between the vehicles and the crowd, and there was no visible violence.Nevertheless, Bunkueanun and two others were charged under an obscure criminal statute on committing violence against the queen, who was in one of the vehicles.“I was numbed, dumbstruck, and feared for my life,” Bunkueanun recalled. He turned himself in to police the next day and spent a day in jail before his release on bail.Prayuth and his government responded to the incident and the protests with their tested playbook, declaring a state of emergency for Bangkok that banned gatherings of more than four people and gave authorities other broad powers. That only led to even bigger protests and the government eventually removed the emergency decree to try to ease tensions.Prayuth has said he is open to some changes but has maintained that the monarchy should remain off-limits.“While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands,” he said Monday, opening a special session of Parliament his government called to ease tensions.The students’ questioning of Thailand’s social structure is rooted in their experiences at school, said Thak Chaloemtiarana, a historian who has also been an administrator at Bangkok’s Thammasat University and Cornell University in the U.S.“The current movement, while led by a handful of university students, has attracted younger students who have become politicized through more news and information from the internet and social media, and spurred by how their teachers and school administrators suppress individualism and exercise authoritarian policies that control dress code, haircuts, gender choice, and ceremonies that are seen as originating from feudal times,” he said.In addition to political injustices, Thak said, young people were spurred to action by what they saw as the king’s accumulation of power and wealth with the acquiescence of the military, as well as the military’s needless expenditures during a pandemic-weakened economy.The protesters’ aim at the monarchy has led to counterprotests by royalists who allege the students are being used as pawns by unidentified powers behind the scenes.Unlike previous protests, today’s demonstrators are far younger and have no clear links to any group or party, making them appear untainted by past quarrels, said Allen Hicken, political science professor at the University of Michigan.The government has so far seemed indecisive about how to deal with the protests, torn between trying to placate or punish those involved. Neither approach has lessened the ardor or number of protesters, who adroitly use social media to organize short, quickly announced events that don’t require the infrastructure of past demonstrations.Police use of water cannons and chemical irritants against the young protesters this month drew broad public outrage, so it’s not clear if the government would push a more violent crackdown like those in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.Chonticha is aware history is not on the protesters’ side, but she says in some ways they have already succeeded.“Our movement has changed the perception of Thais toward the monarchy and military,” she said. “If we cannot win this time, we still have planted the seed of criticism of the ruling elite and monarchy in the people’s minds.”___Associated Press journalists Tassanee Vejpongsa and Busaba Sivasomboon contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-pro-democracy-movement-student-protesters-aim-for-ambitious-political-change/story-cduo9bzULg1yI83Npn3gdI.html
28-10-2020||World||Philadelphia police shooting: Had called for ambulance and not police, victim’s kin say||The family of a Black man killed when Philadelphia police officers fired a dozen rounds in a shooting caught on video had called for an ambulance to get him help with a mental health crisis, not for police intervention, their lawyer said Tuesday.Additionally, Walter Wallace’s wife is pregnant and is scheduled to have labor induced in coming days, the lawyer, Shaka Johnson, told reporters from the steps of a family home. Wallace’s father planned a statement later Tuesday, Johnson said.Chief Police Inspector Frank Vanore said earlier at a news conference that police had received a call Monday about a man screaming and that he was armed with a knife.The two officers each fired at least seven rounds — at least 14 total shots — but could not say how many times Wallace, 27, was struck.Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr., earlier told The Philadelphia Inquirer that his son was on medication and struggled with his mental health.“Why didn’t they use a Taser?” he asked.The officers had not been interviewed as of Tuesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. They and their races have not been publicly identified. Neither officer had a Taser or similar device, with Outlaw saying the department has previously asked for funding to equip more officers with those devices.Wallace was shot before 4 p.m. Monday in an episode filmed by a bystander and posted on social media. Witnesses complained that police fired excessive shots.Police arrested at least 91 people during unrest Monday night and Tuesday morning, with three people cited for failing to disperse and about a dozen charged with assault of an officer. Police had previously said 30 officers were injured in the unrest, most of them hit with thrown objects like bricks. One officer was still hospitalized Tuesday with a broken leg after being purposely run over by a pickup truck, police said.Officials with the Fraternal Order of Police, the union representing officers in Philadelphia, said the officer injuries were unacceptable and called for public patience as the investigation into the shooting continued.Officers said they found Wallace holding a knife and ordered him to drop the weapon several times. Wallace advanced toward the officers, who fired several times, said Officer Tanya Little, a police spokesperson.In the video, a woman and at least one man follow Wallace, trying to get him to listen to officers, as he briskly walks across the street and between cars. The woman, identified by family members as Wallace’s mother, screams and throws something at an officer after her son is shot and falls to the ground.The video does not make it clear whether he was in fact holding a knife, but witnesses said he was.Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest, Little said. One of the officers drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.No officers or bystanders were injured in the initial confrontation, Little said. Both were wearing body cameras and were taken off street duty during the investigation.Hundreds of people took to the streets in west Philadelphia into the wee hours of Tuesday, with interactions between protesters and police turning violent at times, the Inquirer reported. Video showed many yelling at officers and crying.Dozens of protesters gathered at a nearby park, chanting “Black lives matter.”Police cars and dumpsters were set on fire as police struggled to contain the crowds. More than a dozen officers, many with batons in hand, formed a line as they ran down 52nd Street. The crowd largely dispersed then.The 52nd Street corridor was also the site of protests against police brutality at the end of May, after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police. Those protests have been the subject of City Council hearings, with protesters describing harsh and unnecessary tactics, including tear gas and projectiles fired by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philadelphia-police-shooting-had-called-for-ambulance-and-not-police-says-victim-s-kin/story-ec5CTf3mU3qBUv1ZR5568O.html
28-10-2020||World||US announces Taiwan defence systems sale||The US on Monday said it had approved a $2.4 billion sale of 100 Harpoon coastal defence systems to Taiwan, defying Beijing’s anger over a $1 billion missile deal last week.The announcement came just hours after Beijing said it would sanction US firms involved in an earlier arms sales to the democratic self-ruled island.The deal involves 100 Harpoon Coastal Defence Systems, which includes 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II surface-launched missiles with a range of around 125 kilometres. The missiles, manufactured by Boeing, can be positioned on fixed platforms or mounted on trucks.The office of Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the sale would “upgrade asymmetric warfare capabilities”.China views Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing said on Tuesday it “firmly opposed” such moves, urging the US to “call off the relevant arms sales plan to Taiwan, so as not to cause further damage to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”.Hong Kong police on Tuesday detained three people under the city’s contentious national security law on suspicion of publishing content to incite others to secede from China. Police said two men and a woman, aged between 17 and 21, were in custody and an investigation was under way. Authorities did not name the suspects but pro-independence group Studentlocalism said three of its members, including Tony Chung, a former leader of the organisation, were among them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-taiwan-defence-systems-sale/story-whdN9uGUxRWRaB0285MZhL.html
28-10-2020||World||New protests loom as Europeans tire of curbs||European governments moved on Tuesday to launch new clampdowns to try to rein in a fresh Covid-19 surge amid protests by people tired of the curbs.World leaders face an increasingly difficult task holding the disease at bay while keeping their economies afloat as they pin their hopes on as-yet unproven vaccines.The US, Russia, France, Sweden, Poland and other countries have registered record numbers of infections in recent days as autumn turns to winter in the Northern Hemisphere and people socialise indoors where the risk of infection is higher.Hundreds of protesters took to the streets across Italy on Monday to vent their anger at the latest round of restrictions, including early closing for bars and restaurants, with demonstrations in some cities turning violent.In Milan, youths hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with volleys of tear gas. In nearby Turin, luxury shops had their windows smashed and some were ransacked, leading to the arrest of 10 rioters. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was expected to approve measures to help companies hit by the new curbs introduced at the weekend after daily infections increased eightfold in less than a month.In France, interior minister Gerald Darmanin warned the country to prepare for “difficult decisions” after some of the strictest restrictions currently in place anywhere in Europe have failed to halt the spread of the disease.The Czech government will ask lawmakers to extend its emergency powers until December 3, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday, as it tries to stem one of the strongest surges in infections in Europe.There have been at least 8.54 million reported infections and 251,000 deaths caused by coronavirus in Europe so far, according to latest Reuters data. The continent registered a record 230,892 new cases on October 26, up from 67,739 on October 1.Authorities in Russia, which with 1.55 million infections has the world’s fourth largest Covid-19 case load, ordered people to wear facemasks in some public places and asked regional authorities to consider shutting bars and restaurants overnight.Even Germany, widely praised for its initial response to the pandemic, signalled concern on Tuesday over rising infections, with officials saying the country was likely to reach 20,000 cases a day by the end of this week.Dr Michael Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said the European Union’s open borders might even need to be shut down again to “take the heat out of this phase of the pandemic.”“There’s no question that the European region is an epicentre of disease right now,” he said.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even more stringent measures should be applied to stop the virus. “If it’s let go freely, it can create havoc, especially when we don’t have vaccines at hand.” Iran on Tuesday again hit a record single-day Covid-19 death toll, reporting 346 new deaths. That brings the country’s total fatalities to 33,299. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said that daily new coronavirus cases have also hit a record, with 6,968 reported. That brings Iran’s total number of infections to 581,824.The remote Kashgar area of China’s Xinjiang region reported 164 asymptomatic Covid-19 cases until Monday night, as a rapid mass testing campaign for over 4.75 million people is underway.All the positive results were traced to the Shufu county of Kashgar prefecture where a 17-year-old girl had tested positive over the weekend||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-protests-loom-as-europeans-tire-of-curbs/story-GyWMLUGWEADw11y9AtRkNN.html
28-10-2020||World||Ahead of Election Day, NYC bikers hit the roads to encourage people to vote||With little more than a week to go for the contentious US presidential election, hundreds of New Yorkers, dressed in grey, biked nearly 23 kilometres from Bronx to Lower East Side as part of an initiative arranged by Brooklyn-based collective Street Riders NYC.The so-called Justice Rides are part of the group’s strategy to encourage people get out and vote. Bronx for instance has reported historically low levels of voter turnout. As they rode through the borough, many residents watched them pass and even participated in the chanting.“The first step in the push for change is to get [Republican President Donald] Trump out of office,” says Peter Kerre, one of the co-founders of Street Riders NYC. The group has been arranging Justice Rides weekly, with next weekend being the last before Election Day on November 3.Boosted by the effects of Covid-19, the US cycling industry has seen “unprecedented growth” with sales increasing by 31% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of the year, according to reports by NPD Group, a market research company. While some use the two-wheelers for leisure and other as a way to commute, bikes have also increasingly become a feature of activism across New York. Their presence was tangible over the summer months as protests against police brutality erupted after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man killed during his arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Kerre, who is of Kenyan heritage and comes from the same town where Floyd was killed, had bought a scooter to commute to work, but found that it came in handy when protests began in New York. “There would be 20-30 protests a day,” Kerre tells HT. “The scooter made it easy to get from one protest to another.” It was at these protests that he repeatedly ran into the six cyclists who later became co-founders of Street Riders NYC. The organisers of Riders4Rights, another New York-based group, also met at protests. “Riders4Rights essentially grew out of McCarren Park,” says Rutuja Ganoo, one of the organisers, referring to the park in Brooklyn which became a popular location for sit-ins, vigils and demonstrations. “The riders essentially provide protection to the people as they march.” What started as a small group has now grown to include between 60 to 70 organisers. As the elections approach, Riders4Rights has been involved in education and awareness campaigns. It organises community meet-ups and webinars where people can get together and talk about difficult topics and policy issues. The group has also been involved in voter canvassing in Philadelphia. With early voting underway, New York is seeing long lines at polling booths. Street Riders NYC has also been part of an effort to stop voters from giving up due to the long waits by setting up water, refreshments and chairs, especially for senior citizens.Kerre also believes that the presence of bikers could also deter voter intimidation and harassment, which has become a huge concern this time especially after President Trump encouraged his supporters to go to polling stations and “watch carefully”.On October 14, Kerre received a call from Floyd’s brother requesting biker protection for a vigil to mark what would have been Floyd’s 47th birthday. “It was a last-minute request, but in the end, it shows the easy resilience and malleability of our movement,” says Kerre. The whole movement community is built on love and respect, says Ganoo. They offer people the chance to meet like-minded individuals and engage in something that bigger than themselves and to engage in their shared interests — activism and cycling. The goals of the groups are much larger than just the election; they believe in total systemic change and hope to keep working towards it post-elections. “The long-term goal of Riders4Rights is to see liberation for all — especially the most oppressed,” says Ganoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-election-day-nyc-bikers-hit-the-roads-to-drive-people-to-vote/story-BfPLnuOFtiDQFOPQN6FCFO.html
28-10-2020||World||At least 8 killed in blast at Peshawar seminary||A bomb blast at a religious seminary in the Pakistani city of Peshawar on Tuesday killed at least eight people and wounded more than 130 others, several of them critically, police and eyewitnesses said.The explosive device kept in a bag detonated inside the madrassa in Dir Colony in the morning as students were entering the premises. Most of the victims appear to be young men between the ages of 22 and 28 who were already within the building and possibly attending a class at the seminary when the device exploded.Witnesses said they saw an unidentified man leave a bag in the school premises and leave almost immediately. Police said they are trying to retrieve the footage of this person so that they can identify him. A video shared by police showed the madrassa’s religious scholar Sheikh Rahimullah addressing students, citing religious texts on the importance of education, when a huge blast ripped through the hall, knocking over the camera.Police said the explosive device was believed to have exceeded five kilogrammes.Police fear the number of casualties may increase because some of those injured are in a serious condition. Most of the victims were in Peshawar’s Lady Reading Hospital. Most students in the premises at the time of the blast were hurt in the blast, many of them critically, said police. The total strength of the Madrassa is believed to be over 1,000 but at the time of the explosion, many had not entered the building. It is believed that the students of the junior classes had not come to the school at the time of the explosion. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb in the city, which has long been plagued by Islamist violence. Prime Minister Imran Khan on Twitter sent his condolences to family members of the victims and the injured. “I want to assure my nation we will ensure the terrorists responsible for this cowardly barbaric attack are brought to justice ASAP,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-in-pak-madrassa-kills-7-injures-80/story-9fovXQTAcwkTsPDdTl4DcJ.html
28-10-2020||India||Citizens can’t be harassed for being critical of govt: SC||New Delhi Ordinary citizens cannot be harassed for criticising the government, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday in a matter wherein a Delhi woman was summoned by Kolkata Police over a Facebook post that she shared of a crowded Raja Bazar area and questioned the Mamta Banerjee-led government’s seriousness in enforcing the lockdown imposed to fight Covid-19.Finding the post too innocuous to be converted into a first information report (FIR), the bench of justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee said that if police were to issue summons to ordinary citizens in such a manner, it would force the courts to step in and protect the constitutionally guarded fundamental right of free speech under Article 19(1)(a). “If some person writes something against the government in some country, are you (state) going to make him appear, say in Kolkata or Chandigarh or Manipur and tell him that now we will teach you a lesson? This is a dangerous proposition. Let this remain a free country,” the bench remarked.The court stayed a high court order of September 29 asking the woman to appear in Kolkata while asking the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation. The investigating officer (IO) was granted liberty to question the petitioner through video-conferencing or even travel to Delhi to confirm facts.The court was hearing a petition filed by Roshni Biswas, a resident of Delhi against whom an FIR was registered at Ballygunje police station on May 13, 2020 for an allegedly objectionable post attributed to her on a Facebook page. The FIR was registered for offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) involving promoting enmity between religious groups (Section 153A), outraging religious feelings (Section 295A), defamation (Section 500), breach of peace (Section 504), public mischief (Section 505) and other related provisions under the Information Technology Act and the Disaster Management Act.Biswas got a stay on arrest from the Calcutta high court on June 5 on an undertaking that she would appear after the lockdown was lifted. The Kolkata Police issued her summons under Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code asking her to appear in Kolkata to be questioned in the case. She approached the Calcutta high court to quash the FIR. While this petition was still pending, the high court directed Biswas on September 29 to appear before the police. She challenged this order in the top court.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani appearing for Biswas told the bench, “Where is a cognizable offence made out? Moreover, my client has denied that she has any connection with the objectionable post. ”The Kolkata Police have attributed to Biswas two posts on a Facebook page on the lockdown not being followed in Rajabazar, claiming that thousands had gathered there and that the state wasn’t doing anything. The FIR stated that the posts implied “the state administration was going soft on the violation of the lockdown at Rajabazar as the area is predominantly inhabited by a particular community”. The area has a majority Muslim population.The state police denied any attempt to harass the petitioner. Senior advocate R Basanth who represented the West Bengal government said, “In Section 41A proceedings, courts should not interfere. Why should the state be against her? She agreed before the HC to appear but did not do so. We only seek to question her and not harass her. Some persons cannot claim to be more equal than others.”The court did not agree.  “We will be the first institution in this country to tell citizens that if they have done wrong, they must answer to the law but not for this. We have to be here to ensure ordinary citizens are not harassed like this… We have strong reservations against people being called from one state to another just because they have criticised the government.”Striking a balance between the citizen’s right to free speech and police’s power to investigate, the court directed a stay on the HC direction asking the petitioner to appear. The court issued a notice on the petition and granted four weeks to the West Bengal government to respond. Meanwhile, it directed the HC to proceed with the petition to quash the FIR without being influenced by its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citizens-can-t-be-harassed-for-being-critical-of-govt-sc/story-iQSgU5qf0JSkzKn79GZVHI.html

28-10-2020||India||Covid-19 curbs take a back seat on Dusshera in West Bengal’s Kharagpur||Thousands of people gathered in a field on Dusshera to witness the burning of Ravan’s effigy violating Covid-19 restrictions at Kharagpur in West Midnapore district in West Bengal. The incident has shocked public health experts who criticized the local administration for allowing such a gathering at a time when the state is witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. West Bengal added 4,121 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, which was the second highest number of cases in India after Kerala. While Kerala with 4,287 cases topped the list, Maharashtra with 3,645 cases ranked third. The top brass of the local administration including the district magistrate and senior Trinamool Congress leaders such as the local MLA attended the ritual organised around 140 km west of Kolkata. “As the event involves the sentiment of the people and is being organized for many years, we had made preparations so that it could be live streamed through a local cable television channel and on a video sharing platform. But people refused to stay at home and came out in large numbers. Nobody was prepared for this,” said Rashmi Kamal, district magistrate of West Midnapore, Thousands of people from Kharagpur and nearby villages gathered at the spot on Monday, to see the burning of the 54-feet effigy. While physical distancing between people took a back-seat many were not even wearing face masks raising the risk of transmission. The district administration, however, said that masks and sanitizers were distributed. “This involves people’s sentiment and the Ravan Dahan at Kharagpur has been going on for several years. It was once the biggest Ravan Dahan in the country. So it was not possible to stop the festival overnight,” said Ajit Maity, district president of the ruling TMC. “This was done keeping in mind the people’s sentiment. People also need to be aware and understand that Covid-19 restrictions need to be followed. The violations have come to our notice. The next time we organise any such gathering we will be better prepared,” said Pradip Sarkar, TMC MLA. The Durga Puja has been muted this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed by the Calcutta High Court. The court had banned the entry of visitors inside puja pandals this time. “The way people had gathered at the spot was shocking. Even if there was one Covid-19 patient the disease will spread to many people. The administration should have been more careful” said Kajalkrishna Banik, public health expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-curbs-take-a-back-seat-on-dusshera-in-west-bengal-s-kharagpur/story-n0QzL4edDl5IYurjUKy3jO.html
28-10-2020||India||In Andhra, Jagan Reddy vs top poll officer over local body elections||The ongoing tussle between the YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh and the State Election Commission (SEC) took a new turn on Wednesday with the latter setting in motion the process of conducting elections to the rural and urban local bodies in the state.State election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar held a meeting with representatives of all political parties in the state to seek their views on reviving the process of conducting elections to panchayat raj bodies and municipalities, which was stalled in March this year due to outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement later, Ramesh Kumar said he had held consultations with representatives of 11 recognised political parties. Two other parties had sent their opinions in writing while six others did not attend the meeting. “The consultations with each party representative were held separately keeping in view the Covid-19 guidelines,” he said.TDP state president K Atchan Naidu said he had requested that the SEC issue a fresh notification for the conduct of local body elections, as there were allegations of large scale irregularities against the ruling YSR Congress Party in the first phase.Several other opposition parties like BJP, BSP, the Congress, the CPI and CPI (M) also echoed the same view stating that fresh elections be conducted for the local bodies in the state.The ruling YSRCP boycotted the all-party meeting alleging that the SEC had held the all-party meeting in a bid to hurry through elections.“Ramesh Kumar postponed the elections to local bodies when there were not even three Covid-19 positive cases every day. How can he conduct the elections now, when the state is reporting around 3,000 cases a day?” YSRCP official spokesman and MLA Ambati Rambabu asked.He said as per the Supreme Court directions, the SEC should consult the government before holding the all-party meeting.“He should take the views of the health department officials and chief secretary to know whether the situation was conducive for elections or not,” Ambati Rambabu said.He reminded that Ramesh Kumar had written letters to the Centre in the past making wild allegations against chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and his party. “How can we expect the elections to be free and fair under his authority? He is clearly hand-in-glove with the TDP, led by N Chandrababu Naidu,” Rambabu said.However, the SEC refuted the allegations, saying he had already had a meeting with the officials of the health department on Tuesday afternoon and would be meeting the chief secretary later. He said he had invited representatives of all recognised political parties with reserved symbols. “The SEC is a Constitutional body and casting aspersions is best avoided as per the best democratic traditions. The exercise is being done as a prelude to a stand it has to adopt before the high court in a PIL related to conduct of elections,” Ramesh Kumar said.It may be mentioned that Ramesh Kumar had incurred the wrath of the Jagan government for abruptly postponing the process of elections to local bodies in March amid Covid-19 pandemic. The chief minister directly accused him of postponing the elections in collusion with Chandrababu Naidu because both belonged to the same caste. On April 10, the Jagan government removed Ramesh Kumar from the SEC post through an ordinance reducing the tenure of the SEC from five to three years and appointed a retired judge in his place.Ramesh Kumar challenged the ordinance in the high court, which struck down the same on May 29. The state government moved the SC challenging the high court order and after prolonged hearings, the SC upheld the high court judgment on July 31 and asked the government to reinstate Ramesh Kumar as the SEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-andhra-jagan-reddy-vs-top-poll-officer-over-local-body-elections/story-YNJ9h1wlWD7Pu3vV1EoZXN.html

Neel Nakshatra Das, who scored 99.8 percentile, his father Dr Jyotirmoy Das, a practising doctor in a prominent Guwahati hospital and employees of the test conducting agency - Hirulal Pathak, Pranjal Kalita and Hemendra Sharma - were arrested by the Guwahati police on Wednesday evening. “The five persons have been arrested based on investigation which revealed that Das and his father had used a proxy to appear on the candidate’s behalf with help of an agency,” MP Gupta, commissioner of police, Guwahati, said. According to an FIR filed by Mitradev Sharma at the Azara police station in Guwahati on October 23, the candidate allegedly didn’t appear for the test held on September 5. “We have constituted a special investigation team to probe the allegations. The FIR alleges the candidate used a proxy to appear in the test on his behalf,” said Suprotiv Lal Baruah, Additional DCP (West), Guwahati. It is alleged that the candidate was scheduled to appear for the test at a centre located at Borjhar in the city. But after completing the biometric attendance formalities, he came out of the exam hall with the help of the invigilator and someone else wrote the test on his behalf. “The matter came to light after the candidate reportedly admitted this during a phone call, which was recorded. As of now, we haven’t come across any other case of misrepresentation during the test,” said Baruah. The police have got in touch with the National Testing Agency, which conducts the test across the country, and sought data related to the JEE Mains to help them in their investigation. The complainant has alleged that the parents of the candidate, both doctors, had paid a sum of Rs 15-20 lakh to a private coaching institute in Guwahati to help the candidate in the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jee-mains-candidate-in-assam-4-more-arrested-for-proxy-exam-writing-police/story-ayfr1Q5f3a301tKrNoxr6N.html

By November 2, it will cover all the 272 wards in the city, he said. “I appeal to every citizen of Delhi to encourage five people to participate in the campaign to curb vehicular pollution,” he told reporters.The minister had earlier invited opposition MLAs and MPs to join the campaign.Rai said switching vehicles off while waiting at traffic signals can reduce vehicular pollution by 15-20 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/each-delhiite-should-encourage-5-people-to-take-part-in-govt-s-anti-pollution-campaign-gopal-rai/story-mikLbEQepNzDrejHETQLTM.html
28-10-2020||India||Bombay HC orders BMC to pay lockdown salary dues of its physically challenged staff||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to pay the arrears to its physically challenged employees for the days they failed to report to work during the lockdown.The court said that the civic body’s decision to deduct salaries of such employees, who could not report to duty owing to the hardships imposed by the lockdown, was “illegal”.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni held that the corporation was a statutory body that had specific obligations to discharge for the interest of the people.The bench said that the civic body was “not a private employer with a mindset of earning profits” and directed that it clears the pay arrears of its physically disabled employees in two instalments.The court said that the first of the two instalments must be paid before Diwali, and the other one must be paid within 45 days of the first.The court’s verdict came on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the National Association of the Blind.It was filed through advocate Uday Warunjikar.According to the plea, the BMC initially exempted its physically disabled staff members from reporting to work, informing such employees that they were entitled to a special leave without loss of pay.However, in another circular issued on May 26, the BMC said that it was not a special leave, but a ‘permissible leave’ that needed to be sanctioned.Therefore, such physically challenged employees, who did not have any leaves left, or those who failed to get their leaves sanctioned, would have to forfeit the salary for the days that they missed work.The court noted that the central government, too, had exempted its physically disabled employees from reporting to work during the lockdown.And the BMC’s “change of heart” over the same was not backed by sound reason, it held.It stated that it was understandable that the physically disabled would have found it very difficult to report to work during the lockdown since most means of public transport remained suspended and there wasn’t any scope of help from other citizens due to the fear of spread of coronavirus.“If indeed the corporation was not inclined to offer financial benefits like pay to the physically disabled employees who do not report for duty, it was its duty as a model employer to make special arrangements for public transport or special measures to ensure hassle-free travel by such employees to their respective work places,” the HC said.The court also dismissed the BMC’s arguments of loss of revenue on account of paying such employees despite their absence of work.The HC said that such a notion was “misconceived”.“We declare the action of the corporation to withhold the monetary benefits to the physically disabled employees with retrospective effect, as assailed, to be illegal,” the HC said.“We also hold that such employees would be entitled to all normal monetary benefits, which ought not to have been withheld by the corporation during the period of pandemic,” it said.The BMC has around 1,150 physically disabled people, including 268 visually impaired employees on whose behalf the PIL had been filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-orders-bmc-to-pay-lockdown-salary-dues-of-its-physically-challenged-staff/story-clgZmsbYJmBBFHaoA9wzBO.html

The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 provides for maintaining the “religious character” of holy structures as it existed on August 15, 1947.A plea filed by a Hindu organisation in June had challenged Section 4 of the law in a bid to open the litigation route to reclaim disputed religious sites other than the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. The Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh’s plea assumes significance in the case of Kashi and Mathura where two disputed mosques stand. Talking to PTI, chairman of Sunni Central Waqf Board, Zufar Farooqui, said, “The Places of Worship Act clearly prohibits the conversion of any place of worship and maintain its religious character as it existed on 15 August, 1947.” “The Supreme Court’s verdict which had cleared the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya where the demolished Babri Masjid once stood has also reiterated the places of worship act,” he added. “The board will be dealing with the court cases but since the places of worship act in place, it must be implemented to stop such attacks on mosques in India,” he said. After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. Farooqui, who is also the president of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), a trust, for the construction of the mosque in Ayodhya, said the new structure will be bigger than the Babri masjid. A museum, hospital and research centre which will also be built inside the complex.“We are working on war footing to kick start the construction of the mosque and other facilities in Ayodhya. We are taking the advice of International experts to construct a world-class facility,” he said. “The hospital of course will hold centre stage as it will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the prophet. It will be in sync with the architecture of the mosque, replete with calligraphy and Islamic symbols. It will house a 300-bed speciality unit, where doctors will work with missionary zeal to provide free treatment to the ailing,” he added.  The master plan will be designed to house an archive, museum and community kitchen in the mosque complex. The archive and museum will exhibit contribution of Muslims to nation building, Indian culture and freedom struggle and of course Sufi saints who spread love and harmony, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunni-waqf-board-seeks-implementation-of-place-of-worship-act-amid-calls-to-reclaim-kashi-mathura/story-mA3BThhZ1Cbn7GmAIX62RP.html

The HC had rejected their plea on Tuesday to stay the case and exempt their personal appearance in court. On October 15, the CJM’s court had ordered the six accused in the case, including the two ministers, to appear before it. Later, both ministers had moved the High Court. The House witnessed violent incidents in March 2015 after opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators prevented then Finance Minister K M Mani from presenting the state budget alleging his role in a bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee and two legislators were later hospitalized. The session was live when violence unfolded in the House. Then Speaker N Sakthan later filed a police complaint against six LDF legislators, two of them EP Jayarajan and KT Jaleel are ministers in the Pinarayi Vijayan ministry now. The complaint said property worth Rs 2.5 lakh was damaged in the melee and they tried to manhandle treasury bench members. But the case failed to make any progress and when the LDF came to power in 2016 the public prosecutor had sought permission to withdraw it but the court declined. The government had invoked the privilege of legislators to justify its decision to withdraw the case but the court rejected it saying privilege was not a licence to carry out violent activities in the House. During a discussion in the assembly last year chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said assembly proceedings should not be dragged to courts. Interestingly the Kerala Congress (Mani) is in the left camp now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-kerala-ministers-get-bail-in-five-year-old-case-related-to-violence-in-assembly/story-b6OxgAh6LJ7RHtUQ5YzU1O.html

The woman had shared a crowded Raja Bazar area scene of Kolkata and questioned the Mamta Banerjee government’s seriousness to enforce the lockdown.Finding the post too innocuous to be converted into a first information report (FIR), the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee shuddered to think that if police were to issue summons to ordinary citizens in this manner, it will set a dangerous trend forcing Courts to step in and protect the constitutionally guarded fundamental right of free speech under Article 19(1)(a).The bench remarked, “If some person writes something against the Government in some country, are you (state) going to make him appear, say in Kolkata or Chandigarh or Manipur and tell him that now we will teach you a lesson. This is a dangerous proposition. Let this remain a free country.”The apex court stayed the High Court order of September 29 asking her to appear in Kolkata while asking the petitioner to cooperate with the investigation. The investigating officer (I.O) was granted liberty to question the petitioner through video conferencing or even come to Delhi for confronting facts.What prompted such harsh words from the top court was a petition filed by one Roshni Biswas, a resident of Delhi, who faced a FIR registered at Ballygunje police station on May 13 for an objectionable post attributed to her on a Facebook page. The FIR was registered for offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) involving promoting enmity between religious groups (Section 153A), outraging religious feelings (Section 295A), defamation (Section 500), breach of peace (Section 504), public mischief (Section 505) and other related provisions under the Information Technology Act and Disaster Management Act.Roshni got a stay of arrest from the Calcutta High Court on June 5 on an undertaking that she will appear after lockdown is lifted. The Kolkata police issued her summons under Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code asking her to appear in Kolkata to be questioned in the case. She approached the Calcutta High Court to quash the FIR. While this petition was still pending, the HC directed Roshni on September 29 to appear before the police. She challenged this order in the top court.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Roshni, told the apex bench, “Where is a cognisable offence made out. Moreover, my client has denied that she has any connection with the objectionable post. They want to call me to Kolkata and put me under terror.”What was attributed to her by the police were two posts on a Facebook page where she said, “The lockdown is not being followed at Rajabazar….During lockdown, thousands of people have come together and raising concerns as to whether the State administration would do something about it.” The FIR stated that the posts implied “the State administration was going soft on the violation of the lock down at Rajabazar as the area is predominantly inhabited by a particular community.” This area has a majority of Muslim population.The FIR attached other web links to imply from the posts that “the State administration is complacent while dealing with lock down violations caused by a certain segment of the community”.The state police denied any attempt to harass the petitioner. Senior advocate R Basanth, who represented the West Bengal government, said, “In Section 41A proceedings, Courts should not interfere. Why should the state be against her? She agreed before the HC to appear but did not do so. We only seek to question her and not harass her. Some persons cannot claim to be more equal than others.”On a bare reading of the FIR, the bench remarked, “We will be the first institution in this country to tell citizens that if they have done wrong, they must answer to the law but not for this. We have to be here to ensure ordinary citizens are not harassed like this…We have strong reservations against people being called from one state to another just because they have criticised the government.”The court issued notice on the petition and granted four weeks to the Bengal government to respond. Meanwhile, it directed the HC to proceed with the petition to quash FIR without being influenced by the present order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-it-remain-free-country-sc-after-police-summon-woman-over-facebook-post/story-Add2MROByHU6iOMQ7hcCqK.html
28-10-2020||India||6 cops suspended for handcuffing Amaravati farmers during judicial remand||The Andhra Pradesh police on Wednesday suspended six head constables and served charge memos on a reserve inspector and a sub-inspector for handcuffing seven farmers from Amaravati in connection with their agitation against the formation of three capitals for the state. Guntur (rural) superintendent of police Vishal Gunni said the department took serious note of the farmers being handcuffed while being shifted from Narsaraopet sub-jail to Guntur prison on Monday. He also ordered a detailed probe by a committee headed by an additional superintendent of police. “It is unfortunate. There is no question of shielding any errant officer. Investigation is on,” he said. The arrested farmers from Krishanayapalem included five SCs and two OBCs and the police, ironically, booked them, along with four others, under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They were charged with obstructing some Dalits from neighbouring villages, who had come to Amaravati last week to stage demonstrations in support of the three capitals plan. The Amaravati farmers alleged that the ruling YSR Congress party leaders had brought outsiders to launch a counter-agitation in support of the three capitals decision. “We did not abuse them or attack them. We only questioned their credentials. For that, the police foisted cases against us,” a farmer told reporters. On Monday, the police arrested six farmers and remanded them to judicial custody in Narsaraopet jail. On Tuesday, they were subjected to Covid-19 tests and later, shifted to Guntur jail in a bus. In the process, the police handcuffed the farmers. This triggered massive protests from farmers in Amaravati. Representatives of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi and Joint Action Committee staged protests in Amaravati, demanding the release of the arrested villagers. Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu said the police had committed a serious human rights violation by handcuffing the farmers. He alleged that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was harassing farmers for agitating and demanding that the capital city be retained at Amaravati. TDP politburo member Varla Ramaiah sought the National Human Rights Commission’s (NHRC) intervention in the matter. TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh called on the families of the arrested farmers at Krishnayapalem and extended solidarity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-cops-suspended-for-handcuffing-amaravati-farmers-during-judicial-remand/story-7KgMzFprCA2LvM7iy064mI.html

28-10-2020||India||With 5,673 new coronavirus cases, Delhi records its highest single-day spike||Delhi has crossed another grim landmark of recording over 5,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day. On Wednesday, 5,673 new cases of the viral infection were reported in the daily health bulletin. The 4,853 cases reported on Tuesday were highest so far. Before that, 4,473 new cases reported on September 16 had been the highest number of cases in the city during the second surge. The city had seen the first surge in cases in June-July, when the union home ministry had stepped in to control the spread of the infection. An expert committee headed by NITI Ayog member Dr VK Paul had said that the number of cases in Delhi could go up to 15,000 a day during the winter months. The positivity rate – proportion of samples that returned positive among those tested – also tipped over 9%. This happened for the first time since the first week of September when Delhi was conducting only about 20,000 tests a day. Once the government tripled it to about 60,000 a day, the positivity rate had dipped. However, when the testing was scaled up, most of the tests were done using the rapid antigen method which is cheap, easy to deploy in clinics, and gives results in 15 minutes. However, it is also more likely to throw false negatives for people who might actually have the infection. The number of cases in the city started increasing again in October as the government scaled up the more reliable RT-PCR tests. On Wednesday, over 17,000 RT-PCR tests were conducted in the city for the very first time. “We are now testing people in a targeted manner. If one person tests positive, we are looking for all his family members and contacts and getting them tested. This strategy is being closely monitored. What we have seen is that if one person tests positive, usually several members of the same family test positive. This is the reason that the positivity rate has gone up,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Tuesday during a media interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reports-5-673-coronavirus-cases-in-a-day-its-highest-so-far/story-OQdzkrbudgoG7K2yUuFqiN.html
28-10-2020||India||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to visit France, Germany and UK in November||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla will visit France, Germany and the UK during October 29-November 4 – his first trip outside the neighbourhood amid the Covid-19 pandemic – to review bilateral relations and boost cooperation in trade and investment. The visit will provide India with an opportunity to brief the leadership of the three countries on the latest developments in the border standoff with China and discuss efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Shringla will review bilateral relations and discuss matters of mutual interest and “share Indian perspectives with his counterparts and with other key interlocutors”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Besides discussing international cooperation in dealing with the pandemic and its consequences, Shringla will interact with businesspersons, academics, intellectuals and the media in the three countries, the statement said. “France, Germany and the UK are strategic partners of India and are nations with which India has close and well-established relations. Bilateral ties are multi-dimensional and have grown rapidly,” the ministry said. India’s relations with all three countries are built on a foundation of shared democratic values and “informed by a commonality of interest in issues such as sustainable development and climate change”. India also has very substantial trade and commercial ties and large investment flows with these countries, and works closely with them in multilateral and plurilateral platforms on different issues. “Indian priorities such as robust and reformed multilateralism, its expanded multilateral and plurilateral engagements, including its forthcoming non-permanent tenure in the UN Security Council, and its commitment to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific will be discussed,” the statement said. Shringla’s visit to these countries is part of India’s continuing international engagement and diplomatic outreach in spite of limitations posed by the pandemic, officials said. Since the pandemic restricted diplomatic engagements, Shringla has travelled to only two countries in the neighbourhood. He travelled to Bangladesh in August to deliver a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and to push forward connectivity and development projects. Shringla visited Myanmar with Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane earlier this month to boost security and development cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla-to-visit-france-germany-and-uk-in-november/story-xxgbktjkaNukSo0wjMe8WK.html
28-10-2020||India||Govt pulled up by RTI body over evasive reply on Aarogya Setu. It clarifies||The Central Information Commission issued a notice to the government and asked it to explain the evasive RTI response over the creation of the Aarogya Setu app, the contact tracing app that has crores of users’ data. The RTI body called the government response “extremely preposterous”.The RTI application, filed by Saurav Das, had sought information about the creation of the application in light of privacy concerns around it. Government officials from the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and National E-Governance Division (NeGD) and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) declined to comment on the question raised by Das, prompting him to file an appeal with the CIC. The application has been particularly contentious as news reports and data privacy activists have alleged that the app collects information and stores it.“The CPIO (central public information officer), NIC’s submissions that the entire file related to creation of the App is not with NIC is understandable, but the same submissions if accepted from MeITY, NeGD and NIC in toto, then it becomes more relevant to now find out how an App was created and there is no information with any of the relevant public authorities,” the CIC said in its order dated October 26.It has further directed NIC, which manages the creation and maintenance of the government’s websites, to explain how the website was created with a gov.in extension if the ministry had no information about it.“The Commission observed that none of the CPIOs provided any information. Therefore, the Commission directs the CPIO, NIC to explain this matter in writing as to how the website https://aarogyasetu.gov.in/ was created with the domain name gov.in, if they do not have any information about it,” the CIC said.“None of the CPIOs were able to explain anything regarding who created the App, where are the files, and the same is extremely preposterous,” the order added.The order has taken cognizance of Supreme Court decisions in Namit Sharma v Union of India 2012 (8) SCALE 593 in which it was held that the “purpose and object for the enactment of the RTI Act was to make the government more transparent and accountable to the public and to ensure access to information to every citizen from the public authorities”.MeitY officials, however, said that the government will comply with the CIC’s orders.“As per the orders of the CIC, CPIOs of MeitY, NeGD and NIC have been directed to appear on 24th November 2020. MeitY is taking necessary steps to comply with the orders of the CIC,” MeitY said in a statement.The statement added that the app was developed in record time to combat the prevailing Covid-19 outbreak and its source code and the names of those associated with developing the app are available in the open domain.“With regard to the above, it is clarified that there should be no doubt with regard to the Aarogya Setu App and its role in helping contain Covid-19 pandemic in India. Aarogya Setu App was launched by Government of India in public private partnership mode to bring people of India together in its fight against Covid-19,” the ministry said.“Since 2nd April 2020, regular press releases and updates have been issued on Aarogya Setu App including making the source code available in Open domain on 26th May 2020. The names of all those associated with the development of the App and management of the App ecosystem at various stages was shared when the code was released in Open/Public Domain and the same was shared widely in media also,” the ministry added.The CIC has asked for a clarification about who created and maintained the application, especially considering the platform is designed, developed and hosted by NIC.“Furthermore, as per the website, it is mentioned that the content is owned, updated and maintained by the MyGov, MeitY. Therefore… directed to explain in writing who is the concerned CPIO to explain regarding MyGov, MeiTY maintaining the app. The platform is designed, developed and hosted by the National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India, then how is it that they do not have any information about creation of the App,” the Commission said in its order.The Commission has directed the CPIOs of the agencies to appear before the bench on November 24.“The Commission is constrained to issue a show cause notice to the concerned CPIOs,” it added. It has asked the three CPIOs to make written submissions detailing their role in creation of the website https://aarogyasetu.gov.in/ with the domain name gov.in. “The CPIO, NeGD shall also explain the delay of about 2 months in replying to the RTI application. The Commission directs the above-mentioned CPIOs to appear before the bench on 24.11.2020 at 01.15 pm to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them under Section 20 of the RTI Act. The CPIOs are also directed to send a copy of all supporting documents upon which they choose to rely upon during the hearing,” the order said.It has also asked why a penalty under the RTI Act should not be imposed on them “for prima facie obstruction of information and providing an evasive reply”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-pulled-up-by-rti-body-over-evasive-reply-on-aarogya-setu-it-clarifies/story-C8KlA3tXrl7wCPvcv7fxSP.html

Worlds largest contact tracing App, appreciated by WHO also. #SetuMeraBodyguard #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/mbhQ4pTuZwIn a two-page clarification tweeted from the official handle of the application, the Centre said Aarogya Setu has been downloaded by more than 16.23 crore users and it has been strengthening India’s fight against Covid-19.Also Read: Ministry has no information on who created Aarogya Setu, RTI body issues showcause notice“It has helped identify bluetooth contacts of Covid-19 positive users and issued alerts for helping people to stay safe. These bluetooth contacts have been advised for caution, quarantine or testing depending on the ectent of the exposure to Covid-19 positive user,” it said.About 25 per cent of those who have been alerted tested positive, the clarification said. “This is much higher compared to the overall positivity rate of 7 to 8 per cent. Thus the efficiency of testing has gone up with Aarogya Setu,” it added.Dousing the controversy that was fuelled after the National Informatics Centre denied having any knowledge about the app, the Centre said there should be no doubt over this app. Giving details of how the app was developed, the Centre said the app was developed in a record time of around 21 days. It was a ‘Make in India’ effort for which the best of Indian minds from industry, academia and government worked round the clock. NIC has developed the app in collaboration with volunteers from industry and academia, it said.The Centre also mentioned how the World Health Organization praised the app for helping the state health departments identify Covid-19 clusters. “Aarogya Setu app from India has been downloaded by 150 million users and helped city public health departments to identify areas where clusters could be anticipated and expand testing in a targeted way,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-developed-by-government-and-private-collaboration-centre-clarifies/story-iQyqZTZR4CKZVN5SCB3SLO.html
28-10-2020||India||In Telangana’s Warangal, man sentenced to death for killing 9 to hide earlier crime||A local court in Telangana’s Warangal district on Wednesday sentenced a 25-year old migrant worker from Bihar to death for allegedly murdering nine other migrant labourers in May this year in a bid to cover up another murder he had committed earlier. Warangal first additional district court judge Jaya Kumar delivered his judgement, awarding a death sentence to accused Sanjay Kumar Yadav for the gruesome killings, including six members of a family on May 20. The Warangal police booked Yadav under seven sections of the Indian Penal Code and filed the charge sheet within 25 days of the FIR being registered. Yadav confessed to the crime during the trial. In all, the court cross-examined 98 people, including 68 witnesses, before pronouncing the judgement. The mass murders that took place at Gorrekunta village of Geesugonda block on the outskirts of Warangal town created a sensation in Telangana. On May 20, the police recovered nine bodies from an abandoned well. Warangal city police commissioner V Ravinder said the deceased were identified as Md Maqsood (55), his wife Nisha (48), sons Shahabad Alam (21) and Sohail Alam (18), daughter Bushra (20) and her three-year-old son Shoaib (all from the same family from West Bengal), Sriram (21) and Shyam (22) from Bihar, besides Shakil (30) from Tripura. All the elders were working in a gunny bag manufacturing unit at Geesugonda and staying in the same company premises since the enforcement of lockdown in March. The police initially thought they had died by mass suicide owing to financial constraints or some other family reasons. Investigations later revealed that all the nine people were murdered by Yadav, also a migrant worker from Bihar, to cover up another murder he had committed in March – that of Rafiqa (37), a divorcee sister-in-law of Maqsood, with whom Yadav had an illicit affair. The police said Yadav had killed Rafiqa on their way to West Bengal at Nidubrolu in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district on March 6 and quietly returned to Warangal. When other family members of Maqsood grew suspicious about Rafiqa being missing even after two months, Yadav decided to eliminate them. He mixed sleeping pills in their food and after they fell asleep, bundled them in gunny bags and dumped them in an abandoned well, the police said. The prosecution produced all the evidence before the court, including footage from Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras showing Sanjay Kumar Yadav coming to the victims’ house at 5.30 pm on May 19 and leaving the next morning at 6.30 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-telangana-s-warangal-migrant-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-9-to-hide-earlier-crime/story-VT2KkX0nU1Ymwah6hTJ2KL.html

The police’s FIR names Rajput’s two sisters and a doctor of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, Tarun Kumar, who allegedly signed the medical prescription. The HC will hear the petition on November 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-s-accusations-against-sushant-s-sisters-speculative-says-cbi/story-sTL1QC5BHXitFAyoeQRT1O.html

The company’s statement comes in the backdrop of its appearance in front of the joint committee of parliament on Data Protection Bill, 2019, on Wednesday. Representatives of the social media company were also questioned by the members on showing Ladakh as part of China. Committee chairman Meenakshi Lekhi had told PTI that Twitter’s explanations to the panel on showing Ladakh as part of China were “inadequate” and that the act amounts to criminal offence attracting imprisonment of seven years. Representatives of Twitter had told the panel that the company respects the sensitivities of India. “The recent geo-tagging issue was swiftly resolved by our teams. We are committed to openness, transparency around our work and will remain in regular touch with the government to share timely updates,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Twitter had come under heavy criticism and faced a backlash from social media users after its geo-tagging feature displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from Leh’s Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in the Union Territory of Ladakh. Twitter had called it a technical issue that had been swiftly resolved. Last week, the government had written to Twitter on the issue, saying any disrespect of the country’s sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-to-transparency-will-share-timely-updates-with-govt-twitter-on-geo-tagging-issue/story-ucTJ5WQq42BtANawOeDwiN.html

28-10-2020||India||India’s high use of antigen tests risks underestimating Covid-19 spread, says diagnostician||Fast but less accurate “rapid antigen tests” now account for 60% of all coronavirus tests in India, the head of a top diagnostic firm estimated on Wednesday, warning that such a high use could misrepresent the actual spread of the infection.Antigen devices return results in about 15 minutes compared with several hours for the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, a laboratory based process which the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) calls the “gold standard“ for Covid-19 detection.Whereas antigen tests typically detect the virus around 80% to 90% of the time, lab based tests detect the virus more than 95% of the time, say regulators and health experts in countries like the United States.As a consequence of the reduced accuracy, India’s high use of antigen tests compared with a global use of around 10%, risked underestimating the spread of coronavirus, according to the founder of Mumbai based Thyrocare Technologies Ltd , one of India’s top-three diagnostic chains.“It’s a wrong scale used to assess” the extent of the spread of the virus, Arokiaswamy Velumani told Reuters in a phone interview.Though the total number of coronavirus cases reached close to 8 million on Wednesday, India’s official tally shows daily new cases have dropped sharply since a mid-September peak.Velumani said Thyrocare’s centres are now receiving only about 2,500 samples a day for RT-PCR tests, down from a high of about 7,000 in September.The health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) did not immediately respond to emails from Reuters seeking comment on Velumani’s comments.RT-PCR dominates in the United States but authorities there are planning to increase the use of antigen tests to screen people.India’s federal health ministry has not provided a breakdown of the test methods deployed, but state and federal officials have repeatedly defended the use of antigen tests to quickly identify infections in the country of 1.3 billion people.It has also helped India quickly ramp up its testing capacity to 1.5 million samples a day.“There was a stigma that India was not doing enough tests,” Velumani said, noting at least that criticism was being addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-high-use-of-antigen-tests-risks-underestimating-covid-19-spread-says-diagnostician/story-gRHmqbelk99zLaQwf1dBmL.html

28-10-2020||India||Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to meet Amit Shah in Delhi tomorrow||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar will meet Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday during a three-day trip to Delhi. Dhankhar was scheduled to leave for Delhi on Wednesday evening. The news of Dhankhar’s visit to the capital led to speculations in political circles that he might submit a report on the law and order situation to Shah. Raj Bhawan officials said they had no information on this. During their last meeting on July 20, Dhankhar told the Union home minister that the law and order situation in Bengal was “worrisome” and added that the state was on the “edge of a cliff”. He also talked of healthcare management, nepotism in cyclone relief distribution and general governance. The governor has been raising these issues on social media platforms and in his interactions with ministers and bureaucrats. The acrimonious relationship between Raj Bhawan and the government has touched a new low in recent weeks because of this. “Worrisome and dangerously deteriorating law and order situation, targeting political opponents and the highly partisan role of the police was also discussed. The role of police leaves much to be desired and that it was high time exemplary action was taken against senior police officials who act in disregard of the conduct rules,” the Governor House said in a statement in July after Dhankhar met Shah. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, who have met Dhankhar several times recently with complaints against the state, did not comment on his Delhi trip. Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member and spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “All governors have to report to the Union home minister at regular intervals. Dhankhar is doing the same as he has to justify his job. This has no political significance.” Interestingly, the governor will spend the entire month of November at the picturesque Governor House in Darjeeling. “Many governors have done this in the past. He wants to enjoy the weather in the hills, which is very pleasant right now,” said Roy. Appointed governor in July last year, Dhankhar’s relationship with the TMC government and chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been marked by acrimony through a chain of events since September 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-to-meet-amit-shah-in-delhi-tomorrow/story-ZnD63BI8E7sBWlFohcaU1M.html

Tyagi’s suspension by the President comes amid heated power tussle amid two sections in the university over recent decisions on crucial appointments taken by the VC and their compliance with varsity norms.Orders issued by now-suspended varsity’s VC Tyagi during his period of absence on medical ground will be treated as null and void, officials told news agency PTI. President Ram Nath Kovind, who is the Visitor of the university, had sent his approval for suspension of the VC on Tuesday.The order further states that Tyagi has been on leave since July 2 when he was admitted to AIIMS under emergency medical condition. The government had on July 17 given Pro-VC P C Joshi the charge of VC, until Tyagi resumes office. “The president has given his assent for a probe into issues of misgovernance. The Union education ministry has raised questions about the governance of the varsity and the consent has been received. The ministry will now set up a committee that will probe the issues,” said an education ministry official. The high-voltage drama has been unfolding at Delhi University since Tuesday with two factions of the university supporting two registrars, two pro-vice chancellors, and two directors of South Campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-university-vice-chancellor-suspended-education-ministry-says-failed-to-discharge-duties/story-20H00oNG4mtF7KnQnDSS3O.html

The HC in its 83-page order, while hearing writ petitions filed by Umesh Kumar and Shiv Prasad Semwal, said “...In view of the nature of the allegations, this Court is of the view that the CBI should be directed to lodge an FIR on the basis of allegations levelled...and investigate the case.” Umesh Kumar, a journalist, had alleged in a social media post that a man from Jharkhand deposited money after demonetisation into the bank account of a couple related to the chief minister for the latter’s benefit. The judge directed that a CBI inquiry be conducted into the matter and said all documents related to the case be submitted to the court. The government had filed an FIR against Umesh Kumar for his social media post . On Tuesday the HC quashed the FIR.It has been alleged that one A S Chauhan based in Jharkhand had claimed that he knew TS Rawat who was the state in-charge of BJP of Jharkhand. In 2016, Chauhan allegedly struck a deal worth Rs 25 lakh with Rawat for his appointment as chairman Jharkhand Gau Sewa Aayog. Rawat became the CM in 2017.Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Harish Rawat said the HC has taken the matter very seriously and instead of police, it has asked CBI to file FIR and investigate the allegations against CM. “Against this scenario, the chief minister has no option but to resign, one on moral grounds and second that he is heading the state and his continuation as CM can influence the investigation”, he said Rawat said the chief minister and the BJP government had been harping on the zero-tolerance towards corruption. “Now we want to see how they will deal with such serious allegations,” he said Pritam Singh, state Congress president said chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has always been talking about zero tolerance to corruption in his government. “Now the HC has directed CBI to file an FIR and investigate the allegation against the CM, he should resign on moral grounds. Also, he should resign so that there is fair investigation into this matter”, he said. Singh said they would be meeting Governor Baby Rani Maurya to talk about this serious issue. “Governor being the custodian of the constitution in the state, we will urge her to look into this issue and take a stand”. The BJP appeared unfazed by the Congress’ attacks. Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson said they honour the directions of the high court in the matter. “Let this matter be investigated properly so that people come to know about the truth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-seeks-uttarakhand-cm-s-resignation-after-hc-orders-cbi-probe-on-bribery-allegations/story-hRAde98l78hECD4xGcnzMJ.html

Narendra Modi will talk about my family. But neither of them will speak about unemployment, poverty in the state,” Rahul Gandhi said adding that this election is not about families. “The Mahagathbandhan government is Bihar will belong to all. We will talk about jobs, health education. We will not speak about Narendra Modi’s family or Nitish Kumar’s family. This election is significant as on one hand there is Tejashwi, me in this new force, on the other hand, there is those who represent the past,” the Congress leader said.Referring to the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws, Rahul Gandhi reiterated that he was shocked to find that the prime minister’s effigies were set on fire this Dussehra in Punjab. “There is no job in Bihar. Biharis can’t see dreams. For that, they have to migrate. And then suddenly one day, PM Modi will appear on television and say he is not liking Rs 500 notes. Or, he will say there would be a nationwide lockdown from tomorrow. PM said it would be a 21-day battle. But his battle was with the poor who died of hunger, not of coronavirus,” he said.In a veiled attack to Lalu Prasad Yadav, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recently said that development can not be expected from people producing eight or nine kids for a son. “They produce 8-9 kids. They have no faith on daughters. They had 7-8 daughters before a son. What kind of Bihar they want to make? If this is their ideal, what will happen to Bihar?” Nitish Kumar said without naming the RJD chief.Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi have nine children.Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav reacted to the attack and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi too has six siblings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitishji-will-talk-about-tejashwi-s-family-pm-modi-will-talk-about-my-family-rahul-gandhi-in-darbhanga/story-cBSzq4d7bx8SHQSTw0iU7N.html

However, representatives of Twitter told the panel that the social media company respects the sensitivities of India. “It is not a question of sensitivities only, it is a matter of India’s sovereignty and integrity, showing Ladakh as part of China amounts to criminal offence which attracts imprisonment of seven years,” Lekhi said.Officials who deposed before the panel on behalf of Twitter India included Shagufta Kamran, senior manager, public policy, Ayushi Kapoor, legal counsel, Pallavi Walia, policy communications, and Manvinder Bali, corporate security.Officials from the Ministry of Electronics, Information and Technology, and Ministry of Law and Justice also deposed before the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-s-explanation-on-showing-ladakh-as-part-of-china-inadequate-joint-par-panel-chairperson/story-Jl4HLQ38PGdFKjiGP37h1H.html
28-10-2020||India||ADR seeks urgent hearing on electoral bonds case in Supreme Court||The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has moved an application in the Supreme Court demanding urgent listing of public interest litigation (PIL) pending on the issue of electoral bonds.The application on Monday has sought listing of its PIL pending with the Supreme Court since September 2017. The matter was last heard on January 20 this year and has not come up for hearing since then.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who has filed the plea for ADR informed the Court that just before the Bihar Assembly elections, the State Bank of India has been authorized to issue and encash Electoral Bonds through its 29 authorized branches between October 19 and 28.The application said, “Even though a notification, dated January 2, 2018 stipulates sale of electoral bonds in January, April, July and October months of each year; the window was not opened in April and July, but has been opened in October, right before the Bihar legislative election.”The ADR in its PIL had sought that the amendments carried out to the Finance Act that were passed as Money Bills which provided an anonymous route for political parties to receive corporate funding through electoral bonds be struck down. This lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties was cited as the ground by ADR to oppose this scheme. These donations enjoy 100 per cent tax exemption as they need not be reported to the Income Tax Department either, the petition added.“The Electoral Bonds Scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” the application stated, adding that the Finance Act of 2017 exempts use of electoral bonds from disclosure under the Representation of Peoples Act.The ADR moved applications in March 2019 and again in November 2019 to stay the implementation of the Electoral Bond Scheme but the same was not granted. In April 2019, an interim order was issued by the Supreme Court asking political parties to disclose to the Election Commission in a sealed cover details of donations received by way of electoral bonds. In the same order, the top court had observed that the issue with regard to electoral bonds gives rise to “weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country” which require an in-depth hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adr-seeks-urgent-hearing-on-electoral-bonds-case-in-supreme-court/story-5NW4GUJseeDqN77twZfqjM.html

I cannot be a bystander and neither can these legislators to people who are a threat to democracy and to these 7.5 crore people,” stated Scindia while adding that the Congress ran a government riddled with corruption.Calling 22 MLAs resigning together a first of its kind of ‘historical event’ of independent India, the BJP leader said no political party had in the history of independent India has lost the faith of so many elected representatives in a short span of time that too after 15 years after staying out of power.“I don’t think that any political party has ever seen such a scenario in the history of the country. Kamal Nath government is the first one who has lost 22 MLAs in just a couple of months into power followed by four more. He is the first one to experience this in the 70 years of democratic India. Out of the strength of 114, he has lost 26 MLAs which is close to 28 per cent of the strength. It talks volumes about Kamal Nath’s attitude towards his legislators,” he stated.Scindia, the BJP leader who has crossed over from Congress in March said, the reason the Kamal Nath-led government fell is that it trampled upon the rights of its elected representatives.“A government riddled with corruption that throws its manifesto into the wastebasket. It disallows any development project in any of the regions, disrespects the lawmakers who are supposed to be your colleague should have seen it coming,” stated the leader.

They will have to follow all the SOPs as will be issued to them by the Home Department and with 50% capacity they can start. We need to promote tourism activity,” Sawant said. The casinos, which are a significant contributor to the state’s revenue, have been urging the government to allow the restart of operations, which they said would help boost the tourism arrivals in the state and provide an added attraction to tourists visiting the state. Sawant also said that the casinos operators who would earlier pay their annual fees at a single time can now do so on a monthly basis. There are six offshore casinos in Goa, boats anchored in the Mandovi river that flows by the capital city. Other casinos are located inside five star hotels. The 19-year-old industry isn’t just a big draw for thousands of tourists but contributes around ₹300 crore to the state coffers in licence fees and around ₹90 crore per year as State GST. From one offshore vessel which began operations in the year 1999, the state today has six gaming vessels that all float within a one-kilometre stretch of the Mandovi. Industry insiders reveal that each venue used to make a turnover of around Rs 120-crore per year and drew 600-800 people per vessel, especially on weekends, before the lockdown threw a spanner in the works.The casinos were shut earlier than other activity on account of crowding in closed spaces which is a significant risk of superspreading coronavirus. Since the industry has been closed since March, many of the staff have gone back home. Operators believe that they will not be able to restart with only a few days’ notice and will take some weeks to be up and running.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-casinos-to-reopen-on-november-1-operators-say-it-will-take-weeks-go-full-steam/story-5tyWMZlQg94j7NDLrWkz4I.html

28-10-2020||India||Andhra police rescue kidnapped Hyderabad dentist, 3 kidnappers escape||Police in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur district rescued a Hyderabad-based dentist from kidnappers while they were taking him to Karnataka in a vehicle in the early hours of Wednesday. Anantapur’s superintendent of police Dr Satya Yesubabu said when the kidnappers’ vehicle was intercepted at Rapthadu village the driver tried to divert the vehicle towards Kanaganapalli. “But the police surrounded it from all sides. While they overpowered Sanjay, who was driving the vehicle, three others managed to escape into the fields. They could rescue the doctor – B Hussain (57), who was lying in the back seat with his hands and legs tied,” the SP said. Hussain was kidnapped by five burqa-clad men from his clinic at Bandlaguda Jagir under Rajendranagar police station limits on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Tuesday afternoon when he was getting ready to go home for lunch. The kidnappers, who were conversing in Marathi, beat up Hussain’s assistant Syed Salman and dumped him in the washroom. They later dragged the doctor into his Toyota Innova vehicle and proceeded towards Shankarpalli. The SP said the kidnappers first detained Hussain in an undisclosed place till evening. Later, the gang leader handed him to four members of the gang and asked them to take him to Shimoga or Bengaluru in a Mahindra Bolero vehicle. Meanwhile, Salman, who managed to escape from the clinic, informed Hussain’s family. The dentist’s wife then complained to Rajendranagar police. “Since Hussain is also into real estate business and made big money, the kidnappers targeted him. They reportedly demanded a ransom of Rs 10 crore through Bitcoins,” Yesubabu said. Based on the evidence collected, the Rajendranagar police came to the conclusion that the kidnappers had taken Hussain towards Bengaluru. They immediately alerted Anantapur police. “We deployed special police teams on the national highway and kept a watch on the movements of vehicles coming from Hyderabad. In the early hours, Rapthadu police managed to intercept the vehicle and take it into their possession,” the SP said. He said Hussain was rescued and was safe. “We have seized the vehicle and a pistol from the accused. We have launched a manhunt for other kidnappers. Investigation is on,” he said. Andhra Pradesh Director General of Police Gautam Sawang complimented the Anantapur police for their quick action in rescuing the dentist from the kidnappers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-police-rescue-kidnapped-hyderabad-dentist-3-kidnappers-escape/story-fCXaDA5fkTYYn9HHrGDvhO.html

It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, Covid-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders,” Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said.Sisodia’s announcement comes just days after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, on October 24, ruled out reopening of schools in the capital. “Schools are not reopening for now,” Kejriwal had told reporters on the sidelines of an event.(Read: Schools in Delhi not opening for now, says Arvind Kejriwal)Earlier, the Delhi government had announced schools here will remain closed till October 31 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, Delhi logged its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases, with 4,853 cases taking the capital’s tally to 364,341.Schools in several parts of the country have reopened, or will reopen in the next few days, for the first time since March.

We are beginning with the by-polls, in which we will do very well,” he said at a press conference.Akhilesh held the press conference to announce the entry of several senior BSP leaders and Congress leader and former union minister Salim Shervani into his party. This was the SP chief’s first formal press conference in Lucknow since the outbreak of Covid pandemic. Akhilesh said it would be his party’s endeavour to connect more and more people (from other parties) and accommodate them in his party as it prepares for the 2022 polls. When told that BJP leaders were holding rallies in UP by-poll constituencies while SP leaders were not going out, Akhilesh said: “Our people did work on the ground. You will see it in the results.” Attacking the BJP government over crime against women, Akhilesh said: “In UP law and order has completely collapsed. I remember the apex court had once said all states should emulate the 1090 (women helpline)-like system.” He further said if all states had a response system like 1090, Dail 100 (which now is called 112) and if society was sensitised about women safety then the kind of crimes against women that have happened wouldn’t have happened. “I hold the government and chief minister responsible for all the crimes against women. What would you expect from the government that hides figures? There are innumerable incidents where the government did not do what it should have done. What you expect if the state’s chief minister says ‘Thok do (kill them)’,” Akhilesh said. He also accused the government of failing to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.“UP government decided that the disease would be less visible if tests were lesser. Cabinet ministers, members of assembly died, officers died, journalists died. And now the government is saying that we will have to live with Covid. If you and I have to live with Covid then why are our hospitals not proper?” he said. The former chief minister also blamed BJP for the new farm laws that have sparked unrest.“Just like the way people are distressed with Covid, farmers are distressed about their produce. This is the same BJP that had said that it would double farmers’ income. Today, paddy is being looted (purchased at low prices), whatever the farmer is producing is being looted. Everything is just slogans for BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-responsible-for-crimes-against-women-in-up-says-akhilesh-yadav/story-J3NxrNqj2lWAoYYudv09iM.html
28-10-2020||India||India’s Global Himalayan Expedition wins UN award for efforts to fight climate change amid Covid-19||An Indian organisation that leverages tourism and technology to help remote communities access solar energy has won a prestigious UN award for its efforts to combat climate change amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) is among the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Award. GHE is one of the world’s first organisations using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities. The recipients of the 2020 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards, announced Tuesday, bring focus to the best examples of what people across the globe are doing “to combat climate change in a year that has cast darkness upon so many.” According to a statement on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website, GHE is the one of the world’s first outfit using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities as recognised by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). In the Hindu Kush Region, there are more than 16 million people without access to basic energy mainly due to their geographic remoteness. GHE conducts “Impact Expeditions” to remote Himalayan villages and uses a portion of the expedition fee to fund the capital cost of the hardware, transportation, installation and training of village-scale solar micro-grids. The micro-grid infrastructure set up by GHE is owned and operated by the community. To date, the GHE has solar electrified more than 131 villages in three regions of India, directly impacting the lives of more than 60,000 villagers. More than 1,300 travellers from 60 different countries have been a part of these expeditions. Enabling livelihood through homestay tourism has generated over USD 114,000 in income for the villages, which represents a 45 per cent increase in the annual household income, the statement said. UNFCCC said this year’s award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil societies as a whole. They range from the Caribbean’s only carbon-neutral hotel to the world’s first platform fully dedicated to green bonds to the first all-women solar team in Lebanon. Congratulating the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Awards, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the winners provide tangible proof that climate action is underway around the world. “It is exciting to see these climate solutions, which reinforce my call for decisive leadership on climate change by governments, businesses and cities, and for a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us keep pressing ahead to build a more sustainable and equitable future for all,” he said. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the last eight months have been a nightmare for many throughout the world. “Covid-19 has altered lives, economies and the nature of business on every continent -- from the largest cities to the smallest villages. It is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term,” said Espinosa. Espinosa said the convergence of these two crisis has opened a window of opportunity to build forward, to build cities and communities that are safe, healthy, green and sustainable. “Nothing exemplifies this better than the efforts of our 2020 award-winning activities to address climate change.” The award announcement is part of the wider effort to mobilise action and ambition as national governments work toward implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN Global Climate Action Awards are spearheaded by the Momentum for Change initiative at UN Climate Change. The projects are recognised as innovative solutions that not only address climate change but also help drive progress on many other sustainable development goals. The 2020 winning activities were selected by an international advisory panel as part of the UN Climate Change’s Momentum for Change initiative. “It is crucial we celebrate all actors who are leading the way,” said Gabrielle Ginér, Chair of the Advisory Panel. “The recipients of the UN Global Climate Action Awards send a strong political signal to all nations, and through their leadership and creativity, we see essential change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-global-himalayan-expedition-wins-un-award-for-efforts-to-fight-climate-change-amid-covid-19/story-OKgkBK1D69tdQdU4qnAOqL.html

The ministry’s 2019-20 data showed that 26.3% women in Assam, who are in the 15-49 years’ age category, consume alcohol, which is the highest among all states and union territories (UTs).

Bhagat said a decision in this regard was taken at the core committee meeting of the party recently. He said letters have also been sent in this regard to all the ministers and they have also been communicated about the same on phone. The election has to be held before March 2022.“I have asked ministers to spend at least one night in their respective areas, meet district officials, party workers and the people.

28-10-2020||India||China says border standoff is bilateral issue, criticises Mike Pompeo’s remarks||China on Wednesday reacted sharply to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s remarks targeting the Chinese government and backing India in facing challenges to its sovereignty, saying the comments “instigated China’s relations with other countries”. Describing the boundary issue as a “bilateral matter between China and India”, the Chinese embassy said in a statement that there is “no space for a third party to intervene” in the matter. Pompeo told the media after the India-US 2+2 dialogue on Tuesday that Washington will stand by New Delhi in confronting threats to India’s sovereignty. He also referred to the “pandemic that came from Wuhan” and described the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as “no friend to democracy [and] the rule of law”. Also Read: 2+2 meeting: Pompeo says US will stand with India to face threats to sovereignty, libertyThe Chinese embassy expressed its “firm opposition” to the remarks by Pompeo and US defence secretary Mark Esper, and said they had “repeated old lies, attacked and made allegations against China, violated the norms of international relations and basic principles of diplomacy, [and] instigated China’s relations with other countries in the region”. The remarks, the statement saiadded, “again exposed their Cold War mentality and ideological bias”. The Chinese embassy stopped short of criticising India directly in any way. During the media interaction after the 2+2 meeting, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh hadn’t mentioned China in their remarks. The statement said the “boundary question is a bilateral matter between China and India”, and the two sides had been discussing disengagement and de-escalation in the border areas through diplomatic and military channels. “China and India have the wisdom and ability to handle their differences properly. There’s no space for a third party to intervene,” it said. Pompeo’s remarks came against the backdrop of the India-China military standoff in Ladakh region, which is set to enter its seventh month. Both sides have arrayed more than 50,000 troops each at friction points along the Line of Actual Control, and the forces are expected to remain deployed at the disputed border through the harsh winter. Pompeo also made a pointed reference to the 20 Indian soldiers “killed by PLA forces in Galwan Valley in June”, and said the US and India are “taking steps to strengthen our cooperation against all manner of threats”. Also Read: BECA done, fighters and armed drones next as India turns US positiveThe Chinese statement, however, contended Beijing has been “unswervingly committed to peaceful development and developed friendly cooperation with our neighbours based on mutual respect”. “China has always upheld multilateralism and remained committed to maintaining an international system with the United Nations at its core and an international order based on international law. China resolutely opposes behaviour of engaging in unilateralism and bullying,” it added. By “hyping up the so-called ‘China threat’”, the statement said, the US is “making pretexts for maintaining its global hegemony and containing China’s development”. The statement further contended that the Indo-Pacific strategy proposed by the US is meant to “stir up confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition” to maintain the dominance of Washington and organise “closed and exclusive ideological cliques”. The statement said the CPC’s leadership is a choice of the people, who had “achieved strategic victory in fighting the [Coronavirus]”. It cited surveys conducted by international institutions to say the Chinese people’s satisfaction and trust towards the CPC-led government “exceed 90 percent”. “Anyone who turns a blind eye to the fact that the CPC is endorsed and supported by the Chinese people or wantonly slanders the CPC is openly standing on the opposite side of the Chinese people,” the statement said. China accused the US of again trying to “shift the blame onto China on Covid-19” and expressed the hope that US politicians would focus on “their own epidemic response and saving lives”. “We urge the US side to respect facts and truth, abandon the Cold War and the zero-sum mentality, stop hyping up the so-called ‘China threat’, and stop the wrong actions that undermine regional peace and stability,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-says-border-standoff-is-bilateral-issue-criticises-mike-pompeo-s-remarks/story-D22Xc7OoWEVPpGigjUnVAM.html

Customs and the Enforcement Directorate opposed his bail plea saying that he was aware of the smuggling activities of Swapna Suresh. Soon after his bail plea was rejected, the ED detained him.Once a very powerful bureaucrat, Sivasankar fell from grace after his name got linked to the gold smuggling case. On Wednesday, he was detained from the Ayurveda hospital where he was admitted for treatment. When Sivasankar got hospitalised, the customs said he was pretending illness to escape grilling by the agencies.Also Read: Kerala CM’s former secretary’s arrest barred till October 28 in gold smuggling caseEarlier, the ED had claimed that there were attempts to bail Swapna Suresh out after the seizure of gold hidden in a bag camouflaged as a diplomatic baggage that came to the UAE consulate in the state capital. The agency has also accused Sivasankar of helping the main accused in money laundering. But Sivasankar told the court that he had been grilled for more than 90 hours and none of the agencies could implicate him in the case.The sensational gold smuggling case surfaced on July 5 after 30 kg of yellow metal was seized by the customs from a package camouflaged as diplomatic consignment addressed to the UAE consulate.Later P Sarith Kumar, a former public relations officer of the consulate who came to receive the luggage, was arrested by the customs.

28-10-2020||India||RS polls: 8 BJP candidates file nomination in UP; Varanasi lawyer springs surprise by filing papers at last minute||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) eight candidates filed their nomination papers for the upcoming Rajya Sabha (RS) polls from Uttar Pradesh (UP) on Tuesday.However, the buzz around the party fielding a ninth candidate at the last minute turned out to be a damp squib. The dramatic last-minute filing of nomination papers of a lawyer from Varanasi – only 10 minutes before the process drew to a close – has set up the contest for the 10th RS seat from UP.The elections are slated to be held on November 9 amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the results will be declared on the same day. Also read | RS polls set to push up BJP tally in HouseLawyer Prakash Bajaj filed his nomination papers at 2.50 pm on Tuesday and his candidature was supported by 10 lawmakers from the Samajwadi Party (SP).The move implies that there will be a contest for the 10th vacant RS seat from UP. The Bahujan Samaj Party’s (BSP) Ramji Gautam, the party’s national coordinator and Bihar in-charge, is the other contender for the 10th RS seat. “Now, unless a candidate pulls out by November 3, the last date for withdrawal of nominations, or is disqualified, 11 aspirants will fight for 10 (RS) seats,” said Pradeep Dubey, principal secretary, UP Vidhan Sabha. Each candidate will require around 37 votes for an outright win. The BJP and the SP have 304 and 48 members in the UP legislative assembly (MLAs), respectively, and can ensure the victory of their candidates on their own strength.Gautam will contest against Bajaj, who is fighting as an independent candidate and enjoys the support of at least 10 SP lawmakers. “Bajaj has exposed the tacit understanding between the BJP and the BSP,” said IP Singh, who belongs to the SP. Gautam is likely to find the going tough, as the BSP has only 18 lawmakers in the 403-member UP assembly. At present, the assembly’s strength is 395.The BJP, which did not field a ninth candidate despite a few surplus votes and was purportedly assured the support of some opposition lawmakers, had bolstered Gautam’s chances.However, the electoral arithmetic was drastically altered because of Bajaj’s entry on Tuesday.“The move suits the BJP. It can always market its decision to not field a candidate against BSP’s Dalit candidate, while targeting the SP as an anti-Dalit party. The new political formations make it abundantly clear that in the 2022 UP assembly polls, the SP and BSP will contest against each other unlike in 2017. The BJP will relish the prospect, as it seeks to reap benefits owing to a lack of opposition unity,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist. A few SP and BSP MLAs are also in cahoots with the BJP such as Nitin Agarwal and Ramvir Upadhaya, who belong to SP and the BSP, respectively. Ramvir’s son Chiragvir and Nitin Agarwal’s father Naresh Agarwal have also switched to the BJP. BSP MLA Anil Singh has also rebelled against his party. Another BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari has been languishing in a Punjab jail for the past 22 months over multiple criminal charges. The Congress, too, has a couple of lawmakers, who have defied the party line in the past. Political observers feel that BJP holds the edge in peddling influence over the outcome of the 10th RS seat from UP. Apna Dal (Sonelal), which has nine lawmakers, followed by the Congress (7), Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) (4), Independents (3), Rashtriya Lok Dal (1) and Nishad Party (1) make up the representations of the other parties in the UP assembly. Earlier on Tuesday, the eight BJP candidates, including three sitting RS members from UP such as Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, former Ballia Member of Parliament (MP) Neeraj Shekhar, the son of late Prime Minister Chandrashekhar, and party’s general secretary Arun Singh, whose term had expired on November 25, filed their nomination papers in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma among others.UP minister Haridwar Dubey, three-time MLA Seema Dwivedi, both Brahmins, and former director-general of police (DGP) Brij Lal, a Dalit, are the new BJP nominees for the vacant RS seats from the state. Two other backward caste (OBC) candidates such as the party’s former Auraiya district chief Geeta Shakya and BL Verma have also been nominated to the Upper House of Parliament. Verma is the UP BJP vice-president and also the chairman of UP State Construction and Infrastructure Development Corporation (UPSCIDC) Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-polls-8-bjp-candidates-file-nomination-in-up-varanasi-lawyer-springs-surprise-by-filing-papers-at-last-minute/story-ZTLjvRWmtnj81MvywC9g6L.html

The court has also summoned the Investigating Officer (IO) in the case for an explanation. Special CBI judge Sanjeev Aggarwal, in his order on in September 26, had posed a series of questions to the agency regarding its slow pace of investigation in the high profile case, while asking it to file a status report on the probe which has been lingering on for over three years. The judge had asked CBI why it was dragging its feet in a case involving the roles of two of its ex-directors, which may lead to an inference that it was not very keen to investigate them.Also Read: Court asks why three former CBI chiefs not questioned in graft case“….it is apparent that in fact in this case, role of two of its ex-directors is under scanner i.e. AP Singh and Ranjit Sinha, along with alleged middleman Moin Akhtar Qureshi, which needs upfront i.e. frank and honest investigations,” the judge said on September 26. On Tuesday, CBI sought more time to file the status report. The judge in his order summoning the IO and JD, on Tuesday, said that, “...it is expected from the premier investigating agency/CBI that they would candidly answer the queries/issues raised by this court provisionally on the last date of hearing, considering the fact that some of the queries pertain to the role of two of its ex-directors—AP Singh and Ranjit Sinha—along with alleged middleman Moin Akhtar Qureshi”. “However, considering the peculiar circumstances, let the IO along with the concerned JD, CBI, who is supervising the investigations of this case, be summoned for the next date of hearing for answering the queries raise in order dated September 26,” the order said on Tuesday. Qureshi used to collect money from individuals directly or through Hyderabad-based businessman Sathish Sana Babu and used the funds “for influencing probes” by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said after a probe in 2019. Qureshi was arrested in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moin-qureshi-case-cbi-joint-director-investigating-officer-asked-to-explain-slow-progress/story-TOa5ISVfnrvCpyIBPl3y5N.html

The minister’s address is expected to touch on different aspects such as the security situation along the borders, modernisation of the armed forces and achieving self-reliance in the defence sector. The four-day conference, chaired by army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, began on October 26. The country is currently locked in a border dispute with China in the Ladakh theatre and the next round of military talks to reduce friction is expected soon.The situation in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where the army is preparing for a long haul, will be discussed during the conference. The border row is in its sixth month and efforts to disengage and de-escalate have yielded no results. The eighth round of military talks between corps commander-ranked officers to reduce border tensions is expected to be held shortly. Also Read: Indian Air Force to get a big Rafale boost, 16 fighters to land by AprilIndian and Chinese military commanders met for the seventh time on October 12 in their latest attempt to defuse tensions. The Indian side demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of the status quo ante of early April during the talks. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre, said a joint press statement issued a day after the talks. “The first day of the conference was spent deliberating on matters related to human resource management…And today’s [Wednesday’s] schedule includes in-depth discussions on the various agenda points projected by the various army commanders, including an update by CINCAN (Commander-in-Chief of Andaman and Nicobar Command),” the officials said. The officials said the top brass will get an update from the Director General of Border Roads (DGBR) on the various infrastructure development projects being undertaken by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and allied formations in the forward areas. The BRO has been working on a war footing to execute key projects despite the ongoing border row with China and the Covid-19 pandemic.As India remains focused on scaling up its border infrastructure despite the ongoing border tensions, Singh, earlier this month, dedicated 44 bridges in forward areas to the country, including 10 in Jammu and Kashmir, eight each in Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, two in Himachal Pradesh and four in Sikkim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-to-address-top-brass-at-army-commanders-conference/story-qkcnV3vjdUUtvMscoya1PJ.html

Air quality index (AQI) between 201-300 and 301-400 are considered poor and very poor category, respectively.Stubble fires contributed to 23% of Delhi’s particulate matter (PM) 2.5 load on Wednesday, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).But wind speed is likely to reduce from Wednesday, while the wind direction will continue to remain north-westerly.“Wind speed increased to about 18 kilometres per hour (kmph) on Tuesday ,the Safdarjung weather bureau showed. and, as a result, the impact of stubble fires was not felt as much. Wind speed will reduce from Wednesday, but wind direction will remain north-westerly. Consequently, air quality is likely to worsen,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Conditions are becoming favourable for withdrawal of monsoon from the country and for commencement of north-east monsoon rainfall over parts of extreme southern peninsula on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).A cyclonic circulation lies over the south-west Bay of Bengal off north Tamil Nadu (TN) coast. Under its influence widespread and heavy rainfall and moderate thunderstorm and lightning is likely to occur over Kerala, Mahe, TN and Puducherry during the next five days. Normally, monsoon withdraws from the country by October 15.Meanwhile, night temperatures in most parts of north-west India were recorded 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (C) below normal. Tuesday’s minimum temperature in Karnal was 12.6 degrees C, 2 degrees below normal.

28-10-2020||India||Piyush Goyal calls upon global community to ensure timely, equitable availability of Covid-19 vaccines||The Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal has called upon the global community to ensure timely and equitable availability of vaccines and medicines for Covid-19, in sufficient quantities and affordable prices.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19In his intervention at the virtual informal meeting of WTO Ministers held on Tuesday, he said that India and South Africa have proposed TRIPS waiver to address the challenges that countries with limited manufacturing capacity will face, in accessing these medical supplies. He called upon all Members to support the proposal, in order to have a decision on it by Ministerial Conference 12 (MC), if not earlier.Goyal said that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought out the inherent weaknesses and inequalities in the global economic & trading system. “The need of the hour is to take effective measures to address the immediate challenges, and also prepare a long-term roadmap on how to reform an ailing and imbalanced global trading system,” he said.Goyal said that India believes that every crisis presents big opportunities for new and innovative pathways to progress. He said that meaningful and equitable reform requires us to re-imagine the multilateral trading system and fix what has not worked in the last 25 years.“We are always ready to engage constructively with other WTO Members to protect human life and work towards restoring inclusive and sustainable global economic growth,” Union Minister added.Goyal said that the pandemic has also highlighted the need for easier cross-border movement of health care professionals. “A multilateral initiative that provides for easier access to medical services under mode-4 needs to be launched immediately and we should aim to deliver this outcome by MC12,” he said.On the issue of ongoing fisheries subsidy negotiations, the Minister stated that the negotiations should address the problem of industrial fishing by some nations that has led to a major depletion of the global fish stock.Goyal said that members, who have provided and continue to provide large subsidies, must make the highest contributions in line with the ‘Polluter Pays” principle. “We should not repeat the mistakes made during the Uruguay Round negotiations, that allowed unequal and trade-distorting entitlements for select members, while unfairly constraining the less developed member countries who did not have the capacity to support their farmers at that point of time,” he said.He said that India will not accept any attempts to restrict the flexibilities and policy space that developing countries need to better integrate with the global trading system.“In fact, we should open more opportunities for the less developed and developing countries, taking into account the contrasting levels of prosperity, unequal levels of economic development and vast disparity in human development indicators amongst nations, so that global trade is fair and sustainable,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/piyush-goyal-calls-upon-global-community-to-ensure-timely-equitable-availability-of-covid-19-vaccines/story-A5Do7xT3YkKJiIlY8JoFbK.html
28-10-2020||India||Ahead of MP assembly bypolls, Shivraj Singh Chouhan announces memorial for Padmavati||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday announced a memorial to be built in Bhopal to commemorate legendary queen Padmavati. Chouhan’s announcement on the memorial during a ‘shastra pooja’ (worship of weapon) programme organised by the Rajput community in Indore on Tuesday came almost three years after he announced a ban on the Bollywood film Padmaavat and a memorial for Padmavati. He had also announced that a chapter on the legendary queen will be included in the school syllabus in the state. “I have reserved a piece of land at Manuabhan ki Tekari in Bhopal for the memorial on Maharani Padmavati. A grand memorial will be built over there,” Chouhan said.Reiterating his announcement to include a chapter on Padmavati in the school syllabus from the next session Chouhan said, “Besides, two prizes carrying Rs 2 lakh cash and a citation each to be named after legendary warrior Maharana Pratap and Rani Padmavati as ‘Maharana Shourya Puruskar’ and ‘Padmini Puruskar’ will be instituted.” Chouhan also attacked filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali and said the film was “a blow to the society’s honour”. The CM also announced withdrawal of criminal cases lodged against protesters in 2018 for protesting against the movie. Bhansali’s film on Padmavati had faced stiff resistance from Rajput organizations which alleged that it distorted history.While Chouhan was making the announcements some members of the gathering including women shouted slogans against caste-based reservations. They also said, “Mamaji (As Chouhan calls himself Mama of children of the state) we want jobs.” Chouhan during a programme organised by SC/ST government employees in 2016 had announced that “duniya ki koi taqat, koi mai ka laal aarakshan khatam nahi kar sakta (no one in the world can do away with reservation). That statement which agitated mainly upper castes people particularly in Gwalior-Chambal region cost the BJP dear in 2018 assembly elections as the video clip containing the speech did the rounds ahead of polls. The party suffered a major setback in the region having managed to win only 7 seats against the Congress’ 26 whereas it had won 20 seats against the Congress’ 12 in 2013 assembly elections. Out of the 28 assembly seats where bypolls are going to be held, 16 of the constituencies fall under the same region. The opposition Congress dismissed Chouhan’s announcement as a publicity stunt to woo a particular section of voters ahead of bypolls.“Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should also make it clear as to what stopped him from implementing his own announcements on Rani Padmavati when he himself was the chief minister in 2017 and 2018 as well. What can be more unfortunate than playing politics in the name of legendary warriors of our country? He should at least spare the great personalities of the country and not use them as means to garner votes,” Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-mp-assembly-bypolls-shivraj-singh-chouhan-announces-memorial-for-padmavati/story-Rjd71hBNkECl3UC6BraCGP.html
28-10-2020||India||Indian Air Force to get a big Rafale boost, 16 fighters to land by April||The Indian Air Force’s strike capability is set for a boost with 16 omni-role Rafale jet fighters to be inducted into the Golden Arrows squadron by April 2021 and with France’s biggest jet engine maker Safran ready to make fighter engines and ancillaries in India, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Five Rafale jets flew to the Ambala airbase via Abu Dhabi on July 29 and have already been inducted into the IAF’s Squadron 17. The next batch of three Rafales will arrive in Ambala on November 5 directly from the Bordeaux-Merignac facility (there will be no stop as they will be fuelled mid-air), according to senior government officials. Seven Rafale fighters are already being used for IAF fighter pilot training in France.Three more Rafales will arrive in January, another three in March and seven in April, taking the total number of fighters handed over to the IAF to 21 single-seat fighters and seven twin-seat trainer fighters. This means that by April next year, the Golden Arrows squadron will be complete with 18 fighters and the remaining three can be sent to the Hashimara airbase in north Bengal’s Alipurduar to counter the threat posed by China on the eastern front. All the fighters are equipped with Mica and Meteor air-to-air missiles along with Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles. India has now requested Safran for the air-to-ground modular weapon known as Hammer with a 250kg warhead.While France is willing to offer more Rafale fighters to India, Safran’s offer of making the Snecma M88 engines in India, four years from the day the contract is signed, is a welcome proposal, said the officials cited above. Also Watch l How Rafale jets will impact India-China LAC tussle: Lt Gen DS Hooda explainsNot only will the M-88 engines be used by Rafale fighters but these can also be deployed to power Light Combat Aircraft Mark II and twin-engine advanced multi-role combat aircraft developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The IAF plans to buy 83 LCA Mark I A jets, taking the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. Safran is said to be willing to offer engines with no third-country spare parts so that no additional approvals are needed, and with 100% indigenisation. The French offer may come up for discussion during foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s visit to France, the UK and Germany, starting from Paris this Thursday. While DRDO can continue developing its own fighter engine, the Safran engine will fill the gap between development and manufacture. Only the US, Russia and France have the capacity to produce fighter jet engines, with China still using the Russian RD-93 and RD-33 engines to power its jet fighters such as the J-31 and the JF-17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-air-force-to-get-a-big-rafale-boost-16-fighters-to-land-by-april/story-Ezh1Pt1Co5frHnWI89LK7M.html

The Prime Minister’s Office has also sought inputs on steps to improve governance, addressing the issue of regional imbalance as a “challenge to Atmanirbharta” and ways to promote the government’s call for “vocal for local” and “local for global.” It has also sought ideas on expanding the MSME sectors and addressing issues of “quality of policies, products and processes.” The questionnaire sent by the PMO, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times has to be submitted by all ministries by October 28, according to officials aware of the development. “India’s GDP is concentrated in major industrial hubs in West and South India and hence there are vast inter regional and intra-regional development gaps. Under Aatmanirbhar Bharat scheme the government aims to bridge the gap and set up new industries in these underdeveloped areas,” a senior official said. “The government has decided to be more aggressive to address the issue of significant trade imbalance and the strategic implications of the same. Therefore, the government should look at two things; ending imports of lower end products like pens, mouse pads etc, which we are being imported from China. Domestic production can easily take over such products. The second should be to focus on high-end products such as laptops and smartphones manufacturing with strategies such as Phased Manufacturing plan, which was highly successful in building India’s auto industry,” said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president of the Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research (CDEP), a think tank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmo-seeks-ideas-to-boost-self-reliance/story-KEWK0iP4n80kYGMoVwmI7O.html

A second official said the government’s focus is now to incentivise ‘Make in India’ and make India a global manufacturing hub for those who want to shift their base from China with a prime focus on employment generation.PM has been briefed about a proposal to extend production-linked incentive (PLI) to six-seven manufacturing sectors and contours of another stimulus to boost demand, the official said. Proposals for PLI schemes are ready for sectors such as automobiles, electronics, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, textiles, food processing, white goods and speciality steel, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-sitharaman-take-stock-of-economy-as-centre/story-cXLqWTtYVWnO1gz5NaIZGM.html
28-10-2020||India||‘17% Covid deaths linked to pollution’||Around 17% of deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India could be linked to long-term exposure to air pollution, higher than the 15% seen on average across the world, according to a study published in the journal Cardiovascular Research on Tuesday. The analysis was based on study of air quality data and distribution of fatalities across the world till the third week of June, which the researchers used to calculate a Covid-19 mortality rate attributable to pollution. The highest proportion of these was in Czech Republic (29%), Poland (28%), and China (27%).In terms of global regions, East Asia had the highest proportion of such deaths at 27%, followed by Central Europe and America where nearly 25% of the deaths in each of the regions were attributed to air pollution by the study. The authors say that these are proportion of deaths that could have been avoided if the populations had been exposed to lower levels of air pollution. “...Attributable fraction does not imply a direct cause-effect relationship between air pollution and Covid-19 mortality (although it is possible). Instead it refers to relationships between two, direct and indirect, i.e. by aggravating co-morbidities [other health conditions] that could lead to fatal health outcomes of the virus infection.” “When people inhale polluted air, the very small polluting particles, the PM2.5, migrate from the lungs to the blood and blood vessels, causing inflammation and severe oxidative stress... This causes damage to the inner lining of arteries, the endothelium, and leads to the narrowing and stiffening of the arteries. The Covid-19 virus also enters the body via the lungs, causing similar damage to blood vessels, and it is now considered to be an endothelial disease,” said Professor Thomas Münzel one of the authors of the paper from the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany in a release. In India, experts have warned of air pollution leading to such outcomes, Covid-19 infections severe. “This will be the first winter we will see Covid-19 in India, we still do not know how it will play out. However, like every other year, we will see an aggravation of symptoms in people with existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases with the dip in temperature and increase in pollution levels. And, a person with compromised lung function is much more likely to have a severe course of Covid-19 infection as compared to a healthy person,” said Dr Anant Mohan, head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-covid-deaths-linked-to-pollution/story-Qzy3z5rn54OH3hCHIUlQ6O.html

The EC told Nath that the use of the word “item” to address a woman “constitutes a violation” of the advisory issued by the poll body relating to the model code of conduct. Nath’s remark had triggered outrage, with BJP leaders, led by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, staging protests against the Congress leader. Meanwhile, the EC also issued a notice to BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya to explain his “chunnu-munnu” remark (a term used to refer to children) for Congress leaders Nath and Digvijaya Singh during an election rally in Indore’s Sanwer, where he also called them “gaddar” (traitors).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-pulls-up-kamal-nath-over-remark/story-I9DqIKI0VlRQ5fRSNmrm4N.html

The poor of our country will never compromise on honesty and self-respect. With PM SVANidhi, the poor have set an example of honesty before the nation,” Modi said in a video message, addressing beneficiaries of the PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme at 651 locations in Uttar Pradesh. His comments came a day before the first round of the three-phase Bihar elections beginning Tuesday.Modi used the occasion to urge people to follow social distancing norms and use masks in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. “When Covid-19 attacked, there were apprehensions around the world. All efforts of the government focused on how to minimise people’s hardships…the Garib Kalyan Yojna involving ₹1.70 lakh crore was launched. The focus of the scheme was that no one should sleep hungry. Subsequently, an economic package of ₹20 lakh crore was also launched. The common man has proved that s/he has the strength to overcome big problems,” he added. Modi said the poor have been linked to the banking system and loans have been given to street vendors who are repaying them in time. “…Uttar Pradesh is number one in the country in benefitting people under the PM SVANidhi scheme. The largest number of street vendors has applied from this state,” he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who was present at the programme, praised the PM for his guidance in the “successful” fight against Covid-19. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesman Ashok Singh said the PM was only trying to divert attention of people ahead of elections. He accused the Modi government of not doing enough to generate employment opportunities for the youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-hails-street-vendors-slams-oppn/story-m2M6RrmAUu2yIIyU52o1dK.html
28-10-2020||India||Bihar is in distress, govt arrogant, time for change: Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said “change is in the air” in Bihar, and attacked the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the state for its “dictatorial governance” that “has plunged the state into deep distress”. In a four-and-a-half-minute-long video message released a day ahead of the polling for the first phase of the assembly elections, Gandhi appealed to the people of Bihar to vote for the Mahagathbandhan, or Grand Alliance . “The government in Bihar is steeped in power and arrogance and has strayed from its path. Neither its words nor its actions are good. Workers are helpless, farmers are distressed and young people are disappointed. The fragile state of the economy is impacting the lives of the people. Dalits, Mahadalits and backward sections of the society have been left on the brink of destitution,” she said in the message. “The voice of the people of Bihar is with the grand alliance of the Congress. This is the call of Bihar today,” Gandhi added. Attacking the Centre and the Bihar government, Gandhi said all sections of the society, and especially young people, farmers and traders, are suffering due to decisions such as demonetisation,and a prolonged Covid lockdown. “The people of Bihar are ready to create a new Bihar for the next generation,” she said. The Grand Alliances comprises the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Congress, and the Left parties.Voting will take place on Wednesday in seventy-one of the 243 seats in the state. The second phase of polling is on November 3, and the third phase on November 7. The results will be declared on November 10. “Bihar has the skill, talent and capabilities but unemployment, migration, inflation and starvation have given the people only tears and blisters on their feet. Words that cannot be spoken are said with tears. Policies and governments cannot be formed on the basis of fear,” Gandhi said. “Bihar is a mirror of India. It is also a hope and pride of India. Today, Bihar is getting ready for a change for its glory and future. That is why I said that change is in the air in Bihar,” she added. BJP’s national spokesperson Guruprakash said the Congress as no locus standi to comment on Bihar as the state saw the worst years under its rule. “For 55 of the last 73 years, the state has seen the misrule of the Congress and its allies. When we (NDA) inherited Bihar the rate of crime was at an all-time high and today the data from the national crime records bureau has put Bihar at the 23rd position. There has been a huge change in the situation, people are no long scared to step out after 6 p.m. as was the case during the Congress-RJD years.”Guruprakash also criticised Gandhi’s allegation that the Dalits and the Mahadalits are oppressed in Bihar. “For her the Dalits of Punjab and Rajasthan are not Dalits. When a six-year old Dalit girl from Bihar was allegedly raped and burnt alive in Punjab where was the selective outrage brigade of the Congress,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-is-in-distress-govt-arrogant-time-for-change-sonia-gandhi/story-ees3fmBCzWzPWHbFHiV5YO.html
28-10-2020||India||Judges shocked as SC lawyer appears shirtless at hearing||A lawyer on Tuesday appeared at a virtual hearing before a Supreme Court bench without his shirt on, prompting the surprised justices to bemoan the lack of decorum, and India’s second most senior law officer to describe the incident as “unpardonable”.The image of the lawyer, Suvidutt, an advocate on record who was appearing for website OpIndia in a public interest limitation matter involving news channel Sudarshan TV, flashed for a few seconds when the hearing began on Monday before a bench of justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee. Surprised by his appearance, justice Chandrachud asked: “Who is this lawyer?”The lawyer appeared to realise his mistake, and put on a shirt, but logged out soon after without offering an explanation to the bench.Justice Chandrachud told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing in the case for the Union government, that it was important that caution be exercised when coming before the court. “I am not one who takes action against lawyers but this is a Court for all purposes. Some decorum has to be maintained by lawyers while appearing before us. Caution must be taken in future,” justice Chandrachud said.Mehta described the episode as “unpardonable”.When contacted, Suvidutt declined to comment. He wrote to Solicitor General offering an explanation for his conduct and expressed a sincere apology for what had happened.Advocate Shivaji Jadhav, president of the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association, said no complaint was sent to them in this regard. “It appears to be a mistake by the lawyer for which he should offer apology. At the same time, we must understand that such things can happen during a virtual court proceeding,” he said.Ever since proceedings of the Supreme Court and several high courts have switched to videoconferencing because of the Covid pandemic, there have been instances of lack of decorum during hearings, with some lawyers seen eating food, smoking, chewing gutkha, dressed casually, or lying on a bed. The Rajasthan high court in April this year reprimanded a lawyer who appeared to argue a bail matter in a vest. On September 24, a lawyer found smoking in a car during a Gujarat high court virtual hearing was slapped with a cost of Rs 10,000.In May, the Supreme Court secretary general Sanjeev S Kalgaonkar issued a notification allowing lawyers to shun their long robes and coats while appearing before the court through videoconferencing. While lawyers agreed that the need to maintain decorum during virtual court hearings was paramount, they pointed out that sometimes there is no advance notice of when they will become visible to the judges. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said: “The lawyers appearing before a court log in since morning and have to wait for hours before their case comes up.

28-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On June 21 (Dispatch 87), I wrote: “So, bored, tired, lonely perhaps, and physically, mentally, and emotionally weary, we let things slip. And the virus wins.”There’s a term for this,pandemic fatigue , and as the second wave roils Europe, and the third the US, everyone is talking about it.“Pandemic fatigue is real — and it’s spreading.” That’s in Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal. “Sick of Covid-19? Here’s why you might have pandemic fatigue.” That’s in the conversation.com from October 23. “As the Coronavirus surges, a new culprit emerges: Pandemic fatigue.” That’s from October 17’s New York Times.And on Monday, World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke of pandemic fatigue. “Working from home, children being schooled remotely, not being able to celebrate milestones with friends and family or not being there to mourn loved ones — it’s tough and the fatigue is real,” he said. The problem has become serious enough for WHO to, earlier in October, release a document titled “Pandemic fatigue: Reinvigorating the public to prevent Covid-19”. In the document, WHO actually defined pandemic fatigue.“Pandemic fatigue is... demotivation to follow recommended protective behaviours, emerging gradually over time and affected by a number of emotions, experiences and perceptions,” the document said.It “is expressed through an increasing number of people not sufficiently following recommendations and restrictions, decreasing their effort to keep themselves informed about the pandemic, and having lower risk perceptions related to Covid-19,” the document added.It would be alright if Covid fatigue involved merely how people feel; unfortunately, this also extends to how people behave, and it is behaviour that puts them and others at risk. Still worse, because their behaviour is directly correlated with a rise in infections, governments may be forced to react by imposing restrictions on movement and activities, even a partial lockdown (most countries are very averse to going down the total or hard lockdown path again). And when this happens, a population that is already in the grip of pandemic fatigue is unlikely to listen. That’s happening in Europe and the US, and it is happening in India too.So, what should governments and administrators do? As WHO’s DG put it on Monday: “We cannot give up… Leaders must balance the disruption to lives and livelihoods with the need to protect health workers and health systems as intensive care fills up.”Enforcement may not work in all cases and may end up being counterproductive.The problem will be familiar to behavioral economists, though. In 2012, Niranjan Rajadhyaksha, then Mint’s executive editor, wrote an article titled “How behavioural science can reduce deaths on railway tracks”.In the article, Rajadhyaksha detailed how Final Mile Consulting, a firm headed by Biju Dominic that used behavioural economics, cognitive neurology and anthropology to shape people’s behaviour, did this in one part of Mumbai – “The Final Mile team hung around the most lethal crossings for several weeks, melting into the crowd,” says Dominic, “like method actors living the character.” “They quickly noticed that the people crossing the tracks were overconfident, one of the biases that behavioural scientists say are hard-wired into our brains, the same bias that ensures that equity analysts overestimate corporate earnings or cigarette smokers refuse to believe they can be struck down by cancer” Rajadhyaksha wrote. It’s the same overconfidence that makes people believe that they are unlikely to contract Covid-19, or assume that they are safe because most people who do get infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms.I won’t tell you how Final Mile solved the rail crossing problem. You can read about it yourself by scanning the QR code with this column.The WHO document actually has some interesting pointers for administrators on how to “allow people to live their lives, but reduce the risk” — for it is the disruption to their lives that is perhaps the biggest contributor to pandemic fatigue. This involves: differentiating “between lower-risk and higher-risk activities”; guidelines on carrying “on with life while reducing the risk of transmission”; proactively planning for “end-of-the-year celebrations”; avoid cancelling all cultural events and find “creative solutions” to host them; and “avoid judgment and blame.” It’s always toughest to protect people from themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-uQzsTZtcZjkFsUKqmfHmQM.html
28-10-2020||India||Outsiders can now buy non-farm land in J&K||The Union home ministry on Tuesday notified rules allowing outsiders to buy non-agricultural land in Jammu & Kashmir more than a year after the region’s special status under Articles 370 and 35A was scrapped, and it was split into two Union territories.People from outside the state were barred from buying or owning immovable property there, settle permanently, or avail themselves of state-sponsored scholarship schemes before the nullification of Article 35A, which gave special rights to the Jammu & Kashmir’s permanent residents.Issuing a gazette notification, the government has omitted the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with the disposal of land in the Union territory.In subsection 2, the notification substitutes the “whole of the State” with the “whole of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir”. It also notifies to omit “being permanent resident of the State”, paving the way for everyone to buy land.Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said that agricultural land has been reserved for farmers.“Agricultural land has been reserved for farmers and no outsider is going to come into that. We are identifying industrial areas and we surely want that industries come here like other states of the country, so that this place is developed and youths get jobs,” Sinha said at a press conference.The notification evoked strong reactions from mainstream politicians of the region who said they would fight it as the order was aimed to disempower the people of J&K.“Unacceptable amendments to the land ownership laws of J&K. Even the tokenism of domicile has been done away with when purchasing non-agricultural land & transfer of agricultural land has been made easier. J&K is now up for sale & the poorer small land holding owners will suffer,” tweeted National Conference vice-president and former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah.“Interesting that the Centre waited till the elections to LAHDC had concluded & the BJP had won a majority before putting Ladakh up for sale. This is what Ladakhis got for trusting the assurances of the BJP,” Omar tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party won 15 out of 26 seats in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council on Monday.Peoples Democratic Party president and vice-president of the People’s Alliance for the Gupkar declaration, Mehbooba Mufti, said the order was aimed at disempowering local people.“Yet another step that’s part of GOI’s nefarious designs to disempower & disenfranchise people of J&K. From the unconstitutional scrapping of Article 370 to facilitating loot of our natural resources & finally putting land in J&K up for sale,” she tweeted.“After failing on all fronts to provide roti & rozgar to people, BJP is creating such laws to whet the appetite of a gullible electorate. Such brazen measures reinforces the need of people of all three provinces of J&K to fight unitedly,” she tweeted further.The J&K unit of the BJP said the move would bring about development in the region. The J&K Peoples Conference said, “We are awaiting a collective response on this matter.”Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had assured former legislators of J&K who met them under the leadership of Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari that concerns of the people vis-a-vis land and jobs would be taken seriously.Bukhari on Tuesday reiterated his party’s position vis-à-vis the restoration of statehood to J&K along with comprehensive domicile rights on land and jobs for its residents.“The party will go through the gazette notification issued by the Union government today with regard to land rights in J&K and would take up its reservations before the top leadership in the country,” he said, adding that any laws that do not safeguard the interests and rights of people of J&K would be unacceptable to the party. “Better would have been such laws of urgent nature should have been left to or dealt with in consultation with the duly elected government in Jammu & Kashmir,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outsiders-can-now-buy-non-farm-land-in-j-k/story-ue4rl9dDSVYgVLkbQP5vvL.html
28-10-2020||India||Some evidence shows children could be Covid spreaders: ICMR||There is some evidence which shows that children who were earlier thought to be protected against coronavirus infection can be “spreaders, rather than super-spreaders”, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday.Speaking on the coronavirus infection spread in the country among children, Bhargava said tat overall the figure in India is that below the age of 17 years, only 8 per cent are Covid-19 positive.“Below five years, the figure would probably be less than a per cent but then we can come back with a figure for this,” he said.  In response to a question over surge in cases among children in Mizoram,  there are 315 active coronavirus cases in the state as on date.  Over Kawasaki disease and presumably a link with Covid-19, Bhargava said India so far has not reported any cases of Kawasaki disease among Covid-19 patients.Kawasaki is an auto-immune disease that affects children who are less than five years of age and presents with fever, Thrombocytosis and a condition in which the arteries of the heart become dilated and aneurysm. So this is a rare condition which affects more males than females. The disease is more common in the US and less common in India, Bhargava said at a press briefing.“This has been described with Covid-19 in different parts of the world. I don’t think we have had any experience of Kawasaki with Covid-19 in India so far. It is a very rare condition. “Having said that we have to remember that it affects small children and the arteries of the heart get dilated and clots can form in that and it can lead to heart attacks and can also be harmful for the child,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-evidence-shows-children-could-be-covid-spreaders-icmr/story-s3LOFhGpHaomc7nnwLIslI.html

On Sunday, after a portion of construction work of the house was over, six of the workers had consumed the brew prepared by building contractor Kalia Dehury in the forests of Pathargada village.“After consuming the liquor, all of them fell sick. Soon after labourers Kaira Pradhan (20) and Tukuna Pradhan (30) died. Later, head mason Sashi Kanta Dehury, too passed away in Angul district hospital on late Monday evening. On Tuesday, another labourer named Pramod Sahu too passed away,” said excise commissioner Anjan Manik.Angul Superintendent of Police Jagmohan Meena said building contractor Kalia Dehury has been arrested in the case while another accused Basant Dehury has been admitted to hospital in a critical condition. “Post-mortem of two bodies has been conducted and their viscera have been preserved and blood samples of the victims have been collected to ascertain the cause of death,” he said. Two others who had consumed the brew have been admitted to a government hospital in Angul in a critical condition.Meanwhile, district excise officials along with local police visited the village and have started an inquiry into the matter. A case in this regard has been lodged at Purunakote police station under Sections 272, 273, 304, 323 and 325 of IPCThis is the first liquor tragedy in Odisha this year.

28-10-2020||India||Before PM’s visit, Tejashwi asks key questions on Bihar’s development, migration woes||Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second leg of campaigning in Patna and north Bihar districts, leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Tuesday put forth questions in the public domain on various issues regarding the state’s development and promises made by the BJP-JD (U) led NDA government. In the first question, he asked, the PM should answer why the announcement of construction of AIIMS, Darbhanga was made just before the election even though the project was announced way back in 2015. The opposition leader wondered whether the PM would talk on the Muzaffarpur shelter home sex abuse case and also sought to know why the construction of a super specialty hospital at Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur was not fulfilled and appointment of doctors not made. He also put forth a question to the PM about why migrants were stopped from coming to Bihar during the Covid-19 induced lockdown and why migration has remained unabated in the state in the last 15 years of NDA rule. Besides, he also said the PM should give a reply as to why Bihar continues to have such a huge unemployed workforce and how many jobs had been generated in Bihar during the six year tenure of the NDA government at the Centre and 15 years of rule in Bihar. Later in the evening, Tejashwi took potshots at the state government accusing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of not setting up good schools and ignoring higher education facility citing it as a reason for the migration of students to other states and flight of capital from Bihar in the education sector. “If Bihar had good education facilities, why would students go out of the state? People of the state are spending big money for education of their wards in other states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-pm-s-visit-tejashwi-asks-key-questions-on-bihar-s-development-migration-woes/story-wB3I24wGbBVcj8wby5IaYM.html
28-10-2020||India||Lok Sabha evaluates how many of House panel ideas adopted||New Delhi The Lok Sabha has decided to examine the “strike rate” of parliamentary committees, and see how many recommendations by these panels have been accepted by the government — an exercise undertaken by Speaker Om Birla at a time when the Opposition is up in arms against the Union government for allegedly attempting to push through legislation without in-depth scrutiny. An internal circular seeking data from different panels that has been seen by HT said: “Committee coordination branch should ascertain committee-wise percentage of implementation of the recommendations by the respective ministries/ departments and submit a report on the same.” The circular added that reports “presented during the 16th Lok Sabha (2014-2019) and so far during 17th Lok Sabha (2019-2020) from parliamentary committees” will be taken up. Parliament has 24 standing committees, out of which 16 come under the purview of the Lower House and the rest under the authority of the Rajya Sabha. Each panel has MPs from both Houses.Apart from the standing committees, there are three financial panels of the Lok Sabha, and several ad-hoc panels of both Houses. To be sure, the reports of the committees are not binding on the government. The Centre is free to reject the entire report, partially accept the recommendations, or in rare cases, accept all the suggestions of the panels which usually work outside the purview of partisan political lines. Officials argued that the exercise by the Speaker will help ascertain the work done, and strengthen the supervisory role of Parliament over the Executive.Last month, during the debate on the three labour reform bills, the Union labour minister informed the House that out of the 233 recommendations of the Standing Committee, the government accepted nearly 75%, underlining the importance of the panels. According to data available with PRS Legislative Research, 25% of the bills introduced in the first term of the Modi government were referred to committees. “The figure, however, is much lower than 71% and 60% in the 15th and 14th Lok Sabha respectively,” said a PRS note. The Opposition was up in arms against the government in the Monsoon session over the passage of three farm bills that were not referred to the panels for scrutiny in a session that was shortened due to the Covid pandemic. The confrontation led to an intense protest in Parliament, and eight Opposition MPs were suspended from the Rajya Sabha. Former Lok Sabha secretary general P Sreedharan said that assessment of the rate of implementation of the panels’ suggestions “will give a clear and better insight into the extent of quality of recommendations and how the government has reacted to them”. “It will also serve the basic purpose of parliamentary oversight of the executive; MPs, people, and Parliament itself, must know how far the government is accepting recommendations of multi-party panels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-evaluates-how-many-of-house-panel-ideas-adopted/story-4lRJarSlXCJoigeH4Pp1BK.html
28-10-2020||India||RS polls set to push up BJP tally in House||The upcoming biennial elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are set to help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) take its Rajya Sabha tally to 92 members and offset losses due to the exit of two key allies — the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal. The Congress-led Opposition’s tally is likely to go down below 100 for the first time in the recent past, creating more space for the Narendra Modi government to push legislations in the Upper House. The BJP is set to win eight out of the 10 Uttar Pradesh seats and also bag the only Uttarakhand seat that go to poll on November 9. Eleven Rajya Sabha members will retire next month, necessitating this year’s last round of biennial polls. Out of these 11 seats, the ruling BJP currently holds just three from Uttar Prdesh. The rest are occupied by the Samajwadi Party, Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The BJP’s net gain would be six seats — five from UP and one from Uttarakhand—and its tally would increase to 92 from the present 86. This will be just enough to compensate for the three seats each of the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal, the two key allies who left the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Sena quit the NDA after the Maharashtra assembly polls last year and joined the NCP and the Congress to form the state government. The Akalis, another trusted ally of the BJP, left the NDA last month over farm bills. Even as the NDA would not be able to breach the majority mark in this round of election, it will improve its tally to 118 from 112 in the 245-member House. The Opposition tally, on the other hand, will go down from 101 to 95. The majority mark is 123.While Lok Sabha members are elected directly by voters, Rajya Sabha members come through a complex process of proportional representation and by votes of MLAs of their respective state. The calculation is: (total number of MLAs of the state ÷ number of seats going to poll in the state +1) +1. Simply put, more MLAs of a party in an assembly means more seats for the party in the Rajya Sabha. Each MLA will give ranking of candidates according to his or her preference. If a candidate gets the minimum requisite votes, he or she would be elected. But if a candidate fails to get the requisite votes from the first preference of voters in a contest, the second preference votes would be counted. Even as it is in numerical minority, the NDA’s political clout has helped it gain support from regional outfits such as Tamil Nadu’s All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Odisha’s Biju Janata Dal, Andhra Pradesh’s YSR Congress Party and pass key bills such as those on triple talaq and bifurcating the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. During its initial days in power, the Modi government faced the Opposition heat in the Upper House, where bills would be regularly stalled. On one occasion, amendments to the President’s speech was approved in the Opposition-dominated Rajya Sabha in an embarrassment for the government.“You will notice that in last two years the BJP has managed to get its way in the Rajya Sabha with the support of other parties,” said political analyst Sandeep Shastri. “What will change now is that the BJP will assert itself more without the support of other parties. It is the same difference you see in the NDA of 2014 and NDA of 2020 (when it won more seats in the national elections). There is no non-BJP minister in the cabinet. A consolidation of the BJP is likely to be witnessed in the Rajya Sabha as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-polls-set-to-push-up-bjp-tally-in-house/story-myIBX5Ha2SMeVF3MONCKlI.html
28-10-2020||India||Covid-19 to ‘significantly’ impact state finances: RBI||The double whammy of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic — a collapse in revenue and rise in health-related and other costs — is likely to have a significant impact on state government finances and the challenges from the economic shock will persist for the new few years over which states will play a crucial role in India’s recovery, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) annual report on state finances released on Tuesday. As most states presented their budgets before the onset of the pandemic, their budget estimates of deficits are unlikely to capture the true picture of the ongoing fiscal year, the report says. The average value of gross fiscal deficit as a share of gross state domestic product (GSDP) for the states which presented their budget before the outbreak of the pandemic is 2.4%, while the average for the remaining states that made post-outbreak budget presentations is 4.6%. The report expects capital spending by the states to be lower than budgeted levels this year. While part of this is likely to be a result of states not being able to start a lot of projects due to the lockdown in the first quarter and monsoon in the second quarter, the report also says that states have a tendency to treat capital expenditure as a residual element. “Capital expenditure undertaken by states, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of general government capital expenditure is generally treated as a residual and is prone to adjustment, conditional upon revenue generation. In 2017-18 and 2018-19 as well, capital spending was reduced from budgeted levels,” it says. The economic impact of the pandemic is likely to have a major revenue impact on state finances. The RBI report says that the implied tax buoyancy for 2020-21 (based on 2019-20 provisional accounts) is higher than budgeted on the basis of 2019-20 revised estimates and much higher than the previous year average. Tax buoyancy is the ratio of change in taxes and GSDP. Higher tax buoyancy implies that tax collection would rise at a faster pace for the same rise in incomes.SGST, the component of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) which accrues directly to the states, would suffer the biggest hit, the report says. SGST collections fell by 47.2% during the April-June quarter of the current fiscal year, the report says. To be sure, the decline moderated to 6.4% in the July-September quarter. State receipts will also suffer because of a fall in divisible pool of the Centre’s tax revenue, it adds. The report also notes that state governments have taken their own set of measures to give a boost to aggregate demand. A conservative estimate — not all states have explicitly quantified their support measures — puts the fiscal outlay on such policies at 0.3% of GDP. Additional spending on such items has been compensated by cutting back on other kinds of expenditure. These include deferment and deduction of salaries and allowances and rationalisation of travel and establishment expenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-to-significantly-impact-state-finances-rbi/story-sfzIL2Xliskw6twVwgr5DP.html
28-10-2020||India||More poll code violations in Madhya Pradesh than Bihar||There have been more violations of the model code of conduct in Madhya Pradesh, the state where by-polls to 28 assembly constituencies are scheduled to be held on November 3 , as compared to Bihar, which will vote to elect its 243-member assembly  in three phases starting 28 October, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued nearly seven notices for serious poll violations in Madhya Pradesh, including to former chief minister Kamal Nath, BJP state minister Imarti Devi and BJP leader Kailash Vijayvarghia . No such notices have been issued so far in Bihar. According to people familiar with the matter, nearly a 1000 cases of model code violations have been found in MP, whereas in Bihar cases are in the hundreds. The violations include serious ones and other inconsequential ones. “It is surprising and unusual that so many cases would come from Madhya Pradesh,” said one person familiar with the matte. “So many weren’t expected; it is highly irregular.”The person added that the last they saw such a trend was in West Bengal ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. “That was also unorthodox considering normally a fight between a national party and a local one doesn’t make national polls so murky.” The Madhya Pradesh by-poll is particularly contentious as the erstwhile Congress government was brought down after Jyotiraditya Scindia and his loyalists resigned from the Congress to join the Bhartiya Party. BJP enjoys a wafer-thin majority in the state, and has to win nine seats to ensure the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government stays in power. The Election Commission of India on Monday advised former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath to not use words like “item” during the period of the Model Code of Conduct. “ ... the Commission, hereby advises Kamal Nath, ex-chief minister Madhya Pradesh that while making public utterances he should not use any such word or statement during the period of Model Code of Conduct,” the order said, referring to his use of the term to describe Imarti Devi. It added that Nath’s use of the word “item” for a lady was a violation of the advisory issued by the commission relating to the model code.The Commission has also issued a notice against BJP leader Kailash Vijayvarghia asking him to explain his ”chunnu-munnu“ remark. The BJP leader referred to Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh as ”chunnu-munnu” at an election rally. He had also called them “gaddar” (traitors). The notice said the statement was found to be in violation of the provisions of the model code.The Commission has given Vijayvarghia 48 hours to explain his comments. It has also given Devi 48 hours to explain her remarks that Nath went “mad after he lost the post of chief minister.” The violations include serious ones and other inconsequential ones, ones made over the phone, C-Vigil and to the officials in state. The Commission has also held a meeting with senior Madhya Pradesh leaders to discuss the matter.A second person familiar with the matter said that the increase in violations seems to be because both parties are invested in bringing their government back to power. “It is a make or break situation, so the stakes are higher in Madhya Pradesh,” the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-poll-code-violations-in-mp-than-bihar/story-Gu0y45gatNF78djC3atXaL.html
28-10-2020||India||Jyotiraditya Scindia hails Shivraj govt’s achievements in final leg||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia held several rallies in the Gwalior-Chambal belt on Tuesday ahead of assembly bypolls in the region, saying that Madhya Pradesh has a tradition of welcoming guests on its soil in response to election events held by former Rajasthan deputy chief minister and senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot in the state.Just five days are left for the election campaign to 28 legislative assembly constituencies to end ahead of polling on November 3, and all political parties have stepped up their campaigns to woo more than 6.35 million voters. Talking to the media on Pilot’s campaign in the state, Scindia said, “Madhya Pradesh has a rich tradition of welcoming guests on its soil. In democracy everyone has a right to campaign during elections.” Addressing election meetings in Biora assembly constituency in Rajgarh district, Pohari in Shivpuri and Badnawar in Dhar district in support of the BJP candidates, Scindia said, “During the then Congress government neither were farm loans of farmers waived nor was unemployment allowance given to the youth despite promises by the government. In fact, the then Kamal Nath government betrayed every section of society in its 15-month rule, whether it’s farmers, the youth, women, weaker sections of society, or others.” The Gwalior-Chambal region is geographically close to Rajasthan and has a large number of Gurjar voters, the community to which Pilot belongs — a fact he sought to capitalise on.Addressing election meetings in Shivpuri and Morena districts, Pilot said, “This region (Gwalior-Chambal) has a deep relationship with Rajasthan (roti-beti ka rishta) and we are all brothers.” Pilot targeted the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh. “The farm bills introduced by the central government are a massive blow to the farmers in the country whereas it’s the then UPA government’s schemes like MNREGA which proved a big support to migrant labourers during the lockdown. In Madhya Pradesh, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government came from the back door whereas it was known for one of the biggest scams in the country: Vyapam,” he said.Meanwhile, addressing election meetings in Nepanangar assembly constituency in Burhanpur district and Mandhata constituency in Khandwa district, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “Congress pushed Madhya Pradesh back into a ditch in just 15 months of its rule. But in its six-month rule, the BJP government has not only controlled the Covid situation to give relief to people but also disbursed benefits of more than ₹23,000 crore under various government schemes.” Earlier, taking part in a meeting of the Rajput community in Indore, Chouhan announced the building of a memorial in the name of Rani Padmavati and withdrawal of cases against those who had protested against the film Padmaavat before its release in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scindia-hails-shivraj-govt-s-achievements-in-final-leg/story-QFlMpd275ooqMewdtsgpzI.html

28-10-2020||India||2+2 meeting: Pompeo says US will stand with India to face threats to sovereignty, liberty||Against the backdrop of the border standoff with China, the US on Tuesday said it will stand by India in confronting threats to its sovereignty, even as the two sides inked an agreement for sharing classified satellite imagery and aeronautical data during their 2+2 ministerial dialogue. Security challenges and threats emanating from China’s belligerent actions across the region, including the standoff in Ladakh, figured prominently in the 2+2 meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh and their US counterparts Mike Pomeo and Mark Esper, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The focus of discussions was on ways to jointly deal with these challenges and to boost defence and security cooperation to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, the people said. “The two countries are standing firm in meeting these challenges,” one of the people cited above said. Terrorism originating from Pakistan and the related security situation in Afghanistan too figured in the talks, and the Indian side made it clear cross-border terror is “completely unacceptable”.  “The US will stand with the people of India as they confront threats to their sovereignty and to their liberty,” Pompeo said during a media interaction after the meeting, making a pointed reference to a visit by him and Esper to the National War Memorial to honour Indian military personnel who died during conflicts, “including the 20 killed by PLA forces in Galwan Valley in June”. Pompeo juxtaposed joint efforts to fight Covid-19, which he described as the “pandemic that came from Wuhan”, with measures to counter China’s actions jeopardising democracy and a rules-based order. “The challenge of defeating the pandemic that came from Wuhan also fed into our robust discussions about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Our leaders and our citizens see with increasing clarity that the CCP is no friend to democracy, the rule of law, transparency, nor to freedom of navigation, the foundation of a free and open and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” he said. “I’m glad to say that the US and India are taking steps to strengthen our cooperation against all manner of threats, and not just those posed by the CCP.” Jaishankar and Singh didn’t name China in their remarks at the media interaction, and said the two countries are committed to bilateral and multilateral cooperation for post-pandemic economic recovery and creating more trusted supply chains, while also ensuring peace and stability for all countries in the Indo-Pacific. Singh referred to growing information-sharing and interaction between India’s armed forces and various US military commands through the exchange of liaison officers, and called on America’s defence industry to join India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative by taking advantage of the liberalised FDI regime. “Our national security convergences have obviously grown in a more multi-polar world,” Jaishankar said, noting that peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific depend on upholding the rules-based order, ensuring freedom of navigation, promoting open connectivity and “respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states”. He added, “A multi-polar world must have a multi-polar Asia as its basis.” The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), one of five agreements signed by the two sides on Tuesday, will allow India to get access to classified US satellite imagery, maps and critical aeronautical data that will help the military strike targets with greater accuracy using platforms such as long-range missiles. BECA is the last of four foundational agreements between India and the US for sharing sensitive information and facilitating sales of advanced weapons systems. The two sides have been sharing real time intelligence under the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) signed in 2018, and they signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 for reciprocal access to logistics. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) was inked in 2002. Previous Congress-led governments had held off on signing all the agreements because of thinking in certain quarters that they would tie India militarily with the US. The people cited above said there were adequate safeguards in the pacts to protect India’s autonomy and sovereignty. Chaitanya Giri, fellow for space and ocean studies at Gateway House, said BECA can help the two sides coordinate intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) during joint exercises and operations. “The India-specificity of these agreements demonstrates the US’s recognition of India’s doctrine of strategic autonomy,” he said. Technology-specific cooperation made possible by these agreements can help co-development and co-production of technologies under the India-US Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI), Giri added. Former Northern Army commander, Lt Gen (retired) DS Hooda, described Pompeo’s remarks on US backing for India as part of efforts to build a closer alliance. “I think the larger message is the attempt by the US to get India into a closer alliance to counter what is clearly greater assertiveness by China in Asia. Both India and the US have some common cause in resisting Chinese actions. However, India will be conscious that China is an immediate neighbour, with whom we have an unsettled boundary. Therefore there are some issues that will have to be handled bilaterally, and a strategic balance has to be maintained.” The Indian and American ministers welcomed New Delhi’s decision to include Australia in this year’s edition of the Malabar exercise, which brings together the navies of India, Japan and the US. This will be the first military manoeuvres in 13 years to feature all members of the Quad. Singh said the 2+2 meeting also explored capacity building and other joint cooperation activities in third countries, including in India’s neighbourhood and beyond. “We have convergence of views on a number of such proposals and will take those forward,” he said. The US accepted India’s request for cooperation in maritime domain awareness and both sides will take steps for joint development of systems and expertise, Singh said. Besides strengthening Covid-19-related cooperation to develop vaccines, therapeutics, and equipment, the two sides are working on a MoU between health authorities to enhance cooperation on health emergencies, pandemics, and biomedical research. The two sides also intend to sign a MoU between the Indian Council of Medical Research and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to collaborate on infectious diseases, including Covid-19 and other emerging threats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-2-meeting-pompeo-says-us-will-stand-with-india-to-face-threats-to-sovereignty-liberty/story-SgG2lXLwaNRG3RlsW6YZbK.html
