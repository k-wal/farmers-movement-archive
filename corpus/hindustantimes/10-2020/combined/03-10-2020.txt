03-10-2020||News||The internal drivers of China’s Ladakh offensive||The India-China standoff in Ladakh persists even after multiple rounds of commander-level talks and two ministerial meetings between the defence and foreign ministers of the two countries. This amounts to India living with the Chinese encroachments since May. That there was no reference to reverting to the status quo ante in the joint statement after the foreign ministers met in Moscow suits China well.China’s military obduracy in the Himalayas reflects its assertion as an emerging Asian hegemon and expansionist power. Many of its neighbours have experienced the effects of this. However, the Ladakh situation is not just about China asserting its dominance. The Aksai Chin region has a strong strategic value for China. In the late 1950s, when it first transgressed into Aksai Chin, the then Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai made a proposal to accept India’s hold over Arunachal Pradesh (then called North East Frontier Agency) in return for Chinese control over Aksai Chin. This region of Ladakh was critical to China to shield its turbulent periphery of Tibet and Xinjiang. China also, subsequently, deepened its links with Pakistan, which handed over parts of Indian territory under its occupation to China. This partnership has only grown, with Beijing now having invested billions of dollars to consolidate its strategic outreach. China’s officially blessed commentators often highlight the significance of Aksai Chin, and the centrality of Pakistan in the region. It was in this backdrop that India’s stated intent to recapture Aksai Chin rattled the Chinese. Union home minister Amit Shah’s statement in Parliament, in September 2019, after changing the status of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir to Union Territories, may be recalled: “Kashmir is an integral part of India. When I talk about Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin are included in it…We will give our lives for this region”. China strongly questioned this statement and has refused to endorse the new status of Jammu and Kashmir.The fate of mutually-agreed non-escalation between India and China will depend on the Chinese side. China will try to sustain the standoff by all means possible. Diplomatically, Beijing is keenly awaiting the outcome of the United States (US) presidential elections and hopes that a Joe Biden victory will open a window of opportunity to soften US hostility. China is also preparing to further pacify the Japanese approach towards it under Prime Minister (PM) Yoshihide Suga. Japan has heavy economic stakes in keeping the peace with China and Suga, unlike his predecessor Shinzo Abe, may also like to steer clear of the deepening US-China rivalry. This may sound speculative at the moment, but geopolitics often shifts radically. China’s success with the US and Japan will be bad news for India. An internationally-emboldened China could be far more aggressive towards India. In China’s perception, India is asserting itself against Chinese moves in the Himalayas only because it is backed by the US and its allies. India has to carefully monitor and adequately respond to such developments. PM Narendra Modi’s conversation with PM Suga, in this context, is a welcome initiative. The theories that the Ladakh moves are primarily led by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which is not comfortable with President Xi Jinping and the Chinese political establishment, are untenable. Xi is the chief of China’s military command and the massive movement of troops in Ladakh by PLA could not have taken place without his endorsement. Xi, at the Seventh Central Symposium on Tibet (August 18-29), also made a strong policy move on Tibet, asking for developing a “new socialist Tibet”, where its Buddhism must conform to the “Chinese context”. This, in Xi’s approach, would be done by taking the Tibetans away from the Dalai Lama, changing their Lamaistic religious and social practices, and integrating them closely and ethnically with mainstream China. This approach aims to control Tibet in three principal ways. One, to cut off its external linkages and deflect international pressure on Tibet; two, change its demographic composition, and; three, institutionalise mass surveillance. This will be on the lines of similar repressive moves in Xinjiang. The massive military movements and deployments of Chinese forces in Ladakh and the projection of a so-called Indian military threat will help in this repression. The standoff is thus in China’s internal political interests of stability in Tibet. One wonders if China is doing this out of enhanced confidence that it can control Tibet or a lurking sense of vulnerability in the context of a post-Dalai Lama Tibet. Xi is also using the Ladakh standoff in his internal political campaign of silencing critics who are cautioning him against hostility towards India and other neighbours, while the principal challenge is to confront the US. The official media has also projected the Ladakh conflict as an answer to India for the so-called setback in Doklam. It has been woven into China’s resurgent territorial nationalism. The local media plays up the idea that India is too weak to stand against China’s might. There does not appear to be any easy way out of this Chinese domestic political dimension of the Ladakh stand-off. There is a reactive internal political dimension to the military situation in India as well. It is seen as a defence for the changed status of Jammu and Kashmir and is also linked to India’s resurgent nationalism, where any plea for moderation on the border with China will come in for criticism. One wonders if the internal political dimensions can be decoupled from the Ladakh standoff through a summit meeting between Modi and Xi. Or, will there be hostilities in the Himalayas again?SD Muni is professor emeritus, JNU, member, Executive Council, IDSA and former ambassador and special envoy, Government of India The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-internal-drivers-of-china-s-ladakh-offensive/story-dnbFa9lQZvOGcEwCklIBlM.html

As the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and a splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa are still uncertain over contesting the polls, Mohali is in for a three-cornered contest among Congress, SAD and BJP.In the last MC elections, of a total 50 seats, BJP had contested on 20, but won only six.Ashok Jha, BJP secretary and spokesperson, Mohali, said, “We were feeling really suffocated with SAD as they always suppressed us. The decision of snapping the ties should have been taken much earlier. Also, they never offered us the post of deputy mayor or senior deputy mayor.”Sukhwinder Singh Goldy, executive member of Punjab state BJP, said, “Now, we will be in a better position to serve the people of Mohali.” On the other hand, NK Sharma, district president, SAD, said, “We treated them with full respect and now they are leveling baseless allegations. In 2022, they will come to know the reality of whose side the people of Punjab are on.” Meanwhile, Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Congress was ready for the MC elections. “The people of Mohali have seen development in the last few years and we are hopeful of winning the elections with a clean majority. Both BJP and SAD will be wiped out.”In the previous five-year term of the MC House that ended on April 26 this year, Congress had 14 councillors and the SAD-BJP alliance had won with 23 councillors; Azad group, which was led by former mayor Kulwant Singh, had won 10 seats; and two seats were won by independent councillors. In August 2017, Kulwant Singh had joined SAD.Out of the 2.36 lakh people who will be voting in the MC polls, 25,000 belong to the Scheduled Castes (SC) category. Five seats in the MC House are reserved for SC candidates, two for women (SC), three for backward classes (BC) and two for women (BC). There are 43 general category seats, of which 23 are for women and 20 for men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-contest-all-50-seats-in-next-mohali-mc-elections-bjp/story-9LENYnthWxJkmyLrjDn85L.html

03-10-2020||City||Chhatbir Zoo set to reopen on October 15||After a gap of nearly seven months, the Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park, popularly known as Chhatbir Zoo, is set to reopen on October 15.Zoo field director M Sudhagar said, “We are preparing for the reopening on October 15, but we are waiting for the final nod from the state government. Instructions have been given to the workers to ensure social distancing among visitors. All safety precautions will be taken.”“We are deciding on how many visitors to allow at one time,” he added.Since closing down on March 17 owing to the nationwide lockdown, the Zoo has suffered a loss of ₹3.5 crore. The Zoo had been earning ₹1.8 lakh a day before the lockdown and was hoping to become self-reliant in the next two years. Authorities say it will take at least six months to recover from the said losses.Projects on haltThe Punjab government had planned to open a Dinosaur Park on two acres in the Zoo at a cost of ₹4.5 crore, which was being developed via a public-private partnership (PPP) mode, but only 50% work has been completed so far.An aquarium was proposed to be set up; and an exotic animal exchange programme, wherein the Zoo was set to import exotic animals including zebras, giraffes, chimpanzees and gorillas from Africa, was slated to begin as well.Numerous features such as an aviary and new ticket counters were also added to the Zoo premises, besides carrying out road maintenance to attract more visitors.The zoo spends around ₹30 lakh a month on meat, fodder, grains, fruits and vegetables for the animals.The revenue is generated through outsourcing of the parking, canteen and lion safari—all of which had to be closed due to the pandemic.The zoo used to attract around 3,000 visitors a day. The tickets were priced at ₹80 for adults and ₹40 for children, which contributed to generating a daily average revenue of ₹1.8 lakh. Lion and deer safari tickets cost ₹75 per visitor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhatbir-zoo-set-to-reopen-on-october-15/story-UJuyRKzIU8SyQcedXYZ4SM.html

Thereupon, he went in the witness box and made the claim that he has been forced by the investigating agency to implicate Bollywood personalities,” his lawyer Satish Maneshinde said.The NCB has denied all allegations made by Prasad. “The allegations are completely false. He has been arrogant and non-cooperative throughout his custody with us and that has been conveyed to the court. The court granted him judicial custody. Names of the mentioned persons do not figure in any of his statements. This is his feeble and frivolous attempt to divert the focus of the investigation,” NCB’s zonal director, Sameer Wankhede, said. Prasad, who was in NCB custody till Saturday, was arrested on September 26 for allegedly receiving contraband from alleged peddlers who had allegedly supplied hashish to Showik and Rhea Chakraborty. The agency had claimed that Prasad’s role was revealed during the interrogation of Sanket Patel, one of the alleged drug peddlers. The agency had said that Patel told them that he had delivered ganja (weed) to Prasad at his residence in Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-coerced-by-ncb-to-implicate-dino-morea-ranbir-kapoor-arjun-rampal-says-arrested-film-executive/story-vaiuggMPlqqsueZXARdt7K.html

A 26-year-old man from Rajasthan was killed and his three friends were injured after their car rammed into a stationary truck parked along National Highway-44 near Sahnewal. The deceased, Ketan Mehta, was a native of Bahadurgarh, Rajasthan. His friend, Dipender Singh of Alwar, Rajasthan, told the police that Ketan was driving the car in which he and two other friends, Ashwani Kumar and Rinku Puri, were travelling to Dalhousie.When they reached near Zimidara Dhaba in Sahnewal, Ketan failed to notice a stationary truck and rammed the car into it. The impact of the crash killed Ketan on the spot, while the other three car occupants suffered severe injuries. The truck driver fled the scene with his vehicle, as passers-by informed the police and rushed the injured victims to a hospital.ASI Harpal Singh, who is investigating the case, said the unidentified truck driver had been booked under Sections 283 (obstruction in public way), 304-A (death by negligence), 427 (damages) and 337 (endangering people’s life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

03-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Shiv Sena, Congress, NCP slam BJP as AIIMS report calls death suicide||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies, Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday over the issue of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death after an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) panel headed by Dr Sudhir Gupta concluded that the actor died by suicide and it was not a murder. While Sena said it stands vindicated, state Congress unit demanded a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) into the “conspiracy to defame Maharashtra and find the mastermind behind it”.The BJP, however, said the investigation was ongoing and the party wants “justice” for the late actor.In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the case, the six-member AIIMS medical board of forensic doctors dismissed the claims of “poisoning and strangling” made in the case of Singh’s death. The premier institute’s forensic chief Dr Sudhir Gupta termed it “a case of hanging and death by suicide”. “We welcome the comments by Dr Gupta on the medical probe into the untimely and unfortunate death of Sushant Singh Rajput. We also believe people are the best judge to know who was using the issue for political gains and how a motivated campaign was run against the state government and certain people in the government. We will wait for the final report to be released by AIIMS to decide further course of action,” said Shiv Sena spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi. “We stand vindicated and have maintained that the truth will prevail.”Congress, on the other hand, demanded an SIT probe, while NCP said a case should be filed against those spreading fake news. “After the official confirmation by AIIMS panel head Dr Sudhir Gupta… it is proved that investigation by @MumbaiPolice was honest and forthright. It is also clear that it was a conspiracy of Modi govt with help of their fake media allies to defame Maharashtra,” said Sachin Sawant, general secretary and spokesperson of state Congress unit in a series of tweets.“Now we demand government of Maharashtra to form an SIT to nab the conspirators and their mastermind… And take appropriate action against these fake channels to save our democracy as their fake stories are harmful for our country,” Sawant tweeted.The NCP said CBI should now complete its investigation in a month and “bring out truth before the people”.“This proves that the entire campaign was politically motivated and BJP is exposed. We want CBI to complete the probe in the next one month so that people know the truth. They have already taken two months, how much more time do they need,” said state minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik.NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said a criminal case should be filed against those who ran a campaign to defame Mumbai Police and Maharashtra government. The BJP, meanwhile, said it wanted to ensure justice for Rajput. Ram Kadam, BJP MLA and party spokesperson, said the CBI investigation is ongoing. “We have never questioned the efficiency of Mumbai Police. We wanted the state government to give them free hand to probe the matter. On what grounds had the police had said that it was a suicide case? We have been trying to get justice for Rajput’s family,” said Kadam, adding that the MVA government wanted to “protect the drug mafia and thus never investigated that aspect”.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. The post-mortem report concluded he died by suicide. A controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterparts. The probe was handed over to CBI by the Supreme Court, after it upheld the validity of the Bihar Police’s first information report (FIR) filed on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh, who has accused actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his son’s suicide and misappropriating his money.Chakraborty has denied all allegations levelled against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-shiv-sena-congress-ncp-slam-bjp-as-aiims-report-calls-death-suicide/story-5nacSWCIIBvh1DGRJRforM.html

In its place, the village panchayat has decided to purchase around 250 acres in the nearby villages with the compensation amount. This land will be leased out to villagers for farming.“The villagers have given consent for the project and the land has been transferred to the government,” said Dhir Singh, a former sarpanch of Sekhowal.GLADA chief administrator PS Gill said, “GLADA has taken possession of 960 acres for construction of the industrial park. At a few places, government land in possession of different departments, including animal husbandry and horticulture, has been transferred to GLADA. Apart from this, panchayat land has been acquired in various villages against a compensation of Rs 86 crore.”He added that the future course of action, with regards to how the industrial park will be developed and what it will comprise, has yet to be decided by the state government.ACTIVISTS MIFFEDMeanwhile, social activists have decided to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the Punjab government’s decision to develop an industrial park near Mattewara forest.Social activist Kuldeep Khaira said, “The project will destroy the Mattewara forest and its wildlife. Establishment of an industrial park will also pollute the Sutlej river, which flows through the forest area. The Sekhowal gram sabha had also approved a resolution against the land acquisition in the past. The administration is not releasing information regarding the project even under the RTI Act.” Another activist Ranjodh Singh, who had earlier written to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to rollback the proposal, said,”We will take up the matter with the state government again.”Sub-divisional magistrate, Ludhiana East, Baljinder Singh said, “The villagers have accepted the compensation provided for the land by the government. No one was pressured. The land has been transferred to GLADA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/glada-acquires-416-acres-in-sekhowal-village-for-mattewara-industrial-park/story-GIt8dBS00rsDlmwl181WhK.html

03-10-2020||Mumbai||Parents of students to protest ‘unjust’ fee hike on October 10 in Mumbai||Several parents of students from the city are planning to join the nationwide protest against unjust fees charged by private schools on October 10. As part of the protest organised by the Forum for Fairness in Education, a city-based NGO that works in education, parents and students of private schools are urged to bang plates from their homes between 7am to 7.05am on October 10. “The issue of indiscriminate fee hike is affecting parents across the country; especially in the current situation, as parents are facing pay cuts and job losses. It is becoming difficult to pay the hiked fees. We are urging the governments to take strict action against such schools,” said Jayant Jain, president of Forum for Fairness in Education. Parents of several schools in Mumbai had written to the state education department complaining about the indiscriminate fee hikes levied by schools. In September, the department formed two panels and are now in the process of inspecting these schools. Parents said that with schools not willing to have a discussion with them, they are having a tough time opposing hikes. “Schools are resorting to all sorts of unjust practices such as removing students from online classes, charging late fees to parents etc. Children are already stressed in the transition to online learning, and schools are adding to the pressure,” said the parent of a school in Central Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-of-students-to-protest-unjust-fee-hike-on-october-10-in-mumbai/story-aAMuiwmR6lTOBeLEbsZKKL.html

03-10-2020||City||Hooda, BJP-JJP leaders lock horns over farm laws||The Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party leaders on Saturday trained guns at former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, accusing him of misleading the farmers even as “his own government had launched the contract farming laws in 2007”. Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal said, “In 2007, the Congress government had introduced contract farming in Haryana, which did not mention the MSP. Even in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress manifesto had promised to repeal the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act. But now, Congress workers are provoking the farmers to hold protests in the state as they have themselves been wiped out of power by the public.”She further said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified that the minimum support price (MSP) is not going to end and the union government has announced the MSP for the next Rabi season crops.”Meanwhile, Jannayak Janata party (JJP) president Nishan Singh said, “The Congress is alleging that the MSP system is going end but our government is purchasing Kharif crops at MSP. Once the procurement process ends, the farmers’ will know the real truth behind these laws.”The JJP leader further said, “The union government brought the same contract farming law along with two others, which was implemented in the state during Hooda’s regime and Hooda had advocated for the same before the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to implement across the country.”Reacting to BJP-JJP leaders’ allegations, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, said his party will not allow implementation of the new farm laws in the state.“The ruling party leaders are misleading people about our contract farming law, which was implemented during my tenure as a chief minister of Haryana in 2007. The contract farming rule framed by my government says the agreed rate or contract rate shall not be less than the MSP of the proceeding year. Where there is no MSP and no agreed rate, the amount of security shall be calculated at the rate of 15% of the prevailing market rate of agreement,” the former CM said while asking the ruling party leaders if the new laws have such provisions to protect farmers.Hooda further said that the government has one option now – it should promulgate a fourth ordinance which guarantees that the farmers’ produce will be procured at MSP and any person or firm found purchasing below this price would face a criminal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooda-bjp-jjp-leaders-lock-horns-over-farm-laws/story-HyuTvx8UJPIY90gcXKVuSN.html
03-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic corporation distributes 50 smart phones to patients at Covid-19 jumbo centres||In an effort to increase communication between Covid-19 patients and their family members, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has distributed 50 smart phones at Covid-19 jumbo centres on Saturday. In addition to this, the civic body also plans to procure 600 tablet phones for the patients. Due to the contagious nature of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – patients are being kept in isolation wards, where their family members are not allowed to visit, leaving patients to remain alone for days, until the end of their treatment. HT had previously reported how this often leads to sadness and depression among patients. In order to address the issue, BMC provided smart phones to the patients so that they can chat and opt for video calls with their family members everyday. “We have observed in our civic-run hospitals that patients who talk to their relatives daily, have a better recovery rate. Though this is not scientifically proven, we believe that it may help in the early recovery of patients. This may also help in curbing the mortality rate,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. The facility has been made available free of cost for patients. “We have Wi-Fi in all the centres. Patients won’t have to shell out any money for internet usage. We have also bought the sim cards and will recharge the phones from our budget,” said Kakani. BMC said it has allocated a budget of ₹1.3 crore to procure 600 tablets and it is likely to get them by next weekend. Psychiatrists have welcomed the move and believe it might help in improving the mental health condition of patients. “Patients, irrespective of their age or gender, get scared when they get detected with Covid-19. In such a situation, when they stay alone for days, it leads to depression and anxiety. Many patients experience the same sadness even after they get discharged. But if they talk to their family daily, it might contribute in their faster recovery,” said Dr Harish Shetty, a psychiatrist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-corporation-distributes-50-smart-phones-to-patients-at-covid-19-jumbo-centres/story-Q7GfCZOeoSgZoZoCv9iINO.html

Kataria said that these bills will not have any impact on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the existing mandi system in the country. Kataria said the centre has decided to spend Rs 1 lakh crore to boost agriculture infrastructure and Rs 500 crore to improve the financial condition of farmers. He said that the MSP will continue as the government had paid Rs 7 lakh crore as MSP in the past six years. Kataria, however, urged the farmers to adopt alternative crops as paddy is a water guzzling crop and the production of 1 kg of rice takes 3, 500 liters of water. “Farmers should take the advantage of the schemes initiated by the state government for crop diversification,” said Kataria.Replying to a question on Hathras incident, the union minister said that the Uttar Pradesh police was working on the case and action was taken against officials for their negligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/union-govt-to-spend-1-lakh-crore-to-boost-agri-infrastructure-mos-kataria/story-7adJQ3lQ2nrCmDaRaZu03N.html
03-10-2020||City||Blaze ravages quilt factory in Ludhiana’s Chattha Colony||It took 10 fire tenders four hours to control a massive fire that broke out at a quilt factory in Chattha Colony on Bahadurke Road on Saturday. Though all workers managed to escape to safety, goods and machinery worth lakhs was gutted in the incident. As the fire erupted around 3pm, some workers inside the factory tried to douse the flames, but realising that their efforts were going in vain, they informed the fire brigade and rushed out of the factory. The fire sent plumes of smoke in the air, putting area residents and workers in panic. The reason behind the incident remains uncertain. Sub-fire officer Navrang Singh said, “We received an alert at 3.25pm and pressed 10 fire tenders into service. However, there was only a single entry and exit point in the factory, posing difficulties in gaining access. Besides, excessive heat and smoke also dented fire-fighting efforts. We had to break the boundary walls of the unit from two sides to enter the factory and put out the fire. The factory had various anomalies with regard to fire-safety arrangements.”“Some workers claimed that a coworker was still inside the factory. But no one was found during the search. The 10 fire tenders were refilled over 40 times and the flames were controlled in around four hours. There was no injury or casualty,” Singh said. Scrap goes up in flames at mini-secretariat buildingScrap stored on the first floor of the mini-secretariat caught fire around 3pm on Saturday. While the reason behind the fire was not ascertained, a major tragedy was averted as the fire brigade doused the fire in no time, stopping the flames from spreading to the notary kiosks. Narrow escape for driver, helper as truck catches fireA truck driver and his helper had a close shave after the vehicle’s cabin caught fire on the flyover of National Highway-44 near Samrala Chowk on Saturday evening. The duo rushed out as soon as they saw the flames and informed the fire brigade, who reached the spot and controlled the fire.

Their dues tally up to ₹33.75 crore, discom officials said. PVVNL chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said the discom has already prepared a list of defaulters. “It has been classified into three categories. Of the 1.1 lakh defaulters, 60,000 have not paid their bills for at least one year and their dues amount to over ₹28.5 crore. The second category has 24,500 who have not paid their bills for the past six months and their total dues are ₹5 crore. The third category is of 25,500 defaulters have not cleared their dues for the past three months and have dues of ₹3.25 crore,” he said. He further said PVVNL has already started sending notices to the first lot of 60,000 defaulters. “We’ll start disconnecting their supply from October 15, even though the festive season is beginning soon. We are not going to hear their pleas or give them grace time as all our instalment offers to clear dues were ignored. Without clearing their full outstanding dues, their supply will not be restored,” he said. The chief engineer also said without proper revenue generation, it will be impossible for the distribution companies to improve the power scenario in the district. “Notices to the second and third category of defaulters will be issued in the third and fourth week of October, respectively. After seven days of serving the notice, we’ll start disconnecting their supply as well,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/discom-serves-disconnection-notices-to-1-1-lakh-defaulters/story-b83UJoyoFqiDRmnA7B8r2L.html

The suspects allegedly tried to inject sedatives into her when she was boarding her vehicle. She fought off her attackers who had inflicted injuries on her while they tried to sedate her. Police said the matter is pending investigation.Based on the woman’s complaint, Indirapuram police registered an FIR under Indian penal code (IPC) sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354a (physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 366/511 (kidnapping attempt) at Indirapuram police station. The woman’s father said they had gone to a nearby market on Thursday night. While exiting the market, the woman offered to fetch the vehicle. “As soon as she opened the vehicle door, a man pushed her into to the front co-driver’s seat, while another held her neck from the back seat,” said the father, a senior health department officer with the UP government. “While trying to overpower her, one was telling the other to inject the sedative they had brought along with them. They repeatedly tried to inject the sedative to her body but she resisted. She suffered eight to 10 injuries on her thigh, but she continued to fight.” “The man in the driver’s seat turned on the ignition in an attempt to drive away, but my daughter grabbed the keys. She foiled his attempt at least three times. A man from the highrise who was passing by, head the commotion and alerted the guards. Seeing people approaching, the two men fled the spot,” he said. According to the family’s statement, one suspect could have been around 20-years-old while the other could have been between 25 to 30 years. “They were not wearing masks and she may be able to identify the one who sat in the driver’s seat. The car also had cameras inside, which we gave to the police,” the woman’s father said. The family said they had no grudge with anyone and couldn’t say what the motive could be. The woman, according to her father, was rushed to a local hospital where she was treated for her injuries. According to police, the car camera caught a man fleeing, but the image was not clear. “Our teams are working on the case and also trying to scan nearby CCTVs to get clues on the two men,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city), Ghaziabad. Police officers said they are investigating the case from all angles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-based-fashion-designer-survives-abduction-bid/story-JPJCtZQ7Kg3PYzv9olMTeJ.html

The authority suggested three models – public-private-partnership (PPP), to be developed by Yeida on its own, or a single developer to be chosen.The authority put forth all three models in the meeting and discussed the same to decide the future course of action.Going by rules, Yeida takes all its policy-related and other important decisions in its board meeting. Once the proposals are discussed, the authority sends these to the state government for a final approval before implementing the same on ground, said officials.In the PPP model, the authority and a master developer will together form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop this project. In this, the authority may be responsible for land, and the developer for the capital to develop, run and maintain this project. In the single builder model, Yeida will allot the land to a private entity that will develop and further sub-lease the premises. And in the third model, the authority will on its own develop the internal and external infrastructure and allot the space to filmmakers.“We put forth all these models. The board members discussed all issues related to the project and decided to conduct a feasible study. We will send these discussions (minutes of the meeting) to the Uttar Pradesh government for further guidance,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of the Yamuna authority.While it is not known when the decision on the most appropriate model will come through from Lucknow, Yeida officials said that the state government wants to execute this project as soon as possible.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on September 18 had announced the development of the Film City project in the area. Subsequently, on September 20, Yeida had sent a proposal stating that it has got 780 acres of land earmarked for industrial and 220 acres for commercial usage in Sector 21 that is suitable for a film city. The land is located only 6 km away from the scheduled Jewar airport and is located at a distance of 12 km from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.“We want to set up institutions of film research and development of cinema, film production houses, international academies, film studios, artificial villages, museums and other recreational zones for filmmakers,” said Singh.Officials said Yeida hopes that the film city project will not only boost growth but also attract international investors to the region, thereby helping in job creation and growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yamuna-authority-board-mulls-over-three-models-to-develop-film-city-project/story-isS7WvlqEJo2BXHiG1HUsO.html

Once the tenders are issued and winning firms finalised, it should take about four months for completion.The E-bus project was cleared by the UP cabinet in October last year for intra-city commute. Ghaziabad was among the 14 cities selected for the project. Scheduled to have been completed this month, however, the project ran into many hurdles not least of which was the Covid-19 pandemic. “Initially the land (measuring about 26,000 square metres, sqm) for the charging station/maintenance depot for the buses was identified in Bonjha. But the presence of many high tension power lines forced us to cancel it. Now, we have received possession of about 25,000 sqm in Akbarpur-Behrampur at the Ghaziabad-Greater Noida link road,” said Umesh Shukla, the project manager from the Construction & Design Services (C&DS), a unit of UP Jal Nigam tasked with developing the charging station. The entire project of the construction of the charging station/maintenance depot is estimated at ₹10 crore, 25% of which will be paid by the municipal corporation. “Once we get funds from the municipal-corporation, we will start the tendering process within a fortnight. Thereafter, it will take around four months to complete the project. The depot will have charging bays, maintenance and parking facilities for the e-buses,” he added. “We have started the process to provide the funds. The land handover at Akbarpur-Behrampur has also been given to the Jal Nigam (C&DS),” said MS Tanwar, municipal-commissioner. Six routes have been identified for the service– Anand Vihar to Muradnagar, Anand Vihar to ALT Centre, Dilshad Garden to Govindpuram, Dilshad Garden to Lal Kuan and Govindpuram police line to Noida City Centre besides Tila Morh to New Bus Stand. “Presently, there is no mode of intra-city travel by government buses. As a result, thousands of daily commuters including girls and women either use their own vehicles or forced to use shared autos. If the project is slotted to get complete next year, it would mean that the polluted conditions on city roads will continue to prevail this winter season as well,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation. Earlier in August last year, the Department of Heavy Industries had approved the sanction of 5595 e-buses to 64 cities, state governments, state transport undertakings for intra-city and inter-city operations while 600 of these were approved for 11 cities of Uttar Pradesh including 50 buses for Ghaziabad city. The approval was made under the phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India scheme in order to push for clean mobility in public transportation. The buses were proposed to run about 4 billion kilometres during their contract period and expected to cumulatively save about 1.2 billion litters of fuel over the contract period, which will result into avoidance of 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/tendering-for-e-buses-maintenance-charging-depot-within-fortnight-land-handover-complete/story-tVkUC6samJGfh7aLmjd15J.html

Doctors said the rising trend of Covid-19 cases in several residential pockets was probably due to large working population and high population density.“Residents too are to blame. They are complacent in wearing masks and adhering to health protocols. We get so many patients who visit us without wearing masks and we have to tell them each time to stick to protocol as the risk of Sars-Cov-2 has not subsided,” said Dr. Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “The trend may increase in winter as cases of flu generally increase then.”Residents welfare associations (RWAs) said that ever since the markets, daily bazars and weekly markets have opened up, social distancing has gone for a toss.“In areas like Indirapuram, there is hardly any enforcement. Containment zones are hardly contained. RWAs and apartment owners association (AOA) are not included in the district’s strategy either,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners.Agreeing that residents were not being involved in the fight, Col (retd) T P Tyagi, presidnet of flat owners’ federation said, “We had already conveyed our issues in this regard to the local administration during our meetings held in past.” The district administration, however, said that they had included RWAs in their strategy.“We have increased surveillance, testing and monitoring of the high incidence areas in order to control new cases and spread of infection. Apart from this, we have requested the RWAs to help in awareness drives. Besides, we have also launched massive public awareness campaign through the vehicles of police and corporation,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The district health department said that they are aiming to test all in containment zones. “Our focus is on 100% testing in containment zones as several of the residential segments like Indirapuram, Vishali, Vasundhara, Kavi Nagar and Raj Nagar among others have most of the containment zones from where we are getting new cases. So, we are working of focussed strategy to contain cases in these areas with more testing and increased surveillance,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/six-residential-segments-share-46-of-covid-19-cases-in-ghaziabad/story-0xItppbChqmL89eJVBFmEJ.html
03-10-2020||Chandigarh||2019 saw uptick in juveniles caught for rape in Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police in 2019 apprehended eight juveniles for rape, a significant rise in otherwise comparatively lean figures of those arrested for crime against women. Though Chandigarh witnessed a dip in number of offences committed by juveniles for third year in a row as per data provided by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), police registered eight rape cases against minors against five in 2018 and seven in 2017. However, in 2019, only one juvenile was apprehended for outraging a woman’s modesty and two for kidnapping, against five caught for the former and three for the latter offence in 2018. In 2017, police had detained seven juveniles for rape, three for outraging modesty and five for kidnapping. Overall, crime graph went downOverall, cases registered against juveniles saw a drop, with 117 in 2019 as compared to 137 in 2018 and 159 in 2017. However, Chandigarh was second to only Delhi among Union Territories that logged highest number of cases against juveniles (2,783) in 2019. At 49.7%, Delhi also recorded highest rate of crimes involving juveniles, followed by Chandigarh at 29.3%. As many as 208 juveniles were arrested in 2019, 36 of whom were caught for theft, 14 for burglary and three for murder. “Minors take to thefts to make easy money. Many of those apprehended admitted to having committed thefts to buy expensive phones or branded clothes and shoes, while a few were lured into crime to fund their craving for drugs. In fact, the ones involved in robbery and murders were also doing it to buy drugs,” shared a senior official of Chandigarh Police, who was not authorised to speak with media. Chandigarh Police’s endeavoursAccording to the police department, endeavours undertaken by the cops to impart skill development training to the children based in colonies bore fruit. The data pointed out that 208 such juveniles were school dropouts, of whom 178 had studied up to Class 10, while 22 left after completing primary schooling. The figures also revealed that 191 juveniles stayed with their parents, nine with guardians and only eight were homeless. UT director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal had started a skill development programme for them under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana to improve their lives and keep them away from crime and drugs. The police identified children who were into petty crimes, drug abuse and at high risk of getting involved in major criminal activities. NGOs were roped in that helped the police survey 22,000 children, 3,000 of whom from six peripheral areas were tagged as the high-risk category. They are in the age group of eight to 16. The police have enrolled them in vocational courses such as beauty and wellness, hospital assistance, retail store assistance, and food and beverage assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2019-saw-uptick-in-juveniles-caught-for-rape-in-chandigarh/story-NZJsf7qo6Pwa7tkGxYmpyN.html

The police said the woman, a Delhi resident, had earlier filed a zero-FIR at Bindapur police station in Uttam Nagar in Delhi, which was then marked to Sadar police station in Gurugram and an FIR was lodged here on Saturday. According to the police, the woman, who has a private job, alleged that she got acquainted with a police official from Gurugram in 2017 and after some correspondence, he took her to a hotel in Sector 49, where he allegedly sexually assaulted her. The police said she alleged that after the incident, he established sexual relations with her on multiple occasions and threatened her. Dinesh Kumar, SHO, Sadar police station, said, “The woman has levelled allegations against a police head constable. She had lodged a complaint in Delhi, where a zero-FIR was registered and based on that complaint, he has been booked. In the complaint, she has alleged that he had raped her. However, there are certain contradictions in her statement. It is mentioned in the statement that they got married. This is yet to be verified. We have summoned both the parties and a probe has been initiated. No arrests have been made so far.” In the complaint, the woman alleged that she got pregnant but the accused forced her to take abortion pills. She further alleged that he told her that he would get a divorce and then marry her. “In December 2019, he showed me fake documents of divorce from his wife, following which we got married in a temple in Ghaziabad. Later I found out that he had been lying and had committed a fraud. In June 2020, he called me to a hotel in Gurugram, and threatened to defame me on social media. He also threatened to implicate me in a false case and boasted about having contacts in police and CBI. I had filed a complaint earlier but had to withdraw under pressure from him” she said in the complaint.A case was registered against the accused police official under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code at Sadar police station on Saturday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-head-constable-booked-for-rape/story-RlgXgzcBDnQ0DPoo4UNvnI.html
03-10-2020||City||Covid-19 impact: Many pre-schools shut down, leave teachers jobless in Ludhiana||In the last five months, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has forced a number of pre-schools in the city to shut shop, leaving many teachers without jobs.More pre-schools are likely to shut down by the end of this month. A number of pre-schools situated in Gurdev Nagar, South city, Pakhowal Road, Dugri, Civil Lines have closed down as they were unable to meet monthly fixed expenses with many owners saying that the rent has been a major impediment.This move has been the last nail in the coffin for many teachers and Class IV employees, who have lost their jobs.Bugz and Beez preschool, located at the backside of Pancham Hospital, was running successfully till March this year, but the lockdown forced the owner to shut shop. Catering to nearly 75 children, the pre-school was running since 2017. Director of the school, Seema Sharma, said, “I started the pre-school three years ago with an aim to offer quality education, focus on the social development of a child, but the lockdown changed all my plans. With the schools being closed, very few parents were interested in online classes for their children. It was getting difficult to pay a monthly rent of ₹45,000, hence I decided to shut the pre-school.”The situation is no different for other pre-schools. DPS Kids Pre-school, situated on Pakhowal Road also shut down last month. Owner Bobby said, “There is no clarity on when we can re-open the school. We have informed parents that we have shut down and I will start another venture soon.”There are around 150 pre-schools in Ludhiana and several new playways and daycare centres have come up in the last two years.President of the Pre-school Association of Ludhiana, Amanpreet Singh Arora, said, “With pre-schools remaining closed since March-end, the owners are finding it difficult to survive. Uncertainty over the reopening of schools looms large, hence affecting those running in rented accommodations. Even parents are not willing to pay the fee due to which many of them are closing down.” Ishneet Sharma, director of Childhood Kindergarten Playway School, Punjab Mata Nagar, said, “Other factors have also led to the closure of pre-schools. It is often overlooked that what kind of quality is being maintained at an early childhood centre as there are no quality checks and no uniformity in the syllabus or age criteria. People who were running the pre-schools in rented properties could not meet their expenses as their income reduced to almost zero with parents completely refusing to pay even for online classes. Many owners were unable to bear the burden of monthly rent and teacher salaries.”Teachers left in the lurchI was working as a pre-school teacher for the last three years. Due to the pandemic, our pre-school situated in Dugri closed down as per government orders and in August the principal informed all the staff regarding the permanent closure of the school. Since I was left without a job, I decided to start tuition classes for students.Ankita Jindal, pre-school teacherFor the last 10 years, I was working as a caretaker for the day-care students in a preschool and used for work from 9 am to 4 pm. But after the coronavirus outspread in March, the school closed down and since then I did not receive my salary. I have run out of savings. On one hand, I’ve lost my job, while on the other, I had to pay my child’s school fee from my savings.Karamjit Kaur, Class IV employee of a pre-school||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-impact-many-pre-schools-shut-down-leave-teachers-jobless-in-ludhiana/story-eLg6lmMgIJHvgpQ4WH0GNP.html

In all, the report provided data for 34 cities.In Ludhiana, nine people were killed as a fallout of family discord, while people losing their cool during petty quarrels ended in 11 murders.This included the death of a 42-year-old realtor, who was shot dead during a birthday party following an altercation at Castle’s Barbeque restaurant and bar in Ludhiana’s Pavilion Mall on the intervening night of September 13 and 14 in 2019. This murder, resulting from a petty quarrel during a party, had left the city shocked.Dispute resulting from money matters led to the murder of four people, while property dispute was also behind one such case.Police investigations had found personal rivalry as the reason for four murders, while in two cases, personal gain was the driving force behind two people being killed.The second leading cause in the city – resulting in 10 murders – was illicit relationships. While the police could not establish the cause behind six cases, they also found that two women were killed by their husbands or in-laws over dowry. The NCRB report lists three murders for dowry in Punjab, of which two were reported in Ludhiana.Murders are penalised under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, which may entail life imprisonment or even capital punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dispute-behind-maximum-murders-in-ludhiana-reveals-ncrb-s-2019-data/story-SWXlch3sypCvy4hJwz4cvN.html
03-10-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata to get first underground metro station in 25 years||Kolkata will get an underground metro station after 25 years on Sunday as the East-West line will be extended till Phoolbagan, an official said.The Phoolbagan metro station is the first underground one to be opened on the line that will connect Sector V to Howrah Maidan, he said.Railway Minister Piyush Goyal will flag off the first train from Phoolbagan through a video link, the official said on Saturday.Services of the East-West Metro began earlier this year between Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium in the first phase.Commercial services between Phoolbagan and Sector V will commence from Monday, the official said.Owing to the COVID-19 situation, there will be no formal function at the venue.The underground MG Road metro station on the North- South line was opened in September 1995. All metro stations opened after that are either elevated or at grade-level.The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) granted authorisation for extension of services from Salt Lake Stadium to Phoolbagan station in June.Local TMC MP Sudip Bandopadhyay and MLAs Sashi Panja and Sadhan Pande, both ministers in the state government, will not participate in the programme, sources in their party said, claiming that the state government has been kept in the dark about the event.According to the Metro Railway, Bandopadhyay and the two local MLAs have been requested to join the virtual event of the inauguration.Bandopadhyay said he was unhappy with the way the Railway Ministry had tried to “bypass” the state government.“I am happy about the project, but why the state government was bypassed? Why did they not inform or invite the chief minister, who is also the former railway minister? She had extended all sorts of help to the East-West metro project.I am unhappy with the attitude of the authority,” he told PTI.Bandopadhyay said he was out of Kolkata and could not join the event.He also said that during Banerjee’s tenure as the railway minister, she used to invite the state transport minister despite having political differences with the then Left Front government.Panja, however, said she is yet to receive an invitation or letter from the Metro Railway.Metro Railway said that as the programme is being held online and no inauguration ceremony was being held, the local MLAs and MP were requested to join the event.“There is no proper inauguration ceremony. Everything is happening through video conference. So there is no invitation of any sort. The local MP and the MLAs have been requested to participate in the video conference,” a senior Metro official said.On February 13, the 4.88-km-long first phase of the East-West Metro got functional.The public representatives of the TMC gave that event a miss as well, protesting against the absence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s name from the invitation card for the programme.Senior TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Fire Services Minister Sujit Bose and Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Mayor Krishna Chakraborty were invited but had stayed away in protest.According to a senior Metro official, completion of the East-West corridor is likely to be delayed by up to one year due to an accident caused by an aquifer burst in the Bowbazar area during drilling operations in August 2019.The 16.6-km-long rapid transit system, connecting the twin cities of Kolkata and Howrah, may be completed by mid- 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-to-get-first-underground-metro-station-in-25-years/story-M9KEAXgqBIgjHQgwWJhYlI.html
03-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Grand Alliance announces seat-sharing deal, VIP walks out in protest||The Grand Alliance (GA) on Saturday took the lead by announcing much-awaited seat-sharing deal among its constituents for the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar, scheduled to begin from October 28. As per the final agreement, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has been allocated 144 out of 243 seats, which has the share of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), while the Congress did well this time and got 70 seats and Valmikinagar Lok Sabha constituency, the bypoll on which is scheduled to be held simultaneously. This is the best-ever seat deal that the Congress managed to strike since it allied with the RJD in the state. In 2005, the Congress was given 51 seats to contest under the RJD-led coalition. Sources said that the Congress would leave two seats for the NCP to contest. The left parties, including the CPI (ML), the CPI and the CPM, have been offered 29 seats. Of this, the CPI (ML) has been given the biggest share of 19 seats. Announcing the final negotiation, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav thanked the coalition partners for reposing trust in his leadership and said that he stood with the side of people and would help them get rid of the corrupt, insensitive and inefficient regime led by CM Nitish Kumar in Bihar. He said the number of seats for the VIP and JMM would be announced in the next two-three days. Also read: Chirag Paswan seeks people’s support for ‘Bihar first’ vision document; may fight polls independentlyVisibly dejected at Tejashwi’s offer, VIP chief Mukesh Sahni walked out of the conference, accusing Tejashwi of betraying his faith by not declaring the seats for this party. “He backstabbed the party, which remained with him throughout,” said Sahni, adding that the next course of his party would be decided on Sunday. Earlier, Tejashwi said that some of the leaders might find it hard to adjust as the all constituents were given fewer seats than their expectations, they should be ready to make a small sacrifice to save Bihar which was facing deep crisis and rule of anarchy. “Four rapes and five murders every hour sum up the scenario people of the state are grappling with,” he said, adding that migrant labours, students and the poor would not have forgotten the miseries they had undergone during the lockdown. Reiterating his resolve to launch the process of filling up 10 lakh vacancies in the government at his first cabinet meeting, Tejashwi said the GA would emerge as a strong alternative for the people to the present dispensation which was founded on the betrayal of the mandate. “I am a theth (rustic) Bihari, who stands by his commitments,” said the RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s scion, adding that the fee to apply for the vacancies would be done away with. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) screening committee chairman Avinash Pande praised Tejashwi for his stint as deputy CM and said the GA wanted Bihar to prosper under his leadership. “He is son of Lau Prasad, who is better known as the messiah of the poor and leader of social justice not only in Bihar but in the country. A large number of young people associate themselves with Tejashwi with the hope for a better Bihar,” said the Congress leader, apparently projecting Tejashwi as the CM face of the GA.Also read: Tejashwi Yadav Opposition’s CM face, Congress gets 70 seats Exhorting the people to teach Nitish Kumar a befitting lesson for hijacking the popular mandate and topple, Pande claimed that farmers, youths, Dalits and the poor were deeply frustrated by the anti-people policies being pursued by the NDA out of owing to thumping majority accumulated by reeling out false promises and propagating falsehood.

03-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram health dept braces for a rise in respiratory illnesses with onset of winter||The district health department has instructed its healthcare workers to be on alert for an uptick in respiratory illnesses over the next few weeks as the temperature drops with the onset of winter.Officials explained that the upcoming season will pose two challenges amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic: first there will be an increase in the severity of respiratory diseases other than Covid-19, such as asthma, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). The second challenge will be to tackle the spread of Covid-19 itself, which, experts say is likely to speed up during the colder months (a pattern that has been well established with other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza).Health department officials said they are preparing to meet both challenges by shoring up testing for Covid-19 and beefing up surveillance for ‘winter diseases’. Medical officers, lab technicians involved in sample collection, and NHM field staff have been told to prioritise tests for people suffering from signs of respiratory distress, or severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI).Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram, said, “The overall burden of respiratory diseases, both Covid and non-Covid, will rise in winter. The festive season is also coming up. So, there will be more social engagements and travelling. Low temperature and high levels of air pollution are perfect for symptoms of asthma and COPD to worsen. After monsoons, we knew that we will see more people coming in with flu-like symptoms; now we are expecting more people to come in showing signs of distress, such as chest pain, shortness of breath and upper respiratory tract infections.” All these patients, he added, would need to be tested for Covid-19, due to the overlapping nature of their symptoms.Dr MP Singh, nodal officer for containment zone management in Gurugram, added that the health department is prepared to absorb any such surge. “Our rapid response teams and field staff have been told that anyone showing even the slightest sign of respiratory distress needs to be given a test on a priority basis. The first step is to determine whether they are Covid-positive, in which case there is a particular course of treatment. If they are not, then they can be referred elsewhere to treat whatever it is they have. Our aim is to prevent the patient from going into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal.”As new daily infections, and test positivity, have slowly been dropping over the last few weeks, the health department has not had to urgently expand its testing capacity in September. “But we are well placed to conduct upwards of 5,000 tests per day by the end of October, so we will be able to accommodate anyone with symptoms who needs a test,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. He added that facilities for tertiary care are also available in adequate measure, with less than half of ICU and ventilator beds currently occupied, and only a quarter of general hospital beds with oxygen facility in use.Experts agreed that a heightened public health response would be required during winter months to keep the death rate of Covid-19 down. “In outbreak areas, or among vulnerable populations, authorities might want to consider giving free shots to protect against other respiratory illnesses, such as viral influenza or bacterial pneumonia. And of course, more tests for Covid-19 are a must because one should expect the transmission to accelerate in the winter,” said Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president ( research and policy) and director, Centre for Control of Chronic Conditions, PHFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-health-dept-braces-for-a-rise-in-respiratory-illnesses-with-onset-of-winter/story-juquTyWwmMK1nQ1FeLtM7K.html
03-10-2020||City||Model Sanskriti Schools: Fees will range from ₹200 to ₹500 per month||Gurugram: Model Sanskriti Schools being developed by the Haryana government will be following a varying fee structure for students in different classes, the department of school education has said. The fee in these schools will range from ₹200 to ₹500 on a monthly basis for classes 1 to 12, as per the latest guidelines released by the department. These schools will be recognised by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the classes will start from April 2021, the department said. Model Sanskriti Schools are schools that lay special emphasis on English as the medium of instruction. Last month, state education minister Kanwar Pal had said that over 1,000 schools across the state would be developed as the model schools. In the Gurugram district, 93 primary schools are being upgraded to these model schools with the first batch of English-medium classes slated to start in 2021. In a letter issued recently to district education officers across the state, the department shared directives, including the fee structure. According to the department, all such schools will have a separate co-ed wing where English will be the medium of instruction. While classes will also take place separately in Hindi, students enrolling in English medium classes will have to pay a monthly fee depending on the class level. Suman Sharma, who holds charge of the Government Model Sanskriti Primary School in Gurugram’s Sector 4/7 that was inaugurated last week, said that for students in classes 1 to 5, the one-time admission fee will be ₹500 whereas the same fee for students in classes 6 to 12 is ₹1,000. “The monthly fee starts from ₹200 for students in classes 1 to 3 and goes up till ₹500 for senior students in classes 11 and 12,” she said. Sharma further said that all schools have been asked to convene a meeting of the school management committee (SMC) and ensure that the names of the schools are changed to Model Sanskriti School. Besides, a school development plan is being created on the basis of which school infrastructure can be expanded, she said. As per the guidelines shared by the department, teachers in such schools will be selected through a special screening process and will be kept out of routine transfer drives. Teachers will also be given special training that will enable them to teach lessons in English. Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari said that while some schools had already started adopting the guidelines, others will be following suit so that arrangements are in place before the next academic year. “Schools that need to meet certain infrastructure requirements will be commencing work after holding consultations with the school management committee. Other steps such as the renaming of the schools have already been started. As far as teacher training is concerned, developments are awaited on that front,” said Kumari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/model-sanskriti-schools-fees-will-range-from-200-to-500-per-month/story-Pe3M4TKb2yM7L2a7wcfq0H.html
03-10-2020||Chandigarh||Covid antibodies found in 7.5% of Oxford vaccine trial volunteers at PGIMER||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has found antibodies against new coronavirus in 7.6% of the volunteers who were screened for the Oxford vaccine trials which are underway at the institute. Similarly, 82.5% of the recovered patients who had come forward for plasma donation at the institute’s blood bank were found to have developed the antibodies. Professor Mini P Singh from the department of virology said that the till now 66 volunteers have been screened for the vaccine trails of which five were found to have developed antibodies.“Fifty-nine volunteers for the Oxford vaccine trial along with seven health workers (Non-Covid) making a total of 66 participants, who were healthy and never encountered any symptoms of the virus, got tested for IgG antibody test. Out of 66 tested, five (7.6%) were found positive for IgG antibodies test, clearly indicating that they had contracted the infection but were asymptomatic and hence had developed antibodies,” a statement from the institute quoting Professor Mini P Singh said.She added that the department of virology has also conducted the test on 80 Covid-19 recovered patients which comprised participants who had donated plasma and healthcare workers from the Institute. Of the 80 tested, 66 (82.5%) were found to have IgG antibodies, meaning thereby, that they developed antibodies post their recovery from the virus.”Singh further concluded, “This data shows that the majority of the recovered persons developed antibodies. However, among the healthy population, the seropositivity was found to be only 7.6% implying that most of the population in the tricity is still not exposed to the virus. However, it’s very preliminary data and larger systematic studies are on the way.” The institute statement quoting Professor Jagat Ram, director PGIMER, stated, “We are at a very preliminary stage of the study which is aimed at identifying the seroprevalence of Covid-19 at the community level and monitoring the transmission trends. It is too premature to say anything conclusively. The study is ongoing to collate more evidence to reach a definite result on the subject.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-antibodies-found-in-7-5-of-oxford-vaccine-trial-volunteers-at-pgimer/story-txiSnJR7qxrdccKeyyw8fI.html

Last year, there were 46 accidents and 16 fatalities on this stretch.Jitender Mittal, chief engineer (infrastructure), GMDA, said, apart from fixing potholes, the tender also seeks to fix other structural defects associated with this stretch. In 2018, GMDA started taking over the maintenance of the master roads in the city from Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). It has now started floating tenders for the annual and periodic maintenance of master roads on a first-time basis, including for GCER.“Unlike most other stretches, where we are floating tenders for annual maintenance, GCER needs regular fixing. Hence, we are floating tenders for maintaining the stretch on a periodic basis rather than an annual one,” said Mittal. Mittal added that the stretch encounters frequent problems. For instance, last night, a drainage leakage occurred, which led to the stretch being inundated in patches. “The tender has been floated to address all such issues,” said Mittal, adding that they were waiting for the monsoon season to be over before commencing with any bitumen-related work.Bids for GMDA’s tender are valid till October 5 and the projected cost is ₹34.38 lakh, said officials.“We have highlighted several areas in the city, where traffic congestion, accidents, and illegal parking are rampant. Subsequently, we have shared the necessary information with various public bodies. The issues with GCER had also been conveyed to GMDA as part of this process. We are taking all steps to reduce accidents in the city,” said DK Bhardwaj, DCP traffic, Gurugram Police.As per a 2019 GMDA axel-weight report, GCER is designed to sustain a maximum load of 8-15 tons. However, during an inspection, most heavy vehicles were generally found to be carrying four-five times this weight, amounting to 30-40 tons, leading to the frequent formation of potholes. Further GCER is a major thoroughfare, carrying heavy traffic throughout the year. According to GMDA’s traffic study, the average number of vehicles plying on GCER per hour in June 2018 was around 4,100 vehicles per hour. This increased to 4,600 vehicles per hour in June 2019. By June 2028, the average number of vehicles per hour is expected to be around 7,000 while by June 2038, it is expected to rise to 11,500 vehicles, the report further stated.GMDA officials said that until a ₹300-crore project for building flyovers and laying the entire stretch with Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) commences, GCER will continue to remain vulnerable to formation of potholes. Re-carpeting and maintenance work will only provide a temporary fix.The project is still in planning stages, said officials. PQC is a material used in the construction of national highways as well as airport runways.“Due to its connectivity to major road networks, as part of its Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP), GMDA is treating GCER like the outer ring road in Delhi. The flyover alone would not be able to address the problem of heavy traffic. The lower layer of road also needs to be in a position to sustain this weight. PQC is a tried-and-tested approach and GMDA can go ahead with this method, provided it is executed correctly,” said Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-gmda-floats-tender-for-repairing-golf-course-extension-road/story-dllTWqNFH67csbMQmsNzXO.html

What’s more, he donated blood for the 106th time as he bid adieu to the institute. He had joined PGIMER in 1983 for graduation in medical laboratory sciences. His quest to learn more led him to do post-graduation and he went on to study technology microbiology (parasitology) as an in-service candidate. He topped it off with a doctorate.Journalists caught in the crossfire at Akali protest When Chandigarh Police resorted to a lathicharge on Shiromani Akali Dal activists at Zirakpur on Thursday to prevent them from entering the Union Territory amid prohibitory orders, the protesters ran towards the journalists for cover. Several journalists ended up bearing the brunt of the police action. The protest was led by SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal along with Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Bunty Romana, and Dera Bassi SAD MLA NK Sharma. The SAD kisan march activists defied the police when they were told that only a few leaders would be allowed to meet the governor. No MC meet in September, Congress cries foul There was no general house meeting of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation on Friday. The Congress termed it a violation of MC rules and accused the ruling BJP of working against local democracy. BJP councillors also expressed dissatisfaction but chose to keep their views “off the record”. The common refrain was: “The meeting should be there. Let me check with the MC commissioner and the acting mayor.” It’s another matter that they never got back with the response to their queries. Car-borne thieves drive away with SUV mirror Beware, four car-borne thieves driving through Chandigarh at night are stealing whatever they can lay their hands on. A resident of Sector 38, Anuj Raura, lodged a complaint of the theft of a side mirror of the Fortuner parked in his courtyard. The thieves who took away the mirror were caught on CCTV driving an Etios. The CCTV footage showed two of the four men entering the courtyard and fleeing with the mirror. When VIP violators forget the mask They issue strict Covid guidelines but take it easy themselves. A photo of Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja was shared on a WhatsApp group of the district public relations office, showing him wearing the mask improperly as his nose was uncovered. Haryana Speaker and Panchkula legislator Gian Chand Gupta, who recently recovered from Covid-19, organised a havan (prayer meet) “to make the environment corona-free” but many participants were seen without a mask. Local Congress leader Ranjeeta Mehta, who also recovered from Covid-19, was seen driving a tractor during a farmers’ protest without a mask. A festive breather in gloomy Covid times The new director of health services of Chandigarh, Dr Amandeep Kang, received a warm welcome when she took charge on October 1. As she stepped out of her car to reach office, employees of the Government Multispeciality Hospital, Sector 16, were seen clapping for her. Amid the cheers, she even came forward to hug several junior colleagues. “It appeared like a festival in these gloomy Covid times,” a senior doctor at the hospital said. Private school students reluctant to join back A week after academic consultations were started in Chandigarh schools, government schools are reporting a rise in the number of students joining such sessions with children of Classes 9 and 11 also coming along with the board classes. However, students of private schools are still reluctant. Most private schools that opened up partially for students from September 21 are yet to receive any student for academic consultation. The education department will soon hold a meeting with heads of private and government schools to start academic consultations for students below Class 9 as well. Confusion over late fee for PU admission According to the academic calendar for first year post-graduate courses released by Panjab University on September 29, the late fee with permission from the vice-chancellor is Rs 3,000. This is higher than the amount notified earlier. While teachers wanted to know how and when the hike was implemented, the dean college development council put out a notice saying the late fee with the V-C’s permission was Rs 2,040.

03-10-2020||City||Our take: Victims of cheating and theft, senior citizens in Chandigarh need to feel safe||At an age when they should be living comfortably on their savings and pensions, enjoying the golden years of their lives, senior citizens are falling victims to crimes in Chandigarh. The city has recorded the highest rate of cheating cases against those aged above 60 in 2019, a report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) revealed recently.According to the Crimes in India 2019 report, seven cases were lodged under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code in Chandigarh, which has a population of 70,000, giving it a rate of 10.4 in 2019. This rate is calculated by taking into account the number of incidents per lakh population. Delhi came next with a rate of 9.2 and Maharashtra with 7.5. The national rate is 2.2 incidents per lakh population.The city also has the second highest rate of thefts against senior citizens with 29.8 incidents per one lakh population after Delhi at 48.5. To Chandigarh also goes the dubious record of the third highest rate of total crimes committed against seniors at 74.5 incidents per lakh population, placing the city third after Gujarat at 85.4 and Delhi at 93.8. A total of 50 crimes were committed against seniors in the city last year as against 64 in 2018. With 34 cases pending from previous years, the Chandigarh police investigated 84 in all in 2019, out of which chargesheets were submitted in 17 cases. As many as 44 cases are still pending.It’s not all that difficult to understand the reasons for the crimes. Many aged persons live on their own as their children have moved to other cities, even abroad, for work opportunities. Helpers left behind to care for them often end up exploiting them. As a majority of the elderly is also not computer savvy, they can easily be convinced by unscrupulous elements to share sensitive data such as bank account numbers and pin numbers and have the money siphoned off their accounts.A concerted effort needs to be made by the police to protect this vulnerable section of our society. Most importantly, banks need to be extra vigilant while handling seniors’ accounts, reporting suspicious transactions and ensuring attendants are ready at banks to help them. A special ‘seniors’ telephone helpline should be set up for anyone wanting to report fraudulent bank calls or needing information on their accounts.The police, apart from strengthening the beat system to check on seniors, should maintain lists of seniors without assistance and ensure areas and sectors where they live are patrolled at night.Resident welfare associations too can play a key role in seniors’ care, recruiting volunteers to call the elderly regularly, helping them with bill payments and medicine collections and checking on domestic helpers caring for them.Putting simple systems in place will ensure the safety and well-being of the people who need the city’s maximum care and attention in the later years of their life. Safe seniors What should be done to prevent crimes against the elderly? Chandigarh has recorded the highest rate of cheating cases against those aged above 60 in 2019. What should be done to keep them safe?

03-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi adds 2,258 new cases of Covid-19||Delhi reported 2,258 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, according to the daily health bulletin, down from the average 3,025 cases reported each day during the seven preceding days. This could be because of fewer tests conducted on Gandhi Jayanti, when only 39,306 samples were tested as compared to average of over 53,000 samples tested every day. The fewer tests meant a slight increase in the positivity rate, which still remained below 6%, at 5.74% as on Saturday. This was 5.19% the day before. The transmission of the disease is thought to be in control if a positivity rate of less than 5% is maintained over two weeks. Delhi also reported 34 more deaths due to the viral infection, taking the total toll to 5,472, the data shows. The cumulative case fatality ratio (CFR) – fraction of deaths among total cases reported – stands at 1.9%, slightly higher than the national average of 1.57%. The number of people hospitalized with the infection has also declined over the last ten days, dipping below 6,000 for the first time since a surge in cases in the second week of September. As on Saturday, 5,989 people were admitted to hospitals across the city with Covid-19. At its peak, the number of hospitalisations had been just over 7,000. “The availability of beds – especially ICU beds – has improved in the city over the last seven to eight days with the number of hospitalisations reducing by around 1,000. The situation is much better right now,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.The number of active cases or those with current infections has also come down to just over 25,000 for the first time since September second week. At its peak, there were over 32,000 active cases in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lowest-new-cases-in-delhi-since-aug-31/story-D2X80QzPDReztAQH81XcaO.html

Puri, as per BJP insiders, was specifically sent by the party high command to Chandigarh to hold a press conference on the issue. He also said the Narendra Modi government was committed to safeguarding the interests of farmers and minimum support price (MSP) system will continue. “Misinformation, disinformation and outright lies are being spread that the Centre intends to dismantle the MSP system,” Puri told the media. He said: “Lies are being spread that farmers’ land will be snatched by big corporates. Sale, lease or mortgage of farmland is prohibited. Farmers’ land is also protected against any recovery. All this is mentioned in the Bills.” The Union minister sought to know from the Congress and other opposition parties if they were opposing the farm Bills then why 33 of their 107 MPs in Rajya Sabha remained absent from the House on September 20. “The ordinances were promulgated in May. Go through the Congress manifestoes of 2017 (Punjab Assembly polls) and 2019 (Lok Sabha),” he said, adding former prime minister Manmohan Singh and former deputy chairman of erstwhile Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia had said that “these things” should be implemented, apparently referring to the new farm laws. Claiming that the new farm laws were a win-win situation for everyone, he said the BJP-led government wanted to put money in farmers’ pockets by liberating them. When pointed out that agriculture was a state subject, Puri said that it was mentioned in the Constitution that the Union government can legislate in this domain in the national interest. “Farmers will be the real beneficiaries as they will get better prices,” he said. Avoids direct attack on SAD Puri, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Amrtisar seat, avoided a direct attack on Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal that recently snapped ties with the BJP over the new laws. However, without naming Harsimrat Kaur, who resigned from the Modi cabinet last month, he said till September 6, she thought the Bills were good for the farmers. About the SAD’s claim that they had raised their concerns over the farm reform laws with the Centre, he said, “Where and when it was raised, I do not know. Som Parkash ji (union minister) and I also sit in the council of ministers.” “Whatever information was sought on the Bills was provided to the SAD. They asked for a written assurance from the Union agriculture minister and a statement in Parliament on the MSP, which was done. I don’t know what happened in three days ahead of the first Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha,” he said. Union minister Som Parkash said the SAD had supported the ordinances. Even former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal also spoke in favour of these Bills, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/oppn-doing-hooliganism-in-name-of-dissent-hardeep-puri-on-farm-laws/story-A36Iw0wPjnzd7EL2QAChGO.html

Now, it will open before Zojila. Distance and travel time to Manali has also reduced,” said Dorjay.He said that in no way has Atal Tunnel provided 24x7 connectivity between Leh and Manali. “There are three passes - Lachung La, Taglang La and Baralacha La - on the Manali-Leh axis.

03-10-2020||City||Post-Covid, healthcare in India must take a Gandhian turn||Many years ago, on a train journey from Mumbai to Wardha, to appear for the entrance exam to the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Sevagram (India’s first rural medical college), I hurriedly read through a book on Gandhian thought, because it was a part of the exam curriculum. I did well in the examination, but chose not to join the college which was run by a board of Gandhian scholars and doctors. Instead, I chose the King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Mumbai. After spending 12 long years at KEM, I became a qualified super-specialist and then continued my supposedly stellar career path by eventually joining as a consultant at a ‘five-star’ private hospital, which primarily caters to the upper strata of the society and provides world-class care and results. Unfortunately, India’s healthcare, too, followed a similar trajectory: it moved away from villages into the metros, from preventive and primary care to curative and tertiary care, and from the public sector to the private sector. Today, as I reflect back, I wonder if joining the Gandhian institute would have been a more satisfying career choice. Also, had India decided to develop not just one, but hundreds of such rural (Gandhian) medical colleges and hospitals in the villages and small towns of our country in the 1960s and 70s (the Sevagram-Wardha medical college was started in 1969), the whole healthcare pyramid in India would’ve been the right way up, and not turned upside down, as it is today. If Gandhiji would’ve lived longer, it may have actually happened. Today, our erroneous health trajectory and our poor health infrastructure have been thoroughly exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, eight months into the pandemic, as we are coming to terms with the virus, it’s time that governments must start thinking and planning about how to rectify the wrong path that we have taken. It is time for India’s healthcare to take a Gandhian turn, or shall I say, a U-turn. The young Mohandas was eager to become a doctor, but his brother and father had nipped his desire in the bud – the reason being that Vaishnavas should have nothing to do with the dissection of dead bodies. So he went to England and studied Law. But even for the Barrister Gandhi, health –both personal and social – was of great importance. His life, principles and writings, hold many lessons about health and healthcare.The first turn: From healthcare to health The first Gandhian turn – that we as individuals as well as a nation – must take, is to move away from just thinking about healthcare, without thinking about health. Prioritising health over healthcare means living healthier lifestyles as individuals and as a society and enabling its citizens to lead such lifestyles. It also means prioritising preventive care over curative care and primary healthcare over tertiary care. Not just Gandhi, but recently even the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, Dr Sandro Galea, in a live online dialogue about Indian healthcare, in the wake of the pandemic, pointed out the need for India and Indians to emphasise health over healthcare.Gandhi was a short and lean man, but had a healthy disposition. Throughout his life, he was more than conscious about what and how much he ate, avoiding intoxicants and the need for regular exercise. An interesting example of his diet fanaticism was how during a serious illness, he refused to take cow’s milk (because of a vow he had taken to abstain from it due to ill-treatment of cows while milking them), and was then persuaded to take consume goat’s milk – which was much more expensive. That is probably why Sarojini Naidu once said to him, “How costly it is to keep you simple.” Gandhi, after a pause, had replied in a contemplative mood, “Yes, God will forgive me. I have to maintain my body in a healthy way so that I can carry on my mission.” Gandhiji was also a fitness freak, and walked nearly 18km every day for over 40 years. It has been estimated that he must’ve walked enough to go around the earth twice.Gandhi was equally concerned about the health of his colleagues and of the poor masses. He realised that health also depends on the air we breathe, the earth we live on and the water we drink. It meant that to be healthy, one needs to live in simple, but clean and uncongested dwellings. In his book ‘Key To Health’ published in 1948, he says that the general rule should be to live in a locality which is not too congested, and insist upon the house being well-lighted and well-ventilated. He believed that cleanliness is next to Vaishnavaite Godliness. His ashrams in Sevagram and Ahmedabad are examples of these beliefs. He would have been aghast at the urban sprawl of unhygienic and congested slums. Prioritising health over healthcare would mean providing proper housing and sanitation and not just good hospitals. In this context, the Prime Minister’s campaign for freeing India of open defecation can be considered a Gandhian initiative.The second turn: From metros to towns and villagesAs was mentioned in the beginning of this article, our health trajectory has been lop-sided. And although late in the day (a good 70 years after the Independence), it is never too late to make amends. Healthcare must move from the KEM hospitals in cities and metros to Kasturba Hospitals in towns and villages. It must move from the corporate Apollo Hospitals to modern public Sushrut or Dhanwantari hospitals. Why can we not imagine a reoriented healthcare system where people from metros go to towns and villages for getting their major surgeries done – and probably at a much lesser cost! Gandhi’s statement, “The future of India lies in its villages,” still holds good, although it has been consistently neglected by the disproportionate growth of Indian cities and urban regions, whereas there isn’t as much growth being witnessed in the villages. This applies to the healthcare infrastructure too. Over the past 20 years, the only meaningful healthcare infrastructure that has been developed in rural areas is a spattering of unregulated nursing homes set up by private doctors. Needless to say that the care provided in most of them is not up to the mark, many times unscientific and expensive. The other health-related infrastructure to come up in rural settings across the country has been the hundreds of private medical colleges run by politicians, where ironically, urban students come and study. Most of these institutions have made a mockery of Gandhian values and medical ethics.During his lifetime, Gandhi advised doctors to go to villages. And his interesting advice to them was: “He will not go out as a patron saint of the villages; he will have to go in humility with a broom-stick in his hand. There is a Trinity of evil – insanitation, poverty and idleness – that you will have to be faced with, and you will fight them with broom-sticks, quinine and castor oil, and if you will believe me, with the spinning-wheel.”I believe that even today, the paucity of doctors wanting to go to the villages is because they do not want to go there with the humility as suggested by Gandhi. They do not see themselves as social workers, while being a doctor. This mentality has to change. This can only happen with a Gandhian mindset. And thus, Gandhian values need to be taught as a part of the medical curriculum in all medical colleges, as they hopefully still continue to do at Wardha’s MGIMS. I would also suggest putting a moratorium on new medical colleges in cities and metros. The third turn: From specialists to generalists and paramedics, from tertiary care to primary careGandhi, while laying great emphasis on preventing diseases, also believed that the most common 42 diseases do not require a specialist doctor, and can be treated easily by a good nurse or a generalist doctor. Gandhi himself served as a nurse in Mission Hospitals and also during the Boer War in South Africa. In his descriptions of his illnesses during his lifetime, he describes how only after several basic therapies were tried, did he opt to go to a specialist doctor. In India, with our lop-sided healthcare trajectory, we have sadly moved away from primary healthcare. The initial efforts and enthusiasm to develop primary healthcare centres (PHCs) did not last long, and many PHCs exist today as dilapidated structures without staff and equipment. We do not even offer a postgraduation course in general practice at most of our medical institutions. The lack of good, modern, well-equipped primary healthcare facilities has led to overcrowding and overburdening of bigger hospitals and tertiary centres. In this context, the efforts of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi to rectify this anomaly by setting up a chain of modern Mohalla clinics have been exemplary, and must be emulated across the country.The fourth turn: From a non-scientific to a scientific and research-minded approachGandhiji was always scientific in his approach towards health and healthcare. He was very critical of the fact that the indigenous systems of medicine had not kept abreast with modern methods of research. Regarding Ayurvedic doctors, he has written, “They impute to Ayurveda an omnipotence which it does not possess, and in so doing, they have made it a stagnant system, instead of a gloriously progressive science.” As I write this, it brings to my mind the recent tall claims made by an Ayurvedic consumer goods and medicines manufacturing company regarding their new drug which could cure coronavirus.Gandhi praised western medicine for the “…brilliant array of discoveries and inventions which western physicians and surgeons boast.” Indian doctors and basic medical researchers have to go overseas to western centres to let their research flourish and bear fruit. We must facilitate our doctors and bio-researchers to be able to do meaningful research. Many of my surgeon-peers in Europe or USA spend a day every week in modern research labs attached to their hospitals and medical colleges. How many surgeons in India can do that?The fifth turn: From private to public health and healthcareThe final Gandhian turn to take is to move away from the limitations of an overwhelmingly privatised, disintegrated and for-profit healthcare system, to a more egalitarian, modern and predominantly public healthcare delivery model. The limitations of our exceedingly privatised model have been more than exposed by this pandemic. A similarly over-privatised system exists in USA and we know the havoc the pandemic wreaked in that country too.Gandhi was very clear in his views about the priorities of the medical profession. On February 13, 1921, on the occasion of opening of the Tibbia National Medical College, he said, “Lastly I shall hope that this college will inculcate among the students the belief that the profession of medicine is not intended for earning fat fees, but for alleviating pain and suffering”. Thus, he would have certainly been against a system which was largely for-profit. In 1991, when we liberalised the economy, the state withdrew many economic restraints, but it has also withdrawn from many of its social responsibilities: health and education. The pandemic has revealed the tragic consequences of abdicating these state responsibilities. The recent spurt of many national and state insurance schemes for citizens to avail treatments in private, non-modern, mom-and-pop, stand-alone nursing homes (it’s difficult to call many of them modern hospitals) cannot be equated to being treated in well-equipped public, modern multispecialty hospitals and centres.It is said, if you sweat in peace, you don’t bleed in the war. During this war against coronavirus, we are bleeding and bleeding much more than others because we did not sweat in peacetimes. We did not build the right health infrastructure. We did not prioritise the health of our people over healthcare. We left the health of our people to the mercy of the market forces. We allowed wealth to buy health. We disabled our citizens from even attempting to remain healthy by making them live in cramped and unhygienic conditions, where social distancing is an impossibility, and asking them to keep a 2-metre distances is a ridicule. I hope that the bright warning light that the pandemic has shone on our failures is strong and scorching enough to be perceived even by our blind or Nelson-eyed politicians.Let us not forget what Bapuji, the conscience-keeper of our nation, once said: “It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.”(Dr Santosh Karmarkar is a consultant paediatric surgeon and paediatric urologist at Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/post-covid-healthcare-in-india-must-take-a-gandhian-turn/story-CqXKKpV2F3NKqAQQL8xEyO.html
03-10-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A dapper cradle killer||Observant citizens nurturing a passion for Nature and equipped with high-tech gadgets (the latest smartphones have very powerful cameras) can make productive contributions to our awareness of the behaviour of species. And, all from the comfort of a plush settee, if luck and chance come laden in a silver spoon! The Oriental Pied hornbill, a rare bird and beloved bird of Chandigarh, is a far more dapper cousin of the State Bird, the Grey hornbill.While most think hornbills are fruit eaters, this big bird’s formidable bill is not just a piece of eye candy. It can savage and mangle little birds and chicks with a force as brute as garden shears set upon a tender rose stem. The butcher bill can equally remove an egg from another bird’s nest with an extractive touch as delicate as a brain surgeon’s, before gobbling it whole and without remorse! In other words, the hornbill is a cradle predator.In a Sector 8 bungalow garden in Chandigarh, a pair of Pied hornbills staked out a nest of Rose-ringed parakeets in a tree hollow. The hornbills were on the hunt for chicks or eggs.Within a few minutes, the male hornbill pulled out a parakeet egg. The hunt was witnessed from inside the house by Nitin Sarin. He quietly took photographs bringing to light this aspect of hornbill feeding behaviour, the first such photo documentation from Chandigarh. Asian hornbills also hunt scorpions, lizards, geckos, skinks, earthworms, frogs, caterpillars, beetles, butterflies, cicadas, grasshoppers while some hornbill species list serpents on their omnivorous diet charts.A TRINKET GLITTERS IN THE NIGHTIt was assessed as a routine snake rescue call when Salim Khan made his way to a house in Sector 21, Panchkula, late on Wednesday night. The householders had seen the serpent take shelter underneath planks of wood in their garden and Khan told them to maintain vigilance till the time he got there. Khan nabbed the serpent easily but its patterns mystified him. In all his decades of rescuing serpents, the hawk-eyed Khan had never seen this one before. In the darkness as light shone on the serpent, it appeared to him as if dazzling zebra stripes had materialised on a reptile so far away from the African savanna. Identified later by field researcher and snake expert Vivek Sharma as the Himalayan Trinket snake (Orthriophis hodgsoni Günther, 1860), its rescue heralded the first authentic record of this species from Haryana. This species is encountered at elevations ranging between 1,000 to 3,200 m, so the Panchkula specimen was somewhat an oddity. It is possible that the serpent got swept by monsoon torrents in the upper hills and landed in the Ghaggar river bed adjacent to Sector 21, just as Himalayan fishes and flora travel far into the plains on water surges.This trinket species is found in India, Nepal and Tibet, is non-venomous and kills prey such as rodents, small mammals and lizards by constriction just like a python. It is also known as the Hodgson’s Rat snake. “Trinket snake species get their common English names as they are colourful and beautiful,” Sharma told this writer.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-a-dapper-cradle-killer/story-hR0WRYeyQD4Ym4fOtpytHI.html

03-10-2020||City||Delhi’s air quality may enter ‘poor’ zone on Sunday||New Delhi: With a dip in mercury and farm fires picking up in the neighbouring Haryana and Punjab, Delhi’s air quality may turn ‘poor’ by Sunday (October 4), government agencies have warned. The last time this year Delhi’s air quality was in the poor zone was in March. As per Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, Saturday’s average AQI was 189 -- in the moderate zone, close to the poor mark (at 201). So far this year, air quality has remained between good to moderate zones only. Overall, this year has so far seen cleaner air than 2019 with Covid-19 induced lockdown and a good monsoon keeping air quality under check. On a scale 0-500, a value of 0-50 is considered ‘good’ (minimal health risk), 51-100 is ‘satisfactory’ (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is ‘moderate’ (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease), 200-300 is ‘poor’ (breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure), 300-400 is ‘very poor’ (respiratory illness on prolonged exposure) and 400-500 is ‘severe’ (affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases). According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, Delhi’s air quality could deteriorate over the next few days. “Air quality may deteriorate to the lower end of the ‘poor’ category by October 4. An increase in stubble burning fires observed recently in Punjab, Haryana and bordering regions is likely to start impacting Delhi in the coming days,” the SAFAR bulletin released on Saturday said. According to officials in Haryana and Punjab, this year the crop stubble burning started at least a week earlier than last year. “Last year stubble burning incidents were recorded from October 1 , which is the usual scenario, however, this year farmers started burning paddy residue from September 25. This is why by October first week we have already had over 200 farm fires, of which a few are accidental fires as well, which we are verifying from field officers,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). From September 25 to October 2, Haryana has recorded 256 farm fires. Last year by the same time, only 35 incidents were recorded, according to HSPCB officials. National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) satellite imagery between September 22 and October 1 shows 880 farm fires in Punjab. Of this, the maximum, 554, were reported from Amritsar. In 2019, only 224 fires were recorded by October 1. “We have been monitoring the fire counts through satellite imagery. This year the farm fires started earlier than last year with Punjab recording a 100% increase than last year. But it also indicates that since the burning has started early, it is likely to not peak around Diwali when pollution levels spike the most and weather conditions are not favourable for dispersal of pollutants. The crucial period begins from October 15, when weather conditions start stagnating,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at IIT Delhi’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences. According to scientists in the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there has been a consistent drop in night temperature over the past few days. On Saturday, night temperature settled at 20.3 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal while maximum settled at 36.1 degrees, two notches above normal. “Both day and night temperatures are likely to decrease from October 5. Also, the wind pattern and speed are changing. Falling of temperature and slow wind speed are not favourable for dispersal of pollutants. This combined with higher density of farm fires may lead to a deterioration in air quality,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD’s head of regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-air-quality-may-enter-poor-zone-on-sunday/story-g1pGtq6vB9xw4cBzQs2HVJ.html

The roadways officials have approached the Haryana, Himachal and Delhi transport authorities, seeking their approval to restart services. Haryana government had sought Punjab’s nod to start inter-state bus operations, while Himachal announced to resume the inter-state services last week. “We are now planning to start the inter-state service soon after receiving a nod from the neighbouring states. Haryana is ready but Delhi authorities are yet to decide on the standard operating procedure (SOP),” Parneet Minhas, deputy director, in-charge of roadways bus operations, said. Currently, roadways is running 40% of its fleet in absence of inter-state operations. General manager, roadways depot-1, Navraj Batish, said the profit was minuscule. “Now, we will earn more with no cap on passenger capacity,” he said. In its ‘Unlock 4’ guidelines on September 1, the Centre lifted the restrictions on the interstate movement of people and goods and did away with the mandatory approvals and e-permits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-roadways-readies-for-inter-state-operations/story-YPQ2RlPtQiAe6HQmhUKRqJ.html

Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag on Saturday claimed that he has conveyed his concerns over the laws to deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. He said it is unfortunate that even after many MLAs and farmers’ unions expressed concerns over these laws, the Union government seems to be reluctant to address the issues. “As a farmer’s son, I know the consequences these three laws will have. I have raised my voice against these bills at every stage. I have always raised the voice of farmers’ and labourers and will not sit quite in this fight. The three laws will be beneficial to only a few crony capitalists while the farmers’, labourers and consumers will bear the brunt,” he added. Sihag further said that though his views are different from that of the party, he has no differences with deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. “Dushyant became deputy CM with the support of other MLAs and not because of his political background. I am happy with the way the state government is functioning. Deputy CM Chautala always solved my grievances related to development work but my views on these laws are different from the party’s. I am surprised with the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced these laws against the farmers’ will,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-jjp-mla-speaks-out-against-farm-laws/story-B1XWTxIxivDPACJFZcWZbP.html

The proposed commission, according to the spokesman, will keep a keen watch on employment opportunities to be available in the state and ensure transparency in recruitment.“The commission will help the youth get a loan under various schemes from banks after arranging training for them as required by the industry,” he said. The commission will get job fairs organized for overseas jobs in coordination with the concerning embassies and high commissions of other countries. The Yogi Adityanath government had set up a temporary commission for the purpose of mapping skills of over 30 lakh migrants that had returned from various states amid the Covid-19 lockdown and help them get work as per their skill and suitability. The agriculture production commissioner (APC) and the industrial and infrastructure development commissioner (IIDC) jointly head this commission. “But desired results are not available since both the officers have totally different areas of work,” the spokesman said, adding, “This is why the government is considering setting up a statutory permanent employment commission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-mulls-over-creating-employment-commission-in-urban-semi-urban-areas/story-7Syu4el2JBaOvAK8BwiOqK.html

Banerjee, who held a protest march against the Hathras gang rape case, said she will stand by the Dalit community till the end as her caste is “humanity” and she does not believe in differentiation on the grounds of caste and religion. The march, the first by the fiesty TMC supremo since March when the nationwide lockdown was declared to break the coronavirus infection chain, covered the 2-km distance between Birla Planetarium to Gandhi statue on Mayo Road here. Sharpening her attack, Banerjee said, “Covid-19 is not a big pandemic. BJP is the biggest pandemic. It is the biggest pandemic of atrocities against Dalit and backward communities.” “We should stand up against these atrocities ... The kind of atrocities that are taking place are completely unacceptable,” she said addressing the rally. “A dictatorship is going on across the country.Instead of government for the people, it is running a government against the people, the Dalits and the farmers,” she said. Hitting out at the Centre for allegedly failing to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, Banerjee said it seemed that the community spread of the disease has begun as people who don’t venture out and stay in a protective atmosphere are also getting infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/dalits-are-being-tortured-most-dictatorship-going-on-in-the-country-mamata-banerjee/story-iyHatZxBSt1qEAkq2Jf7DM.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||To escape Delhi Police, robber applies excreta on his body||A 23-year-old man, involved in four criminal cases, applied faeces on his body to avoid being arrested, but was held by police in Delhi’s Kashmere Gate area, officials said on Saturday. The accused has been identified as Arjun, a resident of Madangir, they said. On Thursday, a police team patrolling Nitya Nand Marg near Kashmere Gate metro station noticed two bike-borne men behaving suspiciously. They were signalled to stop, but the suspects approached aggressively towards the policemen in order to intimidate them, a senior police officer said. “Their bike slipped and they tried to escape from the spot. However, one suspect managed to flee by running in the opposite direction of traffic coming on Yudhister Setu, whereas Arjun was caught after around one-kilometer chase,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse said. He tried to use pepper spray on police but could not succeed. In order to escape from police’s clutches, he took out faeces from his trousers and applied all over his body and even smeared it on the uniform of a policeman. Notwithstanding the bizarre trick, the policeman caught hold of the accused and apprehended him, they said. Arjun, along with his accomplice, used to commit robbery. When they did not get an easy target, they used to spill oil over car to divert the attention of its driver and steal belongings from the vehicle, police said. He kept a knife and a pepper spray for threatening people and police. Raids were conducted to nab his accomplice, he said. A gold chain, one bike, one pepper spray, one bottle automobile oil used for spilling on car engines, ball bearing used for breaking glass and a knife were recovered from his possession, police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-escape-delhi-police-robber-applies-excreta-on-his-body/story-EBCQV1o7TzywQrbd1sD1OP.html
03-10-2020||City||Suspense over Sidhu’s presence at Rahul’s tractor march on Sunday||As political temperature hots up on the issue of new farm laws, Congress leader and former party president Rahul Gandhi will launch a three-day protest march with 3,000 tractors from Moga on Sunday.There is no clarity, however, on the participation of party’s Amritsar East MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu. Sidhu has been among the Congress’ star election campaigners in the past, but is the bête noire of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Sidhu has not shared stage with Amarinder for over a year.Sidhu’s strained relationship with Amarinder became public after the former talked of a ‘friendly match’ at a Lok Sabha election rally in Bathinda on May 17, 2019, referring to alleged ‘inaction’ by the Amarinder-led government against the culprits of sacrilege incidents. Sidhu left the state cabinet in June last year after his portfolio was changed from local bodies to power.Cooperation and jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is overseeing Rahul’s visit, told HT on Saturday that a huge gathering was expected at the grain market in Badhni Kalan in Moga about 11am on Sunday.With AICC general secretary Harish Rawat meeting Sidhu in Amritsar on Thursday, it was believed that the cricketer-turned-politician will be seen at Rahul’s political programme. “All-India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries KC Venugopalan, Randeep Surjewala, newly-appointed Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda will attend the tractor rally. The CM and state party president Sunil Jakhar will be there. There is no official word on Sidhu reaching Moga tomorrow,” said Randhawa. It will be the first political event since March 22, when lockdown was imposed for the first time after the covid-19 outbreak, to have official sanction for the gathering of a large number of people. Congress’ protest has political significance, as Punjab has been reeling under organised protests by all 31 farmers’ associations and unions of farm labourers against the BJP and its former ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), on the new farm laws.SAD, the traditional political foe of the Congress, has already registered its political presence by organising a statewide rally on October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suspense-over-sidhu-s-presence-at-rahul-s-tractor-march-today/story-xnnYTykzMc05cjebhgmFuO.html

The 10-day edition will focus on implementation and execution of all that was conceived and achieved in the previous two editions. The first edition of the B2V programme was held under former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) governor Satya Pal Malik in June 2019 and the second edition under former lieutenant governer (L-G) GC Murmu in November. A senior official, tasked with supervising the project, said, “B2V-3 aims to build on the foundations of B2V-1 and B2V-2. This will be an action edition with focus on implementation and execution.” Shortly, after the constitution of panchayats in the UT, a first-of-its-kind week-long interface programme was devised. “The programme focused on energising the panchayats, collecting feedback on delivery of government programmes, capturing specific economic potential and undertaking an assessment of the needs of the villages,” the official said, adding that as part of the programme, a gazetted officer spent two days and one night in each of the 4,129 panchayats of the erstwhile state. The programme won plaudits across the country, the PM called it a ‘festival of development, public participation and public awareness’, in his radio programme Mann Ki Baat. The exercise of sending a gazetted officer to a village for three days was repeated again in the second phase in November. This time the objective was to follow up on B2V1, focus on 100% implementation of individual beneficiary-oriented schemes, focus on schemes and activities that can be undertaken to double farmers’ income, assessment of implementation of all measures and schemes aimed at empowerment of panchayats and spread awareness about them, said the officer. The programme again found mentioned in the PM’s Independence Day speech. While the first B2V-focussed on interaction and information – getting to know the difficulties of the people and taking the administration to the grassroots, the second B2V focused on strengthening and institutionalising panchayats, handholding the newly elected PRIs and focussing on saturation and 100% coverage of beneficiary- oriented schemes. In both phases, visiting officers participated in gram sabhas and learnt about people’s grouses. “The third edition aims to address the problems, grievances and demands through concrete action,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-s-back-to-village-programme-3-to-focus-to-on-execution-of-first-two-editions/story-L2i1ljs03FMpESayHBML6M.html

He said chief minister Jai Ram Thakur claims that Himachal has a very special place in the PM’s heart but it turned out to be a lie. “Even the CM has failed to effectively put the demands of the state before the Prime Minister,” he added.Rathore also congratulated the people of Lahaul and Spiti for the inauguration of Atal tunnel. He said the Congress had contributed significantly in the construction of the tunnel, which should have been mentioned. He said the Congress leaders were kept away from the programme organised at Sissu in Lahaul. “Such discrimination was an injustice to the people. It was nothing short of a big festival but the government politicised it by making it a BJP programme,” Rathore said.He said the new agricultural law that the PM is making big claims about is not going to benefit farmers and horticulturists. “He should have also talked about the promises made to the people of the state but have not been fulfilled till date,” Rathore said.He said the construction of Rohtang Tunnel, which the PM is describing as the achievement of his government is completely beyond facts. “In 1972, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave her in-principle approval for the construction of the tunnel and in 2010 the UPA president Sonia Gandhi, while accepting the final draft of its construction, laid the foundation stone on June 28, 2010. It would have been better if the PM in his address would have remembered the contribution of former PM Indira Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi in its construction,” Rathore said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pm-politicised-inauguration-of-atal-tunnel-did-not-announce-financial-package-for-himachal-congress/story-VfkFh1wLKDX8accoLOaIfM.html
03-10-2020||Pune||Yogi government does not believe in law of land: Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar criticised the Uttar Pradesh government over the Hathras incident, saying, “the way Yogi government stopped Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from visiting the family of the victim shows that the UP government does not believe in the law of the land and fundamental rights”.The NCP president while speaking to reporters at Vasantdada sugar institute in Pune on Friday said that he heard a statement of a police officer from UP, in which he denied rape. “Not handing over the dead body of the girl who was gang-raped to the family and cremating it without the consent is something which has never happened in the country. I don’t believe there is a government functioning as per law in UP,” said Pawar.Pawar said Hathras incident shows how the UP government and the local police are of extreme and wrongful who are taking the law into their hands.“Maharashtra too has witnessed rape cases, but the state government handled it legally and took immediate legal steps. The Uttar Pradesh government has been mum over it. The entire country is condemning it,” he added. Pawar said that Rahul Gandhi, his aides and a member of parliament went there to meet the family, however, they were not allowed to meet and they were arrested in the middle of the road.“It shows that you do not believe in law of the land and fundamental rights and that is why the reactions that are coming in in the country on the issue is appropriate,” said Pawar.Reacting to grandnephew Parth Pawar’s announcement of approaching the court, the NCP chief said, whoever wants to go can approach the court. “Anyone can go to court. Even if ten people go to court, it will help the state. Ultimately our aim is to lift the stay,” said Pawar when asked about Parth’s announcement. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Parth, son of Ajit Pawar, said he was devastated to hear the death of the Maratha youth who committed suicide and he will file an intervention plea on Maratha reservation. Without mentioning grandnephew Parth Pawar’s name, NCP chief said even if others want to approach the court, they can go. Recently Parth Pawar tweeted and demanded the courts be moved for getting Maratha reservation. Pawar also spoke about the Babri Masjid ruling and said that despite having all proof and evidence, this decision had come where no one was held guilty. Commenting on the Babri demolition case verdict, Pawar said that when the Babri mosque was demolished, he was in the P V Narsimha Rao government.He said that though he was defence minister, he was informed that the then union home secretary Madhav Godbole had given his inputs to the centre that the then Kalyan Singh government will not keep its promise of not touching the Babri structure.“But then Prime Minister P V Narsimha Rao was of the opinion that the centre should trust the chief of the state. Unfortunately, Godbole’s opinion was not considered and what he was anticipating, that incident took place,” said Pawar.BOX Before visiting the Vasantdada Sugar Institute, Pawar also visited the Serum institute where he was given shot of BCG vaccine. “I went there to inquire about development on Covid vaccine. I have also taken shot of BCG, which increases immunity.” Pune based Serum institute is is currently undergoing phase III trials of the Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yogi-government-does-not-believe-in-law-of-land-pawar/story-hBjJzuKJirwolNsJh0E1gO.html

03-10-2020||Mumbai||31 killed in tiger attacks across Maharashtra in 2020, highest in a year since 2010||Tigers killed 31 people in Maharashtra in 2020, the highest in a year over the past decade, with a total of 153 humans being killed in the state by the wild cats since 2010. The state also witnessed most human deaths (57) in wild animal attacks, equalling the previous high of 2016, during the first nine months of this year. A total of 467 people have been killed by wild animals in Maharashtra between 2010 and 2020, revealed data from the state forest department.The incidents of humans losing life in tiger attacks have risen five times over the past decade, with 2010 witnessing 5 deaths, which gradually rose to 24 in 2017 and 2019, the previous high before this year (see box). Recent data tabled before the Lok Sabha by the Union environment ministry showed that Maharashtra also had the highest annual deaths due to human-tiger conflict in India since 2014.“The rise in tiger population, both inside and outside protected areas in Maharashtra, is the primary reason for the in human deaths,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra, adding that other factors could include forest fragmentation outside protected areas, rise in tiger numbers dispersing from one protected area to another, increased human activity in forest areas (agriculture, cattle grazing, firewood collection) or linear infrastructure or irrigation projects within the tiger landscape. Tiger population in Maharashtra has increased from 103 in 2006 to 168 in 2010, 190 in 2014 and 312 as per the latest assessment in 2018-19. “The problem is basically in Chandrapur, and a recent increase in incidents is being witnessed around Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal,” said Kishor Rithe, member, State Board of Wildlife (SBWL).Forest patches of Chandrapur district are home to 175 of the 312 tigers in the state, accounting for 56% of estimated tiger numbers, with 82 found in Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, 23 in Central Chanda, 31 across Chandrapur forest areas, including Pandharkawada, and 39 in Brahmapuri. The district reported just five deaths in 2016, which shot up to 11 in 2017, 17 in 2018, 24 in 2019 and this year so far 26 of the 31 deaths in Maharashtra have been reported from this district. To avoid human-tiger conflict in Chandrapur, the SBWL during its 15th meeting on August 7, recommended the formation of a committee to study and deliberate measures to reduce the population of tigers. “It was highlighted that there have been more than 150 deaths in Chandrapur between 2007 and 2020, and with over 50% of the state’s tiger population in one district, the situation is worrisome. We have submitted a proposal to the state for a committee formation. An announcement is expected soon,” said Kakodkar. Apart from Chandrapur, one death each was reported from Yavatmal, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Bhandara and Nagpur districts this year. The eastern Vidarbha landscape has a forest cover of 22,508 sqkm and the human population there is 1.45 crore.During the lockdown phase (March-May), Maharashtra witnessed 11 deaths, including those of Mahua flower and tendu leaf collectors entering forest buffer areas as well as core zones. So far, five tigers involved in conflict have been captured, including one each from Yavatmal and Gondia, and the remaining from Chandrapur. Operations are underway to capture another tiger (RT1) at Rajura in central Chanda division since February. The wild cat has killed six villagers and has been eluding traps. “Higher conflict is owing to higher number of animals in the landscape. Immediate solution is capturing tigers, as human life is precious. For the long term, a proper policy decision followed by management is needed,” said Bilal Habib, tiger scientist, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. “This rise in conflict was expected and the trend is expected to be similar, if not higher, in coming years with a sizeable number of tigers on one hand combined with more tribal settlements inching closer to forest areas or encroachments getting aligned along the periphery of protected zones,” said Nitin Desai, director (central India), Wildlife Protection Society of India. Other experts said infrastructure projects, rise in human and cattle population, and fragmented forests interspersed with roads were a major cause for concern for dispersing tigers. “There is a need for declaring more protected areas (conservation and community reserves) and involve more people through eco-tourism. Or else, the antagonism will continue and both tigers and people will suffer,” said Bivash Pandav, WII scientist, and director, Bombay Natural History Society.SP Yadav, member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority, said, “Maharashtra has not approached us for any assistance so far. Once we receive a proposal, we can provide all technical assistance, advice, and any other requirement to deal with this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/31-killed-in-tiger-attacks-across-maharashtra-in-2020-highest-in-a-year-since-2010/story-uodHikRC1froTJRwIS5WVI.html

The demand came after India Today quoted Dr Sudhir Gupta, the head of an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi) panel constituted to re-evaluate the actor’s post-mortem report, saying Rajput had died by suicide while ruling out murder. “After the official confirmation by AIIMS panel head Dr. Sudhir Gupta that #SushantSinghRajput committed suicide, it is proved that investigation by @MumbaiPolice was honest and forthright. It is also clear that it was conspiracy of [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi govt with help of their fake media allies to defame Maharashtra,” tweeted Congress spokesman Sachin Sawant.“Till yesterday the fake channels were peddling fake news of IPC [Indian Penal Code section] 302 [murder] in the case. BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leaders kept defaming Maharashtra. CBI & other agencies kept leaking fake information. In a night thousands of fake twitter, FB [Facebook] & YouTube acs were created by BJP IT cell.”“Now we demand govt of Maharashtra to form an SIT [Special Investigation Team] to nab the conspirators and their mastermind. Also to find the originators of SM [social media] racket by BJP IT team. And take appropriate action against these fake channels to save our democracy as their fake stories r harmful for our country,” said Sawant.Congress is a part of the Shiv Sena-led ruling alliance in Maharashtra.The Maharashtra police said Rajput died by suicide before CBI took over the case on August 5.Rajput was found dead in his apartment on June 14. His family has accused actor Rhea Chakraborty of abetting his suicide and misappropriating his funds. Chakraborty is currently in jail on drug-related charges pertaining to the case.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), another constituent of the state’s ruling alliance, said the CBI should now complete its investigation in a month and bring the truth before the people. “This proves that the entire campaign was politically motivated and BJP is exposed,” said NCP spokesman and minister Nawab Malik. “They [CBI] have already taken two months, how much more time do they need?”BJP leader Ram Kadam said the CBI investigation is still on and the aim was to ensure justice for Rajput and his family. “We have never questioned the efficiency of the Mumbai police. We wanted the state government to give free hand to the police to probe the matter.”Kadam alleged the state government wanted to protect the drug mafia and thus never investigated that aspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-congress-demands-probe-into-attempt-to-malign-maharashtra/story-pjy3I9YRpJ58x4txcKwJXM.html
03-10-2020||Lucknow||‘Hathras incident just an excuse, Opposition wants to trigger caste riots’: UP minister||Uttar Pradesh senior cabinet minister Ramapati Shastri on Saturday launched a counter-attack on the Opposition parties over the alleged gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras.“Opposition is behaving irresponsibly, wants to trigger caste riots,” alleged Shastri, who is minister for social welfare and SC/ST (Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe) welfare.In a televised statement, he said, “The Opposition has adopted a completely irresponsible stance and it does not want the truth to come out. The Dalit woman’s honour is not dear to the Opposition. The Opposition deliberately wants to get caste riots triggered”.“Behan Mayawati (BSP chief) is a former chief minister. She should have understood the seriousness of the matter. Medical, post-mortem examination and forensic reports gave ‘negative report’ (indicating there was no rape). Still she, by giving irresponsible statements on social media, has been insulting Dalit women. The chief minister has already constituted SIT (special investigation team) and action has begun on the preliminary report of SIT. This initiative of the government will bring out the truth,” he added.Also read: Hathras case LIVE - Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi stopped at Delhi Noida border“Why is the Opposition opposing narco-analysis and polygraph tests? Tweets, audio-tapes, old incidents of the Opposition point towards a caste riots conspiracy. Hathras is only an excuse,” he alleged.“The chief minister has already made a provision for a strict law pertaining to crime and atrocities on women which would fast track cases and bring swift justice. The CM already has made recommendations for the death penalty in the POCSO Act (Protection of children from sexual offences Act) cases. In cases of Dalits and women, the government is very alert. All such incidents are taken with full seriousness. In the Hathras case, the CM ordered Rs 25 lakh compensation, job to a family member (of the victim) and a house. Test reports have been made public as well,” Shastri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hathras-incident-just-an-excuse-opposition-wants-to-trigger-caste-riots-up-minister/story-NLWW7pMoLL1wqrieYJN0SN.html
03-10-2020||Pune||‘Gandhian engineering’ important tool to boost sustainable development growth post pandemic – Raghunath Mashelkar||In today’s crucial times, there has been a major setback to the world’s sustainable development growth. In the post-pandemic period for all these issues, the only solution is Gandhian Engineering, said eminent scientist Dr Raghunath Mashelkar in the first webinar organised by Pune Knowledge Cluster organised on Thursday.He was taking on the topic of ‘Sustainable inclusive growth through Gandhian engineering’ on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.“Mahatma Gandhi was a great innovator as he introduced non-violence and also the use of ‘Charkha’ (spinning wheel) to spin clothes. For him ’Charkha’ symbolised innovation which had economic, social and spiritual overtones,” he said.“The inspiration of Gandhian engineering comes from his two teachings, first– earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need, but not every man’s greed. And the second one is – I would say every invention of science should be made for the benefit of all. So if we put these principles together we have the principle of Gandhian engineering which is ‘getting more from less and for more.’ It is not just for more profit, but for more people,” he said.“When we speak of education, research and innovation, we can’t find a better place than Pune to have all of these with Pune Knowledge Cluster. And I hope that it turns out to be a great catalyst in fermenting new activities and bringing new opportunities,” he said.Pune city officially got the tag of ‘Pune Knowledge Cluster’ in the month of August this year through the office of Principal Scientific Adviser. The goal of Pune Knowledge Cluster is to connect organisations with high-level of expertise in diverse domains of science and technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, in and around Pune. The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) has been designated to facilitate the project, and the funding for the cluster from the Principal Scientific Advisor Office will be dealt with by the office of the director of IUCAA. The aim is to bring together academia, research and development institutions and the industry of Pune and its surrounding regions to address the challenging problems of the region through innovative means, using scientific knowledge and engaging highly skilled human resources. Furthermore, Pune Knowledge Cluster aims to foster capacity building and promote skills development and entrepreneurship among the students and professionals of the city. In the initial phase, it would focus on air, water, health and sustainable mobility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/gandhian-engineering-important-tool-to-boost-sustainable-development-growth-post-pandemic-raghunath-mashelkar/story-DWMB9r6ndxze35y4jXUBeM.html
03-10-2020||Lucknow||2 arrested in UP businessman death case; hunt on for top cop||Two accused named in Uttar Pradesh businessman Indrakant Tripathi’s mysterious death case were arrested on Friday while raids were being carried out for the arrest of Mahoba’s suspended superintendent of police (SP) Manilal Patidar and inspector Devendra Sharma—both co-accused in the case-- said inspector general of police (IG), Chitrakoot Dham, K Satyanarayan. The IG said that police teams carried out raids at several places in Gujarat and Rajasthan in search of the two officers. On Friday, police arrested local businessmen Purshottam Soni and Balram, named in the FIR by Tripathi’s brother Ravikant for their alleged involvement in the extortion racket purportedly being run by Patidar, the suspended Mahoba SP.The arrests came following the report of the special investigation team (SIT), which indicted the SP and some others for driving Tripathi allegedly to the brink, forcing the trader to take his own life. Also Read: UP businessman murder case: SIT focuses on big guns named for ‘extortion’Tripathi had alleged that he was under pressure from the SP to pay a monthly bribe of Rs 6 lakh. When he went public with the bribe demand, then he was allegedly threatened by Patidar to implicate him in a gambling case. Tripathi was found dead with a bullet wound in his neck on September 8, two days after he released a video addressed to the chief minister. In the video, he levelled allegations of corruption against the SP, a Gujarat cadre officer deputed in UP, and feared that he may get him killed.Also Read: ‘Politics, not for justice’: Smriti Irani attacks Rahul Gandhi over plans to visit HathrasThe SIT, in its finding, has prima facie ruled out murder and concluded that Tripathi might have died by suicide under serious pressure.

03-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Kshitij Ravi Prasad sent to judicial custody till October 6||Kshitij Ravi Prasad, a former executive producer of Dharma Productions, arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with its probe into the drug angle in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, was sent to judicial custody till October 6 by the magistrate court on Saturday.Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande said Prasad was sent to judicial custody for three days to club his case with that of the other accused whose custody ends on October 6.“While seeking his judicial custody, we mentioned that Prasad never cooperated with the agency and was arrogant in his behaviour,” Sarpande said.He added that while Prasad had moved an application claiming he wanted to retract statements recorded by the agency, he had also not signed any statement so far.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was a suicide, not murder, says AIIMS panel chiefPrasad was arrested on September 26 for allegedly receiving contraband from alleged pedlars who had supplied hashish to Showik and Rhea Chakraborty. In its application before the court seeking Prasad’s custody, the agency had stated that during the house search, the agency recovered ‘one roll joint believed to be remains of smoked ganja.’The agency has claimed that Prasad’s role was revealed during interrogation of Sanket Patel, one of the alleged drug peddlers. Patel claimed that he had delivered ganja (weed) to Prasad at his residence in Andheri on the instructions of Karamjeet Singh. Singh is an alleged drug distributor believed to have a local network which provides drugs to people in the film industry.“He (Patel) further stated that he delivered ganja around 12 times to Prasad from May 2020 to July 2020. Further, Prasad make payment of Rs 3,500 each after taking delivery of 50 grams of ganja,” read the application of NCB seeking Prasad’s custody on September 27. The agency further submitted that during interrogation, Prasad admitted to having taken ganja from arrested alleged drug peddler Ankush Arneja and Singh through Patel. “From the above, it is clear that Prasad purchased hashish/ganja from Arneja; further Arneja used to purchase drugs from [alleged drug peddler] Anuj Keshwani. Hence, Prasad is part of the conspiracy for drug procurement with Arneja and his co-accused. Prasad was connected with Keshwani, and Keshwani was linked with Kaizan Ibrahim, who was further linked with accused Dipesh Sawant and Sawant was linked with Showik, Rhea, [and] Rajput,” read the remand application. While disclosing the alleged chain of distribution of ganja, the agency in its application had stated: “Patel supplied ganja/weed to Arneja and the said contraband was purchased by him from accused Singh. On the instruction of accused Singh, accused Patel purchased charas/weed and further delivered it to Prasad. Samuel Miranda [Rajput’s former house manager] and Prasad had taken delivery of ganja from Singh and his associate.” Prasad’s lawyer, advocate Satish Maneshinde, had contended that his statement was recorded forcefully. The lawyer submitted that Prasad was in detention for almost 50 hours. He alleged that Prasad was called in to record his statement on September 25 and was made to spend the night at the NCB office. “The next morning, when his statement recording resumed, Kshitij was categorically informed by Sameer Wankhede [investigating officer] in the presence of several other officers, that since he was associated with Dharma Productions, they would let him off if he implicated either Karan Johar, Somel Mishra, Rakhi, Apoorva, Neeraj or Rahil, falsely alleging that they consumed drugs. Kshitij refused to comply with this threat despite the pressure mounted on him as he did not know any of these people personally and did not wish to falsely implicate anyone,” Maneshinde had contended. “At the end of nearly 50 hours of interrogation, humiliation and torment, Kshitij, is his desperation to speak to his lawyer or family, unwillingly and under threat, signed the statement,” he had further stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-singh-rajput-death-kshitij-ravi-prasad-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-october-6/story-rMkm8L7jsE6ZUo85DtHXVO.html

The repair work will be completed by 6 pm on Saturday only.The damaged pipeline led to flooding and caused traffic congestion near Palava city, Dombivli on the Shil Phata- Badlapur road on Friday evening. Some parts of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation also did not get water supply for a few hours on Saturday morning.The water pipeline is owned by Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and authorities started the repair work Saturday morning. “These pipelines are old and often break. Around 6-feet-wide pipeline was damaged on Friday night. We will need the whole day for repair work. Temporarily water supply from Katai Naka to Mira Bhayander, parts of Kalwa, Mumbra and from Airoli to Ghansoli in Navi Mumbai was shut. To perform repair work for a few hours we had to stop water supply to certain areas within Kalyan Dombivli Municipal corporation as well,” said a senior MIDC officer. On Friday evening, water flowed into some of the slums and hutments in the vicinity. Water flow on the Shilphata- Badlapur road also led to traffic jams at night. “Water was flowing along the road when the incident happened, it started flooding immediately. It was only after the supply was stopped that there was some relief. Those staying in the slums had to throw the water out throughout the night,” said Dombivli resident Kalpesh Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dombivli-water-pipeline-burst-hits-supply-in-thane-navi-mumbai/story-DAAoBkvS1zv5uRusdJpzFK.html
03-10-2020||Mumbai||To spread awareness about fire safety, Mumbai fire bridage to train corporators first||The Mumbai Fire Brigade will hold short training sessions with all 227 corporators of Greater Mumbai to create awareness about fire safety, the challenges faced in their respective localities, and how they can be tackled. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expects that through corporators, this information will reach party workers, community volunteers, and residents. This is part of BMC’s larger aim to ensure citizens are educated about fire safety.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the fire brigade and disaster management departments, said, “The Mumbai Fire Brigade is planning a series of interventions, from the point of view of saving maximum in number of lives if there is a fire. It has decided to tweak its inspection, compliance, data maintenance, and awareness creation policies. At the back end, this will involve meticulous maintenance of data, blue prints, permissions, and inspection related documents of buildings.This information will be available online. BMC will hold awareness sessions with elected public representatives to sensitise them about fire hazards in their localities, and design a plan for them to communicate this information to the voters periodically.” Also read: Fire breaks out at market near Chembur railway station in MumbaiBetween 2017 and 2020, 126 civilians died in fires across the city, and 849 were injured. As many as 109 fire personnel were also injured in these incidents. Kakani said there are simple things that need to be followed to ensure inhabitants of a building can safely vacate the building if there is a fire, such as keeping exit ways unobstructed, installing signages pointing at exits, displaying floor plans in a visible location and manner and regularly inspecting if fire safety systems of the building are working. “After BMC approves the blueprint and gives fire NOC to any establishments, owners should not make internal changes that will divert the original exit pathways,” Kakani added. He said lack of awareness only adds to the body count. During the Kamala Mills fire, for instance, a lot of people in the restaurant ran into the toilet and locked themselves in, believing smoke will not enter a locked toilet. “Such lack of awareness increases the chances of mortality in fire and needs to be addressed,” Kakani said. Sessions with elected public representatives will also comprise information about fire safety hazards typical to a locality. For example, the B ward area of Byculla, Bhendi Bazar, has old buildings, many of which do not have in-built fire fighting systems like sprinklers, and smoke detectors. It also has narrow roads and street parking, making it difficult for the fire brigade to access a building during a disaster; similarly, suburban wards have many high-rises that need to inspect their fire fighting systems periodically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/to-spread-awareness-about-fire-safety-mumbai-fire-bridage-to-train-corporators-first/story-vIHL158ekS1hdb1O3fdcsK.html
03-10-2020||Mumbai||HC sets free 3 men convicted of killing priest in 2012, cites 3 reasons||The Bombay high court on Thursday set free three persons convicted for killing a 90-year-old priest from Chembur, attempting to kill his 79-year-old wife and robbing the aged couple of valuables.As per the prosecution’s case, the trio-- Mohmmed Intekhab Mohammed Imtiyaz Shaikh (28), Ganesh or Gopal Kanojiya (28) and Mohammed Istiyak Abdul Salam Shah (31) -- had on April 12, 2012, visited the house of the victims—90-years-old priest KS Parshuraman and his wife Rajamma (79)-- at Chembur for the purpose of repairing their refrigerator.The next day they visited the flat in the afternoon under the guise of handing over a bill for the payment made by them. After Rajamma opened the door, one of them demanded water, and as she turned to fetch water for him, she was followed by one of them. He gagged her mouth in the kitchen with a piece of cloth and the 79-year-old woman fell unconscious.About two hours later when she regained consciousness, she found her husband motionless on the sofa. She then called her brother, who rushed to the flat and took her to a private hospital where she had to be admitted for two days.Her husband was strangulated and had died on the spot.The couple had lost some gold ornaments in the robbery - four golden bangles of 10 grams each and Rajamma’s mangalsutra, a pendant of about 28 grams.Ganesh was the first to be arrested by the Mumbai police crime branch in connection with the murder of the aged priest and the robbery at his residence. He was apprehended at Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh on September 22, 2012. The other two were from Darbhanga in Bihar.The prosecution produced 19 witnesses and on August 22, 2014, an additional sessions judge at Mumbai convicted them for robbery, murder and attempt to murder, and sentenced them to life imprisonment.All of them appealed before the HC questioning the trial court verdict.At HC, the division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NJ Jamadar found that the conviction was unsustainable in the eyes of law due to lack of clinching evidence against the trio.Also Read: Covid-19: In Maharashtra, MMR worst hit with over 434,000 cases recorded since June 3The bench noted that Rajamma had weak eyesight and she could not identify the accused in the test identification parade and in the court as well. “The complicity of the accused in the present case firstly fails for want of identification by P.W. 1 (Rajamma),” the bench said while reversing the trial court verdict.All the booty allegedly looted by the gang was lying in Mumbai -- in travel bags kept in the shanties that the trio shared with others in Baiganwadi area, but the three were arrested from UP and Bihar. “It is surprising that all the three accused had left the stolen articles in Mumbai and fled to their native villages,” said the bench, indirectly raising suspicion about the prosecution’s claims.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was a suicide, not murder: AIIMS panel chiefThe judges were also surprised by the claim made by two roommates of two of the accused that they had revealed that they were going to their native places, as they had committed the robbery and the murder.

People are not satisfied with the initial probe reports that have come. BSP demands a probe by the CBI or a probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court.”She also said, “At the same time, the party makes a fervent appeal to President of India (Ramnath Kovind), since he hails from UP and is a Dalit, to intervene in getting the victim’s family justice.”In a tweet in Hindi late on Friday, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav said, “Scared of public anger, the BJP may remove the district magistrate and the superintendent of police to hide its own acts. The Samajwadi Party demands FIR against these people so that they reveal the truth about what they did under pressure and at whose behest.” Akhilesh’s party on Friday observed a statewide ‘Maun Vrat (silent protest)’ over the incident and in many districts, the police lathicharged the protesters.On September 14, a Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men in Hathras. After being initially treated at Aligarh Medical College and Hospital, she was taken to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries on September 29. Hathras district police has come under criticism, first for an alleged delay in responding to the woman and her family’s complaint, cremating her body in the middle of the night without the family’s consent, and for throwing a cordon of police officers around the village that stopped the entry of all journalists, and now for allegedly seizing the phones of the victim’s family members.The suspensions were ordered on the basis of recommendations by a three-member Special Investigation Team which questioned the victim’s family members on Thursday. Government’s press note said that SP Vikrant Vir was suspended for alleged negligence and lax supervision of the case. He was replaced with Shamli SP Vineet Jaiswal. “Narco and polygraph tests should be conducted on the accused, complainant and police officials,” the note added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hathras-gangrape-mayawati-demands-cbi-probe-akhilesh-seeks-firs-against-dm-sp/story-Hcf9hTuXxVaoNU9bergWiN.html

03-10-2020||City||Hathras gangrape: Rahul, Priyanka to set off for woman’s home again to meet her family||Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra plan to leave for Hathras around noon on Saturday to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who was allegedly gang-raped and murdered. The Uttar Pradesh police prevented the two from meeting the family on Thursday. Congress leaders KC Venugopal, Rajesh Lilothia, Sushmita Dev, Ajay Lallu, PL Punia, and Deepender Hooda are likely to accompany the Gandhis.“Congress MPs [members of Parliament] under the leadership of former Congress President Shri. @RahulGandhi will go to #Hathras today [Saturday] afternoon to meet the grieving family of the 19 year old daughter of Uttar Pradesh, who was brutally assaulted & murdered,” Venugopal tweeted.Also read: Here is what is happening in Hathras and beyond“@INCIndia [Congress] delegation led by Shri. @RahulGandhi will meet the family members to hear their grievances & demand justice for the victim & her family who have been denied justice & severely traumatized by the BJP Government in UP.”The Uttar Pradesh police have cordoned off the woman’s village to prevent journalists and opposition leaders from meeting the family. The authorities have also allegedly seized phones of the family and put them under surveillance.The woman was attacked and gang-raped on September 14, and rushed to a hospital in Aligarh. Eight days later, on September 22, she recorded her statement, where she said she was raped and named the four accused. Her mother’s statement echoed the claims. As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29, sparking nationwide protests.Later that evening, police drove the family and the victim’s body back to the Hathras village but proceeded to cremate the body without the consent of the parents. At 2.30am on September 30, the policemen cremated her body even as the family alleged they were restricted from even getting a final glimpse of their daughter.A day after the controversial cremation, prohibitive orders were clamped and the village was made off-limits for journalists and “outsiders”.Since then, protests against the crime have swept the nation and prompted several opposition leaders to try and visit the village – but have all been thwarted by the state police. Citing forensic reports, the police have denied that the woman was raped but experts have pointed to lapses in procedure during the medical examination.Priyanka Gandhi joined hundreds of people in New Delhi on Friday to express solidarity with the woman’s family. “We are all here to ensure that the girl gets justice. We will pressure the government to get her justice,” she said.“Her family has got no help from the state government. They must feel they are all alone. We are holding the prayer meeting for them. They should know that they are not alone and fight the injustice being done to them. We will put political pressure and every woman in this country must put moral pressure on the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hathras-gangrape-rahul-priyanka-to-set-off-for-woman-s-home-again-to-meet-her-family/story-NblV1YxMD3l1PUQ5Bfp0UO.html
03-10-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder okay with Sidhu back as power minister, not Punjab Congress chief||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has said that he does not have any problem with his bête noire Navjot Singh Sidhu joining back his cabinet at the power minister, a portfolio the Amritsar East MLA had spurned after the chief minister divested him of the local bodies ministry after the Lok Sabha elections last year. Capt Amarinder Singh was responding to the party high command’s fresh overtures to mollify a sulking Sidhu, during an interview to Hindustan Times at his sprawling farm house, Mohinder Bagh, in the Shivalik foothills near Chandigarh on Friday. Amarinder Singh sounded not amenable to offer any other portfolio to Sidhu. “I can’t change my ministers. They are all doing a good job.” On the speculation on Sidhu’s appointment as Punjab Congress chief in place of incumbent Sunil Jakhar in the run-up to the assembly elections in the state in early 2022, he said: “Why should somebody who joined the Congress three years ago become the president in place of Jakhar who has spent his life in the party?” He was alluding to Sidhu who switched from the BJP to the Congress ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly elections. Amarinder’s comments on Sidhu assume significance in the backdrop of the dinner meeting on Thursday between the party’s Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat and Sidhu at the latter’s residence in Amritsar ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rallies in Punjab from October 4 to 6. The party is keen that Punjab Congress put up a united face during Rahul’s visit. The cricketer-turned-politician enjoys a good equation with the Gandhi family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-okay-with-sidhu-back-as-power-minister-not-punjab-congress-chief/story-bEHWNr4cARIJp2HGPr7AbL.html
03-10-2020||Bhopal||MP proposes steep hike in water charges, fine for spitting, urinating in public||The Madhya Pradesh government has proposed a steep hike in user charges for water supply, sewerage and solid waste management services in the urban areas to recover the cost incurred in providing these facilities as its revenue generation continues on the downward trend, according to a state government notification. The government has also proposed a hefty increase in the spot fines for various violations such as spitting or urinating in public places in urban areas depending on the population of the habitat. For instance, Rs 1000 spot fine may be imposed on a person who dumps solid waste, urinates, spits, defecates in open in cities with a population of one million and more. The fine will be less in cities with less than one million population. Similarly, heavy fines will be imposed on dumping of construction materials, non-segregation of solid wastes, interfering in or damaging the water supply system, disposing animal excreta in public etc, the notification said. Certain officials from the urban administration and housing department say if the notification is implemented in letter and spirit, the water charges in urban areas may see an increase up to 400% to 600% over the existing charges, which vary in every city.For instance, the user charges for water supply in Bhopal, Indore, Sagar and Jabalpur are Rs 180, Rs 200, Rs 150 and Rs 175 per month. Similarly, the charges for solid waste management, which is usually one third of the water supply charges, will also see a steep hike. The actual water charges to be notified are yet to be decided. The process is underway, said an official from the urban administration and development department. In Madhya Pradesh, more than 20 million people reside in urban areas, as per census 2011. There are as many as 378 urban bodies including 16 municipal corporations. Also Read: No doctor or even peon’: MP minister finds hospital staff missing, posts video on social mediaThe notification dated August 28, 2020 issued by urban administration department states, “Based on the actual expenditure on the items mentioned in rule 4 audited by local fund auditor or chartered accountant, the calculation of user charges for water supply services shall be done in such a manner that annual expenditure incurred on water supply services can be recovered cent per cent…Annual expenditure incurred on solid waste management system can be recovered cent percent. Sewerage charges shall be minimum 60% of user charges for water supply services.” As per an official, hardly 25% of the expenditure on the water charges is recovered from consumers due to two reasons- public not willing to pay and a shortage of manpower with the urban bodies and also a lack of professionalism in the urban bodies. For instance, Bhopal municipal corporation (BMC) incurs an expenditure of about Rs 300 crore annually on supply of water, including Rs 125 crore on electricity charges, Rs 40 crore on chemicals, Rs 30 crore on salaries and interest on loans etc, whereas, the realisation of water charges is about Rs 50 to Rs 60 crore annually.

The rates will be notified based on the decision of the committee.” Retired executive engineer, BMC, RB Rai said, “The corporation needs to augment its revenue if it has to upgrade its facilities to provide quality water to people in the city.” State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “When people are facing a financial crisis due to loss of jobs, salary cuts or business losses due to anti-people policies of the central and state governments and their inefficiency in controlling Covid situation, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is looking for ‘Aapada me awsar’ (opportunity in disaster). The notification was issued secretly, that too, at a time when people are fighting against Corona. But Congress would not allow such malpractices by the government.” Minister for urban administration and development, Bhupendra Singh, couldn’t be reached for his comments. However, the state BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “The BJP government is sensitive towards the needs of people. I don’t think the state government will allow such a steep hike in the water charges. The party will bring the notification to the notice of the government if there is any proposed hike in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-proposes-steep-hike-in-water-charges-fine-for-spitting-urinating-in-public/story-i0oMsw3l3dIPh94lKYN8CL.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi AQI moves closer to ‘poor’ as stubble burning begins in Haryana, Punjab||With changes in weather conditions and stubble burning picking up in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab, the national Capital’s air quality has started inching closer to the ‘poor’ category. Government agencies have warned that over the next two days, air quality may touch the ‘poor’ zone.At 6 am on Saturday, the air quality index (AQI), as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), was 172 in the ‘moderate’ zone. On Friday, the overall average AQI was recorded as 180, close to the ‘poor’ mark (at 201).Last month, AQI was in ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ categories. October too has so far seen ‘moderate’ days though with AQI values mostly remaining in the higher end of the category.On a scale of 0-500, with a value of 0-50, air quality is considered ‘good’ (minimal health risk), 51 -100 is ‘satisfactory’ (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is ‘moderate’ (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease), 200-300 ‘poor’ (breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure), 300-400 is ‘very poor’ (respiratory illness on prolonged exposure) and 400-500 is ‘severe’ (affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases).Also read: Delhi-NCR residents prep for bad AQI days ahead with air purifiers, indoor plantsAccording to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, Delhi’s air quality could deteriorate and reach the higher end of the ‘moderate’ zone as the day progresses. “Further deterioration to the lower end of the ‘poor’ category is likely by October 4. An increase in stubble burning fires observed recently in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions is likely to start impacting Delhi in the coming days,” the SAFAR bulletin said.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said a slight decrease in night temperature has already started while wind speed is set to reduce from October 15, which may lead to further deterioration of the air quality.On Friday, the maximum temperature was 36.4 degree Celsius, three notches above normal while the minimum settled at 20.6 degrees C, two notches below normal.“A slight decrease in both day and night temperatures is likely from October 5. A drop in temperature and reduction of wind speed is not favourable for dispersion of air pollutants,” said an IMD scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aqi-moves-closer-to-poor-as-stubble-burning-begins-in-haryana-punjab/story-bK3GGwYlkyNih7JopF8ubK.html

03-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the plant lady||She looks like Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway, deciding she would do the shopping herself. Maybe she’s walking home after a productive excursion in the market. Each arm is weighed down with a bag. But it appears that this sari-clad woman has shopped for plants instead of dresses or books.Wrong. All wrong. Geeta isn’t a shopper, she’s a hawker of plants.“I have been selling phool-paudhe (flowers and plants) for a long time,” she says, stopping by this central Delhi street, on this pleasantly cool morning.Both her arms are occupied, and she’s also holding a little tub containing bottled saplings.“It’s heavy,” she murmurs, shrugging her shoulders. One of the bags around her arms contains mats and seed packets, she informs, and the other has ropes. Sort of strange stuff for a bazaar seller. Geeta explains that she doesn’t walk around the by-lanes like itinerant hawkers, but “I have a stall and I’m going to set it up now.” The mats are spread out on the pavement. The rope is to set up the stall, she says.Apparently, she also uses some of the ropes to hang a few plants in bottles, so as to catch the attention of potential customers.In her 50s, Geeta lives near Safdarjung Hospital, with her son and his family. “My son sells plants too, but in a different part of the city. These are not our plants though, but those of a thekedaar (contractor)… We only get the commission from the sales.”Responding to a query, Geeta admits that her life entails much hard work and not enough material comforts, “but at least I am able to earn, and so is my son, and that makes me satisfied.”Now a child appears and asks Geeta to identify a sapling.“It’s called money plant,” she says.“Isn’t it the one that grows quickly?” he asks.“Yes, beta (son).”“I already have them in my terrace,” he declares, and walks away with the smug satisfaction of the wealthy. Geeta quietly goes to the street-side, and watches out for potential customers among the morning’s passersby. Nobody seems interested. She walks on to set up her stall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-plant-lady/story-RdK2eeJUhwVqxhgwTBdUwI.html
03-10-2020||City||In Punjab, govt employees to face action if farm fires spotted on their rented out land||In an attempt to curb stubble burning amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Punjab government has ordered legal action against its employees if farm fires are spotted on the land they have rented out to someone else for cultivation. The move comes after it was found that in the previous years many government employees had leased out their land in their native villages but failed to sensitise the cultivators not to burn the crop residue. “In every far fire incident, the name of the landowner is being mentioned specifically in the report this time. Action will be taken against the farmer in case of violation as per the law. But if the land belongs to a government employee, it will be mentioned in their annual confidential report (ACR) besides lodging an FIR against them,” said Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) executive engineer Kuldeep Singh. The government is taking initiatives amid the pandemic as stubble burning is harmful to health and inhaling bad air can aggravate the complications among people, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities. “Nodal officers have been appointed in each village and different government departments were roped in the drive to prevent stubble burning. The nodal officer is responsible for ensuring that stubble is not burnt in that village. But if someone burns stubble, the nodal officer will compile a report and send it to the patwari who will forward it to the cluster officer for imposing a fine,” Singh said. The deputy superintendent of police (DSP) concerned will take legal action on basis of the report. District agriculture officer (Jalandhar) Naresh Gulati said awareness camps are being organised in the villages to sensitise farmers to not burn stubble and motivate them to use machines to dispose the crop residue in the fields.Meanwhile, the PPCB has detected eight stubble burning cases in Jalandhar and 12 in Kapurthala so far. In the last year, Jalandhar district had recorded 1550 and in Kapurthala over 1200 cases of stubble burning in the last session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-employees-to-face-action-if-farm-fires-spotted-on-their-rented-out-land/story-3s6rsQxP6ObIEqDbdGtFVO.html

To work out the modalities of the protests in Delhi, a meeting of the party’s core committee is expected to hold a meeting soon. “The SAD has decided to take its protests to Delhi. The schedule will be decided shortly. But we also want all the farmer bodies to come on a common platform with the Akali Dal to put a joint fight for their rights,” said former minister Bikram Singh Majithia. The senior leadership, including former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, ex-Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, sitting and former MPs and MLAs, former ministers, besides the district jathedars, and sitting and former members of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandak Committee (SGPC) will take part in the Delhi protests. The SAD leaders will sit on a dharna outside Parliament to draw the attention of various political parties and farm bodies cross the country, it is learnt. Chain hunger fasts likely“Chain hunger fasts are likely besides the jathas courting arrests every day,” said a senior leader not willing to be named. On Thursday night, police detained Sukhbir, Harsimrat and other senior party leaders when they were trying to enter Chandigarh leading protest marches from Takhts of Sikhism. They were on their way to submit a memorandum, addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind, to Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore demanding the repeal of the farm laws. The party’s farmer wing president Sikandar Singh Maluka said since the paddy harvesting season has started, farmers can’t make themselves available for the protests in Delhi. “So we have decided to make a plan in such a way that only our senior leadership is involved in these protests,” he said.“Also, wheat sowing will begin immediately after the paddy harvesting. The farmers can’t be troubled for at least a month,” he added.To get in touch with regional parties The Akali Dal has also decided to get in touch with other regional parties across the country to turn the ongoing stir into a national agitation. “The leaders of different regional parties have congratulated us for moving out of the NDA and initiating protests for the farmers’ cause,” said Maluka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/to-mount-pressure-on-centre-akali-dal-plans-to-take-protests-against-farm-laws-to-delhi/story-VBVjYxWddfGqIlfA2zA8DK.html

A recommendation to that effect was also made by a special panel of the university on Thursday.Earlier, the decision to scrap the entrance exams was taken on August 11, but was challenged by two law aspirants, who argued that the premise to not hold the entrance was invalid when PU was conducting such exams for other courses. Class-12 marks as a sole criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate for admission to the course would neither be reasonable nor reliable, they had argued.The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) had asked PU to reconsider its decision by September 15. However, PU again decided against holding the exam, which has resulted in the second round of litigation.PU on Tuesday had sought three days from the high court to reconsider the decision again and upload its decision on the website.No entrance tests this yearAccording to a compliance report uploaded on the varsity’s website on Saturday, the controller of examination said the special committee set up by the vice-chancellor had recommended that entrance examination for BA LLB/ BCom LLB (honors) five-year integrated course and LLB (three-year) will not be conducted for this academic session. The same stands approved by the Panjab University.PU has already scrapped the entrance tests for all undergraduate, postgraduate, MPhil, PhD, honours graduate courses, management entrance test.‘Exam not feasible’“In view of the prevalent situation, it is not feasible to conduct the entrance examination for admissions to five-year and three-year law courses in the best interest of students and public at large,” stated the proceedings of the panel.The panel also observed that as per UGC directions, if admissions are not completed by the end of October 2020, the university will be left with no option except to declare 2020-21 as zero academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-entrance-test-for-three-year-five-year-law-courses-at-pu-this-year/story-SmTdhIBkS6z9q6OkwYuKJM.html

The planning of the sectors was on the lines of a mini village, trying to recreate the mohalla, which was the essence of rural life in India, she said, adding that Chandigarh was neither a show of power nor a mere symbol of Western planning, but a product of the Indian ethos.Online interfaith prayer meeting held by PUChandigarh: The Department of Gandhian Studies of Panjab University (PU) in collaboration with the Bodhicitta Centre organised an interfaith and inter-religious online prayer meeting to mark Gandhi Jayanti on Friday.A second online special lecture event was organised in collaboration with the Panjab University Alumni Association on ‘Sustainable lifestyle in a pandemic world: A Gandhian approach’.PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar said, “At a time when the nation is preparing to respond to the direct health impacts of a pandemic, those of us who work on reducing violence and preventing conflict are also feeling the heat. The pandemic is already producing knock-on effects for safety at the individual level, the community level, as well as on international levels.”Professor Nawal Kishore Ambasht said he was fortunate enough to see Gandhi in person while he was on a peace mission in Noakhali. He asked the teachers to reintroduce Gandhian philosophy as a concept for values, life and thought, attitude of mind, living together and especially of peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/planning-of-chandigarh-resonates-with-mahatma-gandhi-s-philosophy/story-WuCTpYd50BaffCNVjKdkBJ.html

The accused damaged a large number of vehicles parked on the roadside with sticks and stones, and in the rampage, ransacked Kunal’s cousin’s house and his employee Rohit Bihari’s house, Kunal alleged.Kunal further alleged that the accused even stole jewellery from his house and attempts were also made to kill his pet dog. A case of rioting was registered and police detained four people involved in the attack.Sec-35 advocate booked under Disaster Management ActMeanwhile, an advocate of Sector 35, whose house lies in a containment zone, was booked under the Disaster Management Act by moving out. Naresh Dilawari was booked on the complaint of one Leeon Chand, the nodal officer and in-charge of the containment zone. The allegations were that Dilawari went out despite being advised not to do so. He was rude with the duty officer who even offered to bring whatever he needed from outside.Sonepat loses purse to snatchersA Sonepat resident lost his purse to three unidentified persons who came on a motorcycle, the police said on Friday. Amit Kumar, who works as a driver, told the police the bike-borne men snatched his purse containing ₹3,000 in Mauli Jagran on Thursday.

03-10-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers stir in Haryana fading out, Cong banks on Rahul’s visit||Though the state’s farmers have demonstrated their angst against the laws, the intensity of the agitation is nowhere close to that of the neighbouring Punjab, say analysts The ongoing farmers’ agitation against the enactment of three farm laws by the Central government seems to be petering out in Haryana. Though in the past few days, farmers’ groups have demonstrated their angst – shown black flags and gheraoed ruling BJP and JJP leaders, including members of Parliament – the intensity levels of the agitation are nowhere close to that of the neighbouring Punjab, analysts say. The Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), who have drawn out a schedule of protests across the state against the farm laws, have also not been able to mobilise the farmers in big numbers. However, leaders of the grand old party are banking on the upcoming visit of former Congress president, Rahul Gandhi to give an impetus to the stir. “Rahul Gandhi’s support to the farmers of Haryana will boost the agitation. One can clearly see how and why the BJP-JJP government in the state is rattled by the announcement of his visit,” said a senior Congress leader. Political observers say that the ongoing paddy harvesting and procurement could also be a reason why the agitation in Haryana is not intense. Another factor is the influence of commission agents. “The agitation is primarily concentrated in the paddy growing districts like Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal and Kaithal but not much is happening in central and southern Haryana districts like Rohtak, Jhajjar, Rewari. The reason for this is the influence of commission agents who have supported the agitation in paddy growing districts along the national highway. The commission agents or arhtiyas have a strong presence in paddy growing districts in northern parts of the state and not so much in central and southern Haryana,” said an expert who did not wish to be named. Political scientist at Panjab University, Chandigarh, Prof Ashutosh Kumar said there was a basic difference in the way the agitation has gone about in Haryana and Punjab. “Both the Shiromani Akali Dal and the ruling Congress are vehemently supporting the stir in Punjab. Also, Haryana’s economy is somewhat different from Punjab and is not entirely dependent on farming. Proximity to national capital has helped Haryana’s economy. Farm sector reforms are hard as they involved rich farmers and has a direct visible impact over Punjab economy,” Prof Kumar said. All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) president, Yashpal Malik, who has announced Samiti’s firm support to Haryana farmers, said that Congress and the INLD have done their bit to mobilise farmers but the ideological divisions between the two has adversely affected the cohesion between the farmers groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-stir-in-haryana-fading-out-cong-banks-on-rahul-s-visit/story-YFdrlOkIkQ4tdIYdpF8HrL.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s record of 150 deaths due to fires in 2019 is city’s highest toll in five years||Fatalities in blazes -- be it in residential buildings, commercial structures or in vehicles -- in the national capital were higher in 2019 than in any of the last five years, according to data by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).A total of 150 persons died in fire-related incidents last year, up from 145 in 2018, showed NCRB data. The previous three years had reported relatively much fewer deaths at 64, 88 and 114, respectively.Also Read: Three fire incidents in Delhi, two factories guttedThe death toll rose last year majorly due to two big fires – a factory fire in north Delhi’s Anaj Mandi that left 43 dead on December 8, and a blaze in central Delhi’s Hotel Arpit Palace that killed 17 on February 12.The two massive blazes aside, 2019 had the highest number of fire incidents in Delhi in the last 10 years. “In 2019, we attended 943 fire calls of which 100 turned fatal. It is the highest number of calls we attended in the last decade. The previous highest was in 2012 when we attended 776 fire calls,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services.Also Read: Delhi: Fire breaks out in manufacturing unit in Inderlok, no casualty reportedAlso, in 2019, as many as 16 persons died in fires in cars or other vehicles. Among the incidents that hit headlines was the one on March 10, when a woman and her two minor children were charred when the car they were driving caught fire in east Delhi’s Anand Vihar.The previous highest for vehicle fires in the last five years was in 2015 when 13 commuters died.“We have noticed that most of these blazes occur as vehicles are either not maintained well, or they get poor quality CNG cylinders fitted in their vehicles,” Garg said.The number of deaths in residential buildings (95) and in commercial buildings (22) were also the highest in the last five years. The previous highest deaths in residential buildings were in 2018 when 64 people were killed. For deaths in commercial structures, 2016 was the second worst year when seven persons had died.Also Read: Delhi fire: An explainer on why govt agencies are blaming each otherThe Anaj Mandi and the Hotel Arpit Palace blazes were behind the year 2019 topping in the two indexes. “The Anaj Mandi fire was in an illegal factory operating out of a residential building,” said Garg. As it turned out, both blazes were caused by short-circuit. “Our probe found short-circuit triggered the Anaj Mandi fire,” said a senior officer of Delhi Police’s crime branch, which probed the fire. Garg too said the hotel fire was due to short-circuit in one air-conditioning system.Unsurprisingly then, the number of deaths due to short-circuits (83) was not only the highest in the last five years, it was also the single biggest cause for fire-related fatalities in 2019.Also Read: Need strong punishment for lapses to improve fire safetyAn electricity board official blamed the short-circuits on “overloading” by consumers, “faulty internal wiring”, and “absence of protective equipment” in old buildings.While fire-related deaths in commercial buildings were mostly on account of the infamous hotel blaze, several other incidents led to 95 deaths in residential buildings.Among such incidents last year was a fire in a four-storey residential building in Jamia Nagar that left six persons dead on August 6. Garg said this particular blaze, and other similar ones, pointed to the dangerous trend of installing electricity meters in close proximity to parking lots on the ground floor or the basement.“If a fire breaks out in such meters, vehicles in the parking lot are quickly gutted and the stairs leading down to the parking lot are blocked by either flames or smoke, leading to deaths,” Garg said.The fire department has written to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission to have such meters shifted from parking lots, he said. In September, one of the discoms sent an advisory to its customers, asking telling them to ensure electric metres are not installed in parking or enclosed spaces.While 2019 topped on many indexes, it was a year that saw fewer deaths (eight) in blazes in legal factories, which Garg said are usually equipped with fire-fighting equipment and safety exits. In 2018, 14 people died in factory fires. The number was 13 in the year before that.This year has been easier for Delhi when it comes to fire incidents. Until August 31, there were a total of 226 fire calls of which eight were fatal. The number of people killed in those eight incidents wasn’t immediately provided. “The lockdown and closure of commercial buildings and factories during that period could lead to far fewer deaths this year, compared to past years,” Garg said.SK Dheri, former DFS chief, said as long as building bylaws are bypassed and fire safety norms neglected, deaths will keep happening. “The Anaj Mandi deaths were due to illegal use of a residential building, the Hotel Arpit Palace deaths were because of disregard for safety rules. The situation will not improve unless exemplary punishments are handed out and large fines imposed by enforcement agencies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-record-of-150-deaths-due-to-fires-in-2019-is-city-s-highest-toll-in-five-years/story-wsPwK1IpV6Ss1p9Fs5gesN.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Districts ask for more volunteers at city’s hotspots||With the number of containment zones across the national capital consistently rising, the district administrations have written to the revenue department, asking for more civil defence volunteers to be allotted to them, a senior Delhi government official said on Friday.On October 1, Delhi recorded 2,615 containment zones up from 846 a month ago. In the same period, active Covid-19 cases in Delhi increased from 15,870 to 26,738, as per the Delhi government’s daily health bulletins.Civil defence volunteers help district officials check violation of containment norms in the sealed zones and ensure the doorstep delivery of essentials to the residents there. Also Read: Weekday cases in Capital fall below 3,000 after September 5“All resources of the districts have been engaged in Covid-19 management. At this point, having more helping hands would really help,” said a revenue department official, who asked not to be named.Delhi is sanctioned around 238,000 civil defence volunteers, the official said. However, he said, the city has only 46,000 enrolled volunteers, of whom around 22,000 are on active duty across departments.Currently, the revenue department has the highest number of civil defence volunteers with it — around 8,500. Of the total, at least 7,000 are engaged only on Covid-19 management. The transport department has around 7,000 civil defence volunteers with it as of now, said the official.Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “Civil defence volunteers play a major role in management of containment zones across the city. In the coming days, we are looking forward to recruit more of them and engaging them in the fight against Covid-19.”Civil defence volunteers are not bound by any contract, and are paid an emolument of around Rs 730 for a day’s duty. Their enrolment is a round-the-year process, but they receive calls from the departments when their services are needed. The volunteers also help traffic police in managing traffic or ensure social distancing on the roads.The most active volunteers in terms of service are often prioritised. In the last one year, the government engaged over 5,000 civil defence volunteers in the rescue and rehabilitation of victims of the communal violence in north-east Delhi and implementation of the odd-even road space rationing scheme to reduce pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/districts-ask-for-more-volunteers-at-delhi-hot-spots/story-7kGh7hElZwGWbQVXI5MUcK.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi police’s Operation Eagle Eye reveals how auto lifters supplied snatchers with vehicles||The Delhi Police on Friday busted one of the largest syndicates of vehicle thieves and snatchers in the national capital and arrested 14 men, who regularly rented out stolen two-wheelers to snatchers in Delhi. Police said they have recovered at least 116 stolen two-wheelers from these men. The arrested also include the alleged kingpin who is believed to be involved in 89 cases of vehicle thefts. Police said snatchers preferred using stolen vehicles as these couldn’t be traced to themAlso Read: Rise in snatching cases alarming, no leniency for perpetrators: High courtPolice said the racket was busted during a special operation code-named Eagle Eye, which was executed by joint teams from Raj Park and Mangolpuri police stations in outer Delhi. Deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan said police had noticed that in recent cases of snatching, the vehicles used by suspects were mostly stolen. “Using stolen motorcycles is one way for snatchers to evade the police as they are registered in the owner’s name. An in-depth probe revealed a nexus between auto lifters, middlemen and snatchers. The auto lifters would provide stolen bikes to middlemen who would rent them out to snatchers for Rs 2,000 a day or a share in the snatched item(s),” Koan said. The DCP said the racket was active for the past two or three years at least and some snatchers were directly in touch with auto lifters in order to avoid paying the middlemen. “In case a snatcher could not afford to pay upfront the Rs 2,000, he was still given the bike, but on condition that half the snatched valuables will be handed over to the auto lifters at the end of the day. If they stole cash, then around 30%-40% of the loot was given to the auto lifters in lieu of bike rent,” Koan said.Also, the rent price varied, depending upon the make and type of motorcycle that the snatcher wanted to use. He said from questioning arrested snatchers, police got to know that they would always leave these motorbikes near public parks or in isolated parking lots to avoid being tracked. Koan said, “All 14 men accepted that they operated a racket of auto lifters and snatchers. They said the stolen motorcycles were being provided to snatchers on rent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/auto-lifters-rent-out-bikes-to-snatchers-to-evade-cops-racket-busted-14-arrested/story-VVkXl85ysjD4BlzdvFZH8O.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||NDMC flags off Lutyens Delhi bicycle tours||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) Friday flagged off a bicycle tour, as part of its ‘Cycle4Change’ pilot project to promote cycling in the capital city. The tour was launched from Bikaner House (near India Gate) and hundreds of participants rode on a 6km dedicated corridor up to Lodhi Gardens, said NDMC officials. The guided tour will be on for nine days — from October 2 to 10 — and is open to all, but participants who must bring their own bicycles. These can also be rented from one of the public bike-sharing stations in the NDMC area. NDMC chairperson Dharmendra said, “At the time when physical and sports activities have been drastically curtailed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, NDMC has initiated a move toward normalcy and road safety by organising cycle rides in the New Delhi area. To elevate the safety, convenience and experience of cyclists, we have dedicated this pilot corridor of 6km to a unique cycling experience, around a recreational space surrounded by wall paintings.” Based on the success of this pilot project, many more corridors in the NDMC area may be dedicated to cyclists in the winter months, he added.“The cycle tour is organised in two slots -- three hours in the morning (6am to 9am) and two hours in the evening (5pm to 7pm). Cyclists would start from Bikaner House and go via Humayun Road, Amrita Shergil Marg, Jor Bagh Metro station, Lodhi Garden Gate No.6, Lodhi Garden Gate No.11, Avenue Road-2, and Lodhi Colony Block-17 before arriving at the Lodhi Colony Cycle Plaza,” a statement from the NDMC said. A senior NDMC official said on Friday, around 1,000 cyclists took part in the morning tours, which stretched till noon on account of Friday being Gandhi Jayanti, a public holiday. The event, however, could not be held in the evening because of a protest demonstration at India Gate, the official said. At least four public bike sharing stations fall on this route, including one near Bikaner House and Lodhi Garden. E-scooters or motorcycles are not allowed in the tour, NDMC said. “We have tied up with traffic police to keep the corridor free of congestion during the tour slots. Also, we have deployed our marshals to ensure safety of women and children,” the NDMC official said. He added that the nine-day period will be assessed to see if this corridor could permanently be made into a dedicated corridor for cyclists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ndmc-flags-off-nine-day-bicycle-tours-through-lutyens-delhi/story-rkiZ9rGboQCDDvDQOfkyBL.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Experts to examine mental health of Delhi riots accused||A team of doctors, as part of a medical board, have started assessing the mental health of a man who is suspected of having schizophrenia and has been arrested by Delhi Police for being involved in three murders during the February Delhi riots. The man was arrested from Karawal Nagar, north-east Delhi, during the course of investigations, police said . Also Read: How the Delhi riots probe polarised society | AnalysisA Delhi court, on September 22, had passed an order for a medical board to be constituted after the jail superintendent informed that the suspect has been an outpatient department patient at IHBAS since 2011 and was being treated for “paranoid schizophrenia.”The court will now hear the case on October 6, when the medical board would submit its opinion on the accused.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav had directed the superintendent of jail number- 13, Mandoli, to put together a medical board — under the supervision of director of the Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences (IHBAS) — and to communicate to the court about the actual mental condition of the man after thoroughly examining him as per existing protocol.Also Read: Politicians who addressed anti-CAA protests mentioned in Delhi riots charge sheetThe court said that the board shall also communicate to it “whether it is safe to release the suspect on bail in the above matters, which are cases of murder and rioting.”“In case, it is not advisable to release him on bail, then whether he has to be kept in jail or elsewhere; the board shall also communicate as to whether the applicant is capable of taking his defence in the above-noted matters,” the court said in its September 22 order.The man, through his counsel, had sought bail stating that he was a “person of unsound mind.” Along with the bail plea, the counsel had also submitted the man’s medical records on August 28.“Yes, we have received the order and assessment would be done and a report be submitted at an appropriate time,” said Nimesh Desai, director, IHBAS.The suspect has been charged for the murder of Veer Bhan,48, Alok Kumar Tiwari,32, and Dinesh Kumar 35, all of which took place in Karawal Nagar during the riots between February 23 and 27 this year.In his report, the jail superintendent informed the court that the applicant has been registered as OPD since August 13, 2011. The report said he has been diagnosed to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, for which treatment is required.While passing the order, the court said that it was incumbent and in the interest of justice to have a proper diagnosis of the applicant, as to whether he is a person of “unsound mind” or not and if he is one, then whether he is capable of defending himself in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/medical-board-constituted-to-examine-mental-health-of-man-arrested-in-delhi-riots-case/story-DEiAH3aHeHAYmfjnLiSgWN.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||‘List pollutants that flow into Shahdara drain’: Yamuna Monitoring Committee tells UP govt||The Yamuna Monitoring Committee has directed the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) to submit a report on untreated or partially treated sewage and industrial effluents being discharged into east Delhi’s Shahdara drain — a stinking outlet that meets the river and adds to its pollution load. The committee in a review meeting with the state government on October 1 pointed out that two outlets from neighbouring Ghaziabad in UP — the Sahibabad and Indirapuri drains, which meet the Shahdara drain — carry a huge quantity of chemicals that cannot be treated by conventional methods. It said the agencies concerned must be directed to prevent industrial effluents from entering the drains and mixing with sewage. Besides these two, the Loni drain also discharges sewage into the Shahdara drain. Loni and Sahibabad are industrial townships in Ghaziabad bordering east Delhi, where the Shahdara drain flows and ultimately meets the Yamuna.The committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), for revival of the Yamuna, comprises former state chief secretary Shailaja Chandra and former NGT expert member BS Sajwan. “The COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) levels in the two drains way exceed the permissible limits. COD varies from 1,400 to 1,600 ppm (parts per million) while the permissible standard is 250 mg/l whereas BOD levels are in excess of 740 mg/l, as against the permissible limits of 30 mg/l,” stated the minutes of the review meeting. COD refers to the total amount of organic and inorganic chemicals in waste water. BOD is the amount of oxygen used by microorganisms in the oxidation of organic matter. “Since the gradual opening of industries, discharge from untreated industrial effluents in drains has again started, which has been contributing to pollution in the Shahdara drain, the most polluted among the 22 in Delhi that meet the Yamuna. It is causing massive pollution in the river. In many cases, the drains do not have sewage treatment plants (STPs) while in other places the plants are underutilised. A major chunk of pollution in the Shahdara drain comes from UP, which needs to be curbed,” said a member of the YMC. The committee has asked the UP government to provide the current status of the functioning of STPs in Indirapuri, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Noida, their capacity utilisation and whether they are meeting treatment standards. It wanted timelines for new STPs and other short and long-term measures to be taken for reducing pollution. A report submitted by the Central Pollution Control Board to the NGT in December 2019 said Sahibabad and Loni townships in Ghaziabad generate 575 MLD (million litres per day) of discharge for which there are only seven STPs with a total treatment capacity of 427 MLD in Ghaziabad. According to UPPCB officials, work is under way to improve the condition of STPs and set up new plants. “Work on a conveyance channel that will be able to carry and tap more sewage in the Sahibabad drain is already under way and will be completed by November. It was delayed because of restrictions in place due to Covid-19,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB (Ghaziabad). Manoj Misra, convenor, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said major part of the industrial pollutants in the Shahdara drain is from UP. “There are a number of industries in Ghaziabad which discharge their effluents directly or partially treated into the drains in absence of adequate treatment plants. The Shahdara drain meets the Yamuna downstream of Okhla barrage, half of which falls in Delhi, while the another half in UP,” Misra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/submit-report-on-pollutants-flowing-into-shahdara-drain-yamuna-panel-to-up/story-tFMkqeNTNXYIl0UJQurksN.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi topped list of fake notes seizure last year, says NCRB data||Delhi witnessed the country’s highest number of seizures of fake Indian currency notes in 2019 , statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) show.In terms of value of seized fake notes in rupees, the national capital figured fifth on the list, which Karnataka topped. Also Read: Economic crimes on rise in Maharashtra, Mumbai tops metropolitan citiesThe analysis of the NCRB’s data shows that circulation of fake notes of Rs 2000, Rs 500 and Rs 200 (new currency notes launched after the demonetisation exercise in 2016) increased in Delhi last year in comparison to 2018. As per the NCRB data, police seized 8,979 fake notes in the denomination of Rs 2000 (valued more than Rs 1.79 crore) in Delhi in 2019, which was 2,522 notes (nearly Rs 50.44 lakh) more than the seizure of the same currency fake notes in 2018. Police had seized 6,457 counterfeit notes of Rs 2000 valued a little over Rs 1.29 crore in 2018. Like Rs 2000 notes, there was a sharp rise in the seizure of counterfeit notes of Rs 500 as well in 2019. According to the NCRB statistics, the police had seized only 368 fake notes of the new Rs 500 notes in 2018, but this number rose to 4,583 in 2019. Similarly, there were only 57 counterfeit notes of Rs 200 that were seized in 2018,. But in 2019, the figure increased to 2,644, making police officials believe that printing, smuggling and circulation of counterfeit notes had increased in Delhi. Also Read: India records 1.6% rise in crimes in 2018-19: NCRB data“The increase in seizure of fake Indian currency of Rs 2000, Rs 500 and Rs 200 denominations is an indication that printing of fake notes was picking up pace after a lull of almost two years post demonetisation in November 2016,” said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav. “Many of the fake notes we seized contained security features that were similar to the genuine notes, making it difficult for anyone to differentiate between them. Most such notes is pumped into the country through Bangladesh and Nepal. Delhi Police and other law enforcement agencies continue to bust gangs and their networks involved in circulation of such notes,” said DCP Yadav. According to the NCRB’s data, Delhi had the highest number of the seizure of fake notes (60,384) valued around Rs 3.01 crore last year. With 44,580 such notes being seized, Gujarat held the second position in the list. In terms of value of seized currency, Karnataka topped the chart having seized Rs 4.78 crore worth in fake notes. Apart from the seizure of counterfeit notes, the Delhi police in 2019 had also recovered 4,553 notes of Rs 1,000, which was banned after demonetisation. Former IPS officer Ashok Chand, who has served in the Delhi Police force, said, “There are two types of fake currency notes – one just a duplication of the genuine note without having any security features and the other that contains many security features and looks genuine. If the seizure of fake notes of the second category is increasing, then it is alarming.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/highest-seizure-of-fake-currency-notes-happened-in-delhi-ncrb-data/story-BtvE5sykDK6uLFdhds6w6O.html
03-10-2020||Delhi||Weekday cases in Capital fall below 3,000 after Sept 5||The number of new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases reported in the Capital in a day dipped below 3,000 for the first time since the first week of September, barring weekends — when fewer tests are conducted. Friday’s health bulletin added 2,920 new cases of the viral infection in the city. To be sure, there has been a declining trend in new cases since September 26. So far, over 280,000 people in the city have been infected with Covid-19, and 5,438 have died. Of these, 37 deaths were reported on Friday. With more deaths due to the viral infection being reported for the past two weeks, the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) — the fraction of people who died among those diagnosed with the infection – increased to 1.37% from 0.76%. The cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of total number of cases and deaths reported from the city – is on the decline, however. It stood at 1.9% as on Friday, slightly higher than the national average of 1.6%. It was 2.5% in early September.“We do not know the reason there are fewer deaths in India. It could be because we are now giving several experimental therapies to our patients and have standardised the treatment protocol. It could be that we have a younger population that is less likely to die of the infection. Or it could be that the virus has mutated and is causing more infections but fewer deaths. Most patients we are getting right now are not very severe; they need oxygen support but not even non-invasive ventilation,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor in the department of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital. The number of hospitalisations has gone down across the city over the past few days, and fell to 6,071 as on Thursday, accounting for 22.9% of the active cases. The number of hospitalizations had gone up to just over 7,000 prompting the government to add more ICU beds in its hospitals and direct 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for Covid-19 treatment. The order has been challenged in the Delhi high court. As on Friday evening, 63.7% of the intensive care unit beds in the city’s hospitals were occupied, according to the Delhi Corona App.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-adds-2-920-fresh-covid-cases-on-friday-fatality-rate-drops/story-HcLHV86SOrCBBvbHCcFWqN.html

It means they are worth. These lines are from The Book of Kindness, written by Om Swami and they hold much value in an initiative started by Sanjay Dodrajka, a CA by profession. Under his program, Food with dignity, he has been providing meals at just Rs.10.Quoting Dalai Lama, Dadrojka says,“It is not enough to be compassionate. You must act”. He always wanted to do something tangible for the people who are in dire need of help. “As responsible citizens, we cannot leave everything to our government. We need to pitch in, directly. Every year, many people across the world fail at the very elementary task of staying alive. Not because they are sick or meet with an accident, but for the most damning reason of all – they starve for want of food. Hamari Udaan, a young NGO has taken up task of providing affordable food cooked in hygienic conditions for those who have no access to such meal.”Through small initiatives, Dodrajka has been involved in social service since his college days. However the idea to set up a full fledge NGO came to his mind after untimely death of a close school friend. “My friend died in an air crash in US and Hamari Udaan was born in 2014. The name being related to his passion for flying. The program has been running in Maya Enclave for almost twenty months now with a simple concept. Volunteers prepare the food in collaboration with ACT, another NGO from the area. This food is prepared every day in time to meet the lunchtime needs of passersby, often factory workers, autorickshaw drivers and labourers and other people from an economically stressed background. The food is hot, hygienic, fresh and tasty,” says Dodrajka.A minimal amount is charged for the food. “We charge a token amount of Rs. 10 per plate of food served. The reason for charging this small amount and not giving away the food for free is two-fold. Firstly, it ensures that the purchaser is accorded the full dignity of a paying customer. Refills are free and once a person has paid for a meal, he or she can eat to their content. Giving away the food for free would have reduced the beneficiaries to the status of beggars, something that we want to avoid. Secondly, the token amount ensures that there is no wastage. This is an equally important component and dovetails with the ideal of tackling hunger, one meal at a time,” says Dodrajka who runs this program in Maya Enclave nearby his work place to manage this project.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/meals-at-rs10-charity-wrapped-in-dignity/story-NIqcr952CtVeswxWslwZcO.html

Dr Shaw Dooley, a lead specialist on the team said, the president “is in exceptionally good spirits” and conveyed to them “I feel like I could walk out of here today”.Trump was shifted to Walter Reed on Friday “out of an abundance of caution”, the White House had said. And in a video message he tweeted after reaching the military medical facility, the president said, “I think I’m doing very well, but we’re going to make sure that things work out. The first lady is doing very well. So thank you very much I appreciate it I will never forget.”President Trump had waved to reporters as he walked to the helicopter waiting on White House grounds to fly him to Walter Reed, a short distance from DC. But he did not answer questions shouted out by reporters. He wore a mask, as did others with him, including his chief of staff Mark Meadows.Earlier in the afternoon Kayleigh McEnany, press secretary to the president, had said in a statement that “out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”The presidential suite at the medical facility in Bethesda in the adjoining state of Maryland, are large and roomy and include a conference room, a living room and a bedroom.Dr. Conley, the president’s physician, had said earlier in a statement Trump was “fatigued but in good spirits” and had been administered a single 8-gram dose of a cocktail of antibodies against the coronavirus, which is an experimental drug that has not been approved for use yet.The doctor that the president was also given zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin, and a daily aspirin.The first lady “remains well with only a mild cough and headache”, the physician said, adding, the rest of the first family had tested negative.But aides and staff who had been around president in the last some days either at an event at the White House or on the campaign trail continue to test positive. The included Kellyanne Conway, the former adviser to Trump, and Bill Stepien, head of the Trump re-election campaign.The Trump campaign, which has either cancelled all of the president’s rallies for now and taken all of these to be addressed by family members online only, kept up attacks on Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, signaling the urgency of the situations with election day just a month from now.“Do you regret repeatedly attacking President Trump in a Michigan speech on the same day he was diagnosed with COVID-19?” the Trump campaign posted as the “question of the day” for Biden on Saturday, pointing to the former vice-president’s remarks on the economy and jobs.But the campaign left out Biden’s concluding remarks: “I want to say God bless you, may God protect the first family and every family that is dealing with this virus, and may God protect our troops.” The Biden campaign has also pulled down its negative ads on Trump, but the former vice-president continues to campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-doing-very-well-says-medical-team-at-military-hospital/story-xf8UDDNWG7TanYvz7DWe3K.html

Additionally, several members of Trump’s staff in the White House have also tested positive for the viral contagion.As a precautionary treatment protocol, Trump was moved to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for the weekend, from where he is expected to carry out his duties from the hospital’s presidential suite.The White House physician said he was being treated with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after taking another experimental drug at the White House, AP reported.“President Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany earlier. “Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”Several new cases have emerged among some of Trump’s advisers and allies who attended the White House event where Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, was introduced. Among them are former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Senator Mike Lee and North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis. Though the ceremony was held outdoors, attendees sat closely together and few wore masks. Some also mingled at a smaller event inside the White House.Due to the viral infection, Trump has been forced to cancel all campaigning activities and rallies just a month before the US citizens will elect their next President. The next presidential debate with Joe Biden on October 15 also stands undecided in the light of Covid-19 safety protocol.As of Saturday, the United States remains the worst affected nation because of the viral contagion with more than 7.3 million cases of the infection and 2,08,782 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-positive-donald-trump-in-exceptionally-good-spirits-fever-free-breathing-fine-doctors/story-FLPzuNAX7c2i9ihGZUYIKM.html

Joint operations by the London police, Microsoft and Indian police forces have so far led to action against 37 call centres and 88 arrests.Alex Rothwell of the City of London Police said, “Our ongoing close working relationship with Microsoft and the Indian authorities has led to sustained action against this type of fraud, demonstrating that we can and will seek out criminals wherever they are.“At the time of the lockdown in India, we saw a sharp decline in reports of Computer Software Service Fraud in the UK, but we know that criminals adapt quickly to continue to try to defraud people.”Rothwell added, “As more people work from home, the need to prevent fraud of this nature has become more urgent. We welcome this enforcement action on the part of the Central Bureau of Investigation and will support their efforts to bring offenders to justice through the Indian courts.”The modus operandi of the companies included displaying pop-up messages on the victims’ computers, warning them about serious technical problems with their devices, including the presence of malware infection.Victims were then advised to call a helpline to gain assistance and were charged a premium fee for the “fix” and “on-going support”. Victims were made to pay this fee online or over the phone, meaning their financial details were shared with criminals.Some home addresses of people associated with the various companies were also visited, the police said, adding that the CBI is continuing with investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-pat-for-india-s-cbi-from-city-of-london-police-for-drive-against-cyber-fraud/story-JlJIf05B5FAnvFMgMtVy3L.html

About half of the new cases were found in the state of Sabah, which has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the country, followed by 102 in Kedah state. One more person died from the disease, bringing total fatalities to 137.Malaysia won’t return to a nationwide lockdown, defense minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said in a Saturday briefing. It was only in June that Malaysia allowed most activities to resume after imposing restrictions on people’s movement that pushed the economy to shrink 17.1% in the second quarter.Instead, the government will step up enforcement of its maritime borders in Sabah, located on the island of Borneo, and limit foreign delegates visiting the country, Ismail said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-s-coronavirus-cases-rise-by-record-for-second-straight-day/story-nwzuxdwVX13HQUvkRD1GLL.html
03-10-2020||World||Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham admits sending sexually suggestive texts||The Democratic challenger in North Carolina’s closely contested US Senate contest has admitted to exchanging sexually suggestive text messages with a woman who’s not his wife, but he said he will not drop out of the race.Cal Cunningham apologized late Friday for the text message exchanges in which he tells the woman he wants to kiss her and she says she wants to spend the night with him. The messages were first reported by the website NationalFile.com.“I have hurt my family, disappointed my friends, and am deeply sorry. The first step in repairing those relationships is taking complete responsibility, which I do,” Cunningham said in a statement.Cunningham’s admission regarding the text messages, along with his opponent US Senate Thom Tillis testing positive for Covid-19, could reshape a closely contested campaign that’s considered key to determining the power balance in the Senate.But Cunningham, who is married with two children, added that he’s not dropping out of the Senate race: “I will continue to work to earn the opportunity to fight for the people of our state.”Screengrabs of the messages show Cunningham told public relations strategist Arlene Guzman Todd, “Would make my day to roll over and kiss you about now,” to which she replies, “You’re so sweet. I would enjoy that.”Another shows Guzman Todd tell Cunningham, “the only thing I want on my to do list is you,” to which Cunningham replies, “Sounds so hot and so fun!”A spokeswoman for Cunningham’s campaign, Rachel Petri, confirmed the authenticity of the text messages.It’s unclear when the messages were sent, but at one point Cunningham says he’s “Nervous about the next 100 days,” which could be a reference to the Senate election. One hundred days before the election would be July 26.An email trying to reach Guzman Todd at the communications firm that lists her as an employee wasn’t immediately returned Saturday morning.Earlier Friday, Cunningham’s opponent, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, announced that he tested positive for Covid-19 but said he has no symptoms. Cunningham tweeted that he wished Tillis a “quick recovery” and said he would get tested himself after the two men shared a debate stage Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-candidate-cal-cunningham-admits-sending-sexually-suggestive-texts/story-FpCTb6967C1x2ntXmi02xN.html
03-10-2020||World||Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine could be rolled out within 6 months: Report||There is growing hope that a vaccine against coronavirus may be given the green light by health regulators by the end of this year to be rolled out for a vaccination programme in six months’ time or even less, according to a UK media report. The vaccine candidate under trial by University of Oxford scientists in collaboration with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is the furthest in the process of trials and, according to a report in ‘The Times’, it could be given the required clearances by Christmas in December. The newspaper quoted UK government sources involved in the making and distribution of vaccines as saying that a full vaccine roll-out programme for adults could take six months or less after approval.Also read: 1 vaccine may have reached initial efficacy test “We are looking at closer to six months and it is likely to be far shorter than that,” a government source said. Under a protocol developed by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, any approved vaccine will then be given to all over 65s, followed by younger adults at higher risk, which could include those from ethnic minorities as well as those with serious health issues based on their higher risk from the deadly virus. People over 50 will be next in line, with younger adults at the back of the queue. The UK government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine once it is ready for roll-out and the doses are being manufactured before it has been shown to be successful in order to save time once it clears all the regulatory stages. According to the newspaper report, scientists on the trial are hopeful that they will get results before the end of this year, and that they will at the very least show that it prevents 50 per cent of infections, the threshold for success. If it is approved by the regulators, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is said to be in a position to begin mass vaccination almost immediately.Also read: ‘A bridge to the Covid-19 vaccine’: Trump given Regeneron’s experimental drug There are others within the UK government, however, who are more cautious on the timelines as vaccinating every adult is a big challenge. A Royal Society report this week, co-authored by an Indian-origin scientist, warned of the massive uphill task ahead in producing and distributing a vaccine. “Even when the vaccine is available, it does not mean within a month everybody will be vaccinated. We’re talking about six to nine months to a year after a vaccine is approved,” said Professor Nilay Shah, head of chemical engineering at Imperial College London. The report called for the criteria for vaccine prioritisation to be “defined and made explicit” and then “public dialogue and engagement to manage expectations and understanding of vaccine effectiveness, safety, side effects, availability, and access”. The government’s Department of Health sought to downplay the findings and stressed that its planning process will ensure a speedy roll-out. “This study fails to reflect the enormous amount of planning and preparation that has taken place across government to quickly roll out a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine,” said a department spokesperson “We are confident we have adequate provision or transport, PPE [personal protective equipment] and logistical expertise to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine across the country as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-rolled-out-within-six-months-report/story-K25l6S7snlj7XtXaTFrWXL.html
03-10-2020||World||Covid-19 positive Donald Trump at military hospital; new cases among allies emerge||A feverish and fatigued President Donald Trump was spending the weekend at a military hospital for treatment of Covid-19, as new cases emerged among some of his top advisers and allies. Attention focused in particular on last Saturday’s White House event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, with several attendees announcing they had tested positive for the virus.Among them: former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Though the ceremony announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination was held outdoors, attendees sat closely together and few wore masks. Some also mingled at a smaller event inside the White House.The White House said Trump’s expected stay of “a few days” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was precautionary and he would continue to work from the hospital’s presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. The White House physician said he was being treated with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after taking another experimental drug at the White House.The decision for the president to leave the White House for the hospital capped a day of whipsaw events in Washington Friday. The president, who has spent months playing down the threat of the virus, was forced to cancel all campaign events a month before the election as he fought a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans and is hitting others in his orbit as well.Trump walked out of the White House on Friday evening wearing a mask and gave a thumbs-up to reporters but did not speak before boarding Marine One. Members of the aircrew, Secret Service agents and White House staff wore face coverings to protect themselves from the president onboard the helicopter.In a video taped before leaving for Walter Reed, Trump said, “I think I’m doing very well, but we’re going to make sure that things work out.” He remained fully president, all authority intact.“Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!” he wrote in his first tweet from the hospital Friday night.Trump first revealed that he had tested positive in a tweet about 1 a.m. Friday — hours after he returned from a Thursday afternoon political fundraiser. He had gone ahead to the event, saying nothing to the crowd though knowing he had been exposed to an aide with the disease that has infected millions in America and killed more than 1 million people worldwide.First lady Melania Trump also tested positive and has said she has mild symptoms. She is believed to be isolating at the White House.Also testing positive: Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien. Campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Stepien received a diagnosis Friday and is experiencing “mild flu-like symptoms.” Stepien, who joined Trump at Tuesday’s first presidential debate, plans to quarantine until he recovers.Trump’s diagnosis came during an already turbulent period in Washington and around the world, with the US gripped in a heated presidential election and the pandemic taking a heavy human and economic toll. Trump’s immediate campaign events were all canceled, and his next debate with Democrat Joe Biden, scheduled for Oct. 15, is now in question.Trump has been trying all year — and as recently as Wednesday — to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is past, and he has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable. He has mostly refused to abide by basic public health guidelines — including those issued by his own administration — such as wearing face coverings in public and practicing social distancing. Until he tested positive, he continued to hold campaign rallies that drew thousands of often maskless supporters.“I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,” he told reporters back in May. With the election coming up in a month, he is urging states and cities to “reopen” and reduce or eliminate shutdown rules despite continuing virus outbreaks.The White House tried to maintain an atmosphere of business-as-usual on Friday.“President Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. “Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”The president’s physician said in a memo that Trump received a dose of an experimental antibody combination by Regeneron that is in clinical trials. Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley said Trump “remains fatigued but in good spirits” and that a team of experts was evaluating both the president and first lady in regard to next steps.Late Friday, Conley issued an update that said Trump is “doing very well” and is “not requiring any supplemental oxygen.” But he said that, “in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate remdesivir therapy,” an antiviral medication.“He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably,” the doctor wrote.The first lady, who is 50, has a “mild cough and headache,” Conley reported, and the remainder of the first family, including the Trumps’ son Barron, who lives at the White House, tested negative.Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide.Both Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris have tested negative, their campaign said. Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus Friday morning and “remains in good health,” his spokesman said. Pence was to resume his campaign schedule after his test.Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and has been on a Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers, also tested negative, the White House said. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered.Many White House and senior administration officials were undergoing tests,, but the full scale of the outbreak around the president may not be known for some time as it can take days for an infection to be detectable by a test. Officials with the White House Medical Unit were tracing the president’s contacts.Trump’s handling of the pandemic has already been a flashpoint in his race against Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware, citing concern about the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at Tuesday night’s debate.“I don’t wear masks like him,” Trump said. “Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-positive-donald-trump-at-military-hospital-new-cases-among-allies-emerge/story-KQQshhrLMUZxT58JxcNfSK.html
03-10-2020||World||The day Covid-19 came to Donald Trump’s White House||Donald Trump’s calendar for October 1 showed a typical day for the president: time for tweeting in the morning, and a trip to his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course in the afternoon to raise money for his cash-strapped re-election campaign.But well out of public view, a crisis was building. A small number of officials at the White House, including Trump, learned that morning that one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Few people inside or outside the White House were told, and there was never serious thought given to canceling the Bedminster fundraiser, expected to raise $5 million -- where the more money donors gave, the closer they got to Trump, according to a person who attended.The White House says the fundraiser was deemed safe. But there were signs that not all was right.For one thing, some aides who had been in proximity to Hicks on Wednesday -- including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany -- were hastily pulled off the manifest for the president’s helicopter and replaced.Then Trump steered clear of reporters assembled for the helicopter takeoff, eschewing his normal back-and-forth and cutting an unusually wide path as he strode from the Oval Office. He also avoided journalists waiting under the wing of Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews and on the flight to New Jersey and back.Photo LineAt the event, Trump did the usual photo line customary for VIP donors -- those who had given between $50,000 and $250,000. Inside an expansive room, the president stood in front of a presidential flag and an American flag, with tape on the ground representing a “do not cross” line six feet from guests.One attendee recalled a couple of things: Trump made small talk, and he didn’t wear a mask. He also cut his visit short, the second time in as many days the president seemed to be hurrying through his events.After returning to the White House, the day took an even darker turn for Trump as he announced he had tested positive for the virus.Just 26 hours after departing the fundraiser, he landed in Marine One to be admitted to Walter Reed hospital. White House aides, familiar with Trump’s fear of germs and aversion to hospitals, say it’s a signal doctors are genuinely concerned about his condition.The impact on the president and the White House has been profound. His re-election campaign, already struggling to gain ground against Joe Biden, has scrapped plans for fundraisers and rallies -- Trump’s political lifeblood -- with little more than four weeks before Election Day.Inside the White House and his campaign, some despondent aides fear the election is lost and the president is sicker than is known. Several officials said they had been provided no more information about his condition than ordinary Americans, who have been left practically in the dark a day after his diagnosis.Trump was administered an experimental “antibody cocktail” by White House doctors, but not much more information has been released, including whether his blood-oxygen levels are falling or even if he has a fever.Little of it was imaginable Thursday morning. This account of the day Trump learned Hicks was infected is based on interviews with multiple administration and campaign officials, some of whom requested anonymity to describe behind-the-scenes details of one of the most significant days of the Trump presidency.In the DarkHicks’s illness came as a surprise to some of the small group of aides informed Thursday morning of her diagnosis, even after traveling with her the night prior. Hicks began feeling ill during Trump’s trip to Minnesota, and when Air Force One landed in Duluth, she holed up in the plane’s private office while other staffers attended a campaign rally.Some White House aides on the trip were more focused on the president, concerned about his lethargic behavior. His rally speech that evening was less than an hour; Trump has regularly spoken more than twice as long during other recent campaign stops.Upon returning to Washington, Hicks waited until all other staff members had exited Air Force One before making her way off the plane -- limiting possible exposure and protecting her privacy. On Thursday morning, only a few aides -- and the president -- were told that Hicks had, in fact, tested positive.The secrecy came in part from a desire on the part of White House aides to shield Hicks, who has attained a level of celebrity while working for Trump -- intended or not. She is regarded by many in Trump’s inner circle as both a close personal friend and victim of unfair media scrutiny. During her first stint in the White House, in 2017, she became tabloid fodder after her then-boyfriend -- former staff secretary Rob Porter -- was alleged to have physically abused his ex-wives.As one of the president’s most trusted and loyal aides, she is frequently at his side.Among the White House officials in the dark about Hicks’s condition was the press secretary, according to McEnany herself. She held a Thursday morning briefing with White House reporters even as a contact-tracing effort was quietly underway in the West Wing.‘Two Standards of Health’During the briefing, McEnany defended the Trump campaign for staging rallies where social distancing measures have been routinely ignored, arguing the media should set the similar expectations for large protests against racial injustice.“There really seems to be two standards of health in this country, one for Trump supporters and one for everyone else,” McEnany said.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said he learned of Hicks’s positive test just as Trump left aboard Marine One, bound for his fundraiser.“We actually pulled some of the people that had been traveling and in close contact,” Meadows said.But there was little discussion of scrapping the president’s Bedminster trip, where he was expected to raise $5 million for a campaign facing an unexpected shortfall of cash.‘Deemed Safe’“It was deemed safe for the president to go,” McEnany said Friday. “He socially distanced, it was an outdoor event.”CDC guidelines say that people who have been in close contact with infected people, as Trump was with Hicks, should stay home for 14 days and maintain social distance from others at all times. It’s unknown if Trump was tested before leaving for his fundraiser.At Bedminster, guests began arriving at about 12:30 p.m. About 60 people were at the VIP cocktail party-style event, none of them wearing masks, according to a person who attended. The crowd for Trump’s remarks later numbered about 150.Those who donated between $35,000 and $250,000 had to undergo a nasal swab test for coronavirus that returns a result within 15 minutes. Top donors would have access to a roundtable discussion and a photo with the president, according to a Republican official.VIP PerkAs soon as the president arrived, VIP ticket holders who had given between $50,000 and $250,000 were invited to take a photo.Donors entered the room and were instructed to stand 6 feet away from Trump at all times. The president made small talk, the person who attended said.All of the Republican Party staff and Trump Bedminster staff wore masks, the person said. At no point during the event did the president wear a mask.Comedian Joe Piscopo was among the donors who attended. He described the event as “very social-distanced” while disputing a New York Times report that the president appeared worn down.“He was at the top of his game,” Piscopo said. “He looked strong and sounded great.”End of NormalcyThe rally would be one of the last moments of normalcy for Trump before he confronted the virus that has stalked the final year of his presidency.Within minutes of the president’s return to the White House Thursday evening, aides began receiving inquiries from a Bloomberg News reporter about Hicks’s health -- the first time some had heard about her condition.Bloomberg first reported Hicks’s infection later that evening.Even late Thursday afternoon, few in the White House appeared aware of the potential exposure. Staffers -- including a White House press aide who subsequently tested positive for the virus -- were working at their desks, not wearing masks.The Hicks revelation renewed concern among aides worried that Trump had seemed off his game in recent days. The decision was made for the president to undergo a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, coronavirus test, regarded by White House doctors as more reliable than the rapid tests the president, top officials and reporters receive regularly at the White House.The PCR test is more invasive, however, and the president has previously complained about how deep the nasal swab goes -- remarking that there was “nothing pleasant about it.”Interview With HannityAs Trump awaited his results, he decided to continue with a previously scheduled phone interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Live on air, he announced that he and first lady Melania Trump were awaiting the results of coronavirus tests because of Hicks’s positive result.“I just went out with a test,” Trump said. “I’ll see what -- because we spend a lot of time. And the first lady just went out with a test also. So, whether we quarantine, or whether we have it, I don’t know.”Around midnight, the results came in: The president and first lady had contracted the virus. Trump and his communications staff scrambled to figure out how to reveal the news to the American people, settling on a presidential tweet and then the release of a memo from the White House physician confirming the diagnosis.“We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump wrote at 12:54 a.m. on Friday. “We will get through this TOGETHER!”It was last the American public would hear from their president for nearly 18 hours, when after arriving at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he posted a video on Twitter.“I think I’m doing well,” he said. “But we’re going to make sure that things work out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-day-covid-19-came-to-donald-trump-s-white-house/story-pPMBy639s3NqdYJpM8CgWK.html

03-10-2020||World||Nobel Prizes and Covid-19: Slow, basic science may pay off||While the world wants flashy quick fixes for everything, especially massive threats like the coronavirus and global warming, next week’s Nobel Prizes remind us that in science, slow and steady pays off.It may soon do so again.Science builds upon previous work, with thinkers “standing on the shoulders of giants,” as Isaac Newton put it, and it starts with basic research aimed at understanding a problem before fixing it. It’s that type of basic science that the Nobels usually reward, often years or decades after a discovery, because it can take that long to realize the implications.Slow and steady success in science has made researchers hopeful in the fight against the pandemic. It even offers a glimmer of climate optimism.Many years of advances in basic molecular science, some of them already Nobel Prize-winning, have given the world tools for fast virus identification and speeded up the development of testing. And now they tantalize us with the prospect of Covid-19 treatments and ultimately a vaccine, perhaps within a few months.“This could be science’s finest hour. This could be the time when we deliver, not just for the nation but the world, the miracle that will save us,” said geophysicist Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences.The coronavirus was sequenced in a matter of weeks, testing became available quickly, and vaccines that would normally take years may be developed in a year or less, and “it’s all been built on the back of basic science advances that have been developed in the past three decades,” McNutt said.She pointed to gene sequencing and polymerase chain reaction, which allows for multiple copying of precise DNA segments. That latter discovery won the 1993 Nobel in chemistry.And even further back, in 1984, the Nobel in medicine went to a team for theories on how to manipulate the immune system using something called monoclonal antibodies. Now those antibodies are one of the best hopes for a treatment for the coronavirus.“Despite the politics, despite whatever other things are slowing us down, Nobel Prize-winning discoveries from 20 years ago are going to be key to treating and preventing COVID next year,” said Sudip Parikh, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “That was made possible by basic research.’‘Basic research comes first. The benefits are typically reaped only later, in what is called applied science.“Without basic science, you won’t have cutting-edge applied science,” said Frances Arnold, a Caltech chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel in chemistry.Nobel-winning basic research has allowed us to see the world in a whole new light.Do you like white, efficient LED light to replace the nasty fluorescent hum of industrial lighting or energy-gobbling incandescent bulbs? A key part of those lights are blue light-emitting diodes, and their discovery won the 2014 Nobel in physics, said astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, head of the Hayden Planetarium.How about seeing better, without glasses, thanks to LASIK surgery? That stemmed from research into precise lasers that led to the 2018 Nobel for physics, but was also the product of an accident in which a researcher got lasered in the eye, said microbiologist Rita Colwell, former head of the U.S. National Science Foundation.And those lasers used concepts that date back to Albert Einstein, said British Royal Astronomer Martin Rees.John Mather, who won the 2006 physics Nobel for cosmology, which is the study of the origin of the universe and is thus the ultimate basic science, said nearly everything we use around us is there because of basic science.“Engineers and entrepreneurs use this knowledge to build commercial empires,” he said. “Doctors use what we find to develop new cures. Architects build houses with modern materials. Airplanes are designed at the very edge of what is possible. Even cars are completely dependent on basic science.’’But some people don’t make that connection. Adam Riess, who won the 2011 Nobel in physics, and Tyson said this is especially noticeable when people who deny climate science or vaccine effectiveness do so while reaching fellow nonbelievers on smartphones and Google searches made possible because of basic science research.“Maybe, maybe science needs a PR agent, OK?” Tyson said in an interview. “Maybe with a new discovery in science in a way that affects your life outcomes, the TV commercials say, ‘Did you know this? This thing that you’re using was invented here in this lab by this person. And it was brought to market by this company. And now you’re using it and enjoying it.’ Stop in silence. ‘You’re welcome.’”As for fixing climate change, Mexican chemist Mario Molina has hope that the world will be able to solve the problem because of the work that led to his 1995 Nobel Prize.He and others discovered that industrial chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons were reaching high into the atmosphere and eating away at Earth’s protective ozone layer. He discovered this many years before an ozone hole developed over Antarctica.His work and the opening of the hole led to a 1987 international agreement to ban those ozone-depleting chemicals, and the hole has started shrinking. Now Molina hopes that kind of action can be applied to what he calls “the climate emergency.”“That’s why I’m optimistic. Because we do have one example of a global problem where practically all the countries of the planet agreed to work together. The ozone layer is healing. It takes quite awhile,” Molina said. “But it’s working, slowly. So it can be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prizes-and-covid-19-slow-basic-science-may-pay-off/story-38yrupY0SsJNs9RaQnzgiK.html

The probe follows determinations in August by the US Treasury and Commerce departments that Vietnam had manipulated its currency in a specific trade case involving tires.“Unfair currency practices can harm U.S. workers and businesses that compete with Vietnamese products that may be artificially lower-priced because of currency undervaluation,” Lighthizer said in a statement. “We will carefully review the results of the investigation and determine what, if any, actions it may be appropriate to take.”Vietnam’s ministry of foreign affairs didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment.Vietnam’s central bank this week cut interest rates for the third time this year, seeking to bolster a gradual economic recovery.Trade War WinnerThe country’s export-reliant economy, a beneficiary of a shift by factories trying to steer clear of the US-China trade war, is one of the few in Asia that’s expected to expand this year as trade and manufacturing recover from lockdown disruptions.The dong traded at 23,181 per US dollar at the close yesterday, little changed from Thursday, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.Vietnam’s central bank has moved to a more market-based framework of setting the currency since 2016, adjusting the dong’s reference rate on a daily basis. It allows the dong to trade within a band of 3% on either side of the reference rate, which is based on eight currencies.Vietnam has never used monetary policy to give it an unfair competitive advantage, the nation’s State Bank Governor Le Minh Hung said during a Hanoi briefing this week. Hung spoke a day after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration plans to announce the investigation into Vietnam’s currency.Hung said Vietnam will continue pursuing monetary policies to create macro stability, sustainable growth and support measures to help with the nation’s economic recovery.Under the Trump administration, Vietnam has become one of the US’s 10 biggest trading partners and one with the biggest imbalances. The US’s goods-trade deficit with the Asian nation this year reached $34.8 billion by July, the biggest after the shortfalls with China, Mexico and Switzerland.Vietnam is already on the US Treasury’s list of nations with currencies being monitored for manipulation. The department, in its latest report from January, urged Vietnam to “reduce its intervention and allow for movements in the exchange rate that reflect economic fundamentals, including gradual appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.”In its statement, USTR said it will issue two Federal Register notices next week with details of the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-opens-trade-case-to-probe-vietnam-currency-undervaluation/story-dFZLJIOjcLWCaEKrxnD4eO.html

In a long-awaited address, Macron insisted “no concessions” would be made in a new drive to push religion out of education and the public sector in France.“Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world today, we are not just seeing this in our country,” he said.He announced that the government would present a bill in December to strengthen a 1905 law that officially separated church and state in France.The measures, Macron said, were aimed at addressing a problem of growing Islamic radicalisation in France and improving “our ability to live together”.“Secularism is the cement of a united France,” he insisted, but added that there was no sense in stigmatising all Muslim believers.The law permits people to belong to any faith of their choosing, Macron said, but outward displays of religious affiliation can under no circumstances be allowed in schools or the public service.He announced that France would seek to “liberate” Islam in France from foreign influences by improving oversight of the financing of mosques.There would also be closer scrutiny of schools and associations exclusively serving religious communities.France has in recent years been forced to take a hard look at its core republican values, perceived by many to be threatened by Islam in the wake of a string of terror attacks since 2015 targeting secular liberties such as freedom of expression.Macron was speaking one week after a man wounded two people in a meat cleaver attack outside the former Paris offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly which was condemned by the government as an act of “Islamist terrorism”.Staff at Charlie Hebdo were massacred in January 2015 by Islamist gunmen seeking to avenge its publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.In January, a renewed debate about freedom of expression erupted when a teenager received death threats for attacking Islam in an expletive-laden Instagram rant.And earlier this month, divisions were highlighted when MPs walked out when a university student entered parliament in a headscarf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-says-islam-in-crisis-unveils-anti-radicalism-plan/story-VNuuRQwF77xJA741iHHbiP.html

He was given the drug at the White House after its maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc received a compassionate-use request from officials.He is currently in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and is being monitored. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has described the experimental drug as a bridge to the Covid-19 vaccine.Here is everything you need to know about the experimental drug:* The experimental drug has been manufactured by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which has developed a successful Ebola treatment from an antibody combo in the past.* It is a combination of two artificially made antibodies, the immune system naturally makes to fight off infection.* It is a single-dose therapy and being tested in several clinical trials in both hospitalised Covid-19 patients and patients outside hospitals.* Monoclonal antibodies are considered one of the most promising potential treatments for Covid-19, and Regeneron is one of the front-runners in testing them.* Before this, Regeneron said the preliminary result showed that the drug may help treat coronavirus patients outside of the hospital by reducing virus levels and symptoms. * The trial was conducted of 275 Covid-19 patients and the partial results showed a reduction in virus levels present in the patient.* As the study is still underway, the preliminary findings have not been published officially or reviewed by the other scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-bridge-to-the-covid-19-vaccine-trump-given-regeneron-s-experimental-drug/story-7u3dASk8UurGl8YxB0EulN.html

03-10-2020||World||Trump gets experimental drug aimed at curbing severe illness||The experimental antibody drug given to President Donald Trump has been called one of the most promising approaches to preventing serious illness from a Covid-19 infection.Its maker, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., said the company agreed to supply a single dose, given through an IV, for Trump at the request of his physician under “compassionate use” provisions, when an experimental medicine is provided on a case-by-case emergency basis, while studies of it continue.The new drug is in late-stage testing and its safety and effectiveness are not yet known. No treatment has yet proved able to prevent serious illness after a coronavirus infection.Trump was given the experimental drug at the White House on Friday before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he’ll be monitored, officials said. So far, Trump has had only mild symptoms, including fatigue.Several physicians who treat Covid19, including Dr. David Boulware at the University of Minnesota, had speculated that doctors might use the antibody drug, given that this approach has worked against other diseases in the past.“They’re not going to just sit around and watch to see if he gets sick,” Boulware said.Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help the immune system eliminate it.Vaccines trick the body into thinking there’s an infection so it makes these antibodies.But it can take weeks for them to form after natural infection or a vaccine. The drugs aim to give that protection immediately, by supplying concentrated versions of one or two antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.Regeneron’s drug contains two antibodies to enhance chances that it will work. The company previously developed a successful Ebola treatment from an antibody combo.The drug is given as a one-time treatment through an IV. In multiple studies, Regeneron is testing it both for preventing infection and in people already infected, like Trump, to try to prevent serious illness or death.Earlier this week, Regeneron said partial results from about 275 Covid-19 patients who were not sick enough to need hospitalization suggested it might be cutting how long symptoms last and helping reduce the amount of virus patients harbour.However, the study has not been completed, the results were only announced in a company news release and have not been published or reviewed by other scientists.Trump’s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said Trump also was taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. None of those have been proven to be effective against Covid-19.Trump apparently is not receiving hydroxychloroquine, a drug he widely promoted that has been shown in many studies to be ineffective for preventing or treating Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-gets-experimental-drug-aimed-at-curbing-severe-illness/story-dR43VJcdVhgvNnZcfeqCJL.html

He is being evaluated by a team of experts, and together we will be making recommendations to the President and First Lady in regards to next best steps,” president’s physician Sean Conley said in a memo released by the White House.Earlier in the day, Dr Conley said as a precautionary measure the president received a single 8-gram dose of Regeneron’s polyclonal antibody cocktail.“He completed the infusion without the incident” said the White House doctor.In addition to the polyclonal antibodies, the President has been taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin, he said.Also Read: US President Trump to be treated for Covid-19 at Walter Reed Medical CenterDr Conley said in his memorandum that the First Lady Melania Trump remains well with “only a mild cough and headache”, and the remainder of the First family “are well and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 today”.“Thank you for the love you are sending our way. I have mild symptoms but overall feeling good. I am looking forward to a speedy recovery,” the First Lady said in a tweet Friday afternoon.In an interaction with reporters, White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows said the president and the first lady remain in good spirits.“The president does have mild symptoms and as we look to try to make sure that not only his health and safety and welfare is good we continue to look at that for all of the American people,” Meadows said.“He continues to be not only in good spirits but very energetic. We’ve talked a number of times this morning. I got the five or six things that he had tasked me to do like I do every single morning. And he is certainly wanting to make sure that we stay engaged, he said.The White House Chief of Staff said it is critically important the doctors continue to monitor both his health and the health of the first lady.“The great thing about this president is not only is he staying committed to working very hard on behalf of the American people, his first question to me this morning was is how’s the economy doing, how are the stimulus talks going on Capitol Hill,” he said.The Vice President Mike Pence was tested negative for Covid-19.“Earlier this morning under my care, Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for COVID-19,” said Dr Jesse Schonau, his doctor.“Under the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Vice President is not considered a close contact with any individuals who have tested positive for COVID, including President Donald J.

03-10-2020||World||Recreating history.....||The German reunification, in 1990, was one of the most significant conclusion to the end of a forty-year-long cold war between US and Soviet Union (USSR). The breaking down of the wall, dividing the city (now Capital of Germany) of Berlin, ushered in a new era, giving hope to many about the onset of a new world order which would based on the principles of equality, freedom and peace.  “And if ever, there was a song that symbolised this change, it was Winds of Change by the German rock band, Scorpions,” says the German Ambassador to India, Walter J Lindner, who has recreated the iconic “rock song with Indian elements”, to celebrate 30 years of this historic day, which is celebrated as the German Unity Day, every year.. “This songs was created for the unification. The whole situation at that time, for example, there was [Nelson] Mandela who was talking about liberation, and ending the apartheid. Here in Germany as well and the whole Cold War ending, symbolised freedom and gave everyone a hope that things will change for the better, and for the ‘children of tomorrow’ and for young people like me, there’s going to be freedom and more importantly peace in the world,” says Lindner adding that he was posted in Berlin, as he started out his career as a diplomat, and recalls what the song meant to him, and possibly to the rest of the world at that time. “I was at the beginning of my diplomatic career. I was still in Berlin, which was still divided, when it [the song] released. Winds of Change inspired a whole generation. If you see the original video, the tearing down of the wall, the movement of the Soviet soldiers, it was like a blast that went through the whole world. It gave every one a hope, and idea of freedom, at least for a decade, at least before the terrorist attack in US in 2001. Around the globe there were these winds of change blowing and the song symbolised it,” adds Lindner, who insists he still is a musician “first” and a “politician” later. “I always believe that, you can give hundreds of speeches, but the real connection you have with people is through sports and music. I started as an artiste, a musician. I became a diplomat and lawyer, later to earn money. At any time in my life, first I am a musician,” he says, adding, “Maybe it’s a good combination. It [Being a diplomat] takes away the necessity to live for music. I can dedicate my free time to music, and be my authentic self.” It, therefore, makes complete sense that a song with such iconic message was recreated, and being an Ambassador to India, the German national felt it was imperative, to borrow from the “vast musical heritage” of India. The iconic opening of the song, which opens with the band’s vocalist, Klaus Meine, whistling has been replaced by a flute, played by Rakesh ChaurasiaAlso, the iconic guitar solo, has been divided into four parts, with solos from instruments such as sarod (played by Pandit Vikash Maharaj), tabla (played by Prabhash Maharaj), sitar (played by Abhishek Maharaj) and a flute. “I didn’t want to make a replica. I had to play with Indian musicians. I already had that in my head that i wanted to create a German-Indian rock song. This song, this since its a rock song, was primarily on the electric guitar. We had to rule that out because it would have overshadowed the Indian instruments. So we got more musicians, and other Indian instruments, on the song,” says Lindner, who adds Klaus Meine, only decided to appear at the start of the video, after he heard the song. “He told me he had goosebumps. I met him in Berlin and that’s when he told me he would love to introduce the song. I think even in Germany, this song will generate good interest because it is a very different and a different sounding version,” he says. The song, as Lindner says, “is still relevant”, and hopes that it will promote the message that the original version has done so over the last 30 years. “Life without art is nothing, there’s no colour. This song contains dreams, and they can be anything. As long as you live, you hope that the world is a better place, for everyone who is born here and lives. That’s the real message and the entire concept, and I hope that this German-Indian rock song promotes that feeling,” he signs off.

03-10-2020||World||US Prez Trump, Melania test positive for Covid-19; could hit his presidential campaign||US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19 and will go into quarantine immediately, the president tweeted late Thursday.“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,” Trump said in the tweet, less than two hours after posting that his close aide Hope Hicks had tested positive.“We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”The tweet raised immediate concerns about the health of the president, who is more than 70 years of age and obese.Trump had earlier in the evening tweeted he and the first lady began “our quarantine process” after one of his closest advisers, Hope Hicks, who had travelled with him several times in the last few days, tested positive .“Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19,” President Trump tweeted. “Terrible! The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”Watch l ‘We will get through this together’: Trump & Melania test positive for Covid-19 Hicks had travelled with Trump and his team on Air Force One to Cleveland, Ohio for the first presidential debate. She also travelled with Trump to his rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday and was seen in close contact with senior members of the president’s campaign.According to rules made by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who were in close contact with Hicks should quarantine themselves. That would include the president, the first lady and senior members of the president’s re-election campaign.Bloomberg, which first reported Hicks testing positive, said she had felt ill in Minnesota and quarantined herself on the way back on the presidential aircraft.“The president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously,” White House spokesman Judd Deere has said in a statement. “White House Operations collaborates with the physician to the president and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible, both on complex and when the president is travelling.”Hicks is the fourth White House personnel to test positive for Coronavirus, after a personal military valet of the president, a member of the vice-president’s staff and the National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien. But Hicks has been the closest of them all to the president, who had gone on a 10-day course of Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug.More than 207,000 Americans have been killed by Covid-19 and millions have been infected. President Trump has refused a responsibility for them, and has been blamed for his botched response to the pandemic, despite his fervent claims to the contrary, citing travel shut-downs.More egregious has been his open scepticism of the use of face masks and social distancing norms. He rarely wears one himself despite professing his complete endorsement of masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-first-lady-melania-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-zsU5dh0MBdiyuMoKwTu3vI.html

He was issued a notice on Saturday; a senior officer who is part of the investigation said adding he was also asked to produce details of his properties. He was asked to appear before the ED office in Shanthinagar in Bengaluru. There are reports he will also be questioned by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Last month he was interrogated by the ED in Kochi for more than 11 hours and later the Central agency had frozen transactions of his properties. Trouble began for the second son of the state secretary after Bengaluru drug racket accused Anoop Mohammad gave a statement to the NCB in which he mentioned his name. After his arrest he said Kodiyeri had helped him a lot in his “business venture”. Later his name also figured prominently in the call list of Mohammad. There were also allegations that he allegedly helped Swapna Suresh, main accused in the gold smuggling case, to slip out of the state in July and helped her find a hideout in the city. Kodiyeri later admitted that he knew Mohammad and helped him to open a hotel in Bengaluru in 2015 but he was not aware of his alleged drug dealings. But, later the ED found that two shell companies floated by Kodiyeri, B Capital Solutions and B Capital Forex, were allegedly involved in many shoddy deals. Floated in 2015, both firms had failed to file tax returns and other formalities and the ED suspects these firms were floated for alleged money laundering and hawala transactions. Kodiyeri was not available for comment. During investigation into the 30 kg gold smuggling through the UAE consulate, the ED has also found that there is close link between the smuggling and psychedelic drug cases. The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment that came in the name of the United Arab Emirates consular office in Thiruvananthapuram. And the drug surfaced on August 28 after the arrest of Anoop Mohammad and two others in Bengaluru. Drug seizure involving Kannada actors is a different case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-kerala-cpi-m-state-secretary-s-son-to-bengaluru-on-alleged-drug-funding-charges/story-pZxZame9wxFqlihRQROOHK.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused rival parties of trying to politicise the incident with Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad accusing the Congress of indulging in theatrics. “It is an unfortunate incident. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath ji ordered a Special Investigation Team(SIT) inquiry into the case. Accused have been arrested. If it’s a rape case or not, that has also been told by UP Police,” Prasad was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Uma Bharti urged Adityanath to allow politicians and media to meet the family members of the victims. “Your image as the CM is very clean. I would request you to allow media personnel and politicians, including those from the Opposition to meet the family,” the BJP leader wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gangrape-will-make-an-example-of-offenders-says-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-WCagos4eIWqgYDfvlL9NlN.html
03-10-2020||India||Top Afghan peace negotiator Abdullah Abdullah expected to visit India on October 6||Afghanistan’s top peace negotiator Abdullah Abdullah is expected to visit India on October 6 as part of an outreach to key countries in the region for support for the negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, people familiar with developments said on Saturday. Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation in Afghanistan, will travel to India after a three-day visit to Pakistan that concluded on Wednesday. This is his first visit to India after the formation of a new government in Kabul following last year’s troubled election. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Abdullah is expected to meet the top Indian leadership to seek support for the intra-Afghan negotiations currently underway at Doha in Qatar. India had sent an official delegation to Doha to attend the event marking the launch of negotiations and the event was also addressed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar. In his speech, Jaishankar said that any new dispensation which emerges from the intra-Afghan dialogue process must ensure that the soil of Afghanistan is never used for anti-India activities. Senior Afghan leader Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum had visited India on September 25 and held talks on the peace process with Jaishankar, who told him New Delhi remains committed to Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled negotiations. During his interaction with the Pakistani media in Islamabad, Abdullah said both Pakistan and Afghanistan are on “the same page” on the issues of reducing violence and showing flexibility in the negotiations underway in Doha. These views should be emphasised in “messages communicated to Taliban”, he said. India, the region’s largest provider of development aid to Afghanistan, has expressed concern at a recent spike in violence by the Taliban and terror attacks on minorities such as Sikhs. It has said that the intra-Afghan negotiations must ensure the interests of minorities, women and vulnerable sections of society and reduce violence across Afghanistan and its neighbourhood. Since 2001, India has undertaken projects worth $3 billion in Afghanistan, including $1 billion pledged in 2016 under the “new development partnership” scheme for five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-afghan-peace-negotiator-abdullah-abdullah-expected-to-visit-india-on-october-6/story-9dAu2F24Amrn9ygUV3kuOI.html

The alleged forcible cremation of the victim’s body in the dead of night has added to the national outrage over the alleged gang-rape and brutalisation that led to the woman’s death.Further alleging that they “couldn’t even see her face before the cremation”, the family said they wanted justice and not money. The state government has already announced Rs 25 lakh ex gratia, a job for a family member and a house for the family of the victim.“We requested not to conduct the cremation at night, but no heed was paid. In fact, we do not know if it was our daughter’s body,” they said.Also read: UP CM Yogi Adityanath recommends CBI probe in Hathras gang-rape case“The village and our house were heavily guarded by the police.

She also denied having asked for a CBI inquiry into the case.

The study, titled ‘Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in two Indian states’, was published in the September 30 edition of ‘Science’ magazine. Quoting the findings, an official in the Andhra Pradesh government said a team of investigators from the CDDEP, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu governments and University of California at Berkeley studied disease transmission patterns in 575,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in these two states. Also read: Covid fear, disparity - Why these countries objected to Indian flights“The study, based on data collected by tens of thousands of contact tracers in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, is the largest and most comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 epidemiology till date,” the official claimed. According to the study, prospective follow-up testing of exposed contacts had revealed that 70 percent of infected individuals did not infect any of their contacts, while 8 percent of infected individuals accounted for 60 percent of observed new infections. The study found a high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age. “Risk of transmission from an index case to a close contact ranges from 2.6 percent in the community to 9.0 percent in the household. Same-age contacts are associated with the greatest infection risk,” it said. However, mortality is higher in the age group of 40-69 years in these two states. It is 0.05 percent among the people in the age group of 5-17 years and 16.6 percent in people of above 85 years. “Men were 62 percent more likely to die than women. Similarly, 63 percent of those who died had at least one co-morbidity, while 36 percent had two or more co-morbidities. Nearly 45 percent of the deceased were diabetic,” the study revealed. The study found that both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have effective primary healthcare delivery models. These two states have the largest healthcare workforces and public health expenditures per capita. They initiated rigorous disease surveillance and contact tracing early in response to the pandemic, it said. Also read: Trump in exceptionally good spirits, fever-free, breathing fine, say doctors“They have followed procedures including syndromic surveillance and testing for all individuals seeking care for severe acute respiratory illness or influenza-like illness at healthcare facilities, delineation of 5-km “containment zones” surrounding cases for daily house-to-house surveillance to identify individuals with symptoms,” it observed. The study also noted that there is a daily follow-up of all contacts of laboratory-confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases, with the aim of testing these individuals 5-14 days after their contact with a primary case, irrespective of symptoms, to identify onward transmission. According to the director of the CDDEP, Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, this study was made possible by the significant contact-tracing effort in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu which involved tens of thousands of healthcare workers. “The results on disease transmission and mortality have the potential to inform policy to fight Covid-19. The study also speaks to the capacity of research emerging from India to help inform the global response to Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70-of-covid-19-patients-don-t-transmit-virus-reveals-study-conducted-in-ap-tn/story-72MK8gg4Qdc8R09HEvZoUP.html

Haji sahab was in the forefront of the Jharkhand movement and played a great role in it. He was a simple person with strong determination. May the almighty give peace to the departed soul and strength to the family to withstand the loss.”JMM president and Rajya Sabha member Shibu Soren said he was pained to hear the news. In his condolence message, Soren described Ansari as a truly popular leader who was available to all. “He was my beloved companion. Ansari was a true leader, who was always alert on public issues and party organisation,” Shibu said adding that his death was an irreparable loss to the party.Condolences poured in from leaders of different political parties as well. Among the prominent ones were state Congress president and minister Rameshwar Oraon, CPI (ML) state secretary Janardan Prasad, CPI (M) and CPI state committees. Born in Pipra village in Madhupur block of Deoghar district, Ansari started his political journey in late eighties with the Congress.

There were no marks of struggle/scuffle in the body and clothes of the deceased,” Dr Gupta told ANI. The findings of the team led by Dr Sudhir Gupta have created a stir and evoked several reactions. Anil Deshmukh: Maharashtra home minister, NCP leader Anil Deshmukh raised questions over the delay in the CBI probe. “The investigation carried out by Mumbai Police in the Sushant Singh suicide case was done professionally & ethically. It has also been confirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme court & AIIMS report,” Deshmukh tweeted.Sachin Sawant: Congress leader and Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant demanded an SIT probe into the conspiracy being hatched against the Maha Vikas Agadhi government. “After the confirmation of AIIMS panel , the Conspiracy of Modi govt to defame Maharashtra is exposed. We demand SIT probe to nab the mastermind of the Conspiracy,” he said. After the confirmation of AIIMS panel , the Conspiracy of Modi govt to defame Maharashtra is exposed.

Since the team did not actually examine Sushant’s body but relied on photographs, the report could not be treated as conclusive. “AIIMS report is not conclusive and CBI in its charge sheet can still file a case of murder in Sushant Singh Rajput death case,” he said.Satish Maneshinde: Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde blamed media for speculation against Rhea Chakraborty. “I have seen the statement of the Doctors from AIIMS concerning SSR case. The official papers and report are only with AIIMS and CBI, which will be submitted in court once investigations are over. We await the official version of CBI. We on behalf of Rhea Chakraborty have always said that Truth cannot be changed under any circumstances. The speculations against Rhea in some quarters of the Media are motivated and mischievous. We remain committed to Truth Alone.

Who cornered him in a way that dying was easier than living? Morally and legally abetment of suicide is a murder.Kangana Ranaut: “Young and extraordinary individuals don’t just wake up one fine day and kill themselves.

The Mumbai Police called it a suicide after preliminary investigation. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is now probing the case.

On Friday, she tweeted, “.@myogiadityanath RESIGN. You have no moral right to continue as Chief Minister of UP.”“Why is the Prime Minister silent and where is the Union Home Minister?

03-10-2020||India||India successfully tests nuclear-capable Shaurya missile||India on Saturday successfully test-fired a new version of the nuclear-capable hypersonic Shaurya missile with a range of 750 kilometres from a defence facility off the Odisha coast on Saturday, officials said. The launch is the latest in a string of recent weapons tests amid military tensions with China in the Ladakh sector.The launch came three days after India test-fired an extended-range BrahMos surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile from the Integrated Test Range at Balasore in Odisha. The cruise missile can hit targets 400 kilometres away - its range increased from the existing 290 kilometres. The surface-to-surface medium range Shaurya missile, that can reach speeds of 7.5 Mach (seven and half times the speed of sound), blasted off from a canister from the Abdul Kalam Island test range off Dhamra at about 12.10 pm, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. There was no official word from the government on the successful launch. Also read: Covid fear, disparity - Why these countries objected to Indian flightsThe missile, equipped with multiple advanced computing technology and high accuracy navigation, efficient propulsion, sophisticated control and guidance systems, successfully followed its target in the Bay of Bengal, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) officials said.“This kind of demonstration of capability/power is extremely important to give a loud message to another nuclear-powered country that they should not take us for granted. This will bring in inherent dissuasion that will further discourage our adversaries from using nuclear weapons (against us),” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).The indigenously-developed missile was tracked and monitored through an integrated system of sophisticated radars, electro-optical tracking instruments and a chain of telemetry stations positioned in different points, they said. It performed a manoeuvre in the terminal phase and hit the impact point. It was the first user-specific trial of the missile that is a land variant of submarine-launched ballistic missile K-15, the officials said. The two-stage missile that uses solid propellants can deceive enemy radars after launch, the officials said. The 10 metre-long missile - weighing 6.2 tonne - can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads weighing up to 1,000 kilograms. The DRDO officials said once launched, Shaurya would be difficult to track by radars as the window for detection, tracking and interception is only 400 seconds. Like the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, Shaurya can be stored in a composite canister, making it easier to handle and transport.Also read: PM Modi rues lack of strategic vision of past regimes for poor border infrastructure Like a ballistic missile, it is powered by solid fuel, but can guide itself up to the target like a cruise missile, the officials added.On September 7, India took the first steps towards developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence, with the DRDO carrying out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time from a launch facility off the Odisha coast. Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-manoeuvring hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept. India could develop hypersonic cruise missiles powered by air-breathing scramjet engines in about four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-tests-nuclear-capable-shaurya-missile/story-fkYlozVJ5oq1MWO26GOwNN.html

Super-autocracy is going on in the country. There is no democracy in India. Media, NGOs, political parties, government officers are not being allowed to speak. Agency-raj is going on,” she said on Saturday, tagging the BJP as the biggest pandemic the country is facing today. Banerjee was addressing a rally in the heart of Kolkata to protest against the alleged gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Uttar Pradesh. This is her first rally after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I felt like rushing to Uttar Pradesh. Today my heart lies in that village. The Dalits and minorities are facing maximum atrocities. If I raise my voice, they (BJP) accuse me of minority appeasement. Today I am a Dalit because a Dalit girl has been murdered. Tomorrow I will be a member of the scheduled tribe community if some tribal person is tortured,” the TMC supremo said, with most of her 30-minute speech being delivered in Hindi. The TMC is seeing an opportunity to reach out to voters from backward classes, who supported the BJP in several of the 18 Lok Sabha seats the latter won in 2019. There are about 10 million people from the Namasudra community (Dalits) in Bengal. Before the 2019 polls, the All India Matua Mahasangha, a Dalit body, had played host to a rally addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Attacking the BJP over the Hathras incident, Banerjee said that she had tried to contact the victim’s family over the phone but was unable to speak as their phones were seized. The chief minister hinted that she may visit Hathras any day. “BJP may have directed the UP police not to allow anyone to enter the village. But for how long will it continue – Today, tomorrow and day after? A time will come when I will visit the village and you won’t get to know about it. I will surely meet the victim’s family,” she said. She ordered party leaders to continue protest rallies at block level every day till October 16 before the countdown for Durga Puja starts. The TMC chief used the platform to lead an all-out attack against the BJP-led Union government starting from farm bills, to disinvestment plans and GST, unemployment among others. “Over the past few days a political drama is going on in Mumbai.

The actor shot in Lucknow for the upcoming OTT series ‘Jackson’. “I have been discussing this project with Saurabh (Tewari, director) sir for a long time. And then when he started shooting in Lucknow, he called me to inform. My mother was like ‘nothing doing!’ but then I had to convince her. She agreed because it was a small schedule, as length of my role is not that big in the first season,” said Flora after wrapping her shoot in the state capital. On being asked what made her say yes to the series, the ‘Gandi Baat’ actor replied, “My role in the series is very different. People have seen me in various glamorous avtars but here I was getting a chance to do something extraordinary. At present I can’t reveal much about it. It challenged me as an actor and I’m glad I was able to pull it well.”Flora agrees that it is risky shooting during pandemic. “There are various norms implemented by our associations which are being followed dutifully. The makers are far too cautious as much is on stake for them. I feel it’s safe to shoot but ‘darr toh lagta hai’. The fact is that we too need to be guarded while shooting,” she said. On reaching Mumbai on Saturday, the actor said that she felt a bit low and anticipates that it must be a normal weather change. Flora earlier shot for ‘Ya Rab’ in Lucknow. The pretty actor is looking forward to shoot for ‘City of Dreams’ season 2 and is waiting for ‘Inside Edge-3’ wherein she has already shot for her part. Her latest being ‘Bahut Hua Samman’ that got streamed on OTT, recently was shot in Varanasi last year. The film will see her playing a glamorous Bhojpuri star.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-feel-it-s-safe-to-shoot-but-darr-toh-lagta-hai-flora-saini/story-jQE2bEeqQ8vW4ZLVIvfwxH.html

Nishank made the statement while addressing a press conference in Dehradun on the three agriculture laws while accusing the Opposition of protesting against the laws without any basis and provoking the farmers. “The agricultural reforms have freed the farmers from the clutches of the middlemen and have made them the masters of their own destiny,” said Nishank. Hailing the laws as highly beneficial for the farmers, he said, “They have given a new lease of life to the agricultural sector of the country. This will largely help the small farmers while ending the influence of the middlemen when selling their produce.”Also read: Tejashwi Yadav Opposition’s CM candidate, Cong gets 70 seats“The new law enables the farmers to sell their produce directly to the buyers like food processors, wholesalers, aggregators and exporters thus increasing their income,” he said. The Union minister also refuted the claims of the Opposition that the new laws will end the Minimum Support Price (MSP) concept and the existing mandis. “There will be no change in the MSP concept nor in the mandis which will continue to operate as normal,” he said.Nishank also lashed out at the Congress and said, “They didn’t read the laws and the provisions in it and have started protesting against them. If they would have read them carefully, they wouldn’t have been protesting without any basis”.The Congress, however, questioned Nishank’s claims saying he should answer whether “there are any provision of not ending the MSP and mandis”.Suryakant Dhasmana, Congress state vice-president said, “He should first answer if there any provisions of not ending the MSP and the mandis which are like a lifeline to the farmers in selling their produce. He should also answer why has the Centre amended the Essential Commodities Act by removing some items like pulses, potato and onion from the list”.“These are all steps to promote crony capitalism and not to benefit the farmers. These new agriculture laws are to push the farmers into bonded labour at the hands of big industrialists,” said Dhasmana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-are-masters-of-their-destiny-now-union-minister-on-farm-bills/story-970zbsUADdPGI9N0raZrOP.html
03-10-2020||India||International flights: Why these countries have objected to Indian flights in past||After months of shutdown, international flight gradually resumed services across the world with several conditions. This period of staggered reopening saw countries exercising their rights to bar flights coming from high-risk countries. Foreign flights have also been banned in the interest of the local airlines. After India started international flights as part of Vande Bharat Mission and air bubbles, several countries have so far objected to India’s flights. Later, some of the issues have been resolved.Here is a list of the countries and why they objectedUnited States: In May, the US administration imposed restrictions on Vande Bharat Mission flights, saying the Indian government has been engaging in discriminatory treatment of American airlines by barring them from operating similar flights. The issue got resolved as India and the US set up air bubble under which airlines of both the countries will be able to carry passengers.UAE: Soon after the United States, the United Arab Emirates raised a similar concern as India was not allowing any UAE flights. The UAE authorities in June said if Air India flights are carrying UAE nationals, then also special permission would be required. Following this, air bubble was set up with the UAE as well.Also Read: International flights: New destinations, rules, relaxations in OctoberHong Kong: Hong Kong banned Vande Bharat flights for a period of fortnight twice in August and September as passengers were found Covid-19 positive.Dubai: Dubai banned Air India flights for Covid-19 concerns. Now it has asked the authorities to blacklist four Covid-19 testing centres when they check test report before allowing passengers to board.Germany: There is currently no flight operational between India and Germany though the two countries have a bubble pact. Negotiations are on as Germany is not allowing Indian carriers to run as many flights as Lufthansa is flying.”As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. In spite of this disparity we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. Negotiations continue,” the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-flights-why-these-countries-have-objected-to-indian-flights-in-past/story-jYDCqzth7dNUDwqhA24RjJ.html

While high drama unfolded in the national capital and the case continued to find wide resonance, a Hathras administration official said the Special Investigation Team had completed its probe into the death and alleged gangrape of the 19-year-old woman. Also read: Hathras gang-rape case: ‘SIT will address all issues raised by victim’s family,’ says ACSEnding a two-day standoff, the administration removed barricades outside her village to allow the media to meet her family. But scores of police personnel in riot gear lined up at the Delhi-Noida Direct flyway to prevent the Congress convoy from moving to Hathras, about 180 km away. Eventually, as swarms of Congress workers and others jostled with each other amid loud honking, slogans and Congress flags fluttering in the air, the Gautam Buddh Nagar Police finally allowed five people, including Rahul Gandhi, to go to Hathras. Congress workers – some who described what happened as “brutal repression” -- claimed police used batons to disperse the crowd. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were detained on Thursday when they tried to go to Hathras.“CrPC Section 144 has been imposed in Noida, Greater Noida as well as in Hathras and some other districts in Uttar Pradesh due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Considering social distancing and other related norms, permission has been granted for five people, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra,” Noida Police Commissioner Alok Singh told PTI.All roads it seemed led to Hathras with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sending senior officials, including Additional Chief Secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi and Director General of Police H C Awasthy, to the village to meet the woman’s family. Several journalists, including those from TV channels, also made their way to the village where various family members spoke of their grief and trauma since September 14 when she was brutally assaulted and allegedly gangraped by four upper caste men Awanish Awasthi told reporters that “any group with no more than five people” is allowed to meet the victim’s family, marking a departure from the last few days when media and politicians, including from the Congress and Trinamool Congress, were turned away from the village.“After returning (from Hathras) we will be submitting a report on the entire incident to the chief minister,” Awanish Awasthi said. Also read: ‘Will stand with Dalit brothers and sisters’: Mamata at protest against Hathras gang-rapeThe Dalit teen died of her grievous injuries in the early hours of Tuesday in a Delhi hospital, a fortnight after she was attacked, and cremated in the dead of night near her home on Wednesday. Her family alleged they were forced by local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites, triggering outrage nationwide and protests in several places. On Thursday, the Hathras administration had clamped prohibitory orders and scuffles broke out as politicians, including from the Congress and the TMC, as well as the media tried to access the village. About 300 police personnel stood on guard to prevent anybody from entering.The death of the young woman, whose brutal assault recalled for many the horrors of the Nirbhaya case, continued to snowball into a major political issue As the Congress delegation from Delhi prepared to make its way to Hathras, its Uttar Pradesh unit president Ajay Kumar Lallu and more than 500 workers were put under house arrest, the party alleged. In Varanasi, a group of Congress workers blocked the Union minister Smriti Irani’s cavalcade. Congress spokesperson Lalan Kumar said protesting party workers, who raised anti-government slogans and demanded justice for the woman’s family, were later arrested.Addressing a press conference, the Women and Child Development minister accused the opposition of playing politics on the Hathras issue. “The victim will get justice. I have spoken to the chief minister. Once the SIT submits its report, the chief minister will take action against the accused,” Irani told reporters. Adityanath had set up three-member Special Investigation Team on Wednesday and instructed that it submit its report by October 14.In a tweet in Hindi using the hashtag ‘Hathrashorror’, Rahul Gandhi said the behaviour of the UP government and police with the woman and her family “is unacceptable”. Hitting out at the Adityanath dispensation, Priyanka Gandhi described the UP government as “morally corrupt” and said, “The victim did not get treatment, her complaint was not registered on time, her body was forcibly cremated, the family is in captivity, they are being suppressed -- now they are being threatened that they will have to undergo a narco test.” The party also alleged that the woman and her family had been denied justice and “severely traumatised” by the BJP government.BSP president Mayawati demanded a CBI or a Supreme Court monitored probe into the incident and said people were not satisfied with the initial investigations in the matter.“There is tremendous resentment in the entire country over the Hathras heinous gangrape case. The public does not seem satisfied with the initial probe report. Therefore, this matter should be investigated by the CBI or under the supervision of the honourable Supreme Court. This is the demand of the BSP,” Mayawati tweeted in Hindi.“Also, the honourable president of the country, who also comes from UP and is a Dalit, it is a strong appeal to him to intervene in this case, keeping in mind the inhuman attitude of the government, to bring justice to the victim family,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-priyanka-on-way-to-hathras-after-high-drama-sit-completes-probe-into-dalit-teen-s-death/story-GwDj0d5hgQ98CqpodSgopI.html

The national carrier had so far allowed the sale of only packaged food across catering and vending units at stations. Food stalls across platforms had been shut throughout the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25. “Zones are advised that static catering units (FP, FFU, RR. JA & CK) which are operational at 10% of licence fee with limited saleable items up till September 30 may be allowed to operate till October 31 at pro-rata LF of 20 per cent of license fee with sale of cooked food as takeaway only. No dine in to be allowed,” the IRCTC order said. “Further, zones are also advised that the contracts which have expired after March 23 may also be allowed to operate up to October 31 on payment of licence fee of 20 per cent,” it added.This also comes as a big relief to passengers looking to travel during the festival season. The Railways is planning to introduce 200 additional special trains between October 15 and November 30 to cater to passengers travelling during the holiday season, Railway Board CEO VK Yadav announced on Thursday. At present around 310 special trains are plying since lockdown while regular trains remain suspended indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-permit-cooked-food-to-be-sold-at-stations-for-the-first-time-since-covid-19-outbreak/story-fi2UQUOXF9ut1MdoWYcKGM.html
03-10-2020||India||India has 18.6% of global coronavirus cases, 21% of all recoveries||With the second highest caseload of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) globally, India continues to post the highest number of recoveries from the infection. India accounts for 21% of all the recoveries reported worldwide, even as the country accounts for 18.6% of the global share of cases. United States accounts for the highest number of cases reported globally, accounting for 21.7% of all the cases, but accounts for 18.4% of the total global recoveries, according to data shared by the Union health ministry. The higher recoveries reported in India are largely owing to fewer deaths due to the infection. India’s case fatality ratio – fraction of people who died of the infection among those who tested positive – is one of the lowest in the world and currently stands at 1.56%, lower than the global average of 2.97%. And, much lower than countries like Mexico where the current CFR stands at about 10.9% and United Kingdom where it stands at 9.17%. The other countries where the CFR is lower than the global average are Russia with a CFR of 1.76%, South Africa with 2.49% and United States with 2.87%, the data from the ministry shows. “India has consistently been reporting one of the lowest CFR across the world. Studies are going on to figure out why, but scientists think it could be because of a younger population, our previous exposure to other coronavirus infections, the virus having mutated to cause more infections but fewer deaths, people having been vaccinated with BCG (anti-tuberculosis vaccine). The current decline in deaths could also be because the treatment modalities have been standardized now,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung Hospital. The higher recoveries and fewer new cases being reported across the country has also resulted in the drop in the number of active cases or those with current infections. The government needs to focus on the active cases as they are the ones who have to be in isolation and might need medical intervention. The number of active cases has gone down consecutively for 12 days now. After reaching about 100,000 cases being reported from the country each day, the number of new cases has dipped to 79,000 reported as on Friday, according to the health ministry. Over 78% of these new cases are being reported from 10 states – Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh. Of the total deaths reported on Friday, 84% are also from ten states – Kerala and Odisha which have reported a high number of cases are not among the ten states with high fatalities, whereas Madhya Pradesh and Haryana which are not among the ten with highest number of cases are among the ten that have reported high fatalities due to the infection. Maharashtra continues to report the highest number of cases and deaths, accounting for 25% of all the new cases and 39.6% of the deaths, the data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-18-6-of-global-coronavirus-cases-21-of-all-recoveries/story-dvx6Q5hPIBlmqjCgEY7zZJ.html

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the nation’s premium medical research organisation, conducted the second national sero-survey for Covid-19 in August to monitor the trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission in India.“The second round of the ICMR’s national sero-survey for SARS COV-2 infection (Covid-19) in Pulwama district shows prevalence of 27.3 percent. In the first round, in June, it was only 2 percent,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar and nodal person for the ICMR’s national sero-survey for Pulwama district.The community-based surveillance was conducted across 60 districts and 10 hotspot sites across all states and Union territories to map the changing trend of the population’s response to SARS COV-2 infection over the months.The first round was held in May and June this year where the prevalence of IgG antibody was found 0.73 percent among the general population in the country. During the survey, blood samples were collected to determine the prevalence of infection in the recent past and the body’s immune response to the SARS CoV-2 infection.Also read: Tejashwi Yadav to lead Opposition alliance in BiharIn the second round in Pulwama district, 413 blood samples were collected in ten different clusters of which 113 reported to be positive for IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 infection which makes it to 27.3 percent.“Sona Samilo village cluster showed the highest, 52.5 percent, positive prevalence while Khaigam recorded the lowest prevalence at 2.5 percent,” Khan said.The district was chosen in the first survey as it was a low-risk district depending on the number of cases per million population.So far, Jammu and Kashmir has recorded 77,253 positive cases of Covid-19 with 3,996 people registering positive for the infection in Pulwama. As many as 69 people have died due to the infection in the district of the total 1,212 deaths in the Union territory till October 2.The data was collected through app-based modules and at each site the data and blood samples of participants were collected for adults and children over 10 years of age.“The eldest positive cases were of three men and a woman ageing over 75 years while the youngest was an 11-year-old girl,” said Khan.The ICMR conducted the study through its regional centres, however, it asked the Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar, to conduct the study in Pulwama district on its behalf.A team from the GMC, comprising faculty, resident doctors and medical interns from the Department of Community Medicine (SPM), was deputed for conducting the survey in ICMR-assigned ten clusters in Pulwama. The study was coordinated by Dr Inaamul Haq and Dr Mariya Amin Qurieshi - assistant professors at the community medicine department, GMC, Srinagar. The blood samples were sent to the ICMR lab at Chennai.“We still need to follow SOPs religiously to prevent further spread of Covid-19 infection in the community which include wearing masks, social distancing and hand hygiene,” Khan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-shows-covid-19-antibodies-in-27-population-in-kashmir-s-pulwama/story-1Vn93uVOxGTa5a6RRWPO5N.html

The incident of rape on a Dalit girl is a very serious issue,” he said. Athawale, who said he will be meeting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, stated, “On the Hathras case, I have to say that there should not be politics in the name of atrocities on Dalits. It is not right to propagate about atrocities on Dalits during Yogi government.” “It is right that atrocities are taking place but it had been so during the Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Akhilesh (Yadav) governments also,” he added. Backing CM Adityanath on the steps taken by him in the case, the Union minister said the manner in which the woman’s body was cremated was wrong and he would be taking up the issue of action on other officials. He said the reason behind such atrocities on Dalits is casteism and it will continue till people have casteist mindset. Athawale said he wanted to go to Hathras on Friday but could not do so as the district administration had barred the entry of outsiders while adding that he would try to go next week, if allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-do-politics-on-dalit-atrocities-ramdas-athawale-on-hathras-case/story-eQbScFgStvJyEgTr14q33M.html

Its two stages use solid propellants.Describing the trial as successful, the sources said that the state-of-the-art missile performed a manoeuvre in the closing stages of its flight and hit the impact point in the Bay of Bengal with precision and accuracy.A gas generator at the bottom of the canister pushed the missile out it. Its first stage ignited then and fell off.The second stage went into action after this, a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) official said.During the test flight, the missile was tracked by various telemetry stations and radars and performed well, he said.DRDO officials rate Shaurya as one of the top 10 missiles in the world in its class with its high performance navigation and guidance systems, efficient propulsion systems, sophisticated control technologies and canisterised launch,” sources said.The missile can be launched from silos and canisters mounted on a truck and fixed on the ground, they said adding that it can be easily moved around. A truck itself can become a launching platform.“Shaurya” missiles can kept in locations where the enemies would not be able to detect them. Besides, it cannot be detected by satellite imaging, the sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-nuclear-capable-hypersonic-missile-shaurya/story-6OVLkT6uXueovpkKniuxGK.html

Domestic flights were suspended on March 25 when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19.2. Aviation sector is one of the worst-hit sectors by the lockdown.3. After a gap of two months, domestic flights were resumed on May 25 — with several restrictions at place.4. Airlines were asked to fly only 33 per cent of their pre-Covid capacity.5. The Centre fixed the air fare so that airlines do not overcharge passengers. Air tickets have been capped between Rs 2,000 and Rs 18,600. The fare cap is still existing.6. Initially, only one check-in bag was allowed in domestic flights. No meals were to be served on board. 7. Over the time, these restrictions have been relaxed. The airlines are now operating at near 60 per cent capacity. The airlines have been asked to revert to their pre-Covid baggage rules. Packaged meals are also available on domestic flights now. 8. Several state governments have still not allowed the airports to return to their pre-Covid numbers of daily arrivals and departures.9. In August, the West Bengal government barred flights from six Covid-19 high-risk cities. On days of local lockdowns, all flights were barred.10. Still, the growth in the domestic figures has been hopeful, as passengers are now convinced that flights are safe, the Union minister has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flights-pre-covid-figures-will-be-reached-between-diwali-and-new-year-says-hardeep-singh-puri/story-b6ye1zYybnmX6xUSlARdFJ.html

03-10-2020||India||KCR writes to Centre as Telangana seeks complete control over dam on Krishna||Telangana has sought complete control over the operation of Srisailam Dam on the Krishna river to prevent Andhra Pradesh from constructing “illegal projects” without the Centre’s permission. K Chandrasekhar Rao, the Telangana chief minister, wrote a letter to Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Friday in this regard.In the 14-page letter, Rao accused the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) constituted for water sharing between the two states of being biased against Telangana and favouring Andhra Pradesh. He said Andhra Pradesh is going ahead with the expansion of the capacity Pothireddypadu head regulator on the Srisailam reservoir to draw 80,000 cusecs of water from the Krishna river to Pennar basin. Rao the regulator was originally meant for drawing only 1,500 cusecs to supply drinking water to Chennai.Andhra Pradesh has finalised tenders for the construction of the Rayalseema Lift Irrigation Scheme to lift 3 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) of water daily from the Srisailam Reservoir and transport it to the Pennar and adjoining basins.“Though the matter was brought to the notice of KRMB in February itself, it has failed to take any action to stop these illegal projects. The KRMB has also failed to install a telemetry system to measure the largescale illegal withdrawal of water by AP [Andhra Pradesh] from Pothireddypadu regulator. Instead, the board gave instructions to Telangana to stop the release of water from Srisailam Left Bank Power House of Telangana,” said Rao.He cited the arrangements and said the responsibility to operate the Nagarjunasagar Project was given to Telangana and Srisailam Project to Andhra Pradesh. “Because of the failure of KRMB, Andhra Pradesh has taken advantage of this arrangement to illegally draw huge quantities of water from Pothireddypadu.”He said the operation and control of the Srisailam Project should also be given to Telangana to stop Andhra Pradesh from going ahead with its plans of expanding the capacity of its projects.“If Andhra Pradesh is allowed to go ahead with their nefarious and illegitimate expansion plans now, there will be no water available to meet the requirements for existing projects in Telangana including the drinking water needs of the capital city Hyderabad.”Rao said Telangana was waiting to know its legitimate share of river waters even after six years of its formation. He asked the Centre to address the issue in a time-bound manner.Rao called Andhra Pradesh’s objections to the projects being constructed on the Godavari river like Kaleshwaram lift irrigation scheme as a complete farce. He said all these projects were contemplated, designed, and grounded before Telangana’s creation in 2014.“The present government has only re-designed some of the projects to augment irrigation potential well within the riparian rights of Telangana.”The Centre has called a meeting of representatives of the two sates on October 6 to resolve their water disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-writes-to-centre-as-telangana-seeks-complete-control-over-dam-on-krishna/story-lZAqtNUQTm5lNbm1PjhiBJ.html

03-10-2020||India||‘Our priority is farmers’ benefit, for earlier govt it was election’: PM Modi at Solang public rally||After inaugurating Atal Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh’s Rohtang, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a public rally in Solang and said the tunnel will help draw tourists to Himachal Pradesh from all across the world.As the country is unlocking itself after Covid-19 lockdown, the tourism sector will also start getting back on track soon, the PM said, adding that the state is bound to see a rise in tourist footfall due to the tunnel.He also took the opportunity to talk about farm laws that were passed in Parliament last month and said that the laws, just like Atal Tunnel, will help small farmers in the long run.Small farmers who wish to sell their produce in markets far away from their origin would be able to do so with the help of this tunnel, PM Modi said. “Our country is bound to change for the better. An example of this is the introduction of farm bills. For us, the priority is our farmers, for earlier governments it was elections,” PM Modi said.“Dreams of youth of Himachal Pradesh and all of India are important to us. These developments will help fulfil them. I would like to congratulate the state and the country again for the inauguration of Atal Tunnel,” he added.Along with the inauguration of Atal Tunnel, another decision was taken for the people of Himachal, the PM said, adding that a 66 MW Dhaulasidh Hydro Electric Project in Hamirpur was recently approved. “This project will not only give electricity to the country, it’ll also give employment to the youth of Himachal,” PM said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur and Union minister Anurag Thakur also attend the Solang Nala rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-addresses-public-rally-at-himachal-pradesh-s-solang-after-atal-tunnel-inauguration-in-rohtang/story-O2IFmKJtxY3yVSkJ9fJjJJ.html
03-10-2020||India||PM Modi rues lack of strategic vision of past regimes for poor border infrastructure | Analysis||At the inauguration of 9.2km long Atal Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lighted up three projects in the west, central and east India to underline that the previous government lacked strategic vision and pitched for a rapid border infrastructure upgrade to defend India.With the on-going stand-off between Indian Army and Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in east Ladakh in mind, PM Modi took the example of 16,800 feet high airstrip at Daulat Beg Oldi post near the Karakoram Pass which could not be activated due to lack of political will from 1965 to 2008. The advanced landing ground was activated by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2008 using a Russian AN-32 plane and the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was informed after completion of the mission. The airstrip, which is vital for supplies to troops in DBO-Depsang Bulge area, is now used by C-130J Hercules aircraft much to the chagrin of the Chinese commanders.Without referring to China, PM Modi also blamed the previous regimes for placing hurdles in way of Indian Army patrols along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) by not building roads to the perceived line. China experts believe that it is this 30-year differential in border infrastructure between the two countries that helps the PLA, in terms of both capacity and capability.Interestingly, PM Modi used three projects launched by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government — Atal tunnel (Himachal Pradesh), Kosi Maha Setu (Bihar) and Boghibeel bridge (Assam) — to showcase the apathetic attitude of past governments towards achieving national goals. While the Atal tunnel was inaugurated on Saturday, Kosi rail bridge was launched in September after hanging fire since 1934 and the Boghibeel Setu was commissioned by PM Modi in 2018 .In the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff Gen Bipin Rawat, India Army chief General MM Naravane and defence secretary Ajay Kumar, PM Modi took a pot-shot at the Indian bureaucracy that kept the Rafale fighter acquisition pending by only flying files from one desk to the other and thus compromising the defence of India. Citing the example of the state of ordnance factories, PM also issued an oblique warning to Indian bureaucracy to not stand in the way of “Atmanirbhar” Bharat.While the importance of Atal tunnel cannot be understated, the fact is that this tunnel under Rohtang La opens a new road to Ladakh via Darcha-Padam-Nimu route rather than Darcha-Upishi-Leh route which is blocked six months a year due to heavy snow at four other high mountain passes en-route. The Darcha-Padam-Nimu route can remain open round the year once a 4.5km tunnel is built under Shinku La on Darcha-Padam axis.Just as roads in the Ladakh sector are being built to connect remote areas of the country, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is moving at a much faster pace to complete strategic roads in Arunachal Pradesh so that places such as Tawang, Walong and Kibuthoo are linked through all-weather roads to other parts of India.It is no wonder that China has refused to recognise the Union territory of Ladakh and calls the border infrastructure upgrade in the areas to ensure India’s so-called occupation of this territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-rues-lack-of-strategic-vision-of-past-regimes-for-poor-border-infrastructure-analysis/story-CcYwzDmQOhj31rDjAPHHnK.html
03-10-2020||India||Foreign secretary and army chief to make first joint visit to Myanmar||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane are set to visit Myanmar on Monday, the first time an Indian delegation to the neighbouring country has included both officials, for discussions to take forward ties in areas ranging from security to connectivity. This will be the foreign secretary’s second foreign visit, after a trip to Bangladesh in August, since the Covid-19 outbreak and the army chief’s first such visit amid the restrictions related to the pandemic, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The visit comes against the backdrop of India’s five-month border standoff with China. New Delhi has been working steadily to boost ties with all countries in the neighbourhood barring Pakistan, and has announced a slew of initiatives ranging from currency swaps, budgetary support and connectivity projects to help other states in the region to overcome the economic impact of Covid-19. The visit will also come four days after the India-Myanmar foreign office consultations, which were conducted virtually by Shringla and permanent secretary U Soe Han on Thursday. During that meeting, Shringla announced that the two sides are working to operationalise Sittwe port by the first quarter of 2021 while the tendering process for 69 bridges for the trilateral highway, also involving Thailand, will begin soon. India’s assistance to Myanmar currently stands at $1.4 billion, and New Delhi will provide debt service relief under the G20 debt service suspension initiative to Myanmar from May to December to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Despite the challenges caused by the Covid pandemic, we are working towards operationalising the Sittwe port by the first quarter of next year. With respect to the 69 bridges on the trilateral highway, I am happy to inform you that we will soon be moving forward with the tendering process,” Shringla said. Sittwe port is part of the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project, which is crucial to India’s plans for the landlocked northeastern states to access the Bay of Bengal through Mizoram and to provide alternative connectivity to Kolkata without having to use the circuitous Siliguri corridor. The India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway has been held up due to problems associated with the stretch in Myanmar and the construction of the bridges is expected to speed up work on the project. Security cooperation between India and Myanmar also figured in Thursday’s meeting, with Shringla describing it as robust. Both sides are sensitive to each other’s security concerns, he added. Myanmar’s handing over of 22 Indian insurgents was “deeply appreciated” by India as it sent a “strong message of deterrence to inimical elements on both sides”, he added. Shringla requested Myanmar for the early conclusion of an extradition treaty, a mutual legal assistance treaty on civil and commercial matters, and an agreement on the transfer of sentenced persons. Also Read: Army chief, foreign secretary to seal shipping agreement and security ties with MyanmarAs part of defence cooperation, an Indian team for deployment of meteorological squadrons will travel to Myanmar this month, and India will receive Myanmar’s representative at its maritime Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean. The situation in Rakhine state also figured in the meeting. India recently entered into trilateral cooperation with Japan in Rakhine, under which it will create infrastructure for 15 schools. “Our efforts towards ensuring an early, safe and sustainable repatriation of internally displaced persons to Myanmar will continue,” Shringla said. This issue assumes importance as Bangladesh had raised the issue of one million Rohingya refugees it is hosting during the virtual meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission (JCC), which was co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Bangladeshi counterpart AK Abdul Momen on September 29. Momen had expressed the hope that India, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council during 2021-22, will play a “more meaningful role for a lasting solution to the Rohingya crisis, including their early repatriation to Myanmar in a safe and sustainable manner”, according to a statement from Bangladesh’s foreign ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-and-army-chief-to-make-first-joint-visit-to-myanmar/story-eKCZX01cnVXsDmLByesvzM.html

However, the HC in another hearing, done via video conferencing on September 30, permitted the public hearing to take place by relaxing the stay.Samantra, who has already filed written objections to the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the Vedanta Aluminium expansion project, however, said the whole process of public hearing should have been transparent. Also Read: Odisha govt provides uniform to 14.83 lakh pre-school children on Gandhi Jayanti“The OPCB should have fixed another day for the public hearing and issued advertisements in the newspapers as per the rules. The HC order could have been implemented on another date by following the law. Many villagers who could have participated in the hearing were not aware of the latest HC order and were deprived of the right to appear in public hearing. How was the hearing made possible within a short time and under whose supervision was it conducted,” asked Samantra.The public hearing was attended by around 400 people including 62 who spoke.Also Read: Odisha fisherman catches exotic fish, sells it for Rs 1.56 lakhOPCB regional officer Hemandra Nath Nayak who had conducted the hearing said that adequate time was given to people through advertisements floated in local dailies on August 28.“Those who are opposing the public hearing should read the notification for public hearing. Besides, no violation of Covid guidelines had taken place as people who attended the hearing had maintained social distancing and wore masks,” said Nayak.Sanjiv Patnaik, the PRO of Vedanta Aluminium, said the company had no role in the public hearing as it was conducted by OPCB. “The proposed expansion will be within the existing aluminium smelter plant complex of about 2061.41 acres. No additional land would be acquired,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-activist-seeks-fresh-public-hearing-for-vedanta-s-expansion-plan/story-cPt1XAZjRht6SgT1r1SDGM.html
03-10-2020||India||Army chief, foreign secretary to seal shipping agreement and security ties with Myanmar||On the eve of Myanmar general elections, Indian Army chief General MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla are headed towards Naypyidaw on Sunday to seal the much-awaited coastal shipping agreement to activate the Kaladan multi-modal project and cement security ties against insurgent groups. Gen Naravane and Shringla will meet senior General Min Aung Hlaing and Aung San Suu Kyi, the state counsellor of Myanmar, as last incoming foreign visitors before November 8 elections.According to South Block officials, both Gen Naravane and Shringla will comprehensively review ties with Myanmarese leadership so that there is no discrepancy in the exchange of views. The highlight of the one-day two-day visit will be the coastal shipping agreement that will allow Indian ships to reach Mizoram via Sittwe Port on the Bay of Bengal and through the Kaladan river multi-modal link. This project has been hanging fire for the past 20 years when it was envisaged by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.The two sides will also discuss strengthening security ties by making the India-Myanmar border impenetrable to the anti-India insurgents and drug smugglers. A large number of anti-India insurgents are based across the Moreh border in Manipur and across Vijayanagar salient in Arunachal Pradesh. The anti-India insurgents are armed with Chinese weapons with their leaders like Paresh Baruah of the ULFA based in Ruili in Yunnan province of China. The Indian-Myanmar border is also used to smuggle synthetic drugs like YABA and heroin.India and Myanmar will also discuss in increasing cooperation in the energy sector with New Delhi already investing more than $1.4 billion dollars into the development of hydrocarbon-rich off-shore blocks in the Andaman Seas.While there is a significant presence of China in Myanmar in the infrastructure, hydrocarbon, power and ports sector, Naypyidaw is keen to develop across the board ties with India. The Myanmarese leadership is clear that its ties with China cannot be at the cost of the bilateral relationship with India.During the visit of Indian top officials, the two sides will also discuss the issue of rehabilitation of the Rohingyas with India already discussing the facilitation of the refugees back to Myanmar. All three countries do not want Pakistan-based Islamist groups to infiltrate into the Rohingya refugee settlements on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border and radicalize them. Already there is evidence that Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen group have sent their cadres to radicalize the Rohingyas.“As India sees Myanmar as the key to develop and secure its north-east region, the dialogue with Naypyidaw will be comprehensive and discuss all aspects of the relationship,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-foreign-secretary-to-seal-shipping-agreement-and-security-ties-with-myanmar/story-MFUF5UY5hdU4KCONvirOkK.html
03-10-2020||India||Ladakh-Leh polls: Set to make clean sweep, says BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday put up a brave front, saying the region’s people are in its favour and it would make a clean sweep in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC)-Leh polls on October 22.The polls are being held amid resentment over the BJP-led Centre’s failure in ensuring constitutional protection for Ladakh’s resources and cultural identity. There are demands for the implementation of Constitution’s Sixth Schedule in the region for these safeguards. Ladakh was split from Jammu & Kashmir and declared a Union Territory last year when Constitution’s Article 370, which that provided these safeguards, was also nullified.Also read: Govt assures Ladakh’s interest will be looked after, local groups withdraw call to boycott LAHDC polls“People are in favour of the BJP and the issue of the Sixth Schedule is over because the Apex Body of People’s Movement [ABPM] comprising older leaders recently went to Delhi, where they met [Union] home minister Amit Shah, who has given them an assurance to fulfil their demand,” said LAHDC chief executive councillor and BJP leader Gyal P Wangyal over the phone. “I am very much confident that the home minister will fulfil his promise.”Wangyal, who emphasised he was not privy to the specifics of the talks between the apex body and Shah, said he has no doubt that the BJP will win the elections under Ladakh Parliament member Jamyang Tsering Namgyal’s leadership.Elections to the hill council are held every five years. The BJP has 18 seats in the outgoing 30-member council, while the Congress five, and the National Conference two.Former BJP lawmaker Thupstan Chhewang has formed the ABPM to seek constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule on the lines of north-eastern states. The umbrella group includes political and religious organisations and the Ladakh Buddhist Association. It is also seeking legislative powers for two councils in Leh and Kargil.Following Shah’s assurance, the body withdrew its call for a boycott of the council polls.Chhewang resigned from the BJP in November 2018 over the BJP government’s failure in grating federal territory status to Ladakh as per the party’s 2014 election manifesto.Chering Dorjay, a member of the apex body, said after Ladakh was given the Union Territory status without legislature on August 5 last year, the local people wanted safeguards under the Sixth Schedule for their land, jobs, language and culture. “It still remains the sentiment of the people in Leh and therefore when high command did not heed it, I resigned in protest in May,” said Dorjay.“Within 15 day of the culmination of the hill council polls, Shah has assured to provide us safeguards under the Sixth Schedule. However, the exercise has to be preceded by the participation of the representatives elected in the polls. Further, we have to take the people of Kargil on board.”Dorjay said the Sixth Schedule will guarantee no settlement of outsiders. “The outsiders cannot purchase land or property in the region. That is the main concern of the people here because Ladakh region has vast swathes of barren land and they are vulnerable to outsiders, who can come and settle anywhere.”Saturday is the last day for filing of nominations for the 30-seat council. The scrutiny of nominations will be held on October 5. October 7 is the last day for withdrawal of nominations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-leh-polls-set-to-make-clean-sweep-says-bjp/story-9DZtIvkFNAOC2kqAE8nMGO.html

The antiviral fabric used for the T-shirt, say the researchers, destroys microorganisms on contact. It reduces the likelihood of microbes settling on the fabric, thereby cutting down transmission. The fabric is over 95% effective against bacteria and viruses, according to the researchers. Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is spread through respiratory droplets that settle on surface that is then touched by another person who can infect themselves by touching their eyes, nose and mouth. The antimicrobial properties of the T-shirt remain effective even after 30 washes in mild conditions. “The Covid-19 pandemic driving an all-time-high demand of multifunctional antiviral and microbial apparels. Developing cost-effective bio-clothing with antiviral and antimicrobial functionalities through local resources and resilient manufacturing can deactivate the viral threats and can efficiently stop or slow the spread of the virus. Further, this will boost the local economy for textile and garment sectors,” said Bipin Kumar, professor in the department of textile and fibre engineering at IIT Delhi and mentor for E-TEX, one of the two startups that has developed the kit. The other startup, Clensta, has created a protection lotion that offers up to 99.9% virus protection for up to 24 hours. The product developed using Prolonged Antiviral Technology to prevent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections without harming the environment and human health. The product can protect against the virus for 24 hours, thereby reducing the need for washing hands and using sanitisers frequently. It can be used on any part of the body, including the face. “Amid the ongoing pandemic, it is of utmost importance to maintain personal hygiene. To cope with the rising demand of sanitisation products, we extend a new range of affordable antiviral products to provide long term protection in one use,” said Puneet Gupta, founder of Clensta International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-two-iit-d-startups-develop-antiviral-t-shirt-lotion/story-HkPrPwiOE33YJUpUirVLPM.html

The moratorium was announced as part of measures to mitigate economic hardships caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread in March.The government made the announcement in the affidavit as a bunch of petitions seeking a waiver of accrual of interest for the moratorium period are pending before the court.The affidavit, however, said the waiver on contractual interest on loans cannot be waived as it will lead to a huge financial burden on banks estimated to be more than Rs 6 lakh crore. “Union of India has decided to continue the tradition of handholding the small borrowers. The Government has decided that the relief on waiver of compound interest during the six-month moratorium period (March 1-August 31) shall be limited to the most vulnerable category of borrowers.”The waiver will apply to MSME/entity or individuals, who have taken below Rs 2 crore education loans, housing loans, consumer durable loans, auto loans, personal loans, professional, etc.The Centre said the decision was taken in the interest of borrowers and the banks, which would unable to sustain this load. It had initially opposed the waiver in the court. The proposal was also opposed by the Indian Banks Association (IBA) and the State Bank of India separately represented in the matter.Agra-based businessman Gajendra Sharma was the first to move the court seeking the waiver.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan is expected to take up the matter on Monday and pass further orders after going through the affidavit. The bench has maintained that it is the responsibility of the Centre and Reserve Bank of India to handhold the borrowers. It has pointed out that it was the Centre’s decision to impose lockdown, shutting down businesses and establishments.The court on September 10 asked the Centre to consider the issue taking all parameters into consideration. Earlier, with the moratorium ending on August 31, the court had said that banks will not declare loan accounts as non-performing assets (NPA) on account of non-payment.IBA, which represents 215 banks, told the court no account shall become NPA at least for two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-waive-interest-on-interest-during-moratorium-centre-tells-sc/story-tXTDIZJPWlz2N2VbW1VgbM.html

PM Modi also addressed the nation after inaugurating the 9.02km Atal Tunnel and hailed the Border Roads Organisation for carrying out the construction work in harsh weather conditions.It is the longest tunnel built at an altitude of 3,000 meters.Here are the key quotes from PM Modi’s inauguration speech:“It is a historic day; not only dream of Atal ji realised but also decades-long wait of people of Himachal is over. It will be a lifeline for Leh-Ladakh.”“Atal tunnel will give new strength to India’s border infrastructure. It is an example of world-class border connectivity. There have been demands to improve border infrastructure but for a long time, such projects either couldn’t get out of the planning stage or got stuck midway.”“Atal Bihari Vajpayee laid the foundation of approach road for this tunnel, but after his government, this work was all but forgotten. It was accelerated after 2014. In just six years, we completed the work of 26 years.” “Connectivity has a direct connection with development. Connectivity in border areas is directly related to security issues.”“Experts say if the tunnel was constructed with the pace it was being built at that time, it would probably be completed in 2040. We completed the work in just six years.”“I want the ministry of external affairs to invite some universities for case studies on this tunnel.

The group includes residents of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, and Thane in the age group of 12 to 65 years.The group has requested the Maharashtra tourism development corporation (MTDC) for developing a waterfall tourism policy including waste management at these sites.“Areas, where we have conducted cleanups, are all within a two-hour drive from the city and accessible to Mumbaikars. Though, they are famous picnic spots and weekend getaways, the trash left behind after such outings is a major problem,” said Dharmesh Barai, head coordinator, Environment Life.“Villagers are often harmed by broken glass bottles and so are animals, which, while grazing, eat up the garbage. The local pristine environment around these waterfalls turns into garbage dumpsites,” added Barai.Environment Life began its waterfall cleanup drive on October 2, 2016, across six waterfalls - Pandavkada (in Kharghar), Zenith (Khopoli), Aanandvadi, Jummapatti, and Tapalwadi (in Neral), and Chichoti (in Vasai), collecting 1,420 kg trash in 71 bags. On December 18, 2016, they removed 1,000 kg of trash from Kondeshwar waterfall in Badlapur. Their highest collection was during their third drive at Bhivpuri waterfall at Karjat, where 2,500 kg of trash was collected in 120 bags.Also Read: Human-wildlife conflict: Committee set up to process victims’ claims in Chandigarh“Thereafter, the drive continued during the monsoon months when maximum trash accumulation took place,” said Barai. Last year, the group collected 1,050 kg trash from Vadap waterfall in Karjat and another 220kg in August from Aadai waterfall in Panvel in October.Overall, a total of 502 bags of garbage has been collected over the past 4 years and waste segregated with the help from local municipal bodies and volunteers.“Useful materials were shared for reuse while remaining waste was sent to landfills,” said Barai. What’s more, the group has now taken on mangrove patches near TS Chanakya wetlands in Navi Mumbai where they have so far removed 1,800 kg of waste with help from volunteers, school students, and NMMC officials.Also Read: Delhi to launch massive anti-air pollution campaign from Oct 5: Gopal RaiBabasaheb Rajale, deputy municipal commissioner (solid waste management), NMMC said, “With the perspective of Swachh Bharat, we will support any cleanup efforts that are genuinely focused towards improving environmental conditions around us. From supporting volunteers by providing them with vehicles, machinery, equipment and personnel to being physically present on-site, we will ensure Navi Mumbai and surrounding areas are declared the cleanest not only in Maharashtra but across India.”Meanwhile, Environment Life’s submissions to MTDC for the waterfall tourism policy include ideas like putting up signboards, information and instruction boards to describe the importance of a particular waterfall, toilets and changing room facilities, dustbins, monitoring, ban on liquor consumption, parking facilities and gate fee collection at every waterfall.“The money can be used for cleanliness and infrastructure development for a better tourism experience. Local villagers will get employment opportunities and will ensure that such areas remain protected during the off season as well,” said Barai.Ashutosh Salil, managing director, MTDC said, “The group’s efforts are absolutely commendable and we welcome their suggestion for waste management at all tourism places. We will have to start working closely with the local bodies, mostly gram panchayats, where ever these waterfalls are located for waste management.”A member of MTDC’s directorate said they would consider the suggestions received and the feasibility of establishing a waterfall cleanliness policy for Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-group-clears-10-500-kg-trash-from-waterfalls-pitches-for-a-policy/story-optYVDQOr0VZwfacYrtbQN.html

The 9.02 km long tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley, ensuring connectivity throughout the year. The valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall.        In a statement, the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) said it has contributed to the mega project by supplying more than 9,000 tonnes of steel. Two-thirds of the total 15,000 tonnes of steel used in the project has been supplied by SAIL, it said.         Out of the 9,000 tonnes, 6,500 tonnes was TMT, 1,500 tonnes structurals and 1,000 tonnes plates for fabricating beams, besides a small quantity of GP/GC sheets for constructing stations and control rooms.        “The tunnel will be of great significance to the locals as well as for strategic movements. It will boost connectivity of the Spiti Valley. This is an achievement considering the very challenging conditions of the construction site and weather,” Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was quoted as saying in the statement.          SAIL Chairman Anil Kumar Chaudhary said, “It is a proud moment for the company to have partnered in such an important project for strengthening India. As India moves forward in becoming Atmanirbhar, SAIL will participate in producing the strong steel needed to fuel every infrastructural need of the nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supplied-9-000-tonnes-of-steel-for-atal-tunnel-sail/story-VxWd5ttVXPoED3vryEVQxM.html

03-10-2020||India||PM Modi questions previous regimes over Ladakh’s Daulat Beg Oldi, says they compromised on security||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday took a jibe at the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government for its lack of focus on the development of border infrastructure and compromising with the country’s security, as he especially mentioned the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh, where India is witnessing a border stand-off with China.PM Modi said, without naming the Congress party, during the inauguration of Atal Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh, that the previous government must explain the reason the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip remained closed for nearly 50 years. He inaugurated the 9.02km long Atal Tunnel, which will connect Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley in the state.“Many other important projects were treated in the same way as Atal Tunnel. The strategically important Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh remained closed for 40–45 years. I do not want to go into details about the helplessness and the pressure behind it,” Modi said adding that the country had seen a phase in which strengthening of border infrastructure was deliberately delayed. Inaugurating the spectacular #AtalTunnel. https://t.co/Npiw0qSO5AThe Prime Minister also asked why the previous government lacked the political will to open the airstrip at the Daulat Beg Oldi as he said his government is now concentrating on border development. “Security of the country is of prime importance for the Union government and the creation of border infrastructure is one of its top priorities. There was nothing more important for us than protecting the country. But the country has also seen a period when the defence interests of the country were compromised,” Modi said.“Connectivity has a direct connection with the development and economic progress of the people. We also know that connectivity in border areas is directly related to security-related issues of the country. The Union government is giving utmost emphasis on the development of border infrastructure and its benefits are being extended to the common people as well as our armed forces personnel,” PM Modi said.He also said that the previous governments had deliberately delayed the construction of Atal Tunnel. He also pointed out that if the work had continued at the same pace on the project, it would have been completed in 2040.“We completed the work in just six years that would have taken 26 years. Atal ji laid the foundation stone of the approach road of this tunnel in 2002. Till 2013-2014, progress was made only on 1,300 meters of this tunnel. After 2014, the project progressed with unprecedented pace,” PM said.‘Realised a dream’Prime Minister Modi said the Atal Tunnel has not only realised Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s dream but has also ended the decades-long wait of the people of Himachal Pradesh.The Prime Minister was accompanied by defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat, chief minister Jairam Thakur, Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Singh Thakur and the Border Road Organisation’s director general Lt Gen Harpal Singh at the inauguration ceremony.The tunnel, which the Prime Minister said will also become the lifeline for Leh-Ladakh, will remain open throughout the year as opposed to the valley being cut off for about six months every year amid heavy snowfall.The strategically important tunnel will also strengthen the country’s border infrastructure, Modi emphasised. “Be it bridges, tunnels, or road construction, development of border infrastructure will not only benefit the common man but also help the military,” he said.Hailing the Make in India move, Modi said big reforms have been introduced to ensure modern weapons are produced in the country. After a long wait, the chief of defence staff is now part of the system. According to the requirements of the Indian Army, better coordination has been established in both procurement and production, Modi added.The Prime Minister also pointed out that work on another bridge Kosi Mahasetu, the foundation of which was laid by Vajpayee in Bihar, has been expedited since 2014 as the Modi government came into power.Cutting travel timeThe Rs 3300 crore-Atal Tunnel, named after former prime minister, reduces the road distance by 46km between Manali and Leh and the travel time by about four to five hours. The tunnel has been built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas at an altitude of 3,000 metres from the mean sea level.The single tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres is horse-shoe shaped and has been designed for a traffic density of 3,000 cars per day and 1,500 trucks per day with a maximum speed of 80 km/hr, according to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office.Jairam Thakur said on Friday that around 200 people were expected to attend the event in Manali. The PMO said Modi will participate in public functions at Sissu in Lahaul Spiti and at Solang Valley after attending the inauguration function at South Portal, Manali.Rajnath Singh had on Friday inspected the Atal Tunnel along with chief minister Thakur and Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-inaugurates-9-02km-atal-tunnel-connecting-manali-to-lahaul-spiti-valley/story-LcX6JyHvq5ADJHibvEjDqJ.html

Rolling Stone magazine, which described the song as “an anthem for the end of the Cold War” said the “song’s sentiments of hope and peace, ... (The world is closing in/Did you ever think/That we could be so close/Like brothers?),... and an accompanying video... that employed footage of the construction and tearing down of the Berlin Wall led to it being inextricably linked to the end of the Cold War.” The track has been endorsed by Klaus Meine, the lead singer of Scorpions and one of the writers of the song that was a worldwide hit in 1991 in the times of perestroika and glasnost, and went on to sell 14 million copies. Lindner said Meine told him the new version gave him (Meine) goosebumps. Lindner, an accomplished musician who plays instruments such as the guitar, piano and flute and has released several albums, said he opted to record an Indian version of Wind Of Change, an “unofficial anthem of freedom, hope and change”, to mark German Unity Day instead of organising a webinar or digital workshop. “On this historic day, German reunification was finalised. The Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War came to an end. Commemorating the 30th anniversary of German reunification at a time when we are facing the coronavirus pandemic presented its own challenge. We didn’t want just another webinar. We wanted a different, innovative approach,” he said. ALSO WATCH | German Unity Day: Envoy Walter Lindner records new version of ‘Wind Of Change’ Technology played a key part in the venture – singer Chetan Dominic Awasthi recorded his vocals at home in Noida, sarod, tabla and sitar players Pandit Vikash Maharaj, Prabhash Maharaj and Abhishek Maharaj recorded their parts in Varanasi while drummer Peter Retzlaff sent in his part from New York – and the envoy put everything together in his well-equipped home studio. Besides the drums and the Indian instruments featured in the song, Lindner played all other instruments. The song also features on Lindner’s new CD , A Journey’s Songbook, which has several Indian musicians and is a mix of rock, soul, jazz and Indian music. Lindner said he chose Wind Of Change because the song gives a “glimpse of hope – that there are better days, a better future is possible, that change is possible, be it from Covid or disasters in the world”. The envoy spoke to Klaus Meine, whom he has since befriended, to get the rights for the song. Lindner said Meine told him an Indian version would be a “wonderful idea because the song is about building bridges across cultures”. The video for the track features footage of the Scorpions, and has an endorsement from Meine, who says: “Today, we’re building bridges across borders and cultures for a better and more peaceful world.” Lindner said he hopes the people of India too will take away a message of hope. “If you’re in the corona situation and depressed, and at home and then you crave for getting out, look at this and get some ray of hope. Whatever changes you want in your life and in your surroundings, it can happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/german-envoy-s-wind-of-change-redux-with-a-little-help-from-india/story-0D5FjDMPBsTHsPGd0tESTL.html

03-10-2020||India||Hathras gangrape: Senior police officials suspended||The Uttar Pradesh government suspended senior police officials in Hathras district on Friday and ordered narco-analysis tests for everyone involved in the case as pressure mounted over blocking media access to the family of a 19-year-old Dalit woman, whose brutal gang rape and murder has shocked the nation. The government, in an order on Friday evening, suspended Hathras superintendent of police Vikrant Vir, deputy superintendent of police Ram Shabd, police inspector in-charge Dinesh Kumar Verma, senior sub- inspector Jagveer Singh and head constable Mahesh Pal.The district police came under criticism, first for an alleged delay in responding to the woman and her family’s complaint, cremating her body in the middle of the night without the family’s consent, then for throwing a cordon of police officers around the village that stopped the entry of all journalists, and now for seizing the phones of the victim’s family members -- although it is likely that instructions for many of these came from Lucknow. The suspensions were ordered on the basis of recommendations by a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT), which questioned the victim’s family members on Thursday. “The SIT formed in the Hathras case submitted its preliminary report to the state government today,” read the government press note.It said that Vir was suspended for alleged negligence and lax supervision of the case. He was replaced with Shamli SP Vineet Jaiswal. “Narco and polygraph tests should be conducted on the accused, complainant and police officials,” the note added. Former Uttar Pradesh DGP, Brijlal said: “the state government orders narco-analysis tests in criminal cases to know if the complainants and the accused are giving a correct version of in the incident concerned.”Vikrant Vir did not respond calls despite repeated attempts.The SIT -- comprising home secretary Bhagwan Swaroop, deputy inspector general of police Chandra Prakash and commandant of the Agra provincial armed constabulary Poonam -- was constituted on September 30. The order came after two chaotic days when police banned the entry of “outsiders” to the village, triggering allegations that it had put the Dalit woman’s family under surveillance. On Friday morning, a teenager who said he was a cousin of the victim, approached journalists waiting at the police barricades – set up roughly 2km from the village – and alleged that the administration locked in the family, seized their mobile phones and even hit the victim’s father. “They have seized our mobile phones and won’t allow us to meet the media. All we want is speak to journalists about the pressure we are under,” he said. The police denied the charges, and pointed out that Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code – which prohibits the assembly of four or more people – was clamped in the area. The police said the SIT probe was the reason for the restrictions. “The three-member SIT is conducting the probe in the village. Till then, entry of the media is to remain restricted. We are also maintaining law and order. Hence, no political delegations and individuals are allowed inside the village,” said additional superintendent of police (ASP) Prakash Kumar in the afternoon.The 19-year-old woman, who belongs to the Valmiki caste, was brutally attacked and gang-raped on September 14, and rushed to a hospital in Aligarh. Eight days later, on September 22, she recorded her statement, where she said she was raped and named the four accused. Her mother’s statement echoed the claims.As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29, sparking nationwide protests. Later that evening, the police drove the family and the victim’s body back to the Hathras village but proceeded to cremate the body without the consent of the parents. At 2.30am on September 30, the policemen cremated her body even as the family alleged they were restricted from even getting a final glimpse of their daughter. Since then, protests against the crime have swept the nation and prompted several Opposition leaders to try and visit the village – but have all been thwarted by the state police. Citing forensic reports, the police have denied that the woman was raped but experts have pointed to lapses in procedure during the medical examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gangrape-senior-police-officials-suspended/story-hFY58EB9vFdg0aJhzbPNtJ.html

Taking a cue from his messages, we should follow the COVID-19 preventive measures like physical distancing (do gaz ki doori), use of masks at public places and offices, maintaining hand hygiene as these are most effective ways to keep this dreadful virus at bay,” he said.

03-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The death toll from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crossed 100,000 on Friday. In some ways, this is just a number, and perhaps an underestimate at that. It’s a truth universally acknowledged that every country in the world has undercounted the number of dead from the viral pandemic – not deliberately all the time, but simply because it is tough to keep count. India is no exception – Dispatch 158, on September 15, estimated (based on an assumption on the infection fatality rate) that India, at the time of that writing, had seen between 110,000 and 131,500 deaths, significantly higher than the 80,000 that were officially recorded. Still, 100,000 is a milestone even if not a happy one. India is now the third country in the world, after the US and Brazil, to have deaths in the six-digits.Perhaps because of India’s vast population, or our almost automatic acceptance of fatalism, we find it easy to anonymise deaths and reduce them to mere numbers. We are inured to headlines such as “45 dead in boat accident” or “Floods claim 140 lives”. These headlines are made up, but they will likely be familiar to most people. Sometimes we stop and read a piece that’s extremely tragic or horrific, but then we move on (as, indeed, many believe that we should).The deaths of famous people are different – because suddenly, the death is no longer a mere number. It is a person, a famous person, an artist or a singer who perhaps touches our lives every day (as many do long after they are gone). These are extraordinary people, who lived extraordinary lives. But all lives, even ordinary ones, are extraordinary in their own way – and not just to the family and friends of the deceased. Each of the 100,000 is a life lost – and each (it’s important to acknowledge this because of our fatalism) could have been saved. Old and young, men and women, the fit and the not-so, rich and poor, famous and unknown – the virus has killed over 100,000 people in the country (India’s death toll on Friday night was 100,896). Policemen (and policewomen), doctors, politicians, teachers, farmers, couriers, pensioners, businesspeople, students, cab drivers, journalists, priests – the virus has taken a toll on people from every walk of life. And it will continue to.Among infectious diseases, tuberculosis and respiratory infections still kill more in India, as do many so-called lifestyle ailments such as diabetes, but these comparisons do nothing to reduce the grimness of the Covid-19 death toll. Since September 5 (and till October 1), India has recorded fewer than 1,000 deaths on only three days. The current seven-day average of daily cases in India is around 80,000; at the current case fatality rate of 1.5%, this will translate into 1,200 deaths a day in the next few weeks. In effect, every day that sees the addition of 80,000 cases is actually foretelling 1,200 deaths. This is one of the three numbers India’s health administrators need to focus on – instead, there’s a lot of talk of the recovery rate (which does not make sense because if the case fatality rate is only 1.5%, we can expect 98.5% of those infected to recover over time). The two other metrics the administrators need to keep an eye on are: the number of tests (and within that, the number of RT-PCR tests); and the number of active cases.India crossed 50,000 deaths (50,084) on August 15, when it had 2.5 million cases (2,589,208). It crossed 100,000 deaths on October 2, when it had 6.5 million cases. It has added roughly 50% of the deaths it has seen to date in the same time that it has added around 62% of the cases. In the same period, the world has added 38% of the cases it has seen to date, and 24% of deaths.An even better comparison would be to see the proportion of cases the world has added in the time it has seen roughly half the deaths to date. It crossed 500,000 deaths on June 25, when it had 9.6 million cases. It crossed a million deaths on Tuesday (by which time the number of cases had grown to 33.38 million). In effect, world had added 70% of the cases to date in the same period in which it added half the deaths to date.In September, India added 33,273 deaths (33.7% of its deaths till September 30) and 2.6 million cases (41.56% of its cases), for a case fatality rate of 1.28%. In the same period, the US added 1.2 million cases (16.25% of its cases till September 30) and 23,917 deaths (11.3% of its deaths) to its tally for a September case fatality rate of around 2%.The good news for India: the case fatality rate of 1.28% is not very far from the 1% the government wants to touch. The bad news: September saw one of every three deaths from Covid-19 the country has seen so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-EJAZPzAg11SrMwwTLLMGvI.html

The journalists on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti gathered to protest against comments made by chief minister Deb during the foundation-stone laying ceremony of a special economic zone in South Tripura on September 11 said that he will not forgive some newspapers for creating confusion regarding the state’s handling of the pandemic.“Some newspapers are trying to confuse people....History will not forgive them, people of Tripura will not forgive them and I Biplab Deb will not forgive them. I do whatever I say, history is testimony to that,” Deb had said, according to news agency PTI. Following this incident journalists from Tripura had served three days notice to the chief minister asking him to withdraw his statement. CM Deb said that he did not mean to threaten anyone through his statement. The journalists said that they will stick to their movement and send representatives seeking intervention from the Prime Minister, Home minister and Press Council of India.The president of Agartala Press Club Subal Kumar Dey said, “We work on behalf of the people. But freedom of expression of the media has been trampled in the past 30 months. The officials are not allowed to speak to the media, journalists are threatened and assaulted in different parts of the state.”Dey said that the movement will continue unless the chief minister withdraws his statement. He further added, “We demand that the chief minister withdraws his statement, give justice to assaulted mediapersons or else our movement will continue.”(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-journalists-wear-black-badges-to-protest-against-cm-s-threat-over-reporting-on-state-s-covid-19-situation/story-wNvHshUBTruSfTBxqt9mMJ.html
03-10-2020||India||Like in Sushant Rajput case: Bihar police gets FIR request from actor Akshat Utkarsh’s family||Actor Akshat Utkarsh’s family has filed a complaint with the Bihar police to seek a FIR and a probe into the actor’s death on Sunday night. Mumbai police had indicated that the actor was depressed due to lack of work and had died by suicide.His family in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, however, has rejected this conclusion and alleged that Akshat Utkarsh had been murdered.Utkarsh was found hanging at his rented accommodation at Andheri West in Mumbai on Sunday night. He had worked in some TV serials and advertisements. He had recently signed a Bhojpuri film ‘Litti-Chokha’.Muzaffarpur city deputy superintendent of police Ram Naresh Paswan confirmed that the actor’s family had submitted a formal complaint. But the police haven’t acted on the request. Paswan said they are awaiting directions from senior officials on how to proceed.It is unusual for the police in one state to try to investigate a crime that primarily relates to another state.But the Bihar police had departed from this standard practice in August this year when it registered a FIR for abetment to suicide, dishonestly inducing delivery of property and breach of trust in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in Mumbai on a complaint from his father KK Singh.This FIR was the starting point for the investigation by three federal agencies; Central Bureau of Investigation, the Enforcement Directorate and the Narcotics Control Bureau.Akshat Utkarsh’s family in Muzaffarpur wants the Bihar police to apply the same principles and file the FIR.In the complaint handed over to the police on Thursday, the family has named three suspects including his flatmate Shikha Rajput and his society secretary Kishore Thakkar, said police on Friday. The family accused the three of hatching a conspiracy to kill Utkarsh.The Muzaffarpur police are yet to lodge the FIR against the accused, Utkarsh’s uncle Vikrant Kishore complained. He said if police doesn’t take appropriate action, the family will stage a protest outside Muzzafarpur’s Town police station.The family said has contested the Mumbai police finding that Utkarsh’s family said Akshat Utkarsh had no reason to face financial troubles since they would wire him money whenever he needed.His father Vijayant Kishore said his son had called him around 8.30pm on September 27 and said he wanted to tell him something. However, he did not share anything and said he would tell the same on Monday. Senior police inspector Someshwar Kamte of Amboli police station had earlier said Utkarsh lived with his girlfriend who had found his body.According to his roommate’s statement, Akshat was behaving as usual on Sunday evening and they as usual chatted about various things and then had dinner together before going to sleep. “At around 11.30 pm when she woke up to use the washroom, she found Akshat dead in his room, after which she immediately called the police,” an officer from Amboli police station had said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-in-sushant-rajput-case-bihar-police-gets-fir-request-from-actor-akshat-utkarsh-s-family/story-Hm79vkD7f28wreXzyzCtGO.html
03-10-2020||India||1 vaccine may have reached initial efficacy test||The first clues of whether a Covid-19 vaccine is effective in preventing infections among people may have already come in, a private agency tracking the process and scientific research has projected, pointing to protocols and enrolment data from American pharma company Pfizer.The disclosure of efficacy data is being closely watched, particularly in the context of the presidential election in United States where president Donald Trump has on several occasions assured that a vaccine will be approved before the November 3 polling. Pfizer’s is among half a dozen experimental vaccines being tested in large scale (Phase 3) human trials and, according to science informatics and analytics company Airfinity, it is projected to have had enough Covid-19 cases in the trial for its first interim analysis. Covid-19: What you need to know todayAn interim analysis is when a trial reaches a preset threshold of infections – 32 in the case of Pfizer’s first of four – for researchers to review. If no fewer than 76.9% (26 out of the 32) of the infections are among those who got a placebo, the vaccine will have shown to be effective in preventing the disease as per the first analysis yardstick. Watch: How Covid-19 has gripped India’s urban centres Airfinity’s projections suggest Pfizer would have hit the 32 cases threshold on September 27. “To calculate these projected dates, we have reviewed all clinical trial data and protocols received so far, collected enrolment rates for the leading candidates as well as the Covid-19 attack rate at the locations where they are running their trials. We then use a code to estimate how long it will take to reach the required number of Covid-19 cases in the trial using all this information,” an Airfinity analyst told HT. Also Read: Chronic respiratory illnesses, heart diseases among top three causes of death in India: 2017 dataPfizer’s chief executive Albert Bourla has in recent appearances said the company expects “conclusive” efficacy data to come in by October – a position experts have been wary of. On September 26, a group of 60 scientists and public health experts from top American institutions wrote an open letter to Pfizer expressing their apprehensions and urging Bourla to not apply for regulatory clearance till all safety standards have been met. “Pfizer’s choice of 32 events is the lowest of all seen so far and has been widely criticised... there seems to be concern within Pfizer itself as the CEO has written out a company-wide email following the presidential election debate this week,” said the Airfinity analyst, adding that Pfizer’s choice of “four interim analyses in one phase III trial is unheard of in any vaccine trial”. In the e-mail to staff, Bourla said the company will not heed to political pressure and that the references to vaccine development process in the presidential debate was “disappointing”.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 toll reaches 100,000+The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which will take the final regulatory decision, is scheduled to meet on October 22 to review possible licensing and approvals for Covid-19 vaccine candidates, though it is unlikely to discuss any specific candidates, according to its meeting schedule.According to Airfinity’s projections, the next vaccine candidate to reach interim analysis threshold is Sinovac’s inactivated virus double-dose vaccine (October 22, Moderna’s mRNA-based double-dose candidate (October 25), and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s adenovirus vector single-dose candidate (November 24). Oxford-AstraZeneca is also experimenting with double dose formulations which will take longer for the data. Moderna is US-based while Oxford and AstraZeneca are from the United Kingdom.Also Read: Lonza confident of 2020 target for Moderna Covid-19 vaccine supplyApart from these, US’s Johnson & Johnson, Russia’s Gamaleya institute and China’s Sinopharm and CanSino have the most watched vaccine candidates.

Among these, five have been given emergency authorisation for use among public or in some groups of people by Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-vaccine-may-have-reached-initial-efficacy-test/story-38HjNSTs5TswZf0UBPMNBJ.html
03-10-2020||India||Chronic respiratory illnesses, heart diseases among top three causes of death in India: 2017 data||Heart diseases, chronic respiratory illnesses and strokes are the top three causes of death in India, together accounting for over 3 million deaths in the country in 2017, the last year for when all-cause mortality data is available. This is roughly 30 times of the 100,000 deaths that have been recorded in India due to Covid-19 in the less than seven months that the viral illness began spreading and claiming lives. For the last 28 days, at least 1,000 people have died every day – a number that has been described as alarming. Taking known infections into account, the mortality rate (or the case fatality rate) comes to 1.56%.“Covid-19 shouldn’t be a cause of worry as the death rate for India has been constantly dropping, and my assessment is that it will drop further. In absolute numbers it may sound big that one lakh people have died but we have to also look at our country’s population, and the number of people who got infected,” said Dr NK Mehra, former head, transplant, immunology and immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Science, Delhi.  Also Read: Gurugram: New Covid-19 cases show decline of 23% in a week“In India, the severity of infection is also low because our immunity levels are better modulated to fight off any infections as compared to Europeans and Americans. In fact, other viruses kill more. However, the infectivity rate of this virus is quite high so infections could go up in future. Deaths will remain low,” he added. One of the key ways Covid-19 turns severe is when it comes an intense lower respiratory tract infection, although researchers say the most fatalities may be a result of a cytokine storm (when the immune system begins attacking organs). According to the Global Burden of Disease report published in The Lancet Global Health last year, data from 2017 (the latest period it has been available for), shows respiratory illnesses killed 0.34 million that year – nearly three-and-a-half times of the Covid toll seen till now.WATCH | Covid update: Donald Trump test positive; Mumbai slums infection; Kerala casesAlso Read: Maharashtra government to procure Covid-19 medicines, test kits worth Rs 634 croreIn terms of diseases with high case fatality rate in India are usually those with a CFR of 1% or above. Of the 11 such diseases, as documented in the National Health Profile 2019, at least eight diseases are with CFR that ranges from 100% to 2%. Covid-19’s CFR is around 1.5%. Top infectious diseases with high CFR are rabies (100%), Japanese encephalitis (11%), influenza (A) H1N1 (7%), acute encephalitis syndrome (6%), encephalitis (5%), meningococcal meningitis (4%), tetanus neonatal (4%), diphtheria (2%), and viral meningitis, cholera and tetanus other than neonatal all three reporting 1% CFR. “Covid-19 mortality rate of course needs to come below 1%, that goes without saying, as mortality is one of the factors that determine impact of disease. But, if you ask me, our bigger concern should be post-Covid complications, also called long Covid, because of the structural damage it does to the lungs and the brain. It affects the quality of life in long-term, and needs our focus,” said Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research. Also Read: Death data highlights need to check young-old transmissionICMR recently launched National Covid-19 Registry in six regions from across the country to document long-term effects of the viral disease. Doctors treating Covid-19 patients also say that the number of deaths is dropping. But with winter setting in, Covid-19 could pose a bigger problem. “We have managed to keep things very much under control so far but there is evidence to suggest that pneumonia progresses differently during summers and winters. In winters, it becomes more severe, which is why coming months are going to be a challenge in terms of stopping Covid-19 numbers from rising,” said Dr VK Paul, chairman, one of the government empowered groups, to manage Covid-19 situation in the country, in a recent Covid-19 briefing. “People need to be extra careful in coming days, with absolutely no scope for prevention fatigue. There is no other option but to adopt Covid-19 safe behavior such as wearing a mask, maintaining hand hygiene, and observing social distancing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chronic-illnesses-are-still-the-biggest-killers-2017-data/story-P0Ux8wZX0nKeGKymrNSzCJ.html
03-10-2020||India||Covid-19 death data highlights need to check young-old transmission||At least 88% of Covid-19 fatalities in India are in people above the age of 45 – with those above 60 accounting for most of the deaths among these – but this age band accounts for less than half (40%) of infections, data from the Union health ministry showed. The data suggests that Indians must take precautions to ensure its younger population, which appears to be more prone to being infected, does not pass it on to older people, who have higher odds of succumbing. This trend was borne out by data of deaths classified by age and pre-existing illnesses, which is also a known factor that raises the likelihood of fatalities (as does being male). The data corresponded to the first 90,000 fatalities in India.“What we need to understand about this virus is that it is highly contagious and that everyone is equally exposed to it. It may seem like those who are more likely to be mobile are the ones most affected but we are seeing that even if one family member is infected and brings the infection home then all family members are likely to contract the infection,” says Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.At least 70% of all people who have died have had at least one co-morbidity, according to morbidity statistics from the Union government. Men make up for a clear majority of the dead at 70%.Infection statistics show a markedly different trend: at least 60% of all Covid-19 infections in India have been among people below the age of 45 years, and at least half of the infected people have been between the ages of 18 and 44. Pre-existing diseases raising the risk of severe or fatal Covid-19 include hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, asthma, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low immunity, malignancy, bronchitis and chronic neuromuscular disease. Hypertension and diabetes are the two most common comorbidities that lead to the disease progressing to severe levels among Covid-19 patients. Experts, however, said they expect a clearer picture about the fatality trends once states become better in terms of surveillance concerning Covid-19 cases. “Sometimes during an outbreak, data surveillance takes time to pick up at some places. It is normal but gains momentum with experience as the outbreak progresses. It needs to be monitored carefully though,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology division, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-data-highlights-need-to-check-young-old-transmission/story-XgCoD3gGM9oYck1YXgi2LP.html
03-10-2020||India||Govt’s ‘behavioural change’ campaign to beat festive rush||The Narendra Modi government plans to launch as early as next week, a massive campaign to urge people to be cautious about their behaviour in the upcoming festive season that will see more social gatherings and outdoor activities amid the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. The campaign, according to officials involved in the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity, is likely to start from October 7, continue for at least three months, and cover the entire festive season including the New Year celebrations. The new campaign, which stresses on a change in behaviour, comes days after the government announced the conditional re-opening of schools and multiplexes from late October and also allowed open-air social and religious events to be held. Union home minister Amit Shah held a meeting on September 28; attendees included Cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba, Niti Ayog’s member health Dr VK Paul, secretaries of home affairs, health, information and broadcasting, rural development and panchayati raj . According to people familiar with the proceedings who spoke on condition of anonymity Shah suggested that as people in large numbers will participate in the festivals, there is a possibility that the gains achieved in controlling the pandemic might be lost and that there is need for a campaign to remind people that they should be careful . Shah added that to be effective, the campaign needs to be simple, such as the PM’s coinage of “do gaz ki doori” which a distance of two gaz. That’s around 6 feet. Shah, the people added, said that campaigns that appeal to bureaucrats, might not be attractive for common people and suggested that the campaign’s taglines include key phrases such as Covid, suraksha (protection) and do gaz ki doori. “It has been decided to tap places such as bank branches, anganwadi centres and post offices to spread the word around. Shah asked VK Paul to talk to hospital groups to support the campaign,” said one of the officials present at the meeting. A second top official present in the meeting said, “it is absolutely essential to launch such a campaign as we have to take our battle against Covid to the next level. And already people are lowering their guard which is a dangerous thing to do now.”A third official said that the cabinet secretary has since the meeting held two follow-up meetings,with government of India secretaries and chief secretaries of the state, to focus on the campaign. Information and broadcasting secretary Amit Khare has been entrusted with finalising the slogans for the campaigns, the people said. The government has also indicated that there will be special emphasis on wearing masks in the campaign. Dr VK Paul, member of Niti Aayog and one of the key advisors to Modi on Covid, said in a press conference that the coming festive season will be all about masks— mask wali chhath, mask wali eid, mask wala dussehra aur mask wali diwali. “This is all for our own good; and needs to be promoted big time. There is scientific basis to it. We don’t have to gather in groups; large gatherings must be totally avoided; and no big congregations should be allowed. Community heads should ensure and appeal that festivals should be celebrated with caution; not in large groups but smaller groups. Large gathering, especially in market places, could be detrimental, so we have to be careful,” said Paul, during the government’s weekly Covid-19 media briefing on Tuesday.Experts agreed that public awareness campaign is crucial. “Wearing a mask, and wearing it properly, is as good as vaccine against Covid-19. It also helps reduce the viral load that may go in when you breathe in, which is why it’s essential to wear a mask,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-s-behavioural-change-campaign-to-beat-festive-rush/story-VjtE15jgv82BEz58N6ROJJ.html
03-10-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 toll surpasses 100,000||The death toll from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India surpassed the 100,000 mark on Friday, a grim milestone that comes exactly seven months from the day the first batch of cases were reported in the country.India became the third country in the world to cross this landmark – only the United States (212,000 deaths) and Brazil (144,000 dead) have reported more fatalities – but does so with a significantly better mortality rate than nearly all other countries that have seen large outbreaks. India’s case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of death to the number of confirmed cases – stands at 1.56%, which is not only half of the global average (2.98%), but also better than the comparable rates in the US (2.84%) and Brazil (2.99%).Also Read: 1 vaccine may have reached initial efficacy testHowever, since the first week of September, daily deaths in India have been outstripping those in any country in the world. On average, 1,065 people have died every day over the past week in the country, against 755 average daily deaths in the US and 713 in Brazil in the same period. This has made India the biggest contributor to the global death tally — one in every five fatalities (19%) in the world in the past week has come from India. The first death due to Covid-19 was reported on March 12 in Karnataka, with the 100,000th fatality coming 204 days later. If India’s fatalities are divided into four phases of 25,000 deaths each, each has become shorter than the one preceding one. While the first 25,000 deaths took 127 days (on July 16), India crossed the 50,000 mark only 30 days later (on August 15). Deaths crossed the 75,000 mark another 25 days later on September 9, with the latest 25,000 fatalities coming in just 23 days.Also Read: Death data highlights need to check young-old transmissionThe seven-day average of fatalities in India has been over the 1,000-mark for the past 28 days, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. At its peak (so far), this number touched 1,166 for the week ending September 19. To be sure, this has dropped slightly over the past few days and is 1,069 as on Friday. Only the US, where the trajectory touched 2,300 deaths a day for the week ending April 21, has seen more people die this consistently. Also Read: Gurugram: New Covid-19 cases show decline of 23% in a weekAs of Friday night, of the 6.47 million people infected in the country, 100,896 have lost their lives and over 5.42 million have recovered. The death toll is, however, expected to keep rising as the country is still adding 81,431 new cases a day on average, and of those around 1.5% (based on India’s CFR) will succumb to the disease.WATCH | Covid update: Donald Trump test positive; Mumbai slums infection; Kerala casesGovernment experts have credited India’s relatively better Covid-19 mortality rate to a series of factors such as the experience in dealing with other lung diseases such as tuberculosis, and early interventions in terms of the nationwide lockdown. “These things were crucial in identifying the infected, and isolating them as per requirement very early on in the disease stage,” said Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, India Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Also Read: Maharashtra government to procure Covid-19 medicines, test kits worth ₹634 croreIndependent experts said the country’s relatively younger population may have also helped in reducing mortality. “Fewer people dying in India of Covid is not surprising as the severity of infection is low in the country, which among other factors can be attributed to better immunity status to fight any infections, and also relatively younger population with fewer comorbidities,” said Dr NK Mehra, former head, transplant, immunology and immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The fact that the outbreak in India started relatively later than it did in the western world may have also worked to India’s advantage on the CFR front. This becomes particularly evident because as the disease has progressed, scientists and doctors have learnt to fight and treat it better. As the result, the CFR has been improving, both in India and the rest of the world. India’s CFR has halved since the start of July – it was 3% on July 1.“We obviously know the disease far better now, and manage to save most of the hospitalised patients. The mortality rate is under 2%, which is decent if you compare with other countries,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The share of deaths among the states, however, has largely been uneven, with Maharashtra (37,480 deaths till Friday) accounting for 37% of all fatalities in the country. It is followed by Tamil Nadu with 9,653 deaths and Karnataka with 9,119 people killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-toll-100-000/story-sNGsNLCA2MjbpMfjDdFEDI.html
03-10-2020||India||Hill cutting for Char Dham road on in full swing: SC panel chief||Ravi Chopra, chairperson of the Supreme Court appointed high-powered committee (HPC) has written a letter to the central government pointing out that construction of the Char Dham road project is proceeding in violation of the apex court order of September 8. In the letter addressed to the secretary of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on September 28, Chopra wrote that “hill cutting and destruction of forests are now in full swing in all ongoing projects in gross violation of the SC’s order”. HT has reviewed the contents of the letter. On September 8, Supreme Court ruled that the width of the road should not exceed the 5.5 metres that the Union road transport and highways ministry specified in 2018 for under-construction roads in mountainous terrain. It referred to the fragility of the terrain and impact of the road width on the Himalayan ecosystem while issuing the order. The road being constructed is of width between seven and 11 meters. “I am shocked to see reports in various newspapers…that MoRTH has informed Government of Uttarakhand that the intermediate lane design will only be used for the stretches where work has not begun as yet and that work areas where (illegal) hill cutting has been done and where plantation and other mitigation measures have to be taken as per the Court’s order September 8, 2020, will continue on the basis of the old Double Lane + Paved Shoulder. The same was also confirmed to me on the phone by the Pariyojana Chief Engineer, in-charge of MoRTH’s regional office, Mr. VS Khaira,” Chopra added in the letter, which, if true, means that the highways ministry itself is flouting the court’s order. The Char Dham road connects the pilgrimage centres of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath. The government’s position has also been that because it is in a border area abutting China, the road needs to be able to facilitate the transport of military vehicles to border areas. Chopra said that “hill cutting and destruction of forests are now in full swing in all the ongoing projects. This is in gross violation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s order and the recommendations of the HPC, which are accepted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Forest felling in sensitive areas like the Kund forests along NH-109 is very shocking and disturbing since it may destabilize the slope in near future.” The chairperson has asked the central government to make its stand clear. VS Khaira, chief engineer, regional office of MoRTH Uttarakhand and project in-charge of Char Dham road project, said that the apex’s court’s orders will not be violated in any manner. “We will be following all the guidelines as per the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s orders. There will be no violations of any manner.” RK Sudhanshu, secretary for Public Works Department of Uttarakhand government, said that they have not received any new directions from the central government. “Last week we were directed by the Centre to follow the guidelines of the SC for new stretches and we will be following that. The Supreme Court’s orders will not be violated and all the work will be done according to the directions given by the court,” he added. He said that during a video conference with the central government, they were told that the SC’s order of 5.5m road will be followed for stretches where work is to be started from scratch. That means Chopra’s comments on the width being more than that mentioned in the court order in other stretches is accurate. As work continues, members of the HPC -- formed by SC last year to check environmental damages to the Himalayan region due to this project -- maintain that the order said the whole road should be of the width 5.5m and mitigation measures should be put in place for complying with the order. On September 11, Ravi Chopra wrote to the secretary MoRTH seeking, “submission of a comprehensive work plan to bring the Char Dham Pariyojana in compliance with the Hon’ble Court’s direction that it will follow MoRTH’s 2018 circular”. None has been forthcoming. The letter also pointed out, “Also, kindly make sure that to comply with the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Orders dated 08.09.2020 and 08.08.2019, in letter and spirit, no new hill cutting is done in all the ongoing/proposed projects till the HPC has reviewed the Rapid EIA report and issued specific directions thereafter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hill-cutting-char-dham-road-on-in-full-swing-sc-panel-chief/story-D8bz73fKAPe7WRcQ4VGD9J.html
03-10-2020||India||Govt provided over Rs 2.33 lakh crore cash aid in last 6 months||The government has so far provided cash assistance of over Rs 2.33 lakh crore in addition to free ration to pandemic-hit underprivileged sections of the society in the last six months that played a crucial role in demand generation and reflected in the recent signs of economic recovery, two senior government officials said.Positive growth in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection, an all-time high Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) for manufacturing, and a robust export performance in the month of September are the testimonies that the government’s Rs 20.97 lakh crore Aatmnirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) package launched between March 26 and May 17 has worked, the officials said requesting anonymity.Also Read: A review of economy in 1st half of FY 2020-21The GST collection in September 2020 saw a positive year-on-year growth of 4% at Rs 95,480 crore for the first time since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown on March 25. PMI for manufacturing in September also surged at an all-time high of 56.8, signifying expansion of economic activities. According to the latest official data, India’s exports grew by 5.27% at $27.4 billion in September, after contracting for six months in a row. One of the officials, who is privy to the meetings at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on the Covid impact mitigation exercise, said, “All these money [Rs 2.33 lakh crore] and assistance [free distribution of food materials and cooking gas cylinders] have gone through direct benefit transfer (DBT) into the bank accounts and in the hands of deserving people, without any middlemen and any delay. Yet, critics say that government has not taken enough demand side measures by putting cash in the hands of people. Is this not putting cash in hands of people at the time of distress?”As on date Rs 68,921 crore financial assistance has been provided to 42 crore people under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP). The package was an initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic in March and it was a part of the Rs 20.97 lakh crore stimulus package that was announced in five tranches in May. The size of PMGKP was Rs 1.7 lakh crore. Also Read: Not being risk-averse in face of Covid-19 crisis: FM Nirmala SitharamanGiving details of the direct cash transferred to the poor, the official said, “Rs 30,952 crore has been credited through DBT to 20.65 crore women Jan Dhan account holders. Almost 8.94 crore farmers under PM Kisan have been paid with two instalment of Rs 17,891 crore each. Rs. 15,000 crore fund for health sector is being implemented in three phases. Rs 27,000 crore spent so far under Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan. Rs 40,000 crore additional provision was made under MGNREGA [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act]. About 1.82 crore construction workers have received financial support of Rs 4,987.18 crore.

03-10-2020||India||Cong likely to extend stir against farm laws||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday said that “farmers will win” in their protest against three farm legislations, which were recently passed in Parliament and got the President’s assent, signalling the party’s intent to prolong the fight against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government over the issue. “Congress’ agitation against three black (farm) laws will continue. I want to emphasize that this movement of farmers and Congress will be successful and the farmers will win,” Sonia Gandhi said in her message on Gandhi Jayanti. The opposition parties and various farmers’ groups have alleged that the farm bills will weaken the MSP regime and only benefit big agribusinesses. “...today the farmers and farm laborers of the country are agitating on the streets against the three anti-black laws. The Modi government is crying tears of blood to the donor farmer who grows grains for the country by sweating his blood,” Sonia said.The Congress president said that her party has “always made every law with public consent” and before the enactment of the law, “the interests of the people have been kept at the top”.Her statement comes a day ahead of party leader Rahul Gandhi’s scheduled protest against the farm bills in Punjab. In his tweets on Friday, Rahul said, “I will not fear anyone in the world… I will not bow down to anyone’s injustice, I will win the untruth with the truth and I can bear all the sufferings while opposing the untruth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-likely-to-extend-stir-against-farm-laws/story-NTOY3FeN9HZYzGrk7dOiVI.html
03-10-2020||India||Islamic State group Al-Hind plotted to build province in jungles of South India: NIA charge sheet||An offshoot of IS operating in south India, known as the Al-Hind module planned to establish ISIS Daishwilayah (province) inside the jungles of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala as recently as in late 2019 according to a July charge sheet by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against 17 members of the module. This is the first time NIA or any investigative agency has unearthed an ISIS plot of this nature in India, although the terror group’s playbook has always revolved around creating Islamic states in areas it controls. Also Read: NIA court sentences IS recruit from Kerala to life imprisonmentThe arrests were made between December, 2019, and January this year. To understand how to survive inside the deep forest, the 20-member module, led by Bengaluru-based Mehboob Pasha and Cuddalore (Tamil Nadu)-based Khaja Moideen even bought books on famous sandalwood smuggler Veerappan who successfully dodged the police of several states. Significantly, in November 2019, Pasha, along with four others from this highly radicalised module of IS, even visited the Shivanasamudra area in Karnataka to identify an area in the jungle where they could train, create a suitable hideout for all Al-Hind members and establish the first IS Daishwilayah (province) in the country. Also Read: NIA arrests Al-Qaeda operative from Bengal’s MurshidabadIn its charge sheet, reviewed by HT, NIA has further stated that on the directions of Khaja Moideen, module members procured tents, rain coats, sleeping bags, ropes, ladders, pulleys, bows and arrows, jungle boots, knives, arms and ammunitions, as well as large quantity of firecrackers and sparklers with an intention to extract explosive content from them for making powerful IEDs. The outfit even identified hideouts in Kolar, Kodagu, and other places in Karnataka; Jambusar in Gujarat; Ratnagiri in Mahatrashtra; Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh; and Burdwan and Siliguri in West Bengal where they could hide, according to the NIA chargesheet. Their plan was to target/murder Hindu religious and political leaders, police officers, government officials and other high profile individuals all over India and then retreat to the forest, the charge sheet added.  Pasha was receiving instructions from an unknown foreign handler called “bhai”, NIA said. Also Read: Arrested al Qaeda operatives spill more names to NIA investigators“At its prime in 2014-15, the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi led global terror outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (IS) managed to control a significant territory in Iraq, Syria and even Afghanistan. The outfit influenced hundreds of Indian youngsters – some of whom travelled to the held territories, while many stayed here to carry out attacks in different cities. However, never in last six years, have we heard that there was a plan to create a physical territory here in India by the outfit,” said a senior counter-insurgency official who didn’t want to be identified. The Al-Hind module, which operated from the Al-Hind Trust office of Pasha in Guruppanpalya, Bengaluru, was unearthed by agencies in January this year with multiple raids in Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The NIA charge sheet adds that Khaja Moideen even sold his inherited land in Cuddalore (Tamil Nadu) and gave an amount of ₹5 lakh to buy jungle survival and training items. The outfit members practiced Taekwondo and Kung Fu at the Al-Hind Trust’s premises. On the directions of Pasha, the module members also participated in anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests in different cities. Moideen was arrested in the murder of a Hindu leader KP Suresh Kumar in Tamil Nadu in 2014 but was released on bail in July 2019. Since then, he was in touch with Pasha to create a new module, NIA said. NIA officials familiar with the case said some members of the module are still absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-group-planned-province-in-south-india-nia-charge-sheet/story-PqPdkxdOdt7ormlxfD95hO.html
03-10-2020||India||2 killed on suspicion of being ‘witches’||A 50-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man were killed and their bodies burnt by fellow residents in a hamlet in Assam’s Karbi Anglong on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday on suspicion that the two were “witches”. According to the police, the incident took place at the remote Rohimapur hamlet, located under Dokmoka police station 80 km from Diphu. Nine people including three women have been arrested in connection with case. “We got information about the incident from a relative of the one of the deceased on Thursday morning. The place where the incident happened is located nearly 9km from the highway,” said Debojit Deuri, superintendent of police, Karbi Anglong. The village of 18-20 families comprises people from the Adivasi community and almost all residents are engaged in farming. The nearest proper village is located around 5-6 kilometres away. The deceased, Ramawati Halua and Bijoy Gour, were accused by fellow villagers of being responsible for the death of a young girl from the village who died on September 27. “Prior to her death, the deceased girl had told villagers that Ramawati and Bijoy were responsible for her sickness. The villagers held a kangaroo court in front on the headman’s house on Wednesday night, killed the duo (who are unrelated) and cremated them on a single pyre,” said Deuri. “We have managed to recover some human remains from the pyre which will be sent for forensic examination. Nine persons from the village including three women who were involved in the killings have been nabbed. They have confessed to killing the two deceased. Efforts are on to nab six other accused who are absconding,” he added. Ramawati was a widow who used to stay with her daughter. Bijoy stayed with his father. Such killings are usually motivated by blind superstition, or dispute over land. A case of murder under several sections of Indian Penal Code and the Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act, 2015 has been registered at Dokmoka police station. According to the state government data presented in the assembly in November last year, 107 people have been killed in instances of witch-hunting across the state since 2011. “Our effort will be nab all accused, get all the required evidence and reports from the forensic lab and file a charge sheet in the case within the quickest possible time,” Deuri said. In 2018, two men from Guwahati who drove to Dokmoka on a sightseeing trip were killed by a mob on suspicion of them being child lifters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-2-killed-on-suspicion-of-being-witches-in-assam/story-tdvoA0p1qzLjdORTZ2CFwO.html
03-10-2020||India||Hathras gangrape: Leaders, students, activists demand justice for victim in Capital||Political leaders, students, activists and members of the civil society gathered at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on Friday evening, demanding justice for the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gang-raped and murdered in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, and voiced concern over the law-and-order situation in the state. Smaller protests were held in other parts of the city, including CR Park, Vasant Kunj, Lodhi Colony and Dwarka.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who joined the protest in Jantar Mantar, demanded capital punishment for the perpetrators. “The culprits should be given the harshest punishment so that nobody in the world tries to repeat such an act. They must be hanged till death. Some people have been feeling that attempts are being made to save the culprits and the whole incident is being covered...The FIR for rape was not lodged for many days, no proper treatment was given to her, and her body was cremated at night going against Hindu customs. Several actions have made people believe that the whole incident and the culprits are being shielded,” he said.The chief minister led a candle-light vigil on the Jantar Mantar Road along with his party MLAs Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj, and senior leader Durgesh Pathak.In a statement later in the evening, he said: “There should be no politics on the matter, it is not ethical to play politics on this. When one says a rape has happened in Uttar Pradesh, another person says a rape has also happened in Rajasthan. This is no argument.”Student groups from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia, Ashoka University and Ambedkar University were joined by members of organisations such as All India Democratic Women’s Association and the National Federation of Indian Women, and the Dalit group Bhim Army.Politicians such as Left leaders Sitaram Yechury, D Raja and Kanhaiya Kumar, Yogendra Yadav, Jignesh Mevani, Kanhaiya Kumar and Chandrashekhar Azad also participated in the protest.Delhi Police registered an FIR under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act for defying social distancing norms and gathering in large numbers to protesting at Jantar Mantar. They did not name anyone but said the FIR was against all protesters. Another FIR was registered against eight members of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Congress at Vigyan Bhawan for defying social distancing norms and carrying a match towards BJP President JP Nadda’s house to protest against three farm bills passed recently in Parliament. On Friday afternoon, the organisers changed venue of the protest from India Gate to Jantar Mantar. Anticipating a large number of protesters, there was heavy presence of police and central security forces. All arterial roads connecting Jantar Mantar with India Gate were barricaded by the police. Residents from the satellite cities of Noida and Gurugram also joined.In the evening, when crowds started to gather, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation closed the entry and exit of the Janpath Metro station at 7pm. The exits of the Rajiv Chowk and Patel Chowk stations were also shut. Police barricades were erected and vehicular traffic diversions and restrictions were put in place at several places in central Delhi. Sitting in different smaller groups, the protesters shouted slogans demanding justice for the young woman and her family and the resignation of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. There were an estimated 1,000- 1,200 protesters at Jantar Mantar. Asha Singh, who had come from Balmiki mohalla in Bawana in north-west Delhi said: “Is being born in a so-called lower caste a crime? That woman and her family in Hathras need justice. The incident happened in a village 200 km from Delhi. 200 km is not too far a distance. Tomorrow it can happen anywhere. It has to be stopped now.”As the crowd shouted slogans, police personnel in riot control gear stood at a distance. Madhurima Kundu, member of the All India Students Association, said, “They can conduct polls in Bihar amid Covid-19 crisis but protests are being scuttled. The Dalit victim was cremated without even allowing her family to attend the cremation. This shows the state of the country we are in.”Shadipur resident Kusum (goes only with first name) was in Jantar Mantar with her eight-year-old daughter. “We learnt about the protest through WhatsApp messages. We had to be here today. It is a barbaric crime that has happened against a woman, against a person of the Dalit community,” she said.Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said he would soon march to Hathras to meet the victim’s family.Speaking about the SIT constituted by the state government to investigate the case, lawyer Prashant Bhushan said: “Who can trust their SIT? The village has been cordoned off and we are getting reports that the family’s phone has been seized and they are not being allowed to talk to the media. This is unacceptable.”CPI leader and former JNU students’ union president Kanhaiya Kumar said, “A bigger pandemic than Covid-19 is the patriarchal and casteist mindset of the society. That is why we have gathered here to demand justice for our daughters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-leaders-students-activists-gather-at-jantar-mantar-demand-justice-for-rape-victim/story-JtTj38s8LYLd0fTrd3Q27J.html
03-10-2020||India||Hathras gangrape, midnight cremation and protests across nation: All you need to know||A 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and tortured by ‘upper’ caste men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras on September 14 while she was out with her mother to collect fodder. She died a fortnight later in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital.Family members of the victim claimed that her body was cremated by UP Police in their absence at 2.30am on Wednesday. Dalit community leaders and women rights activists protested against the police action, calling it a “new low”.Also Watch | Hathras case: Kejriwal, Bhim Army chief join Delhi protesters demanding justice Here is a timeline of events:- Soon after the victim’s death on September 29, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad led a protest at Gate Number 5 of Safdarjung Hospital. “The government should not test our patience. We won’t rest until the culprits are hanged,” he said.- The midnight cremation of the victims’ body was slammed by Opposition parties, which claimed that the Yogi Adityanath government did so to suppress protests.- Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women’s Association, said that the girl and her family were being denied dignity even in death and mourning. “When the family found her and she was taken to the police station, the police said she is trying to trap people and then she was hospitalised and not kept in ICU for six days and then on her death the police blamed the victim’s family and they are denying this Dalit family and victim dignity even in death and mourning,” she said.- Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi attempted to visit the family of the victim in Hathras on Thursday, but their convoy was stopped in view of Section 144 in the area.

03-10-2020||India||I am like your elder sister, Uma Bharti tweets to Yogi Adityanath on Hathras incident, asks him to let politicians meet family||Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti urged Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to allow politicians and media personnel meet the family members of the Dalit women who was allegedly gangraped in Hathras and later succumbed to her injuries in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital. “You must have known that I am admitted to the Corona ward of AIIMS after I was found Covid positive. Today is my 7th day here. I have not been able to meet anyone. I was not present at the hearing of special CBI court on Babri Masjid case. I have not spoken to anyone on telephone as well. But I have been following television news,” the senior BJP leader wrote. ७)मै @BJP4India में आपसे वरिष्ठ एवं आपकी बड़ी बहन हू । मेरा आग्रह है की आप मेरे सुझाव को अमान्य मत करियेगा ।Watch | ‘Like your elder sister’: Uma Bharti asks UP CM to allow politicians in Hathras The BJP leader’s long thread of tweet comes soon after a Trinamool delegation which was on their way to meet the family was stopped on Friday. On Thursday, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were not allowed to visit Hathras and police cited the imposition of Section 144 as the reason of barring politicians. On Friday, the family members were not allowed to talk to media people as well. Also Read: No rape claim before SIT report in Hathras case raises doubts, say expertsReferring to the Hathras incident, Uma Bharti said she is certain that the CM is handling the situation deftly. “But the way police has locked the victim’s family offers various scope for debate and apprehension,” the veteran BJP leader wrote. “The women belonged to a Dalit family. Police hurriedly conducted her last rites and now the family has been locked down. I don’t know of any rule that prohibits the family of a victim if SIT probe is going on. This will raise question over the SIT probe only,” Uma Bharti wrote. Also Read: Hathras gang-rape case: UP cops barricade village to stop media, opposition from meeting familyWithout mincing any word, Uma Bharti denounced the action of Uttar Pradesh Police and said UP police’s action will be tarnishing the image of not only the UP government, but also the BJP government. The BJP leader also alluded to the recent groundbreaking ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “We are committed to bring Ram Rajya back in the country,” she wrote. “Your image as the CM is very clean. I would request you to allow media personnel and politicians, including those from the Opposition to meet the family,” the veteran BJP leader wrote.Had Uma Bharti not been Covid-19 positive, she would have visited the family members of the victim in Hathras. “After I get released from here, I will definitely meet the family members,” she wrote. “I am senior to you in the party and I am also like your elder sister. I urge you to not dismiss my suggestions,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-like-your-elder-sister-uma-bharti-tweets-to-yogi-adityanath-on-hathras-incident-asks-him-to-let-politicians-meet-family/story-n2Cy4rfNJQrwwChEiTitUI.html
03-10-2020||Editorials||Hathras will shape Dalit discourse. Whether it affects their political choices is to be seen||The Hathras episode has the potential to deeply impact Dalit politics. This is reflected not just in what appears to be a spontaneous upsurge against the Uttar Pradesh government for its handling of the case by Opposition parties, Dalit formations and civil society groups. It is also reflected in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)‘s efforts to send the right signals, albeit belatedly, by promising action and intensifying its outreach among Dalit communities. No political party in India which has expansive electoral ambitions can be seen as anti-Dalit and recent moves to either allay the apprehensions of the community (in the case of the BJP) or get them to agitate (in the case of the Opposition) are intended to win over their support.Dalit politics in India has always had multiple strands. There is the more militant tradition which sees caste conflict as a fundamental reality of society — and seeks to overthrow the upper-caste order, including through violence. This strand, never very strong, has got even weaker in recent decades. The second is represented by the more mainstream Dalit political party formations — which includes Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party in UP or Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party, among others. The third is the strand represented by mainstream political formations such as the Congress or regional parties which have enjoyed Dalit support. The BJP is the most prominent recent example of this strand, where a significant number of Dalit sub-castes has veered towards the party in recent years. While it is too early to come to any conclusions, Hathras is becoming a key symbol of the atrocities against Dalits. In terms of discourse, it has the potential to evoke the same emotional sentiment as Rohith Vemula’s suicide or the Una flogging. This should worry the BJP. But it is not yet clear whether this sharpening of the discourse will have electoral implications. Hathras, for instance, is a reserved assembly constituency which has voted for the BJP in all but one election since 1991 (a regional party won in 2009). In a reserved constituency, of course, the electoral power of non-Dalit groups is crucial. But the point is that there isn’t always a neat link between the discourse on Dalit issues and the voting patterns of Dalit communities, which are to do with a complex set of local, regional and national factors. How Hathras will change the discourse and political choices will be a key factor in the future of Dalit politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/hathras-will-shape-dalit-discourse-whether-it-affects-their-political-choices-is-to-be-seen/story-vKQVYFmTsRK5IIbBJNiXGK.html
