A politician was ship-wrecked, and found himself on an island. One day, he spotted a passing ship and waved. When he met the captain, he asked, “Are you the government? If so, I am in the Opposition!” That would seem to be the parties in the Opposition today. The farm bills are a fait accompli. It is clear that all those concerned must meet farmers’ representatives and agricultural experts to examine how they can be carried forward. There are many progressive steps in the farm bills that will benefit small farmers, who comprise 85% of the farming community. One bill helps farmers evade the clutches of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) mandis and from the cartel of brokers and traders who are often in league with government inspectors. The other pertains to essential commodities and does away with many of the restrictions on crops that were there earlier. The third bill is aimed at contract farming directly with farmers and encourages start-ups that will help innovate and create new markets. This will attract massive investments by corporates in procurement and processing, cold storages and supply chain from end-to-end. These bills will result in better prices for farmers by reducing the wastage of perishables and by increasing consumption and competition among buyers. They are not aimed at dismantling APMCs or eroding the Minimum Support Price (MSP). These reforms will impact farming practices, livelihoods of farmers and labourers, supply chain linkages from farm to retail shelves and agri-start ups to giant corporates, and the millions of small-time traditional buyers, wholesalers and agents. Only a limited number of crops that come under APMC. There are other crops, fruits and vegetables, flowers and livestock and dairy products, which are not eligible for MSP. These bills have several benefits, but also a few loopholes. Government monopolies, such as APMCs, are moribund and prone to corruption, and can be inefficient and indifferent to customers. But private sector monopolies, while being efficient, can also be rapacious. Many fears of farmers may be unfounded, but there are also legitimate concerns about corporations, which the government must address. Cooperative federalism was a dictum that the prime minister promoted in his time as the chief minister of Gujarat. It is now clear that he must implement the Swaminathan Report: National Commission on Farmers on agriculture which he had promised to do within a year of coming to power. Writer Aldous Huxley talks of what happens when people act out of hubris. Here is a story: Some scientists alarmed at the poaching of rhinos in Africa for their horns — considered aphrodisiacs that fetch a huge price in the smugglers’ market — advised a solution. They recommended that the horns of all the rhinos be sawed off under anaesthesia to prevent them from being killed by poachers. It was a simple silver bullet. They later discovered, to their surprise, that the rhino population dwindled for many reasons. One of them being the female rhinos did not mate with males without horns.Often, our noble intentions have unintended adverse consequences which we cannot foresee when we do not discuss, debate and deliberate on issues before we enact laws. What Ralph Waldo Emerson said, 150 years ago, still holds true: “The first farmer was the first man. All trade rests at last on his primitive activity... This hard work will always be done by one kind of man — the farmer; not by speculators nor by soldiers, nor professors or readers of Tennyson; but men of endurance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/agri-reforms-the-disjunct-between-the-right-ends-wrong-means/story-xa83dJB0b0qzaDajeVbs0L.html
21-10-2020||News||In Indian cities, the quest for dignity||Cities in India are characterised by institutionalised inequalities. Planners, administrators and mayors prioritise policies and resources in favour of the influential middle-class, with little thought spared for those less fortunate, despite their making up a substantial portion of any city. Geeta Devi used to live and work as construction worker at Yamuna Pushta in Delhi. In the run-up to the Commonwealth Games, she and another 30,000 other households were moved to Savda Ghebra area on the outskirts. “It was like coming to a wild jungle, with nothing around, no water, no toilets, no electricity and we had no house. We had to build our own kutcha house, every second day a water tank would come and we spent hours carrying buckets of water. We used the jungle for defecation. My children were often ill and I had to stop working, so we had very little money. We were in despair,” she said. She was poor — and expendable.Babuben Patni, a vegetable vendor, after marriage, came to live in Ahmedabad City. She found that her area — Sinheswari Nagar — had only one public tap, no toilets. It had garbage piled up at the entrance of the area and was water-logged every monsoon. Apart from the residents contracting water-borne diseases, women such as Babuben faced the humiliation of having to defecate on the railway tracks nearby. Geeta Devis and Babubens abound in every city, always characterised by the contrast between areas dominated by multistoried buildings, parks, shopping centres, malls and gyms on the one hand and ramshackle, tightly-packed dwellings without infrastructure on the other. In India, between 25% to 40% of city-dwellers are estimated to live in what are euphemistically called informal settlements. However, a slum need not remain a slum forever. And, that is the story we tell in our book, The City-Makers. Today, 20 years later, Babuben is the proud owner of a two-storey pucca house with her own bathroom and toilet. Sinheswari Nagar has drainage, and sewage and garbage is collected every day.How did the change come about? Not overnight.We detail a long-drawn-out process, involving a chain of actors, from individual households to a non-governmental organisation — Mahila Housing Trust — to officials and elected representatives of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, among others. My colleagues and I in the Mahila Housing Trust have worked for over 25 years to help convert slums into more liveable colonies. The real spark for change starts with the women in slum households who have to queue up to get water; who suffer humiliation when they have to defecate in the open or in badly-maintained public toilets; who have to look after those who get sick from the open festering drains. They are the most keenest on change. The first step for change is for the households in a slum to agree that they will work together. Women must take the lead and form a Community Action Group (CAG), which then becomes the spearhead for action, beginning with finding allies such as a sympathetic elected official or the local administrator. This often requires a financial commitment from the slum-dwellers and it is the task of CAG to collect the money and maintain accounts. Trust is important because these slum dwellers, most of whom are poor and working in the informal sector, have been cheated so often in the past. Many cities still subscribe to an unhelpful policy which enjoins that the people living in “unauthorised” colonies are not eligible to get water and sanitation from the city, although they are “authorised” citizens, holding ration cards, working in the city and contributing to its economy.Fortunately, the compulsions of electoral democracy assert themselves. Those in “unauthorised” colonies also happen to have votes; fortunately, programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission are kicking in. Consequently, the “unauthorised” restrictions are being relaxed — and where that happens, the slum slowly begins to transform.Fourteen years later, Geeta Devi, says her “jungle” in Savda Ghebra has become a busy colony. This happened gradually as she and her neighbours formed a CAG, approached their MLA, the Delhi Jal Board and the municipal corporation. She took a loan and installed her own underground water pump and made her own soak pit. At first, her CAG was ignored by the authorities but as they persisted they began getting responses. Today, not only is she recognised by the authorities but was recently invited to be part of consultations for the Delhi Master Plan 2030. The efforts of thousands of women like Geeta Devi and Babuben are paying massive civic dividends. Many planners no longer think of the poor as interlopers; instead, they are seen as useful citizens who need to be integrated into the physical life of the city if we are to have a sustainable future.Renana Jhabvala is executive trustee, Mahila Housing SEWA Trust and co-author of The City-Makers The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-indian-cities-the-quest-for-dignity/story-lkUknCSY3LLTvOl33K7LaK.html
21-10-2020||News||The real anchor of the Indo-Pacific plan||The challenge for the Indo-Pacific is getting more acute by the day. For all the efforts that China has made to ensure that the term Indo-Pacific gets a decent burial, it has failed miserably in ensuring such an outcome. From Australia, Japan, and India to the European Union (EU) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) member-states, the Indo-Pacific narrative is today widely accepted and reflected in foreign policy outlooks. The idea is a structural imperative now for all regional stakeholders and this has been made possible due to China’s behaviour. The only thing left now for Beijing is to mobilise regional states through fear-mongering, something it is adept at.This was what China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, tried to do during his trip last week to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, and Singapore. Calling on Asian countries to remain vigilant over the United States (US)’ plans in the region, Wang described Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy as a “security risk” for East Asia. Without any hint of irony, he argued that “what it (the US) pursues is to trumpet the old-fashioned Cold War mentality and start up confrontation among different groups and blocks, and stoke geopolitical competition”. For Southeast Asian nations, his message was that Beijing and Asean should work together to remove “external disruption” in the South China Sea.Amid deteriorating Sino-US ties and Washington’s resolve to emerge as a credible partner in the region, Wang Yi was underscoring the choices facing the region. This was happening even as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to Tokyo for a meeting of the Quad had already raised the stakes for geopolitical competition in the region. The very resurrection of this Quad grouping in 2017, involving the US, Japan, Australia and India is a function of China’s growing assertiveness and a deepening suspicion of Beijing’s intentions about its power. As regional stakeholders search for a new, more stable balance of power in the region, they are working with each other in ways that could not have been visualised even a few years ago. The new geometries dotting the regional landscape of the Indo-Pacific underscore this newfound conviction among the regional actors that old structures are just not effective enough anymore. If the Quad meeting saw calls for deeper cooperation among major regional players, the various bilaterals and trilaterals embedded within it have been stronger in articulating the need for greater coordination among the stakeholders. There is a growing regional consensus that despite China’s attempts to discredit the idea, a free and open Indo-Pacific remains the only viable basis for engendering regional peace and stability. For the US, Pompeo’s visit during a high-stakes electoral contest in the US is an important signal to the region that the Indo-Pacific is now the central theatre in its geopolitical contestation with China. It also suggests that Washington will fight hard to retain its credibility. It was for this reason that Pompeo was categorical in underlining that “it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s exploitation, corruption and coercion”. The other regional powers might be more restrained in their remarks but their emphasis was clear — with Japan talking of advancing practical talks on issues such as infrastructure and cyber-security, Australia talking of human rights and India underscoring the need to respect territorial sovereignty. Bilateral ties are gathering pace with India-Japan, Australia-Japan and India-Australia reassessing the need for building cooperation on issues including maritime security, emerging strategic technologies, infrastructure and counterterrorism. The Malabar exercises and Australia’s participation must be seen within this context. While it might be premature to talk of a “Quad plus” at this stage, major powers, at an individual level, and, in coordination with other like-minded countries, are serious about building coalitions. Japan will be signing an agreement with Vietnam to allow it to export defence equipment and technology to the country during Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s visit to Vietnam this week. Japan will be seeking to strengthen security ties with Indonesia too. But it is India that is the critical anchor in making the idea of Indo-Pacific a viable strategic geography. While Japan may have given the idea its original push, Australia may have given it intellectual ballast and Washington may have led the way in its operationalisation, it is New Delhi’s proactive foreign policy outlook that made it possible for others to buy into the concept and incorporate it in their security outlooks. No other country has done more than India in making the regional stakeholders believe that there is an alternative to just acquiescing to a China-led Asian order. Whether it was publicly challenging President Xi Jinping’s vanity project, the Belt and Road Initiative, or standing up to China militarily at Doklam despite being the weaker State, whether it was giving a push to the idea of issue-based coalitions in the maritime sphere or rejecting the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership pact, much before other nations were talking about economic decoupling from China — New Delhi made it possible to envision an Indo-Pacific order which is not dominated by China. As China galvanises its diplomacy to manage the negative externalities emerging out of this Indo-Pacific vision, which, despite Beijing’s best efforts, is going from strength to strength, the challenge for India is to sustain the momentum of showcasing the Indo-Pacific vision and its operational realities.

21-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai man wanted for attempted murder arrested after returning from Dubai||Versova police on Wednesday arrested a 21-year-old man wanted in an attempt to murder with robbery case from 2019. The arrested accused, identified as Shakir Shaikh, 21, is a resident of Versova. Shaikh, along with his friend Akash Naik, 21, had stabbed an autorickshaw driver and robbed him in June last year.Rauf Shaikh, sub-inspector, Versova police station, said, “In June 2019, after committing the offence, Shaikh fled to Dubai, where he started working as a salesman at a mall. In September 2020, he came back to India, and on Wednesday we came to know that he was likely to come to visit his sister at Versova.” “In 2019, Shaikh was overweight and sported a beard and long hair. He had since lost weight, shaved off his beard and cut his hair so that no one could identify him. However, we identified him and arrested him,” said the sub-inspector.“Shaikh and Naik had needed money, and so they planned the robbery. They boarded an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop them at Aram Nagar No 1, Versova. While alighting, they flashed a knife at the driver and threatened to kill him if he did not hand over his mobile and cash,” added the officer. The driver attempted to protect himself, but the accused stabbed him in the stomach and fled with his mobile phone and money. A case was registered under section 307 (attempt to murder), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A day later, police managed to arrest Naik, but Shaikh was absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-wanted-for-attempted-murder-arrested-after-returning-from-dubai/story-HlXeMwVrr4hVISPPUyZ2iP.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to follow up with recovered Covid-19 patients for TB symptoms||As Covid-19 and tuberculosis (TB) share similar symptoms, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed all hospitals in the city to check patients who have recovered from Covid-19 for TB.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB and Covid-19 are both infectious diseases that primarily attack the lungs. Both diseases have similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. “As the pandemic advances, more people of all ages, including TB patients, will be exposed to Covid-19,” reads the note released by WHO in May. In Mumbai, 135 TB patients have been co-infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Of this, 18 have succumbed to the infection, mostly because of late diagnosis. “Most of these co-infection cases have been identified in new TB patients. They approached hospitals considering it just Covid-19 infection. But when their CT scan report showed different forms of clouding in lungs, their sputum culture confirmed that they were also carrying the bacteria of TB,” said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent, Sewri TB Hospital. “Both of these infections affect people with lower immunity,” he said.In view of this, a circular has been issued instructing all private and public hospitals to follow up with Covid-19 recovered patients to check if they have developed any symptoms similar to TB such as coughing, loss of appetite, fatigue, among others.“If any of them show such symptoms, we will run a sputum test to check if he/she has TB,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, deputy health officer, BMC. “But so far, we have not diagnosed any recovered Covid-19 patients with TB,” she added.In addition, BMC has also added TB in the questionnaire for the door-to-door survey under ‘Your Family, Your Responsibility’. “During the survey, if anyone is found with TB-like symptoms, we will also run a diagnosis on it,” she added.Social workers have welcomed the decision of the civic body which may help to identify post Covid-19 TB patients. “When a patient is found positive for Covid-19, many hospitals don’t run a sputum test for TB. So, there is no way to know if the person also has TB as the symptoms are similar. Thus, it is important to check on these recovered patients as TB has a longer incubation period with a slower onset of disease,” said Ganesh Acharya, TB activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-follow-up-with-recovered-covid-19-patients-for-tb-symptoms/story-VQ6OdAsh72ukjDdo0IgN7M.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||55,000 women travel by Mumbai local trains on Day 1||The number of women commuters using locals was low on Wednesday, the first day they were permitted to travel by train. Till 8pm on Wednesday, approximately 55,000 women commuters travelled by local trains, with 25,000 on the Central Railway (CR) and 30,000 on Western Railway (WR). Railway authorities on Tuesday permitted women commuters to travel by local trains from Wednesday between 11am and 3pm, and post 7pm. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) deployed 250 additional personnel at Central Railway (CR) stations. These included women RPF personnel during the stipulated time when women passengers were allowed to commute.Passengers underwent thermal scans at the entrance of railway stations and their tickets were inspected by railway authorities. Women commuters expressed relief over the decision to allow them to commute, but have asked for an increase in the stipulated time for commuting.“I am very happy as women commuters are allowed to travel by local trains. I stay at Reay Road and used to travel to Kurla daily by BEST bus. It used to take me one and a half hours to reach my workplace. Travelling by local trains will definitely save time. The timings should be increased,” said Sofiya Shaikh, a Reay Road resident.“The timings for women passengers should be increased to 5pm. Many women commuters have to work in different areas and cannot reach the railway stations by 3pm,” said Ankita Sinha, a Ghatkopar resident. Many women passengers also used rail services to complete their pending housework. “I am travelling from Kanjurmarg to Dadar after more than seven months. Before the lockdown, I had booked furniture and home accessories but could not finalise the order. I am going to buy them,” said Shruti Kakkar, a Vikhroli resident who travelled by train on Wednesday.The railways stated that they will increase services when the need arises. “There was no incident of overcrowding reported. We will be observing the commuter traffic pattern in the coming days,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway.The state government, under its Mission Begin Again initiative, on Friday had permitted women passengers to travel by local trains without QR code from October 17. However, the railways delayed it to October 21, seeking time to finalise the standard operating procedures.CR is presently operating 706 local train services while the Western Railway (WR) is operating 704 services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/55-000-women-travel-by-mumbai-local-trains-on-day-1/story-bp6zpSnVXBiPDaWnwIZbPO.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||594 proposals on meeting agenda ignored as BMC standing committee debates membership of BJP councillor||Despite having 600-odd civic work proposals from the past seven months on its agenda, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee, which physically met for the first time since March, debated over membership of a nominated member, leaving aside the entire agenda of the day.The meeting started with Shiv Sena group leader and committee member Vishakha Raut contending the appointment of the nominated councillor, Bhartiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Bhalchandra Shirsat, as a committee member. She moved a proposal demanding his disqualification as a standing committee member.While the civic body has 227 elected representatives, there are five citizen members who are experts in various fields or have expertise in the municipal body’s functioning. They are appointed as nominated councillors. These councillors do not get voting rights in the general body or the standing committee, but are allotted councillor funds and are treated like elected councillors.Sena members, with support from the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), challenged Shirsat’s membership as a standing committee member. “If he cannot vote on whether proposals are to be passed or not, there is no point in being a member of the standing committee. These are important civic work proposals that impact every Mumbaiite, and nominated members cannot vote on them,” said Raut.Pointing out the appointment of KP Naik, who was Sena’s nominated councillor and member of the standing committee from 1997 to 2002, Shirsat argued, “Their nominated councillor has served in the standing committee for five years. It is hypocritical of the Sena to oppose my membership. They wasted more than two hours debating over my membership, whereas, they could have discussed these important proposals. The standing committee cannot disqualify me and only the mayor has the right to do so.”A majority of the 594 proposals on the committee’s agenda were tabled for post-facto approval, which means the contracts for the civic works have been awarded and BMC has already committed them for payment. This leaves little scope for the standing committee’s effective rejection of the proposals. This is possible because the standing committee gave spending powers to the municipal commissioner in March, in light of the lockdown, since the committee did not meet during that time. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on October 26.After a heated discussion between the Sena and BJP leaders, standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav said, “I have discussed the matter with the municipal secretary and the law department of the BMC. A nominated member cannot be a member of the standing committee. I disqualify him from the committee and ask him to please step out of the general body hall.” Members of other parties, except the BJP, supported the Shiv Sena.The standing committee has 26 members, of which 13 were newly-nominated on September 28, including BJP’s Shirsat. Following the debates, Sena moved another proposal to adjourn the meeting, stating that it could not be continued without the removal of the nominated councillor, and the proposal was passed. The BJP said that it would challenge the disqualification in the Bombay high court (HC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/594-proposals-on-meeting-agenda-ignored-as-bmc-standing-committee-debates-membership-of-bjp-councillor/story-NuA5EyKUQr10GUVIlsY7kN.html

The official further said the government will start this campaign on Thursday with the north-west revenue district, which currently has the highest proportion of active cases – more than 15% of the total 22,317 active cases (as on October 18). Such maps and lists -- with names and addresses of 310 Covid-19 test centres managed by the Delhi government – were initially distributed to Delhi Metro for displaying outside Metro stations. Later, they were displayed in some prominent markets and public spaces, with an aim to encourage more testing and to ensure that any person who wants to get tested faced no inconvenience in locating a test centre. “Now these lists will be distributed among chemists over the next two weeks. This is part of the government’s action plan to intensify Covid-19 awareness in the light of the festive season, which is likely to increase the risk of transmission,” said a senior government official, not wishing to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chemists-to-get-covid-test-centre-lists-to-display-in-shops-during-festive-season/story-bPpLWuBkN7m0c1AJvtaCDM.html
21-10-2020||City||Colleges in a fix over DU’s new ‘best of four’ directive for Bihar board students||New DelhiThe Delhi University (DU) admission committee’s new guidelines for calculating the ‘best of four marks’ of applicants from the Bihar Board have created confusion about the status of students who have already been enrolled, varsity officials said. In a circular issued to colleges on Tuesday, the university’s admission committee said, “50 marks Hindi paper from Bihar Board will not be considered for calculation of best of four….50 marks English paper from Bihar Board will not be considered for calculation of best of four.” According to an official at an off-campus college, the Bihar School Education Board has papers of 50 marks each for English and Hindi in class 12. In contrast, other boards and CBSE have 100-mark papers in the two subjects.In DU, students calculate the best of four by including one language, one subject in which admission is sought, and two other academic subjects mentioned in list A in the university Undergraduate admission bulletin available on its website. In previous years, according to officials at several colleges, they were calculating the best of four of these students on a pro-rata basis. For example, if a student had scored 40 marks out of 50, it was considered as 80 out of 100 while calculating the best of four. “We used to calculate the percentage of students on a pro-rata basis in previous years and take admissions. Now, when we have already enrolled several students in Hindi (Hons) in the first cut-off list and approved many admissions in the second list, the university has come out with a new directive. What do we do with the admissions of these students? This directive should have been issued before the admissions,” the official quoted above said. At least 6,729 students from the Bihar Education Board have applied for admissions in DU this year. But Delhi University’s dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said the University had informed the colleges about this rule in the first cut-off itself. “We do not take any decision before consulting the principals. We have to compare the syllabus of different education boards for the equivalence. In case of the Bihar board, it is not on a par with the syllabus of CBSE or other boards,” she said. Bagai said the university had last year itself informed the colleges not to consider 50-mark papers on a par with papers with 100 marks. “It is the mistake of the colleges if they still continued with the admissions,” she said.Suman Kumar, a member of the DU admission committee, said, “The admission branch will take a decision regarding the students from Bihar board who have already been enrolled in some colleges.”Abhishek Singh, a Bihar board student aspiring to take admission in Political Science (Hons) in DU, said, “I had both English and Hindi in class 12 and we have to include at least one language while calculating the best of four. What do I do now?” Bagai said, “The University cannot take admissions by including a 50-mark paper in the best of four.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/colleges-in-a-fix-over-du-s-new-best-of-four-directive-for-bihar-board-students/story-jJS2kqMYcwfdsvpBNGNBhM.html

Khalid was arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the communal violence that took place in north east Delhi in February this year.A Delhi court on September 24 had sent Khalid to judicial custody till October 22 after he was produced in the court through video conferencing.The court had sent Khalid to the custody of Delhi police’s special cell for 10 days on September 14, after the agency had alleged that he had planned a conspiracy to carry out the riots in Delhi during the visit of US President Donald Trump.Recently, a Delhi court had directed the Tihar Jail officials to provide safety and security to Khalid in prison. The court’s order came on an application submitted by Khalid seeking adequate security measures in jail so that he was not harmed by anyone in judicial custody.On February 24, communal riots broke out in north east Delhi after citizenship law supporters and protesters clashed with each other, leaving at least 53 people dead and as many as 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-umar-khalid-s-judicial-custody-ends-tomorrow/story-h82FNCSDtOA4xAb7njqD5M.html
21-10-2020||City||Delhi high court raps govt over delay in funds for lower courts||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday pulled up the city government for making the subordinate judiciary “run from pillar to post” to get funds sanctioned for the recruitment of supporting staff at courts, which have come to a grinding halt, and asked whether it wanted judicial officers to conduct proceedings from ‘chaupals’.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad noted that 150 judicial officers are due to be posted in a couple of months but their courts would not be functional without the support staff. It directed its administrative side to release the requisite Rs 2.52 crore from its budget to the district courts without any delay for the recruitment.The court also rapped the government for ‘not sanctioning funds; for the basic requirement of district courts, which are generating huge revenues through collection of fines, traffic challans and court fees, saying it wanted to kill golden egg-laying goose. The same bench remarked, “Rs 115 crore collected through virtual traffic fines by district courts. What do you (Delhi government) want? You want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg?”The court said that since the money is required, it was taking it from the funds provided for the Delhi High Court. However, the amount has to be returned to the HC by the Delhi government on or before December 31.“150 judicial officers are waiting to be posted in courts. Thanks to no support and no staff. Let the Delhi government send the staff on deputation to district courts. Or you want these judges to conduct proceedings by sitting at chaupals (public space),” the bench said.It observed that the judiciary was not doing anything in this regard as it was patiently waiting for the Delhi government to release the funds. “You (Delhi government) did not do anything. Probably you took it as a weakness,” it said.“Thankfully the high court has its own funds. You are making the subordinate judiciary run from pillar to post (for funds),” the bench told the counsel for the Delhi government.The high court had earlier also directed the Delhi government to process the pending sanctions of other branches of district courts but the sanctions are still pending at the executive’s end.Delhi government counsel Santosh Tripathi said he had apprised the authorities about the orders passed by the high court in the case and wanted two weeks’ time and that the matter will be placed before the Cabinet.He said he was not in a position to state the timeline by which the Delhi government will be able to resolve the issue.Advocate Sanjoy Ghose, representing the Delhi High Court, placed before the bench letters issued by Principal District and Sessions Judge (West) who is the chairman of the recruitment committee, Tis Hazari Courts.Addressed to the Registrar General, the letters stated that an agency was engaged for conducting recruitments to vacant posts of senior personal assistants, personal assistants, junior judicial assistants and data entry operators in district courts, family courts.He said written and typing tests were conducted for various posts and the results declared before the Covid-19 lockdown on March 25. Even virtual interviews were conducted in August but the final results have been kept in abeyance in view of the pending petition.“But due to the absence of funds or revalidation of financial sanction, the whole recruitment process has been brought to a grinding halt,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-high-court-raps-govt-over-delay-in-funds-for-courts/story-Fa1tOpl2eIXi9uwHs2hlOP.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Govt orders installation of CCTV cameras at labour offices||A day after he expressed concerns over the state of affairs at the construction labour welfare board offices across the 11 revenue districts in the national capital, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia Wednesday issued directions for the installation of CCTV cameras in each of these offices.Sisodia had taken over the labour portfolio from minister Gopal Rai last week and had announced that one million constriction workers will be registered under the welfare board in the coming months. Currently, around 52,000 construction are registered and around 66,000 are awaiting verification of their applications. Registration in the board entitles construction workers to financial and other benefits in times of need -- ranging from medical aid, expenses to cover deaths and marriages in the family, and also to tackle unforeseen circumstances such as the Covid-19 lockdown.“Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, on the basis of his surprise inspection of labour offices, ordered the installation of CCTV cameras at every district labour office building,” said a statement issued by his office.It further said, “Display boards will be put up outside each labour office clearly explaining process of registration and verification to construction workers. The government has a no-tolerance policy towards any discrepancy that hinders welfare of construction workers.”The order also said that labour commissioners have been directed to conduct surprise checks with the help of police and anti-corruption branch officials to do away with touts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-orders-installation-of-cctv-cameras-at-labour-offices/story-Ll7mIebLMXJPUCN2DTOnPP.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Provide Umar Khalid with FIR copy, other papers related to his arrest, court tells police||A Delhi court directed the city police to supply former JNU student leader Umar Khalid with a copy of the FIR lodged against him in connection with the north-east Delhi riots. The court was hearing a plea moved by Khalid, seeking copies of the FIR related to the Khajuri Khas violence case, remand application submitted for his police custody, the remand order and medical report, so as to know the grounds of his arrest.During the hearing, the prosecution contended Khalid was informed about the grounds of his arrest and that if the documents were supplied to him at this stage, it would open a Pandora’s Box as he would keep on asking for one document after the other.Khalid, who was first arrested on September 13 on charges of being part of the conspiracy behind the Delhi riots and lodged in judicial custody, was rearrested on October 1 in another riots case at the Khajuri Khas police station. Chief metropolitan magistrate Purshottam Pathak also directed police to supply Khalid with the remand application and remand order of October 1 by which he was sent to three-day police custody as well as reports of the medical examination conducted while he was in police custody.The court said no person can be detained without informing him of the grounds for his arrest.Pathak said the remand application and remand order along with the medical reports did not contain any sensitive material which may not be disclosed.In its order on October 20, the court said the Constitution stipulated that no police officer can arrest an individual without informing the grounds of his arrest and Article 22 of the Constitution guaranteed the fundamental right of protection against illegal arrest and detention.It further said Section 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that every police officer with authority to arrest someone without warrant, must inform the person being arrested about the crime for which he is being arrested and other relevant grounds for the arrest.Special public prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the police, opposed Khalid’s plea and said there was no provision in law to supply the documents before the court takes cognizance of charges.But the court did not accept this and directed that the documents sought by Khalid be provided to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/provide-umar-khalid-with-fir-copy-other-papers-related-to-his-arrest-court-tells-police/story-xYSqDSirbMch75HQeXQfRM.html
21-10-2020||Gurugram||City braces for low-key Durga Puja||As the Millennium City adapts to the new normal due to the pandemic, Durga Puja festivities this year are also being tweaked to ensure social distancing at venue, live streaming of rituals and proper hygiene, starting Thursday.The district administration has allowed Navratri and Durga Puja functions to be organised in the city, but with limited attendees and have prohibited fairs, food stalls, exhibitions, rallies and processions until Diwali.Organisers of Durga Puja across the city will be live streaming the ceremonies on each of the five days of Puja. Cultural programmes, coordinated and rehearsed in-house, have also transitioned online. “We will have a digital Pujo in compliance with social distancing, but it will still be according to the almanac, right from Pushpanjali,” said Sraboni Bhattacharya, member, Bangiya Parishad Gurugram.Celebrations will be low-key in public areas as most organisers have prohibited physical visits, while some have set up applications and time slots for devotees to visit.According to the police, organisers have been directed not to allow visitors who are not wearing face masks and also arrange other sanitisation facilities at the venues. Thermal scanning is also must, the police said.The district administration has set strict rules for the Durga Puja celebration across the city.As per the guidelines issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, last week, it is imperative that suitable regulations are put in place and proper measures are taken during the celebration to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the venues. “Durga Puja pandals will be allowed to be set up only in temples and no pandal shall be allowed to be erected on and by the side of any road. We have not allowed setting up of any food stalls near pandals. Also, we have made all necessary arrangements with the organisers to ensure that immersion of the idols will be done with a minimum strength of devotees so as to avoid congestion and large gatherings at the immersion sites,” he said.Organisers of the pandal at DLF Phase-1 community centre, which is one of the most popular in the city, have turned to social media to meet people, prohibiting visits.Ambica Sachdeva, a resident of Block E of DLF Phase-1, said, “This time, we are trying to celebrate by not visiting pandals but meeting people digitally while being at home. There are no pandals this year in our area and all celebrations are only online.”Many in the developing sectors along the Dwarka Expressway and near Kherki Daula have cancelled their celebrations due to apprehensions of Covid-19 spread and are setting up rituals online.Alok Roy, president of Sushant Lok Durga Puja committee, said that this year, rituals will be limited to a few families in a hall. “Social and entertainment part will no longer organised in open and grand way. People are restricted to social media and only members will be allowed to visit the halls,” he said.Some organisers have roped in renowned artists to pull audiences online and celebrate the festival.Sraboni Bhattacharya, member, Bangiya Parishad Gurugram, said that they are celebrating Durga Puja in a new and different way, with most events being organised online. “There would be live streaming of the puja and pushpanjali, and we will enjoy a lineup of cultural programmes online. What we are missing though is catching up with friends, the ‘adda’ and the yummy ‘bhog’. It is sad that we cannot have ‘boron’ and bid adieu to Ma, and there will be no ‘sindur khela’ either. This year, I just pray to Ma Durga to keep everyone healthy and safe,” she said.Partha Dey, general secretary of Bangiya Parishad, said, “Our aim is to ensure the safety of all devotees and we should not get infected nor should others. We will adhere to the guidelines and maintain social distancing. We will celebrate a digital affair — pushpanjali will be offered online and people will not stand before ‘Ma Durga’ but will offer prayers from home through their mobile phones or computer screens.”However, the association has set up an application to allow visitors to book time slots for visits. “A distance of six feet is mandatory for all the visitors, no one is allowed to touch anything and sanitization is being carried out every two hours to ensure the safety of devotees and organisers. The members are allowed for physical presence through pre-booking but only once a day,” said Partha Dey.Khatri said there will be effective sanitisation of all premises, with particular focus on lavatories, hand and foot-washing areas. “No physical offerings like ‘prasad’ or ‘bhog’ will be allowed inside the pandals,” he said.The police has not received any application for setting up pandal this year and special teams have been formed from each police station to keep a check on puja halls.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that this year, the celebrations will be confined to association members of organising committee only. “We have not received any request for deployment of police personnel, unlike the other years. The organisers are not allowing even 100 devotees a day to the hall and they will have to keep us updated in case they increase the number,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-braces-for-low-key-durga-puja/story-r3rYgS9lMhJoLrYzdOgInN.html
21-10-2020||City||Farmers allow movement of trains: Ludhiana industrialists breathe a sigh of relief||The announcement made by farmers’ associations to allow movement of goods trains has come as relief for industrialists and traders in Ludhiana. Many of them were struggling to make ends meet amid rising cost of raw material and orders being cancelled by buyers due to delay in transportation. Industrialists had been urging the state government to intervene in the matter, as apart from increase in input cost, the production cycle of industrial units were also hit amid the farmers’ protests. Importers and exporters from Ludhiana have also welcomed the decision taken by the farmers’ associations.Rahul Ahuja, chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Punjab, said, “If import and export would stay disturbed for the coming days, many industrial units in the city would have to close down due to shortage of raw material. With no import of raw material, the production cycle was hit badly. Also, orders, especially those booked by customers from abroad, were being cancelled due to the delay. We had been urging the farmers’ associations to allow movement of goods trains and the announcement has come as a major relief for the industry. These agitations in the state also pushes away the investors, which will ultimately hit Punjab’s economy.”Harish Dua, president of the Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Association, said, “The transportation cost had increased as industrialists were being forced to move goods by road. It was costing us around Rs 20,000 more to transport goods to Mumbai port through road. Further, orders were being cancelled by foreign buyers due to delay.”At a time when the industry is already struggling to get back on track after lockdown, black marketing of raw material amid shortage of supply is also taking a toll on business as input cost has increased. Jagbir Sokhi, president of the Sewing Machine Development Cluster, said, “The sewing machine sector is facing shortage of raw material, including pig iron, as consignments are stuck in Ambala due to no movement of goods trains. Due to shortage of material in the market, black marketing has increased. Pig iron which was earlier available at Rs 28,200 per tonne, now costs Rs 41,000 per tonne. The industry was already reeling under losses and the input cost has further increased by over 20% due to the lockdown and ‘rail roko’ protests by farmers.”Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, “We hope that the business which was going through a slowdown will be back on track during the festival season.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-allow-movement-of-trains-ludhiana-industrialists-breathe-a-sigh-of-relief/story-rtpH6tvT2fTIlFm4yxAEXO.html
21-10-2020||City||Ludhiana: Sports bike robbery cracked with arrest of four||Zeroing in on robbers having a free run in the city, police have arrested four accomplices of notorious snatcher Lovedeep Singh, alias Sonu, and recovered 20 mobile phones, two motorcycles and two sharp-edged weapons from them.One of the two-wheelers – a Yamaha sports bike – was robbed from a realtor’s office on Jassiyan Road on October 9.Besides this incident, Lovedeep and his accomplices are also believed to be involved in a robbery bid at a currency exchange shop near Dharampura Chowk on October 5.Police have already announced a cash reward for any information that leads to Lovedeep’s arrest.His aides who were arrested on Wednesday have been identified as Raman Kumar of Peeru Banda, Salem Tabri; Ashish Kumar Sethi of Aman Nagar; Narinder Singh, alias Happy, of Bakipur village, Tarn Taran; and Amit Gupta of Aman Nagar.According to the police, the accused were involved in at least 20 incidents of snatching. “We are probing whether they also had a hand in the robbery attempt at the money exchange shop on October 5 or if Lovedeep targeted the trader with other men,” said inspector Satish Kumar, SHO, Division Number 3.He said Raman and Narinder were already facing trial in 15 cases of snatching, burglary and drug peddling.

21-10-2020||City||Ludhiana MC intensifies drive against single-use plastic||Struggling to impose a complete ban on the use of plastic bags for the last four years, the municipal corporation (MC) has once again decided to intensify a drive against the manufacturing of single-use plastic in the city.Working on the lines of Indore MC, the Ludhiana civic body has decided to implement a complete ban on manufacturing and use of plastic bags below the width of 50 microns in the city.Fine up to Rs 20,000 can be imposed depending upon the quantity of plastic bags confiscated. The decision was taken during a meeting wherein the committee members, who had recently visited Indore, gave a presentation to mayor Balkar Sandhu at his camp office on Wednesday. A committee comprising six officials had recently visited Indore to get an idea of the solid waste management in the cleanest city of the country.Ludhiana secured 34th rank among 47 cities with over 10 lakh population in the Swachh Survekshan 2020, while Indore stood at the first position for the fourth consecutive year.The MC team which had visited Indore included councillors Parvinder Lapran, Baljinder Bunti, Pankaj Kaka, councillor Sunita Rani’s son Deepak Sharma, MC Secretary Jasdev Sekhon, and senior assistant engineer Harpal Aujla. Councillor of ward number 74, Pankaj Sharma said, “It has been decided that MC will implement a complete ban on the use of plastic bags below the width of 50 microns. Use of plastic carry bags below 50-micron width is a major hurdle in the solid waste management and the plastic waste also chokes the sewer lines.”The officials also decided to develop a few city wards as model wards for setting an example for others. Sharma said that the committee members have also asked the mayor to deploy a nodal officer for implementing the ban.Sharma said, “A ban on the use of plastic bags has already been implemented in my ward and shopkeepers have been given 10 days to stop using plastic bags or challans would be imposed on the violators.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that there are a number of points on which the civic body can work upon but those would be implemented in phases. The civic body has decided to go strict against the use of plastic bags and the committee members have been asked to submit their recommendations in writing.The state government had imposed a complete ban on the use of plastic carry bags in April 2016, but the MC has been struggling to implement the same in the city. The drives initiated against the use of plastic carry bags got derailed due to political pressure or resentment shown by traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-intensifies-drive-against-single-use-plastic/story-9sCwfpuQiX0D5KqyEUWGzI.html

21-10-2020||Gurugram||Udyog Vihar, sectors 14 and 18 major pollution hot spots in the city, finds CPCB task force||Areas such as Udyog Vihar (1 and 4), sectors 14 and 18 are the major hot spots for air pollution in the city, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) task force that visited these areas on Tuesday and found deficiencies in terms of management of road dust and discharge of particulate matter in air through the dumping of construction and demolition waste (C&D) waste on the roadside.On Wednesday, the Gurugram’s air quality once again slipped into the ‘poor’ category with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 263 on CPCB’s index. The air quality worsened a day after it had recorded a ‘moderate’ AQI of 192. Air quality had been oscillating between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ categories for at least the past 10 days. Shiv Shanker Sharma, a member of the CPCB-led task force, said, “For the last three to four years, air quality monitoring surveys have been carried out where Udyog Vihar and sectors 14 and 18 have repeatedly emerged as pollution hot spots. These surveys take into account both observation as well as complaints regarding violations of anti-pollution measures. These areas have a high level of dust due to the digging up of roads and dumping of C&D waste.”CPCB has formed 50 teams for Delhi-NCR to give feedback on pollution control measures from October 15 till February 28. Out of these, three teams have been earmarked for Gurugram. According to Sharma, in Udyog Vihar, the team noticed heavy dust pollution due to dug-up roads for the installation of a gas pipeline and a fibre optic network. “The heavy traffic movement in these areas is also responsible for blowing up dust in the air,” said Sharma.Sharma added that they found sites where C&D waste was being dumped without being covered. “The agencies concerned have been advised to cover the dumping sites with shade to avoid dust pollution,” said Sharma. For sectors 14 and 18, he said, “Although these are residential sectors, C&D was found along the roadside. The loose soil in these areas was being discharged in the air as dust. The land-owning agencies have been informed to take action,” he said. Earlier, in September, CPCB asked the civic bodies of Delhi-NCR to initiate a special drive to remove waste (garbage and C&D) from open spaces. On October 16, CPCB directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to submit the action-taken report on the activities done so far to tackle the high levels of particulate matter in the air.Between September 15 and 21, CPCB deputed its team at high pollution zones for an assessment of the work done by local agencies in implementing CPCB guidelines. The teams visited Gurugram in the last week of September and observed inadequate action in various locations in terms of management of C&D waste, solid and industrial waste, road dust, construction, and other air polluting activities. According to them, an analysis of public complaints on social media indicated a higher percentage of open dumping of C&D waste and burning of garbage. An MCG official privy to the matter, said, “A meeting was held on October 19 with Bhure Lal, chairman, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA). He was satisfied with our report. The status will be reviewed again after 15 days.” Hari Om Attri, joint commissioner, MCG, who is also the nodal officer enforcement of measures from management of C&D waste, said, “More than 25,000 tonnes of C&D waste has been lifted since October 15, after the Grap measures kicked in. This year, overall 2.5 lakh metric tonnes has been lifted from various the city. At least 41 challans and fine of more than ₹1 lakh has been imposed since the implementation of Grap measures. We are even looking at prospect of recycling C&D waste for construction of roads and footpaths in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/udyog-vihar-sectors-14-and-18-major-pollution-hot-spots-in-the-city-finds-cpcb-task-force/story-x2ZceUnoqLBdtVSSrInWJM.html
21-10-2020||Gurugram||Pollution hot spots on major roads under the scanner||The Gurugram administration has identified 18 spots on major city roads across the city, which witness high vehicular pollution, and asked the personnel of traffic police and other departments concerned to take measures to manage the situation. Officials said the reason for high pollution at these spots is that heavy traffic movement and congestion is witnessed on these spots as these are located on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Sohna Road, Delhi-Jaipur highway and important sector roads.Following the directions issued by the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca), the district administration sent a letter to the traffic police last week, asking for a reduction of jams at these spots, more enforcement and increased presence of police personnel so that road congestion is cleared quickly. The 18 points include the Delhi-Gurugram border near Ambience Island, Iffco Chowk, Subash Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Umang Bhardwaj Chowk, Sohna Chowk, Kherki Daula toll plaza, Dwarka Expressway, Huda City Centre, Hamilton Court in DLF-4, Pataudi Road crossing on Dwarka Expressway, Rampura Flyover underpass and Bilaspur Chowk. The directions issued by the deputy commissioner, Gurugram, to curb pollution calls for stringent enforcement of pollution rules and checks on pollution certificates, wrong parking offences, ferrying of dangerous goods, validity of all vehicle-related certificates and impounding vehicles that are old and not allowed to operate under current pollution norms. The traffic police department said that following the directions of Epca and with measures under the Graded Action Response Plan (Grap) coming into force in the city, they have increased police presence at these pollution and traffic hot spots. Between October 15 and October 20, the police also issued 71 pollution-related penalties and 578 for wrong parking offence, said traffic officials. The main objective of their drive, said DK Bharadwaj, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), was to reduce congestion and ensure traffic movement remained smooth. “We have also increased the presence of traffic police personnel at these 18 pollution hot spots and the enforcement has been made strict. We are also conducting awareness among the vehicle owners to follow traffic rules,” said Bhardwaj.Bhardwaj said that they are keeping a watch on the traffic situation through CCTV cameras in real time, and action is taken immediately when congestion is reported at any spot. “No movement of vehicles which are beyond their life is being allowed,” he said, adding that they are working in tandem to curb vehicular and dust pollution on roads. The traffic police is also sharing the action taken report, on a daily basis, with the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said officials. As per the details shared by traffic police, the department has issued 681 penalties for pollution-related offences till the end of September, 18,543 for wrong parking, 24 for overloading and 1,238 to owners of vehicles whose road worthiness certificates were expired. The National Highways Authority of India, which has Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Dwarka Expressway and Sohna Road, under its jurisdiction, said that it has deployed water tankers to sprinkle water so that dust pollution can be reduced. “Water is being sprinkled at project sites and construction material is covered with green cloth to check dust,” said Shashi Bhushan, project director, Gurugram. To curb pollution at these congested stretches, transport experts say that apart from these measures, authorities should also look at staggering the timing for employees working from offices. Markets and commercial offices should be allowed to open on different days so that people making trips to the markets and offices are reduced. “The movement of vehicles should be allowed more in the day and less during evening hours so that pollutants can settle. The odd-even formula for vehicles and no private vehicle days should be observed barring emergency situations,” said Professor Sewa Ram, a transport expert with the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi. Sewa Ram also said that more enforcement will help in reducing congestion and it would reduce idling time, which causes more pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pollution-hot-spots-on-major-roads-under-the-scanner/story-5enaGIfX1XnUzYLhzcLgjM.html
21-10-2020||Gurugram||Five booked for Rs 2.4-crore insurance fraud||The police on Tuesday booked five persons for allegedly duping at least 27 people of more than Rs 2.4 crore in the last four months, on the pretext of premium payments for their insurance policies. The police said they have traced the fraudsters to remote areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and have dispatched personnel to make the arrests.According to the police, the fraudsters created fake email ids of a reputed city-based insurance company and forged their letterheads and logos to project authenticity. On the pretext of seeking premium repayments, they duped the people to make payments to their bank accounts. After receiving the money, they stopped taking the calls.A case under sections 419 (impersonation) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal code and Section 66 D of Information Technology was registered at the Cyber Crime police station after the police verified all complaints. The police said that insurance frauds have gone up this year, with 18 cases being reported so far in 2020, compared to four cases in 2019.The incident was reported to the police by a city-based insurance company, whose 27 customers complained to the company, which suspected foul play following an internal investigation. A complaint was made by a senior manager of the company to the police last month, following which a case of fraud was registered at the Cyber Crime police station.It is suspected that the fraudsters obtained the data through third-party agents or touts, the police said, although it is yet to be ascertained.Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that during the probe, they found that fraudsters were impersonating representatives of the insurance company to dupe existing customers and those showing an interest in buying a policy.The fraud victims said they started getting calls from the imposters from May, after they had skipped payment of the premium of their term insurance. “In June 2016, I bought a life term insurance policy, whose annual premium was due every June. I had paid a premium for two years consecutively. However, last year I skipped paying the premium and thought I will pay it fully in 2020,” one of the victims, who was duped of Rs 5 lakh, told the police in a statement.Goel said that the victims have shared all pertinent data — forged quotations, fake and fabricated renewal notices received by them, forged logo of the company and proofs of payment made to bank accounts.“A few customers (of the insurance company) have also shared screenshots of WhatsApp chats with the imposters. One of the customers has also shared an audio clip of the conversation with the imposter and one has shared a forged ID card purported to be issued by the complainant company. Records reveal that there are certain imposters who have been defrauding existing and new customers by pretending to be its employees,” he said.The police said this is not the only case and that more than six private insurance companies have contacted them with similar complaints.Police commissioner KK Rao said they have formed a team and involved their cybercrime investigators to probe the case. “We have taken all details from the company, bank accounts and the details of their cellphone numbers. The suspects switched off their mobile phones after making the calls but had the same mobile numbers, which they used every day for three months. So, it is earlier for us to identify their locations. We will arrest the suspects using technical surveillance soon, as teams have been left for six areas in UP and Bihar,” he said.Rao said they have duped more than 60 people as per the records they have recovered, but they are yet to ascertain exact details and that the company has received only 27 complaints so far.According to the investigators at the Cyber Crime police station, the number of people falling victim to online frauds has increased during the lockdown.“Mostly, people are using digital payment options without observing the necessary precautions, which makes them prone to online fraud. People are now glued to their phones and cybercriminals are taking advantage of this by posing as insurance representatives or e-commerce sellers,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-booked-for-rs-2-4-crore-insurance-fraud/story-3FdZ1axpCwbpObBKxsYI1O.html
21-10-2020||Gurugram||HSVP carries out demolition drive in Sector 57||Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Wednesday carried out a demolition drive in Sector 57 to clear out 30 plots on a piece of land, which have been encroached upon by private individuals over the last few years. The land, which was acquired by HSVP from local villagers, has been stuck in litigation for the last one-and-a-half decade. Last month, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave the order in HSVP’s favour. This has now enabled the authority to hand over the possession of these plots to the allottees who are the rightful owners, said HSVP officials. On Wednesday morning, a team of HSVP officials demolished 22 temporary residential structures, 50 tenements and two shops amid strong resistance and protest by residents and locals. Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP, Gurugram, said that these plots had been encroached upon. However, after the high court’s verdict, the plots will now be handed over to the rightful owners. “The enforcement team started the work to remove the encroachments in the morning,” said Kalia, adding that due to the HC verdict in its favour, the authority would be able to hand over more than 800 plots, which were earlier stuck due to litigation. The enforcement team was led by SK Rana, sub-divisional engineer, survey, and Kartar Singh, naib tehsildar, who was the duty magistrate, while a large police team supported the authority officials during the drive. Earlier on Tuesday, Kalia said encroachments were also removed from sectors 27 and sector 43 dividing roads. “A number of complaints had been made by residents regarding the encroachments on main roads. Action was taken against the violators and they would not be allowed on these roads again,” said Kalia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-carries-out-demolition-drive-in-sector-57/story-5suGsUxUtv13MY21vhqvdP.html
21-10-2020||Gurugram||Over 300 new Covid-19 cases reported after a month;tally crosses 26,000-mark||The city reported 304 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, after a month of reporting less than 300 daily cases. Health officials said that they will have to observe the new figures for the next two to three days to understand the impact of the festival season on the Covid count.The last time when the count new Covid-19 cases had reached 314 was on September 21. In the first half of September, more than 300 new infections were emerging every day. It even crossed the 400-mark on September 20. A slight decline was visible in the last week of September, with cases hovering at 280. In October, the number daily cases remained at an average of 260, according to the health department officials.On Wednesday, with 304 new cases, the total count of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 crossed the 26,000-mark. Till now, 26,176 patients have been affected by Covid-19. Out of these 195 have died due to the illness, with nearly 73% deaths being reported due to co-morbidity. Presently, there are 2,424 are active cases. Among them, 153 are seriously ill patients undergoing treatment in hospitals, while 2,259 are in home isolation and 12 in district Covid Care Centres. “The total positivity rate of the district is eight percent. There has been an increase in the number of new cases as almost 30 cases have been added after pending police verification,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to him incomplete addresses given at the time of testing creates problem in identifying cases and their contact tracing. It takes a day or two for the police to trace these cases, after which they are added to the list. When asked about the impact on the positivity rate due to the ongoing Navratri festival and people thronging temples and markets, Yadav, said, “The team will get a better idea on Saptmi and Maha Ashtami (auspicious days of Navratri). The numbers may increase but it will be difficult to predict now. Therefore, we will observe the situation till the next week. Accordingly, the department will work upon the strategy.” Currently, over 3,000 tests are being conducted every day, with more than 2,000 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and nearly 850 antigen tests. Taking note of the festival season, the health department has deployed two testing vans to conduct Covid-19 testing outside crowded markets and shopping malls from 5pm to 8pm. Teams are covering nearly 20 sites through these evening camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-300-new-covid-19-cases-reported-after-a-month-tally-crosses-26-000-mark/story-ZGp5cO0fDJvbb24GYVYLcP.html
21-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG to use C&D waste in construction of roads, footpaths||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is considering the possibility of using construction and demolition (C&D) waste recovered from Bandhwari landfill in the construction of roads and footpaths across the city, said officials on Wednesday. The matter was proposed during a meeting of the finance and contract committee (F&CC) on October 16 and received in-principle approval.As per MCG officials, three types of waste are separated from solid waste with the help of trommel screening machines at the Bandhwari landfill. C&D waste constitutes one of such waste materials. Currently, the civic body’s concessionaire is paying a third-party agency to clear the C&D waste from the landfill.MCG officials said instead of disposing of the waste, it can be incorporated by the civic body itself and used as a raw material while laying the base layer of roads and footpaths. “The matter was put forward for discussion before the F&CC committee and was verbally approved. We are now working on compiling a proposal and sending it to senior MCG officials for consideration,” said Satyawan Singh, superintending engineer (SE), MCG. Currently, the MCG purchases raw material at a rate of nearly ₹40 per cubic feet. Officials further said, at its optimum capacity, the trommel machine can separate daily waste of around 50-60 tons of C&D waste, which, if used in road and footpath construction, will not only help in recycling of waste but also save the MCG their funds for purchasing of raw material.As per a senior MCG official privy to the matter, when waste is lifted from different parts of the city, C&D waste often gets mixed up with wet, dry, and other types of waste before being eventually dumped at the landfill. First, the bio-remediation process is initiated at the landfill that involves spraying of liquid with a high content of bacteria that decomposes organic material.After 3-4 weeks of this process, the mixed waste is then screened via the trommel machine, which segregates waste into different types, including C&D waste, manure, and residual derived fuel (RDF).“The MCG’s proposal will club the utilisation of all three wastes together. We’ll have to wait and see whether one, two, or all three of them get approval at the same time so that the next steps can be initiated,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.Around 850 tonnes of C&D waste is dumped every day in the city, according to an estimate by the civic body.“C&D waste layers are ideal for footpaths, cycle tracks, village, and internal city roads. However, these cannot be used for roads which have heavy vehicle movement, such as master roads and highways as stretches with layers of C&D waste tend to have a low-weight bearing capacity. In such stretches, roads can easily sink or be riddled with potholes if the base layer consists of C&D waste. Hence, MCG needs to be cautious and selective when finalising stretches where they intend to use C&D waste,” said Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi.Recycling of C&D waste is not an entirely novel venture for the MCG. On December 5, last year, MCG’s C&D plant opened in Basai. Depending on the C&D load, the plant is capable of processing 300-1,800 tonnes of waste every day.The plant recycles items such as kerbstones, tiles, pavement blocks, concrete bricks, and concrete aggregate products such as gravel, sand, stones, concrete, items primarily used in construction. As part of its agreement with its concessionaire, MCG receives around 10% commission fee for the sale of any product processed and recycled at the plant.Notably, as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures, the MCG has collected nearly 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of C&D waste from different parts of the city last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-use-c-d-waste-in-construction-of-roads-footpaths/story-NAJJICVvH52jHAMeCsIwQL.html

Faculty from the department of endocrinology, DMCH conducted online lectures to create awareness among the public about proper intake of iodine for better health. Consumption of adequate quantity of iodine is essential for overall well-being, advised Dr Parminder Singh, professor and head of the endocrinology department, DMCH. Dr Singh said that Iodine is one of the essential dietary minerals that is required in the body for normal thyroid function, growth, and development. If a person suffers from Iodine deficiency, it can lead to a number of health conditions that can even be fatal. “The body does not make iodine, but it is an essential part of your diet. A certain amount of iodine is always required in the body in order to create a vital chemical known as the thyroid hormone,” he said.Professor of endocrinology, Dr Naveen Mittal said that proper functioning of thyroid hormones affects all the cells in the body and the hormones are also important for the proper development of cells. These hormones play a crucial role in increasing the metabolic rate of the body, regulate the growth of long bones, and help in the development of the brain.Assistant professor in the department of endocrinology, DMCH, Dr Surabh Arora said, “One of the main sources of iodine is obviously the salt. Apart from salt, milk, and egg yolks are another source of iodine. These are good for children as these provide another essential brain nutrient for them too. Also do not ignore the intake of vegetables and fruits like sweet potato, onion, spinach, banana, and cantaloupe that contains iodine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmch-holds-online-lectures-to-observe-world-iodine-deficiency-day/story-5Gm3b2XZosBneDxGq3KciO.html

The councillors said that residents are raising a hue and cry over clogged sewer lines, potholed roads, non-functional streetlights among other issues, but the civic body is paying no heed to the problem. Rather the mayor is making excuses to further delay the general house meeting, they said. Leading the delegation of councillors, leader of opposition in the MC general house, Harbhajan Dang said, “We have been demanding that the mayor should call a meeting so that problems being faced by residents can be resolved. We had also met the mayor in this regard on September 29, but no announcement has been made by him so far.”“Now, we have given an ultimatum of 15 days to the mayor to call a general house meeting or the party will raise an agitation against the civic body and state government,” said Dang. Councillor Jaspal Singh said that contractors have also been delaying the development projects and many road samples collected by the MC in the past have failed the quality test, but the civic body has failed to take action against such contractors. “A meeting of the MC general house should be conducted at the earliest”, he said.Councillors and SAD leaders including Sarabjeet Singh Laddi, Paramjeet Garcha, Surjeet Singh Rai, Manpreet Singh Manna, Balwinder Shanky, Nirmal Singh among others were also a part of the delegation. Covid test necessary for councillors: MayorMayor Balkar Sandhu said that he will announce the meeting of the MC general house but every councillor will have to get a Covid-19 test as per the guidelines issued by the state government. Dang, however, slammed the claim of the Mayor stating that the assembly session was held with MLAs undergoing the Covid-19 test. “If the mayor is concerned over the spread of the virus, then the meeting can be organised at Guru Nanak Stadium, where it would be easy to maintain social distancing,” he said.Dang said that the mayor is making excuses to further delay the meeting as the civic body has failed to work efficiently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-asks-ludhiana-mayor-to-hold-mc-house-meet-within-15-days-or-face-stir/story-fDNSG5ka1QmSo1yRISraUO.html
21-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad district official rush to Karhera after 236 Dalits ‘convert’ to Buddhism||A controversy has broken out over 236 Dalits from a colony in Ghaziabad’s Karhera allegedly converting to Buddhism to protest the Hathras gang-rape and murder case, following which district administration officials rushed to take stock of the situation on Wednesday. Those who allegedly “converted” were said to be residents of Valmiki Basti, near the Hindon airbase. They claimed they converted on October 14 to seek justice for the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras who was allegedly gang-raped and later died of her injuries last month.District officials, however, said there had been no conversion and that when they visited the locality, people raised issues such as jobs, power supply and housing.Pawan Valmiki, 27, who says he has changed his surname to “Boudh” after the “conversion”, said more people would convert in case their 16-point agenda of demands, which they claimed they had submitted to the delegation, were not met within a week. “Justice for our sister (Hathras victim) who was murdered is a major concern for us. About 236 people converted to Buddhism on the evening of October 14. In coming time, more people will get converted in case the victim of Hathras case doesn’t get justice,” said Pawan, adding other demands were indeed related to other issues. “We don’t have a community centre here for functions. We have also not received benefits of PM Awas Yojna and Ujjwala Schemes. People from Dalit community are basically sidelined. The MLA, district magistrate and senior superintendent of police heard us and promised that the issues will be resolved,” he said, adding that he founded the ‘Navyuvak Sangharsh Sewa Samiti’ to demand their rights.The Hathras case, which sparked widespread outrage after the police forcibly cremated the victim’s body, is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Vir Singh, another resident, said that people of his caste felt pressured and that they were appalled by the events that took place at Hathras. “If we do not get justice this time, we will search for some other way. It is likely that more people will convert. We want justice and our youth need jobs,” he said. “There is lot of resentment in our community. So, slowly, we all will get converted to Buddhism,” said Rajjo, another resident. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said prohibitory orders were in place at Karhera since the pandemic struck, making it impossible that 236 people to gather for a “conversion” ceremony. However, an additional district magistrate was inquiring into it, he added.“We spoke to the residents there, including Pawan Valmiki. They raised issues such as the lack of jobs, electricity, housing, among others. He claimed that some locals had threatened them. The senior superintendent of police will take appropriate action. Pawan told us that the decision (to convert) was taken in the heat of the moment. But he did not raise the Hathras case with us,” said Pandey. “They did not hand over any letter about a 16-point agenda.”Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma, who also accompanied the district administration, said there was a political conspiracy behind the entire issue. “We have come to know of involvement of people from a political party. During the meeting, people raised their local issues like housing, ration cards, etc. There is no conversion,” he said.Community meets KejriwalPawan Valmiki on Wednesday met with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the Capital. Pawan said he is the founder-president ‘Navyuvak Sangharsh Sewa Samiti’ formed to fight for Dalit rights. He had earlier worked as a housekeeping staff at a highrise in Mohan Nagar but lost his job during the lockdown. “My father is bed ridden due to ailment for about 5-6 years and I lost the job. I have to feed my family which also include a son and a daughter. Our electricity bills are mounting and can be disconnected any day,” he said. “Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal sent a car for us and five of us went to meet him at his official residence. He shared his concerns over the Hathras incident but also said that we should not have converted. He also assured us that he will come at Karhera in couple of days to meet us.”.Later, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh tweeted pictures of the meeting and wrote, “There is no justice for Dalits under the rule of Yogi Adityanath. They are being raped and murdered. Angry after the Hathras scandal, several from the Valmiki community left Hinduism. They shared their pain with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-district-official-rush-to-karhera-after-236-dalits-convert-to-buddhism/story-B06l92ItJVzXwXsbnkFv1K.html
21-10-2020||Noida||Over 90% Covid-19 patients in home isolation cured, shows data||Manish Kumar had a few hours of anxiety after testing positive for Covid-19 on September 21. But, after receiving a call from the integrated control room, the 34-year-old resident of Sector 77 found himself in a comfort zone. The doctor from other side told him not to worry. “His voice was so soothing that I got sure that I can defeat this deadly virus at my home,” he said. After a few hours, a health worker came to his house, gave him a pulse oximeter and some medicines, and briefed him and his family about the home isolation protocols. From the next day, Manish was in regular communication with the doctors and other medical staff. “They used to call me at least twice a day to know about my pulse rate, oxygen saturation level, body temperature and urine output. Phone calls from them were a routine affair for me till I defeated Covid-19 in 14 days,” he said. Manish, however, is not an exception. Vibha Choudhary, a 55-year-old homemaker from Sector 51 who tested positive also narrates a similar story. “For the first time in my life, I’ve seen that doctors and medical officials can be so co-operative. And, that too without taking any money,” she said. As per data from the Gautam Budh Nagar health department, 1,955 Covid-19 patients out of a total 2,153 till October 21, who were allowed home isolation in the district, have been cured. And since July 25, when home isolation facility for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients was permitted by the state government, no such patient has died in the district, officials said. GB Nagar district additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Lalit Kumar, who is also the in-charge of home isolation in the district, said that a team of doctors and paramedics takes the stock of home isolated patients at least twice in a day between 9 am and 8 pm. “We also arrange motivational calls for them to boost up their morale as any negativity in the mind can make Covid-19 infection lethal. A patient is shifted to Covid-dedicated hospitals, in case the pulse rate is alarmingly low or temperature goes very high. Also, if the oxygen saturation rate goes below 95%, we immediately shift the patient to hospital from home isolation. So far, we have referred 68 home isolated patients to different Covid-19 hospitals, but all of them recovered soon. None of the home isolated patients in the district has succumbed to the infection,” the ACMO said. About the eligibility for home isolation, the ACMO said that person must be certified an asymptomatic case and should have adequate facility at home for self isolation. “The patient must have a caretaker, who will be available with the patient round the clock. Patients should also agree to monitor their health and updated status must be shared with the district surveillance officer. It is mandatory to follow home quarantine protocols for other members of the patient’s family,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-90-covid-19-patients-in-home-isolation-cured-shows-data/story-QA09rHcH9dDMW5moUZl9mN.html
21-10-2020||Noida||Covid-19 cases dip as Ghaziabad crosses 17,000-mark||The district has witnessed a dip in the number of average Covid-19 cases per day in the current month. The first 18 days in September saw an average of 204 positive cases per day, while during the same period this month the cases have come in at an average of about 155 per day, according to data from the district health department. On Wednesday, Ghaziabad reported 42 new Covid-19 cases, taking the district’s total tally to 17,492.Unlike the previous instances when every lot of 1,000 cases was being reported in a gap of about four to six days ever since the district completed 10,000 Covid-19 cases (on September 10), the latest 1,000 cases, when the district achieved a total of 17,000 cases, has come in a longer duration of eight days, as per the figures of the state control room. The district achieved 16,000 cases on October 10 and reached the 17,000-mark on October 18. Officials said that the declining trend is encouraging. “The cases are now coming in at a slower pace, and we expect that there will be more decrease in numbers in coming days. We are still emphasizing on better surveillance, contact tracing and early referral of patients. Further, there is also strict adherence to social distancing and wearing of face masks so that the infection do not spread during the festival season,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Between September 1 and 18, the district conducted 64,429 tests, while it increased the testing and conducted 78,321 tests during the first 18 days of October. Experts, however, said that there have been no exceptional works done when it comes to tackling Covid-19. “There is an overall trend of decline in cases. It seems to be a natural phenomenon with the virus that reached its peak and is now on declining trend. It could be possible that it can come in waves and at present it reached the peak of a wave and declining,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “However, it is a time when we need to be more alert as the virus has not died down and will stay till a susceptible population is available to it. We must also improve health care infrastructure in remote areas to tackle it if it moves to such places,” he added. Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad, said that the reasons for decline in cases could be manifold. “It (reasons) may range from lesser testing to herd immunity getting developed in community. But it needs to be probed more. On the other hand, there are chances that the cases may increase in winters along with increase in air pollution. In such times, we need to take every preventive measure,” Agarwal said. Meanwhile, officials of the Ghaziabad health department said that they will now be conducting about 3,100 tests per day as directed by the state officials. “Earlier, we were told by the nodal officer to conduct 6,000 tests per day. During a recent video conference, we were told by the state officials to stick to daily target of 3,100 tests which includes 2,000 through the rapid antigen kits. So, we will try to keep the 2,000 tests with the rapid kits while we may increase RT-PCR testing in coming days,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-cases-dip-as-ghaziabad-crosses-17-000-mark/story-nPKHldmYaiwitH1Hcefj2M.html

I did not buy onions as the Navratra festival is going on. The price rise has affected many people, specially the weaker section of society. This should be checked,” he said. Raju Kumar, a vegetable seller at Indira Market, said that prices have increased due to the coronavirus outbreak and high demand. “We buy vegetables from mandis at Bhangel and Phase 2 in Noida, and Azadpur and Okhla in Delhi. In wholesale markets, the prices have increased and hence we have to raise the rates too,” he said. The rates of other vegetables have also increased. Sunil Kumar, another vegetable seller, said that tomatoes are being sold at ₹60 per kg and cauliflower ₹80 per kg. “The vegetable market is down since the coronavirus outbreak. We have to manage the transportation cost and manpower. Prices have increased due to low supply,” he said. However, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked the district administrations across the state to check the rates of potatoes and onions, saying that the rates of these vegetables in the wholesale mandis are significantly low. Manoj Singh, additional chief secretary, UP government, on October 10 wrote a letter to the district administrations over price rise of potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. “In mandis, the prices per quintal of potatoes are ₹2,320-2,820; tomatoes ₹2,000-₹3,646; and onions ₹1,430-3,380. The local price rise is due to hoarding and black-marketing of goods,” the letter stated. Noida city magistrate Umashankar Singh said, “We have not received any complaint from residents about the price hike. We will talk to the different stakeholders to check the prices of these vegetables.” Santosh Kumar, secretary, wholesale sabzi mandi at Noida Phase 2, said that the prices of vegetables have increased in the past three months. “Most of the vegetables in Noida markets come from other states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The import is less due to adverse weather conditions,” he said. Kumar said that the price also depends on the quality of vegetables. “The wholesale rate of onion is ₹40; potato ₹30 and tomato ₹25 per kg,” he said.Suhas LY, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate, said that he has received the government order on vegetable price hike. “We will launch an enforcement drive and take action against the violators, if any,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-prices-of-potatoes-onions-go-through-the-roof/story-RyH6xDZH6KNdjlfHXIYC5K.html
21-10-2020||Noida||Yamuna authority to float infrastructure bonds to raise funds||The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) has decided to raise funds via infrastructure bonds for development projects and land acquisition around the Noida International Greenfield airport coming up at Jewar. This is the first time in Uttar Pradesh that a land owning agency will raise funds this way.While officials said that banks were eager to lend to Yeida after the airport project was approved, the authority believes raising funds through bonds could get it low cost funds.Many critical infrastructure projects are expected to be built around the Jewar airport. A high-speed Metro line, an extension of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and other road projects are part of the plan, which is expected to cost around ₹10,000 crore. Jewar is 70km away from Delhi and 30 km away from Greater Noida and hence, these links are critical in providing connectivity.“We have hired a Brickwork Ratings that will assess and rate us. It has been mandated to complete the assessment in next two months. Once the ratings will be out we can start raising funds via these instruments. But the rating should be in at least category A or better with A+++ to start raising funds with infrastructure bonds,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of the Yedia. “The industrial bodies in Hyderabad and Pune are already selling infrastructure bonds to fund their projects.”Yeida expects that its market value would have increased after the Switzerland company Zurich International AG signed the agreement to build the airport. Work is scheduled to start by the middle of next year and completed by 2023.The Uttar Pradesh government on April 24, 2001, had established Yeida to set up industries to generate employment and develop urban areas along the expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra. Around 200,000 hectares from 1,187 villages of six districts -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra -- were notified under Yeida. So far, it has acquired around 16,000 hectares of land for its various schemes.In 2012, it borrowed around ₹3,000 crore from banks and the Noida authority at a rate of 9.5% and 12%, repectively.“Before the airport project was approved, banks were reluctant to provide loan to us, but now everyone wants to give. However, going for bonds will make available funds at lower interest and investors also can get better returns,” said Singh.“The government agencies can go to raise funds via selling bonds. In these bonds the public can directly invest infrastructure projects and earn safely,” said Neeresh Kumar chartered account and expert in finances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yamuna-authority-to-float-infrastructure-bonds-to-raise-funds/story-e9733isWdV82Jmwf6igE2N.html

HT on Wednesday found instance of stubble burning in an area near river Hindon behind Mohan Nagar. So far, there have been two major instances of stubble burning in the district in which one was spotted by HT team on October 14 at Kushaliya near Dasna. After verification, the officials suspended the local Lekhpal and also lodged an FIR against the erring person. In another, the officials of the pollution board found instance of stubble burning at Muradnagar and an FIR was also registered in the case on October 17. On Wednesday afternoon, another instance of stubble burning was spotted near Mohan Nagar. When the HT team went to get to know why those who were putting fire to the stubble were doing so, they turned aggressive and did not offer any comment. “We will get the instance verified and will take up suitable action if the instance of stubble burning has taken place. We will also levy penalty in the instance which will be based on the plot area. On our part, we are strictly monitoring the instances of stubble/garbage burning and other pollution generating factors,” said Utsav Sharma, the regional officer of the UP pollution control board. According to official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory – a Division of Agricultural Physics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, the Ghaziabad district during the period October 1 to November 30 had witnessed 17 instances of stubble burning in 2019. “During a video-conferencing held on Wednesday, the chairperson of the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority [Epca] appreciated our efforts and has asked us to step up vigilance to tackle pollution in coming days,” Sharma, added. He said that Bhure Lal, the Epca chairperson, has asked the officials for an action taken report with respect to previous issues prevailing at Kaushmabi and Bulandshahr Road Industrial Area. The pollution board officials also added that they penalised seven instances for ₹50000 each at Mohan Nagar, Sahibabad, Vasundhara, and Krishna Enclave among others where the construction material was laying in open. “As part of our enforcement drive, we demolished 109 illegal factories in Loni which were indulged in works related to operation of furnace, extraction of chemicals, etc. Further, we have also completed the verification of 13 instances of bigger construction sites where the UPPCB had directed for conduct of self-audit and installation of CCTV cameras. One of these was found erring and a penalty of Rs 5 lakh was recommended at a construction site in Morta near Delhi Meerut Road,” Sharma, added. He added that the verification of the rest of 37 sites, which either completed the self-audit or installation of CCTV cameras or both, is under process.

PVVNL chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said the discom regularly inspects meters of heavy load connections. “We have identified 66 feeders, out of 76 in urban areas, that report line loss of over 50%. Prima facie, it appears power theft is the main reason behind this mounting AT & C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) loss. We have started checking the meters of consumers with heavy loads in areas where electricity is supplied by these feeders,” he said. Singh said the overall line loss in Noida was around 18%, earlier the state’s power minister Shrikant Sharma had directed officials to bring this down to below 15%. Singh said the ‘faulty’ feeders have been supplying power to around 70,000 consumers mostly from urban villages or developing areas, particularly located on the banks of Yamuna and Hindon rivers. “We have found that power theft is rampant in villages like Wajidpur, Chaura, Jhundpura, Sadarpur, Chhalera, Salarpur, Bhangel and Gejha. Our officials have already started raiding meters of consumers in those areas,” he said. When asked about the possible connivance of power officials in the losses, Singh said, “We are looking into this matter also. If officials are found guilty, action will be taken against them,” he said. The discom has also started disconnection drive against 60,000 defaulters, who have yet not cleared their pending dues of electricity bills of Rs 150 crores. “So far, we have disconnected power lines of over 7,000 defaulters,” the chief engineer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-85-power-feeders-in-noida-s-urban-areas-cause-heavy-line-loss/story-A8iTXRInnuY8ntDApsgHBN.html

Sub-inspector Sandeep Kaur was absconding for the last 13 days. Senior superintendent of police (SSP-rural) Dhruv Dahiya said she was nabbed from near Dhirowal Bet village under the Shri Hargobindpur police station.

In the suicide note, the jeweller stated that he was being blackmailed and threatened by the woman SI, a resident of Nawan Pind. Two cases under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code were registered against the SI and her friends at Mohkampura and Jandiala police stations of Amritsar. On Tuesday, the police had booked three people, including a Punjab Police constable, for sheltering the sub-inspector. On Monday, Dahiya had initiated a departmental inquiry against Jandiala deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sukhwinderpal Singh, besides suspending Mehta police station in-charge Satpal Singh for negligence in arresting the SI. “Sandeep had taken ₹17-18 lakh from me and was demanding more. She threatened to kill me if I failed to pay the money. There are screenshots of messages in my phone that will make it clear that she was pressuring me to kill Baljit Singh, her former friend. She also tried to pressure me to kill one Navdeep Sandhu and his wife,” the Jeweller’s suicide note read.

Elected members of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Wednesday demanded general body and standing committee meetings to be allowed at PMC headquarters. As the state government instructed to conduct online meetings on the background of Covid-19, PMC has been holding general body meetings online since last four months. Elected members from all parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, said that they are not getting a chance to raise various issues. Hence, it is necessary to organise meetings in person. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The city was in the grip of the pandemic since last seven months. Now the virus cases are coming down. Hence, all party leaders, including me, would visit Mumbai and request the chief minister to allow us to hold general body meeting at PMC headquarters.” Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal said, “Administration would put the elected members’ demand in front of the state government. We still have instructions to organise the general body meetings online.” Opposition party leader in PMC Deepali Dhumal said, “Pune zilla parishad is organising online meetings better that the municipal corporation. Many elected members are not getting a chance to put forth the issues of their respective wards at the meets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/elected-members-demand-meetings-at-pmc-headquarters/story-yBsrESeG19Q23TFuBW1vqK.html

However, on Tuesday, the students and police clashed at the university campus when the former tried to meet the vice-chancellor.While interacting with the media, the Congress MLA alleged that HPU had become an arena of RRS politics.

21-10-2020||Pune||Nine more arrested in Rs 20 crore MD seizure case||The crime branch officials of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police arrested nine more persons, including a Nigerian national and a Chhota Rajan aide, in connection with the Rs 20 crore mephedrone (MD) racket that was busted earlier this month. The accused arrested by police used to manufacture drugs at a factory in Ranjangaon MIDC and sold them at high prices in various markets in Pune and Mumbai. While the PCMC police have already seized mephedrone (MD) worth Rs 20 crore in the market, other material worth Rs 90 lakh was confiscated and properties worth Rs 75 lakh has been attached this week. PCMC police chief Krishna Prakash said that the arrested persons had planned to start the second drug manufacturing factory in Palghar district of Thane and had bought two-acre land from the proceeds which they had earned by selling the banned 112kg MD. “Earlier, we had arrested five persons with 20 kg MD worth Rs 20 crore on October 7. After that we had formed six teams to further investigate the case and unearthed the racket,” said Prakash. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the accused had conspired to manufacture MD at a defunct factory, Sanyog Biotech Pvt Ltd, at Ranjangaon MIDC. They had manufactured 132kg of MD in December 2019 of which they sold 112kg and 20kg has been seized from their possession. The kingpin behind the drugs racket has been identified Tushar Suryakant Kale, who is a resident of Borivali and has been linked to the Chhota Rajan gang and another notorious criminal Rakesh Shrikant Khanivdekar alias Rocky of Vasai. It is a major breakthrough and such crackdowns will continue to break the back of the criminal syndicates operating in the region, said Prakash. Among the nine fresh arrests, police have apprehended a Nigerian national identified as Jubu Ukodo, a resident of Vasai, who has been charged with selling the 112kg of MD. He had earlier served 10 years’ imprisonment in Kolhapur jail in a drugs case. He has also been accused of tampering with a visa document and a separate case will be filed against him, investigators said. On October 7, the large scale racket was busted after senior police inspector Shriram Pol had received a tip off regarding the operations of the syndicate. Following the input, the police team had nabbed Anandgir Madhugir Gosavi (25), Chetan Fakkad Dandavate (28), Sanjiv Kumar Bansi Raut (44), Akshay Shivaji Kale (25), and Tausif Hasan Mohammad Taslim (31), on Chakan-Shikrapur road wherein 20kg of MD were seized from their possession. Akshay Kale had kept the drugs at his house and they were seized while he was going to sell them in the market. As the investigation progressed, the PCMC police arrested Kiran Rajguru, Ashok Sankpal and Kiran Kale who informed them that drugs were manufactured at Sanyog Biotech Pvt Ltd in Rajangaon MIDC. Accordingly, the factory was raided, contraband recovered and sealed. Tushar Kale and Khanvidekar emerged as the gang leaders and separate teams were deployed who searched for them at different places in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Vasai, Nasik and Palghar. Tushar Kale and Rocky had planned about setting up a drug factory despite being in jail and had hired Ashok Sankpal’s Sanyog Biotech company, which was defunct. Kiran Kale who works as a director with another company in the same area had intervened with Sankpal and the other accused in the case . A meeting was held at his office where it was decided to produce MD at the rate of Rs 60,000 per kg. Tushar Kale had paid Rs 67 lakh as advance money for buying a large quantity of drugs. The police have frozen all their bank accounts and also attached two-acre land in Palsai village in Palghar district .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/nine-more-arrested-in-rs-20-crore-md-seizure-case/story-lcQmY4BAVSxvc2t5GRgvzO.html
21-10-2020||City||Punjab bills fail to cheer up cotton growers||BATHINDA Unmoved by the Punjab assembly’s bill assuring MSP (minimum support price) only for paddy and wheat, farmers in the cotton-growing belt feel that the proposed initiative would derail crop diversification initiatives.This season, Punjab set a record by bringing 5.01 lakh hectares under cotton cultivation, which is the highest since 2010-11 kharif or summer-sown crop season. Official sources said the record was achieved by sustained efforts made to motivate farmers to get out of conventional cropping pattern for judicious use groundwater.But farmers like Gurjit Singh Romana of Danewala Satkosi village in Fazilka district said the inclusion of only two crops for assured minimum rates is a cruel joke with the farming community. “The government should make assured MSP purchase for all crops a legal right of farmers,” he said.Impressed with state government’s initiative on crop diversification, Romana volunteered to sow maize on five acres and on other 15 acres, he continued with cotton.“Cotton is being purchased by private players at about ₹4,800/quintal while the MSP is ₹5,745/quintal with 8% moisture. Similarly, maize has an MSP of ₹1,850 quintal while no buyer is offering more than ₹1,200. I feel cheated for opting for crop diversification. The state government’s claim of calling Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, a ‘historic move’ is a shallow statement until farmers are assured the best rates,” said Romana.Official sources said of nearly 43-lakh quintal cotton arrived in the market last year, nearly 65% was bought by private buyers below the MSP while rest was purchased by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI).“Of 5.36 lakh quintal cotton arrived this year till yesterday, 2.05 lakh quintal was sold below the MSP. It is for the second consecutive year that farmers are being paid less for the cash crop that is an economical backbone of Malwa districts,” says an official. Criticising the bill, another farmer Jagjit Dhaliwal of Acha Rikki village in Fazilka said the bill doesn’t mean much as farmers are already being paid MSP on wheat and non-basmati varieties of paddy. Proposed legal action against those buying wheat-paddy offer no solution to the farmers who sow other crops but get exploited at the hands of the traders, he added. Dhaliwal has sown cotton on six acres and the private players started offering ₹4,800 per quintal at the start of this month even as the rate of the natural fibre has gone up to ₹5,500, still short of the MSP.“Farmers growing wheat and non-basmati rice always are paid at least the MSP. This year, I was paid ₹1,935/quintal by a private trader, ₹10 more than the MSP. But farmers contributing to diversified cultivation need support and assured minimum rates. In fact, assured MSP is a sham political slogan, farmers actually need assured rates on the basis of cost input calculated in the report Dr MS Swaminathan on National Commission on Farmers to enhance profitability,” said Dhaliwal.Kanwaljit Singh, a progressive from Bathinda’s Dialpura Bhai Ka village, said if the state government wants farmers to only grow paddy, why should they risk venturing into cultivating maize of cotton.“I have six-acre land under cotton and this year, I experimented drip irrigation on one acre. As I took my produce to the mandi in the adjoining Kotkapura town of Faridkot district, traders paid me ₹4,600/quintal, a short of over ₹1,000,” he said.Noted agricultural economist Dr SS Johl said proposing assured rates only for two crops is meaningless. “The state may have limited resources but agencies like Markfed should be financially strengthened to come to the rescue of cotton growers whenever private buyers pay less than the MSP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-bills-fail-to-cheer-up-cotton-growers/story-42XG77yiyKm4JLqwUTu4eN.html

The air and noise pollution caused by the firecrackers also affect the lives of animals, birds and other living beings on earth,” the Directorate of Education (DoE) said in a letter to the school principals.“The ailing and old persons are all the more prone to catch different allergies and diseases caused by pollution. During the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, ensuring better ambient air quality is essential since respiratory ailment is one of the major symptoms in corona patients and bursting of firecrackers can deteriorate air quality,” it added.The department has directed the schools to sensitise the students about the ill-effects of bursting firecrackers and encourage them to celebrate the festivals by lighting candles, electric fancy lights, earthen lamps and keeping the environment neat and clean.“Students should be motivated to ‘say no to firecrackers’. In addition to this, heads of the schools should direct the teachers to motivate the students to adopt safer and eco-friendly measures to celebrate Diwali and other festivals in a different way, instead of bursting firecrackers.“In view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, all the schools are closed for students and hence, all the heads of schools are hereby directed to utilise the WhatsApp groups to share the above information with the students to follow at home,” the DoE said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 268 at 10 am on Wednesday, while on Tuesday, it was 223.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-directs-schools-to-sensitise-students-against-bursting-firecrackers-amidst-dropping-air-quality/story-7XuVQfDOA3LhvXo8X4gqhO.html

During this campaign, we want active participation of every citizen and the goal of this campaign is to bring down vehicular pollution,” Rai said.If two crore population of Delhi contributes responsibly in ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign, then vehicle pollution in the city can be reduced by 15 to 20 per cent, the environment minister said.“About one crore vehicles are registered in Delhi, which on an average burn fuel in Delhi for about 15 to 20 minutes per day at the red light. The purpose of this ‘Red Light on, Gaadi Off’ campaign is to stop fuel burning from vehicles standing at the traffic signals of Delhi,” Rai added. “This entire campaign is voluntary, the people of Delhi have to voluntarily join the campaign.”As many as 2,500 civil defence volunteers have been assigned on the ground at 100 major traffic signals in Delhi in collaboration with the traffic police for the campaign.“These volunteers will make people aware of this campaign through placards.

21-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police cop educates underprivileged kids under open sky school||Sitting under the open sky, with books in their hands and the yearning to learn, dozens of young children throng the school, run on rug covered flooring. Here’s where Than Singh, a Delhi police constable, takes to the board to write the topic of the day, and thus begins the learning process. At the Sai Temple compound inside Red Fort parking area, this open sky school has been run by Singh, since 2016. Catering to kids of labourers, who work in neighbourhood areas, this school is Singh’s way to serve the society.“I don’t want these young kids to get into bad company — betting, gambling or drugs. Nor do I want them to become rag pickers and collect bottles from the streets. I want them to study and achieve something in life,” says Singh. A resident of Delhi’s Paschim Vihar, this cop truly understands the value of education, and the meaning of the right to education that he wants every child to have. Hence, he manages funds for the school from generous donors, and people who willingly lend a helping hand. “We provide the kids with notebooks, stationery, and even sweaters in winter. Basically, we provide anything that can make their life better,” adds Singh, who is a father to two kids, and feels “pleasure in devoting time to teach young children”. In this endeavour, he is joined by another tutor, Ankita Sharma.Their school, which had to shut down due to the lockdown since most labourers had gone back to their villages, has recently restarted. Singh explains, “Around 25-30 kids are dropped here by their parents everyday! These kids don’t have mobile phones, so can’t attend online classes, and hence I reopened the school. We teach them from 5.30pm to 7pm. Amid the pandemic, we have been ensuring that they maintain social distancing, as per safety requirements. I’m also trying to teach them about sanitisation and providing them masks, so that they stay safe and propagate the significance of masks to their parents back home as well.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallika Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-cop-educates-underprivileged-kids-under-open-sky-school/story-rnMaWZmmsilEZvCUGDL3ON.html

Thackeray said that the BJP should think why its foundation stones are coming off.“When someone like Eknathji Khadse, who expanded the BJP’s base, leaves the party, then the BJP should think why its foundation stones are coming off when it is reaching the pinnacle of success,” the chief minister said about his party’s former ally.“There is no point in reaching the pinnacle if the foundation stones are coming off,” he added. Thackeray was speaking in Osmanabad where he took stock of the losses caused due to heavy rains and floods last week.“Earlier, we (Shiv Sena) left the NDA, the Shiromani Akali Dal also left the alliance recently. Now Khadse is also not with the BJP. Hence, the BJP should think about it.

21-10-2020||City||Tripura government announces special provision for sacked teachers in clerical, staff posts||The Tripura government has announced ahead of the annual Durga Puja that over 4,000 posts would be filled in the home and manpower and employment department coupled with a special provision for over 9,000 school teachers, who were sacked six years ago because of a faulty recruitment process. The state government has earmarked 4,000 posts for non-technical lower division clerks (LDCs) and multi-tasking staff and another 500 are for constables in Tripura Police. Altogether 10,323 school teachers, who were sacked six years ago due to the faulty recruitment process, would get relief in age for LDC and multi-tasking employees’ posts.“The selection tests for the Group C and Group D posts will be conducted through a joint recruitment board. As per the new recruitment rules, the candidates have to appear for written tests and viva voce for 85 and 15 marks, respectively,” said Ratan Lal Nath, state minister for education.Also read: Tripura scribes reject offer of talks, demand CM Biplab Deb withdraw remarkThe job aspirants for LDCs and multi-tasking employees need to clear a typewriting test within six months if they don’t have any knowledge of the medium, he added. “There is a special age-relaxation for the 10,323 sacked school teachers for the posts of LDCs and multi-tasking employees,” said the minister. In September, the state cabinet had approved that the 10,323 school teachers would get an opportunity to apply for 9,700 Group C non-technical posts that would be notified in a phase-wise manner.The teachers are eligible to avail the age-relaxation facility until March 31, 2023.The state government will extend the facility to 9,686 school teachers, including 764 postgraduate, 4,380 graduate and 4,542 undergraduate degree-holders.Bhaskar Deb, a leader of Amra 10,323, a motley group of the sacked school teachers, has threatened to launch an agitation against the state government’s decision. “We have demanded a one-time recruitment process for us. Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb had assured us of something better. But ,the state cabinet approved only age-relaxation for us and that too, for only 4,000 posts. We are not happy with the government’s decision. If our demands are not met, we will launch an agitation,” he said. Earlier, the Tripura high court (HC) had terminated 10,323 school teachers due to their faulty recruitment process in 2014. The teachers were appointed in postgraduate, graduate and undergraduate posts in different phases since 2010. The sacked teachers had challenged the HC’s order, when the erstwhile Left Front government was in power. Though they had filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court (SC), the apex court had upheld the HC’s order in 2017. Of the total 10,323 school teachers, over 8,000 teachers were reappointed on an ad-hoc basis, whose tenure expired on March 31. The rest of the school teachers got themselves placed in various posts in the state government’s departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tripura-government-announces-special-provision-for-sacked-teachers-in-clerical-staff-posts/story-EWCdrZtUG7fRZwpyseoxFI.html
21-10-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Maoists threaten to kill those working on road projects; 6 vehicles blown up||Suspected members of the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) have threatened to kill people engaged in road construction works in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum district in their bid to create, maintain and further expand their liberated zones by leaving pamphlets at a road construction site on strategically crucial Arki-Bandgaon road through a Left-wing extremist (LWE) triangle connecting Khunti, Ranchi, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts, the police said on Wednesday.The pamphlets were found strewn around the road construction site on the under-construction 44-kilometre (km) stretch of Arki-Bandgoan road in Lupungdih forest under the jurisdiction of Bandgaon police station in West Singhbhum district.Also read: BSF jawans in Malkangiri unearth 7 IEDs planted by suspected MaoistsMaoists attacked the construction site late at night on Monday and blew up four excavators, a JCB machine, four small vehicles and a motorcycle. The machines and vehicles, which were worth around Rs 2 crore, were blown up by around 60 Maoist rebels, who were led by Prabhat Munda, a close associate of the banned party’s zonal commander, Maharaj Pramanik. “This 153-km Arki-Bandgaon road is strategically crucial from the operational point of view for the police and security forces. Lupundih jungle has a dense forest cover and is surrounded by hills and almost inaccessible for forces even though it is 18 km away from Bandgoan police station. The road is barely a dirt track inside the dense jungle. The Maoists have been targeting road construction projects in a bid to maintain and expand their liberated zones by restricting prompt movement and action by security forces in inaccessible, remote forest and hilly areas,” said Ajay Linda, superintendent of police (SP), West Singhbhum, on Wednesday morning.“The Maoist squad, led by its self-styled area commander Prabhat Munda alias Mukhiya, was behind the subversive activities in its desperate bid to divert aggressive police operations against other groups led by top Maoist commander Jeevan Kandulna, Maharaj Pramanik, Amit Munda and Analda, who are active in the LWE triangle that links four districts. These groups are indulging in extortion and they have nothing to do with Maoist ideology,” said the SP. Earlier, the Maoist rebels had threatened the MNPS Construction company’s management and the contractors in a bid to extort money from them.The Maoists also circulated pamphlets threatening to kill people engaged in road construction works in the area. SP Linda said he had asked the construction firm’s management to park their vehicles at Kochang picket point, which is located four km from Bandgaon police station, by early evening daily after their day’s work got over. “We are and will continue to provide security to road construction works, but the companies must also act responsibly and follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs) that have issued because of the Maoists’ threats. The forces from West Singhbhum district along with that of neighbouring Khunti district are conducting anti-Maoist operations in the area,” SP Linda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-maoists-threaten-to-kill-those-working-on-road-projects-6-vehicles-blown-up/story-YYy7rGqkoeaxh6EUisdeGL.html

Thackeray, during his visit to flood-affected areas, had demanded a compensation of Rs 50,000 per hectare for crop losses.During the current crisis, Thackeray as CM, visited flood-affected areas though he did not make any announcement. “Those who demanded aid for farmers earlier have a chance to keep their word now. Those in the government should be more patient, but the ruling party leaders are indulging in politics. The state should help the farmers,” said Fadnavis.The leader of the opposition, currently on a visit to flood-affected areas of Marathwada, said at Osmanabad during a press conference that the Centre would definitely help the state in the wake of damages caused due to heavy rains, but the state government should also spell out what it is doing to provide relief to the affected farmers.Fadnavis said the three ruling parties in the state have many differences among them, but they are expert in shrugging their responsibilities.“The NDA government will surely help more than the earlier (UPA) government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spoken to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and assured him about it, but the state government must also tell what it is doing to provide aid to farmers,” he said.The Centre is also tackling the Covid-19 pandemic as is the state government, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/fadnavis-replays-old-videos-of-cm-thackeray-says-it-is-time-to-act-now/story-Th8XysG5FkZrN98E22OCqO.html

He asked the police and security forces to go all out in neutralising the threats. “If people sleep at ease, it is because of our police and security forces who work tirelessly to protect Jammu & Kashmir from evil forces and militants who are supported by our neighbour.” He added security forces epitomise bravery and courage.“Police Commemoration Day is the day to remember the heroic spirit of 10 valiant jawans of Central Reserve Police Force, who sacrificed their lives while protecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the nation against the Chinese forces in Ladakh on October 21, 1959. The day is also dedicated to martyrs of Jammu & Kashmir police who have laid down their lives in the line of duty.”He said their supreme sacrifice will be eternally etched into the memory of people. Sinha added security forces perform their duties with utmost dedication and courage despite challenging situations and facing all odds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-touch-the-innocent-don-t-spare-culprits-says-j-k-l-g-manoj-sinha/story-GVnyKalxbVWzGYGcNVtgyO.html
21-10-2020||Election:||In cacophonous poll battle for Bihar, a war of songs erupts||As Bihar gears up to vote in Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday got its Delhi MP and Bhojpuri singer Manoj Tiwari to reprise one of his chartbusters, appealing to voters to retain their trust in the state’s ruling dispensation.“Suna ho Bihar ke bhaiya”, launched by the party as its new election song, is a straight lift off “Jiya ho Bihar ke lala” - the foot-tapping number from Manoj Bajpayee-starrer Gangs of Wasseypur, which had acquired a cult status upon its release a decade ago.Incidentally, the composer of the original song, Sneha Khanwalkar, had been roped in by the campaign team of chief minister Nitish Kumar in the 2015 assembly polls when she came out with the catchy “Phir se Nitish Kumar Ho”.The JD(U) chief had then comfortably returned to power belying naysayers who were skeptical about his coalition with archrival Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) finding resonance with the voters.Back in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Kumar is now the coalition’s chief ministerial candidate, and in the new song, Tiwari, who has retained the tune as well as the background score of the original number, reminds the voters that he wants them to support the JD(U) chief even as the larger than life persona of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his benevolence towards Bihar seems to be the central theme of the song.In the nearly eight-minute-long song, Tiwari dwells at length on the progress made by the state under the NDA rule.He then goes on to add that if someone says in spite of so many accomplishments “Bihar mein ka ba (what does Bihar have to offer)” then the person needs to get eyeglasses checked.For the politically aware people of Bihar, the insinuation is hard to miss.Neha Singh Rathore, a bespectacled 20-something from Tiwari’s native district Kaimur, has become an internet sensation with her rap song “Bihar mein kaa ba” where she takes a grim, sardonic view of her home state. She claims a lot remains to be done despite a decade-and-a-half of sushasan (good governance).Manoj Bajpayee’s rap number “Mumbai mein kaa baa”, released recently to much acclaim, had inspired Rathore, who keeps a low profile and reaches out to viewers and listeners through songs which she self-records on her smartphone and uploads on social media.A self-styled cultural activist who wants to pull Bhojpuri music out of the slush of sleaze, Rathore likes to make a political point without caring much for party affiliations.After “Bihar mein ka ba” became a hit on social media platforms earlier this month, the RJD-led opposition, eager to fish in NDA’s troubled waters following the rebellion by Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan, lapped up the song to use it to score brownie points against the ruling coalition.Paswan has been bitterly criticising Nitish Kumar over a host of issues including alleged corruption and lack of development.The BJP’s famed election machinery hit back with a vengeance, coming out with a series of video packages showcasing the NDA government’s achievements in the state with the tagline “Bihar mein ee ba (this is what Bihar has to offer)”.Recently, another upcoming folk singer from Bihar, Maithili Thakur, who croons in her eponymous native language, sought to lampoon the “kaa ba” refrain of Rathore, whom she did not mention by name, and sung paeans to the state’s rich cultural heritage.It is being speculated that Thakur, with no apparent political inclinations, had been approached by the saffron party. Rathore seems to be taking it all on the chin, though.Unfazed by the attacks, she has come out with yet another song that gets close to the bone of NDA backers.“Rozgar deba ki karba drama, kursi tohar baap ken na ha (will you do something for job creation or simply indulge in antics. Remember, your seat of power is not dynastic),” says Rathore in the song which she says reflects the mood of the state’s youth. It, however, remains to be seen how the new song impacts the electoral outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/in-cacophonous-poll-battle-for-bihar-a-war-of-songs-erupts/story-d0nLTEh6yggYYXTKYXOcUM.html

21-10-2020||Pune||Forts in Pune likely to open next week||Forts in Pune district are likely to open next week after a span of seven months in lockdown, since March 24. In Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani, Satara district, the district collector opened popular tourist points for visitors. The re-openings have being decided on in accordance with the unlock guidelines of the state government, seeking a gradual lifting of restrictions. Pune’s District Collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We would be taking a review of the demand made by Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole regarding the reopening of forts for nature lovers. A positive decision is expected after reviewing the ground situation next week.” Earlier, MLA Siddharth Shirole tweeted: “Trekking and outdoor enthusiasts have been facing unnecessary fines at forts and hills across the district. I have spoken to Collector Dr. Rajesh Deshmukh who has assured me that in the coming week he will issue orders relaxing restrictions on trekking and other adventure sports ” In Satara, district guardian minister Balasaheb Patil and MLA Makarand Patil took up the issue with the government citing serious losses to small businesses and their operators in the Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar hill stations, due to the lockdown. District collector Shekhar Singh ordered the reopening of the Vienna lake for boating in Mahabaleshwar, while the table land has also been opened for public. Similarly, permission has been granted for horse rides and taxis in the area.

21-10-2020||Pune||Experts cite lower testing as reason for dip in case count||The city has been reporting a drop in the number of new Covid-19 cases, a glimmer of hope, however, experts have pointed out that lower testing numbers by the district administration is the reason for this drop. This also could lead to an earlier second wave, the experts have opined. Also, poor contact tracing and unsupervised home isolations are being cited as reasons the chain of infection will not break. Pune district has conducted close to 13,000 tests as of October 1 and 2,656 Covid-19 cases were reported on that day. However, as of Monday, the number of tests conducted is 4,455, one-third of what it was at the beginning of the month. The number of cases went down to 549, one-fourth of the number of cases as of October 1. The graph of positive cases and the positivity rate has also been going down. The positivity rate was 20 per cent as of October 1 and is at 12 per cent as of October 19. The positivity rate indicates the number of positives detected for every 100 Covid-19 tests. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter said that these are not the real numbers and that the administration is not following the ICMR guidelines of contact tracing, which is the only way to break the chain. He said, “The administration has no idea about those isolated at home. People simply get their reports and then stay at home without informing the administration and they are left unsupervised as they are not on record. So, the real numbers could be way higher. Even if the administration tests about four to five people for every positive person, then the contact tracing tests would be about 4,000-5,000 tests and the additional Covid-19 tests of new positives.” Bhondwe also added that there was a slight decline in the number of cases at the beginning of August, which again went up following the Ganesh festival. Similarly, in the Diwali season, there could be a surge which would be evident by November end. Bhondwe said, “If the police and the civic bodies are not able to control the crowd and ensure strict compliance of social distancing and wearing masks then the second wave will be inevitable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/experts-cite-lower-testing-as-reason-for-dip-in-case-count/story-LLwPulWwsCwtF95H4RfYhO.html
21-10-2020||Dehradun||Allow part of Rajaji Tiger Reserve to be used for Mahakumbh 2021: Uttarakhand to Centre||Uttarakhand has again requested the Centre to allow it to use a part of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve to build temporary camps, parking facilities, police posts, health centres and help desks for the 2021 Mahakumbh in Haridwar. The Centre earlier turned down the request. Environmental groups have opposed the proposal saying the move will adversely impact the reserve’s flora and fauna.“We have requested the Central government again to allow us to use the land after it was declined. We are in talks with officials and also finding alternative land for constructing the temporary structures,” said Uttarakhand’s principal secretary (forests) Anand Bardhan.The Mahakumbh, which is held after every 12 years, is scheduled in Haridwar between January and April. Around 50 million pilgrims attended the last Mahakumbh. The number of pilgrims is likely to be restricted for the 2021 Maha Kumbh in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Also read: Haridwar gears up for Mahakumbh 2021, paramount focus on cleanlinessUttarakhand’s chief conservator of forests D J K Sharma said the Centre did not consider the proposal on technical grounds. “As per norms, reserved forest land can be diverted for non-forest activities for 15 days, but given the situation of Mahakumbh, we sought special permission from the Central government which has been turned down.” Sharma said if such land is needed for more time, it is normal to seek either a conversion or a transfer which the state is unwilling to do. “The state government does not want to divert the entire forest area for Mahakumbh as the constructions will be temporary in nature. Another reason is that if the land is transferred, then it can be misused for other purposes in future.”The state government wrote to the Centre in April seeking the use of 778 hectares of land from the reserve for non-forestry purposes from September to May next year.Environmentalist Ajay Singh Rawat said even temporary structures can have a permanent impact, especially on the movement of animals. “Animals require spaces to move. If they [the government] start using the area, then the animals will enter Dehradun and also further increase conflict. Animals are used to moving in particular directions. Even if a temporary structure is made, it can disturb their behaviour. ...what is the guarantee that these temporary structures will not turn into permanent structures as has happened in Uttarakhand earlier?” said Rawat.The reserve is home to 23 species of mammals, including 38 tigers, and over 300 species of birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/allow-part-of-rajaji-tiger-reserve-to-be-used-for-mahakumbh-2021-uttarakhand-to-centre/story-4Wvy5U2uxznLlHMC1tyKIL.html

He recovered after a month and resumed work on July 20.ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava had on Tuesday said that plasma therapy might be removed from the national guidelines for treating Covid-19 after a study conducted by the council showed that it did not help in reducing mortality or slow progression of the infection.“We are discussing with the national task force on Covid-19 management and with the joint monitoring group that may be deleted from the national treatment guidelines on Covid,” Bhargava added.The ICMR study was conducted in 39 hospitals across the country where over 1,200 patients were screened.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plasma-therapy-saved-my-life-icmr-shouldn-t-remove-it-satyendar-jain/story-DtDbYjyU0osrjpkKmvZczK.html

State revenue minister Mahender Singh Thakur said this after presiding over a meeting of the expert committee set up by the state government on land laws. The members gave suggestions on matters of partition, mutation, demarcation and correction in entries in records. The minister said that at present there are 94,902 cases pending in revenue courts in the state. These include 29,313 cases of partition, 18,025 cases of demarcation, 25,251 cases of mutation, 2,497 cases of correction in entries, 2,837 cases of encroachment and 16,790 other cases. He said that Himachal government has made a provision of providing three biswa land for the construction of houses in the rural areas and two biswa in the urban areas to homeless and landless families. Besides, the provision of distribution of nautor land in the tribal areas has been made but due to the implementation of the Forest Conservation Act, the distribution of land was not being done in these areas. Nautor land means the right to use, with the sanction of the authorities waste land belonging to the government outside towns, reserved and demarcated protected forests and outside such areas as may be notified from time to time by the state government. ENSURE TIMEBOUND DELIVERY OF SUMMONS The committee had a detailed discussion on this issue. The members of committee said that the cases of partition, mutation, demarcation and correction in entries often get delayed due to untimely delivery of summons, thus a timebound system should be ensured. Besides, simplification of the settlement process and the use of technology were also suggested at the meeting. Amendments in Sections 45,104 and 118 of the HP Tenancy and Land-Reform Act, 1972, were suggested to make it more practical. Deliberations were also held to improve the provision of Section 118 so that its main objectives could be accomplished. A sub-committee was constituted under the chairmanship of MLA Ram Lal Thakur with Jagat Singh Negi, Rakesh Singha, Narendra Thakur, Balbir Singh and Bikram Jaryal as it members. The sub-committee would submit its recommendations on issues discussed at the meeting and other suggestions before November 30.

21-10-2020||Mumbai||Emergency parole is to prevent spread of Covid-19 in jails, not to empty prisons: Bombay HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday dismissed a petition challenging the prohibition on grant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) emergency parole to convicts from outside Maharashtra.The bench observed that the purpose was “only to ensure social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in prisons and not to empty jails altogether”.“The purpose of enacting Rule 19 (1) (C) of the Maharashtra Prisons (Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959 was not to create a bonanza for convicted prisoners to claim release for being with their families, but to meet the situation created by the pandemic and the nature of its communicable spread,” said the two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Sunil Share and justice Avinash Gharote, while dismissing the petition filed by Chandradev Rai and Satish Ninapure.Also read: Bombay HC restrains builder from further construction at illegal industrial estate near BhiwandiBoth the petitioners are convicted for murders in separate cases and are lodged at Morshi open prison in Maharashtra’s Amravati district. While Rai is a resident of Maharajganj district in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Ninapure belongs to Betul district in Madhya Pradesh (MP).They were aggrieved by a clause in Rule 19(1)(C) introduced to the Maharashtra Prisons (Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959, on May 8, which prohibited grant of emergency parole to convicts having their places of residence outside Maharashtra. The rule was applicable to convicted foreign nationals as well. They were refused the special leave for being residents of other states.The petitioners had challenged the validity of the clause primarily contending that it was discriminatory, creating an artificial distinction between the convicts, who are residents of Maharashtra and those from other states.The bench turned down the challenge noting that the clause was based on March 23 recommendations of the state government’s high-power committee (HPC) and was identically worded. The bench noted that the HC has dismissed a challenge to the HPC’s recommendations and the Supreme Court (SC) has also upheld the decision.The bench said on May 8, when the notification was issued the country was under a strict lockdown, which was enforced since March 25 in a bid to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak.All public transportation, including intra-state and inter-state modes of conveyance, facilities were prohibited because of the lockdown and as a result, the convicts, who belong to other states, could not have travelled to their native places, even if they were released on emergency parole, the bench cited.The bench further noted that the HPC had recommended on May 11 to extend the benefits to those convicts, who did not belong to Maharashtra, but the directives were to come into force after the lockdown was over and public transportation was available. The bench pointed out that it was for the state government to consider and act upon the HPC’s recommendations.The clause (c) of Rule 19(1) of the Maharashtra Prisons (Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959 pertains to medical emergency and the provisions were enacted to address such a specific situation, said the bench. “Thus, the object of the distinction made, is to achieve the safety of the prison inmates and to quite an extent the same appears to have been achieved, with steps and measures already in force to further improve the situation. The distinction cannot be said to be either arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory, as the distinction made, clearly has a nexus and is meant to achieve the purpose,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/emergency-parole-is-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19-in-jails-not-to-empty-prisons-bombay-hc/story-mP6PN0RZd01WNBV5wYBMTI.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Khadse quits BJP, blaming Devendra Fadnavis for the decision; to join NCP||In a major development, senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Eknath Khadse has decided to leave the party. He will be joining Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Friday. State NCP chief Jayant Patil made the announcement Wednesday.Patil said that Khadse had informed him “sometime back” that he had decided to leave the BJP. “Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who has played a significant role in the growth of the BJP in Maharashtra, has decided to leave his party. He has informed me about his decision sometime back. This has paved the way for his induction in the NCP. Khadse will formally join the party on Friday afternoon,” Patil said.After resigning on Wednesday, Khadse held former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis for his decision of quitting party, saying he was forced to take the drastic decision. The leader has also said that his daughter-in-law and party MP Raksha Khadse will continue working for the BJP and there was no other party MLA or MP joining him.Also Read: Maharashtra government, Opposition at loggerheads over financial help for flood-affected farmersAccording to Khadse’s close aides, he is expected to get an MLC seat via the governor’s quota. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, is yet to take a decision on recommending names to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for the appointment of 12 members of the legislative council (MLCs).Khadse, who had resigned as revenue minister and from other 11 departments in June 2016 after he faced corruption charges, resigned from the BJP after working with the party for over four decades. He represented Muktainagar constituency in Jalgaon district in the legislative assembly several times. Khadse said in Jalgaon that he was not upset with any other party leader except Fadnavis. “I have no grievances against any other leader from national or state leadership. I am upset with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who made the police fabricate false cases against me. One case of outraging the modesty of a woman was registered against me on the orders from Fadnavis who was then CM and home minister. Similarly, corruption cases in Bhosri land deal and cases by anti-corruption bureau were registered against me, though nothing came out of them. I urged my party leadership and Fadnavis on various platforms to give me reasons for the punishment, but I never got a reply,” he said.He was denied an election ticket in the state assembly elections held last year.Khadse said that he even tried to raise the issue with the central leadership and told them about the deliberate attempt to defame him (by Devendra Fadnavis), but no heed was paid. “I then got the message that I will not get justice here. I even submitted proof of the conspiracy by party leadership to defeat Rohini Khadse, my daughter, in the assembly elections last year. No action was taken,” he said.Khadse said that his daughter-in-law and Raver MP Raksha Khadse will continue to be with the party. “Raksha is free to take her decision. She has told me that she will not quit the party. There are many such examples of family members being members of different political parties, be it Jyotiraditya Scindia or Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil,” he said.Khadse also alleged that 60-70% of BJP leaders in the state have faced corruption charges. “There are at least 60% leaders in the party who have faced corruption charges. Some of them were given ministership, posts of leader of Opposition, but action was taken only against me. Except for the allegations of corruption levelled against me when BJP was in power, I never faced such charges before in my political career spanning 40 years,” he said.The state BJP unit has confirmed the development. Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil has received his resignation. “We tried to sort out the problems through a dialogue with him. It didn’t work out. We wish him luck. Even a small party worker leaving BJP is a loss for the party,” Upadhye said.Chandrakant Patil said that Khadse’s allegations against Fadnavis were baseless. “Devendraji had already clarified the action taken by his government in each of the cases against Khadse. What Khadse has been claiming now is his version and should not be taken at its face value,” he said.He added that the decision was unfortunate, but there had been no need for Khadse to resign. He said that the party would have resolved the grievances the leader had.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-eknath-khadse-leaves-bjp-to-join-ncp/story-8kR8JTl9niabZeFNIcO2UN.html
21-10-2020||Education||Patna schools to curtail festival holidays for timely completion of syllabus||PATNA: As Durga Puja celebration has been scaled down, several private schools in the city have decided to curtail festival holidays including Durga Puja, Diwali, Chhath and winter vacation, in a bid to complete syllabus on time in the absence of regular classes.Several schools said that a good number of working days remained underutilised in the current academic session owing to new normal adjustment and resorting to online classes. Thus, academic loss will be compensated through shorter festival holidays.Ravi Ranjan Sinha, principal of Baldwin Academy and city coordinator of CBSE, said, “We will have only four-day holiday for senior students this Durga Puja. We are also in a plan to reduce Diwali and Chhath holidays so that syllabus can be completed on time followed by revision and test before final exam.”Umesh Kumar, a senior mathematics teacher, said, “Though education boards have reduced syllabus but the deleted portion has already been taught in the absence of timely information. Now, we have to teach fresh topics to students”Several convent schools, which have around two-week holidays during Christmas and winter vacation have also planned to cut short vacation.“We are mulling to reduce Christmas holiday by 50% for senior and senior secondary students. We will not have combined holidays for Diwali to Chhath rather online classes will be conducted in between the two festivals to carry out academic activities”, said an official of St Dominic Savio’s High School.However, curtailment of holidays has exerted additional pressure on school teachers who are facing 50% salary cut since March despite long working hours.Seema Pandey (45), a high school teacher, said, “It’s eighth month now and I am getting half salary. School management is not compromising with working hours, in fact, we are working double in the name of ‘work from home’. Now, working days have been increased without any compensation. It’s unfair with private school teachers.”PU postpones exams due to pollsPatna University of Monday called off annual year examination of BA, BSc and Bcom part II and LLB semester VI exam which was scheduled from October 22 to November 10.PU’s controller of examination RK Mandal said, “Exams have been cancelled in view of state assembly elections. Fresh exam dates will be notified shortly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/patna-schools-to-curtail-festival-holidays-for-timely-completion-of-syllabus/story-ThVfxOEw0hty4sYb67WPWI.html
21-10-2020||Kolkata||Calcutta high court raises cap on number of people allowed inside a Durga Puja pandal||In a partial easing of restrictions, the Calcutta high court on Wednesday raised the cap on the number of puja committee members who can enter a Durga Puja pandal and allowed dhakis (drummers) to enter no-entry zones. A few local residents can now enter the pandals to take part in the puja and the rituals. However, the court refused to lift the ban on the entry of visitors inside puja pandals.The court was hearing a review petition filed by Forum for Durgotsab, a platform representing over 350 puja committees in the city.  Earlier, the court had ordered that only 15 puja committee members could enter a small puja pandal, and 25 could enter a big puja pandal. The court had also said that the names of the entrants would have to be decided in advance and could not be changed daily. Also Read: 2631 booked for not wearing masks in last 6 days in Kolkata as festive fervour growsIn its Wednesday’s order the division bench of the high court, however, has allowed up to 45 puja committee members to enter a big pandal at a time. The committees would have to prepare a list of 60 names (including committee members and local residents) in advance. Modifying its earlier order, the court said that the names can be changed every day. In case of small puja pandals, the list would contain only 15 names (including committee members and local residents) and not more than 10 members would be allowed to enter at a time. The list can change every day and has to be prepared by 8am daily. “There have been some modifications in the high court’s previous order, which comes as a breather. We are going through the details,” said a member of the Forum for Durgotsab, which filed the review petition on Tuesday. The Calcutta high court on Monday had banned the entry of visitors inside the Durga Puja pandals. Authorities were directed to put up barricades outside pandals. The ban remains in effect. Citing examples of Kerala wherein the number of Covid-19 cases had shot up after Onam, doctors had earlier warned the Mamata Banerjee administration that cases in Bengal could increase up to four-fold, if restrictions were relaxed during the festive season. This comes at a time when Kolkata is witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases because of the festive season because people are thronging the markets for puja shopping and pandal-hoppers have hit the streets en masse. While Kolkata reported 809 cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, 4,029 new cases were registered across West Bengal. A month ago on September 20, Kolkata had reported 514 new cases and the state had registered 3,177 new cases. The positivity rate has jumped from 6.9% to 9.2% in the last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/calcutta-high-court-raises-cap-on-number-of-people-allowed-inside-a-durga-puja-pandal/story-AurpmhU5JI1DQUDwPAa69O.html

The court cited an HT report, “In new online abuse menace, AI bot turns women’s photos into nudes,” while seeking the information.The court, while hearing various public interest litigations pertaining to the alleged trial by the electronic media in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, raised concerns about the menace mentioned in the report and directed additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh to take instructions from the ministry. “If you can gather from ministry what print media has reported... We want you to check malice in the report. Kindly check with the ministry,” said the division bench. The ASG said he had gone through the report and had spoken to the concerned officers. Singh submitted that there were provisions in the Information Technology Act namely section 69A and 79 (3) (b) under which action could be taken against the menace. The CJ said, “The issue is extremely serious and you (ministry) have to take steps.” The ASG assured the bench that the ministry would take steps to address the issue and concerns of the court on an urgent basis. While speaking to HT, ASG said that the newspaper needed to be complimented as it was doing its job diligently by reporting an issue which affects the common man.

Singh submitted that the ministry has laid down a code which has to be adhered to by the news channels, whether they are part of any self-regulatory association or not. “Since we are on TV channels, whether you are a member or not, if there is violation, the ministry will take action, we can take action.” said Singh. He added that the ministry can step in if it finds the action of either members or non-members inappropriate. Thereafter, the chief justice sought to now from the ASG that the news channels were using airwaves which is public property and if the channels were misusing it there should be some regulation to control it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-information-from-i-b-ministry-on-ai-bot-that-turns-photos-into-nudes/story-U8B1FkeYCFw3WRjYl41P3L.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: Rana Kapoor’s daughter gets interim bail||A magistrate court in Mumbai on Wednesday granted interim bail to Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor’s daughter Roshini in a Yes Bank fraud case linked to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). Roshini is one of the eight accused, who have been charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for cheating and corruption. The charges of corruption were dropped by the sessions court for want of sanction of prosecution, but the case for the charges of cheating and conspiracy hold good. Later, the case was shifted to a magistrate court for trial.The magistrate court had accepted the charge sheet filed by the CBI in September and issued summons to all the accused, who are not arrested in the case, including Roshini, and those related to four other companies such as DHFL, Belief realtors Pvt Ltd, RKW Project Pvt Ltd, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd. Roshini appeared before the magistrate court on Wednesday in response to the summons.“We appeared before the court on Wednesday and moved for an interim bail. The court has granted us interim bail until further hearing,” said Subhash Jadhav, the lawyer for the Kapoors. The court is scheduled to hear her bail plea in November. CBI has filed a case that alleged that Yes Bank had invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) between April and June 2018, in lieu of which Kapoor was allegedly paid kickbacks amounting to Rs 600 crore by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd. DHFL sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises, where Kapoor’s family members, including Roshini, have a stake, the CBI has alleged. The loan was sanctioned on the basis of mortgage of sub-standard property that allegedly has a meagre value. The Central agency claimed that Yes bank also sanctioned a loan Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers, which is DHFL group of company. The loan was sanctioned for the purpose of a Bandra Reclamation project. The entire amount of Rs 750 crore was allegedly siphoned off by Wadhawan after the sum was transferred by RKW Developers to DHFL without making any investments in the Bandra project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-rana-kapoor-s-daughter-gets-interim-bail/story-iLn6NdyMGEdAhhNkNXzQcN.html

21-10-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal CM adds cowshed, elevator to Oakover, his British-era official residence in Shimla||Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has brought home a Himachali Pahari cow and got a shed built for it at Oakover, his official residence in Shimla. “It’s auspicious to rear cows at home. They bring peace, harmony and prosperity. Besides, the cow is a sacred symbol of life,” a staff member employed at Thakur’s residence said, requesting anonymity. The public works department, which is incidentally under the chief minister, built the cow shed near Oakover’s Gate No. 2 recently. “The cowshed is covered from all sides,” the staffer said. HARDY CATTLE BREED The Himachali Pahari is an indigenous cattle breed native to seven districts of Chamba, Mandi, Kullu, Kangra, Sirmour, Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti. The hill state has an estimated eight lakh such cows that are adapted to the mountain topography and cold climate besides fodder scarcity owing to higher number of white blood cells and haemoglobin levels. The daily milk yield of the cow ranges from 1 to 3 litres. The Karnal-based National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) has officially recognised the Himachali Pahari as an indigenous breed with unique features after researchers from the Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University (HPAU) gave the NBAGR scientific evidence. The NBAGR is the nodal agency of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for registration of newly identified germplasms of livestock and poultry in India. After taking over reins of the state in 2017, Jai Ram Thakur had imposed cow cess on the sale of liquor bottles that was raised from Re 1 to Rs 1.50 per bottle for this fiscal. ELEVATOR COMES UP The PWD has also added an elevator to the double-storeyed Oakover, making yet another alteration to the historic building that was once the retreat of the Maharajas of Patiala. Despite the fund crunch, PWD sources said the elevator was installed at a cost of Rs 35 lakh. Though the authorities denied any bylaw violation, the utility of an elevator for one floor has raised eyebrows. The British-era building was considered jinxed for years and it came to be believed that the chief minister who stayed at Oakover did not complete his term. Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar, the first CM of the state, Shanta Kumar and Ram Lal Thakur exited their office before their terms expired. The jinx was finally broken by the BJP’s Prem Kumar Dhumal, who completed his term as chief minister in 1998. Jai Ram Thakur’s predecessor Virbhadra Singh, the longest serving chief minister of the state, also avoided Oakover and stayed at his private residence, Holy Lodge, while in chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-cm-adds-cowshed-elevator-to-oakover-his-british-era-official-residence-in-shimla/story-o2tlI6nXifOsOEOzWTDqHM.html
21-10-2020||City||JKCA money laundering case: Farooq Abdullah summoned by Enforcement Directorate again||National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, who is also an MP from Srinagar, has been summoned by Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning regarding the Jammu and Kashmir cricket scam for the second time in three days. On Monday, Abdullah was questioned at the ED office at Rajbagh for six hours. On Wednesday, he was summoned by ED again.The fresh summons have evoked a sharp response from National Conference which has termed it part of a coercive plot and expressed dismay over unnecessary hounding of the senior leader.In a statement, NC spokesman Imran Nabi Dar said these ED summons are calculated coercive measures, aimed at curtailing Abdullah’s efforts to unite mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir.He termed the repeated ED summons pressure tactics. “What is it that ED forgot to ask during the six hours it interrogated an 83-year-old Member of Parliament?”The government and its agencies, the spokesperson said, have no consideration for a law-abiding citizen who is severely immuno-compromised and diabetic.Also Read: ‘Farooq Abdullah kept at ED office for 5 hours despite his age’: People’s Alliance attacks Centre“Dr Abdullah being treated like this is proof that the BJP is not even interested in a face-saving act and is completely comfortable with being seen as a bully by the nation,” he said. “How many times will the BJP use the CBI, ED, the anti-corruption bureau and its other agencies to browbeat the Opposition? The plot has become predictable. Anyone who speaks against the government or against its divisive politics will be hounded and summoned,” he said, adding that the only way to get a clean chit these days is to surrender one’s ideology and join the BJP. “We have seen this story play out from Assam to Karnataka, from West Bengal to Andhra Pradesh, but Dr Abdullah is not going to surrender to the BJP, come what may.”Ten office-bearers of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA), including Abdullah, are accused of turning the sports body into a lending agency and operating several bogus accounts between 2005 and 2012 when the scam was unearthed.The scam came to light in March 2012 when JKCA treasurer Manzoor Wazir filed a police complaint against former general secretary Mohammad Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Mirza. Soon, a list of around 50 names linked to the financial scandal was released. The ED attached assets worth Rs 2.6 crore in the money laundering case related to the alleged embezzlement of JKCA funds, the central agency said in a statement issued in February. A provisional order for the attachment of assets was issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against former JKCA treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza and its finance committee member Mir Mansoor Gazanffer.All mainstream parties except the BJP criticised the government for issuing summons to the senior-most politician of Jammu and Kashmir, after they came up with the Gupkar declaration and formed an alliance to work towards the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jkca-money-laundering-case-farooq-abdullah-summoned-by-enforcement-directorate-again/story-qRcekWI0Lvz61ndPxiZJGN.html

21-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra re-examines ‘wetland’ status for Navi Mumbai flamingo haven||The Thane district administration’s various bodies have undertaken a fresh verification drive from Monday to determine whether two sites in Navi Mumbai can be declared wetlands following an application by an environmentalist, who is also a local resident.The team will make its submissions before the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed state wetland committee, which is headed by the Konkan commissioner, on October 27. The team also identified debris dumping at the site and directed the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco), which is Navi Mumbai’s planning body, to clear it within a week.Also read: Maharashtra forest department confirms mangroves were hacked at Navi Mumbai’s Panje; owner, Cidco to respondThe sites included the 21.9 hectare (ha) NRI Complex and 14.3-ha Training Ship Chanakya (TSC), where a record 9,000 flamingos had flocked in April and May. However, both these sites were not included by the district administration in their final list of newly identified and verified wetlands in line with 2017 wetland rules that was submitted to the Maharashtra government’s environment department on January 3.Cidco plans to develop a golf course and construct 17 buildings, including 1,564 flats and 20 office spaces, in the area, which have been opposed by environmentalists and the local residents.The matter is pending before the Supreme Court.Based on an application for rectification of their status in February by Sunil Agarwal, a petitioner before the Bombay HC on protection of these wetlands, the Konkan commissioner on September 27 had directed the Thane district collector to verify the submissions.District officials said the areas could be declared as wetlands.“We found that both these areas have all the features of wetlands and are also rich in biodiversity,” said Yuvraj Bangar, tehsildar (revenue officer), Thane.“We are not aware of the Cidco’s stand. But a final report has been prepared by the sub-divisional officer (SDO) and will be presented before the Konkan commissioner on October 27. The matter will also be presented before the Thane district collector on Wednesday,” he added.Avinash Shinde, SDO, Thane, said another complaint about construction materials dumped in TSC was identified by the joint inspection team on Monday. “We have been promised by Cidco that the debris from the area will be removed within seven days, and they will submit a compliance report before the HC-appointed committee,” he said.Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco, said, “We are not aware, who dumped the debris, but we will ensure that it is removed. However, these two sites are not wetlands. They are land parcels and revenue records show them as saltpans and agricultural lands. As per 2017 wetland rules, these lands do not qualify to be declared as wetlands.”On January 3, the Thane district administration had submitted its final report to the state government, which showed only three wetlands, excluding the ones in Navi Mumbai.“We were surprised that the final report had left out these two key wetlands. Our application cited the reasons for their inclusion. We are hopeful that these two wetlands will be added to the verified list and a natural habitat for flamingos will be protected from concrete urban jungle and the proposed golf course,” said Agarwal.‘Both sites extraordinary wetlands, land cannot be diverted for other use’Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) authorities said that both the sites at Navi Mumbai have displayed essential wetland characteristics. “These are extraordinary wetlands that are used by a large number of migratory and resident water birds. On an average, around 50,000 birds, including around 15,000 near threatened lesser flamingos, can be observed roosting at this site at high tides during winter . We have recommended this site to be declared as protected areas in the studies carried out for the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) and Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL). Conversion of this land for a different purpose such as a golf course will jeopardise the air safety of the proposed airport, as birds may start using the NMIA and its influence zone for roosting purposes. This land should not be diverted to any other use,” BNHS had said in two separate reports to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-re-examines-wetland-status-for-navi-mumbai-flamingo-haven/story-ClEKPbMMLfbCb2UNA4zQWP.html

The police over the last six days, between October 16 and 20, have booked at least 2,631 people for not wearing masks in Kolkata. In the preceding six days the police had booked 787 violators. This comes at a time when Kolkata is witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases as residents are thronging the markets for puja shopping and pandal hoppers have hit the streets in lakhs. While Kolkata reported 809 cases on Tuesday, 4,029 new cases were registered across West Bengal. Exactly a month ago on September 20, Kolkata reported 514 new cases and the state had registered 3,177 new cases. The positivity rate has jumped from 6.9% to 9.2% in the last one month. HT had earlier reported how the city police had apparently lowered its guard against those without masks in the first week of October. The West Bengal government had made wearing of face masks mandatory on April 12 to check the disease from spreading. Also Read: Festival season, small gatherings aid spread of Covid-19, warn expertsOn an average, 160 people were booked everyday between October 5 and October 11 for not wearing masks in public places while more than 300 people were arrested every day for the same reason between September 5 and September 11. The number of such prosecutions in August was even higher with around 410 violators booked every day. “The vigil has been intensified. The police had launched a campaign titled MaskUpKolkata in July. There has been no laxity. Violators are being booked regularly,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.

Citing examples of Kerala where Covid-19 cases had shot up after Onam, city doctors had earlier warned the Mamata Banerjee administration that coronavirus infection in Bengal could increase up to four-fold, if restrictions were relaxed during the festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/2631-booked-for-not-wearing-masks-in-last-6-days-in-kolkata-as-festive-fervour-grows/story-VYzrLf1ZiHjzidSE4fViMM.html
21-10-2020||Bhopal||MP starts process to develop its second national fossil park||The Madhya Pradesh government has initiated the process for developing a second National Fossil Park in the state at Dhangaon in Mandla district, officials aware of the matter said. The move comes over a decade after a fossil of a palm plant with fruit that is found in Madagascar (Indian Ocean) was among fossils discovered in Mandla.Residents, geologists, paleobotanists, and environmentalists have been urging the government to protect the 40-65 million-year-old fossils of 15 genera of 10 plant families found. A team of Mandla district administration, the state forest department, and paleobotanists inspected the area last month.Mandla collector Harshika Singh said the team confirmed plants like Hyphaenocarpon (palm) with fruit are not found in India before the state government approved a proposal to develop the fossil park in Dhangaon. Singh added the fossils found in Dhangaon are older than those found at Ghughwa National Fossil Park in Dindori district.D K Kapgate, a retired professor studying fossils of plants in Madhya Pradesh, said India was a part of a supercontinent called Gondwanaland that included South America, Africa, Madagascar, Antarctica, and Australia about 180 million years ago. “The tectonic plates started shifting and then breaking up of land started. The Indian plate broke away from that of Madagascar about 60-50 million years ago and collided with that of Eurasia. The fossils of plants belonging to that period were first found in Ghughwa in the late 1970s and now these have been found in Dhangaon.”Kapgate said Dhangaon needs to be developed separately as the experts have not only found stems, leaves, and roots but also fruits intact with the palm tree which is something new.Bandana Samant, a geology professor at Nagpur University who has carried out a study at Dhangaon, said the area has amazing preservation of vegetation which is even older than 60-64 million years. “These trees are mainly found near the sea on the eastern coast of South Africa, Madagascar, and Australia. After breaking away from Gondwanaland, the Indian subcontinent moved from the south equator to its present position--north of the equator. The discovery of these fossil plants is a very important geological event on the Indian subcontinent as it is a window to study weather conditions and vegetation which used to exist more than 60 million years ago.”Samant said most of the fossils in Ghughwa were collected from different sites. “But in Dhangaon, we found whole fossil forest and sediments of that era. The state government should have taken a decision on developing fossil park many years ago because fossils of trunks, seeds, fruits, and leaves are treasures for India.”Prashant Srivastava, a teacher in Mandla with an interest in paleobotany, said he discovered many fossils of plants on a hill in Dhangaon in 2006. “I took pictures and studied them. I shared the pictures with experts and they told me that these are fossils of Hyphaenocarpon [palm] of Madagascar, Garcinia, Sterculia [chest nuts], Sonneratia, Madagascar polyalthia, Heynea [Mahagony], Drypetes, Artocarpus communis [bread fruit], Eucalyptus and others.”Srivastava said Madhya Pradesh is rich in plant fossils and yet the forest department was paying much attention to them.Chief forest conservator (Jabalpur division) Ram Das Mahala said they cross-checked the claims first about the fossils with help of experts. “Now, since we are sure of the presence of fossils there, we have initiated the process to develop the area as a fossil park.”Mahala said the park will be developed in two phases. “In the first phase, we are focusing on protecting about 35-hectare land with a ban on the movement of locals in the area... fencing would be done. In the next phase, the Eco-Tourism Board will invite a team of experts to identify every fossil to preserve it. The documentation will be done properly so that we could set up a museum later.”The National Fossil Park in Ghughwa was earlier developed in 1983. Dhangaon is located about 100 km away.Ghughwa has rare fossils of leaves and trees that existed anywhere between 40 million and 150 million years ago when India was part of Gondwanaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-starts-process-to-develop-its-second-national-fossil-park/story-ylIUmIff8GJYs1ExDQyzRL.html

21-10-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: ‘Accidental death during selfie’ turns out to be double murder; accused arrested||An accident, where two young men were reported to have lost their lives while taking a selfie in Madhya Pradesh’s (MP) Barwani district, located around 313 kilometres (km) south-west of Bhopal, on August 31, has turned out to be a case of double murder, said the police. The accused, who had allegedly killed the men in a bid to keep his theft a secret, was arrested on Tuesday, police said.Shantilal, a contractor, who belonged to MP’s Dhar district, has been accused of the youths’ murder, police said.The arrested accused, who claimed to be the sole eye-witness of the alleged accident, had informed the police of the deaths on August 31, said Nimish Agarwal, superintendent of police (SP), Barwani.

Their bodies were found on September 1. Though Shantilal was questioned several times about the alleged accident, he stuck to the accident theory. However, there were certain discrepancies in his statement,” the SP said, “Shantilal was again detained on Monday and he confessed to his crime the following day,” he said. “Shantilal said that he was working at a construction site with Dinesh and Bunty. He had stolen 200 sacks of cement from the site a few months ago and handed over the building material to the duo. He had demanded Rs 40,000 from Dinesh and Bunty as his share, but the men refused to part with the cash and started blackmailing him. This led to their murder,” the SP said.Shantilal has allegedly confessed to the police that he took the men to Ramgarh, a scenic spot in Barwani, and pushed them to a gorge and made it look like an accident. The arrested accused has been booked under section 302 (murder) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-accidental-death-during-selfie-turns-out-to-be-double-murder-accused-arrested/story-KbJAJaN8CcM4AzdLZgVLXP.html
21-10-2020||City||Assam forest officials ‘seize’ railway locomotive for killing wild elephants||Forest officials in Assam have seized a railway locomotive for mowing down a female elephant and her calf in September. The elephants were killed by a speeding goods train at Lumding in Hojai district of Assam on the intervening night of September 26 and September 27. The accident took place near Pathorkhola railway station, when the elephants were trying to cross the railway tracks. “This is probably the first such instance in the country, when a railway locomotive has been seized in connection with death on train tracks,” said MK Yadava chief wildlife warden, Assam. On Tuesday, forest officials seized the engine from the Banunimaidan locomotive shed of North-eastern Frontier Railway (NFR) in Guwahati. Also Read: Ending longest shutdown, Assam’s Kaziranga national park opens for touristsEarlier, rail authorities had placed the pilot of the train and his assistant under suspension pending an internal probe. “Provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 will be imposed against railway authorities. The seized locomotive will be used as evidence in the case,” Yadava said. Forest officials said the impact of the accident was such that the one-year-old calf was dragged for nearly a kilometre (km) before the engine came to a grinding halt. “The area, where the accident took place, falls in an elephant corridor and railway authorities were cautioned earlier that trains should restrict their speed to below 40 km per hour,” said Pulak Choudhury, divisional forest officer, Lumding. “An internal inquiry by railways has revealed that the train was running at around 60 km per hour in the area and that caused the accident. We have filed a police complaint and are also conducting a separate investigation ourselves,” he added. Despite speed restrictions and meetings between forest and railway officials to prevent elephant deaths on railway tracks, such incidents keep recurring in Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-forest-officials-seize-railway-locomotive-for-killing-wild-elephants/story-oa33PkDhwnIqqNPMAa8X8J.html
21-10-2020||Lucknow||Smriti visits Amethi, Congress calls it ‘political tourism’||Union minister for Women and Child Development (WCD) Smriti Irani arrived in her Lok Sabha (LS) constituency Amethi on Tuesday amid the rival Congress’s barbs of “political tourism”.Irani plans to announce several projects for her constituency, which used to be a Gandhi family’s pocket borough for years until she wrested the prestigious seat from Rahul Gandhi in last year’s parliamentary polls, during the festive season. This is her first visit to Amethi since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from the end of March in a bid to keep the viral infection at bay.The Congress is aiming to expose her “absence” from Amethi since she was elected to the LS from the prestigious seat last year.Irani pounced on former Madhya Pradesh (MP) chief minister Kamal Nath’s “item” jibe and packaged it as a proof of the “Congress culture to insult women”. Also Read: Smriti Irani slams Gandhis for ‘not paying attention’ to development of Amethi-Raebareli“It’s true that the head of a political party (Rahul and Sonia Gandhi) has been doing politics in Amethi-Rae Bareli for years but it’s a matter of great satisfaction for me that we are living up to the expectations of the people through hard work in these places,” she said. Rahul Gandhi had represented Amethi in the LS for three consecutive terms since 2004. While his mother Sonia Gandhi has also been representing Rae Bareli, the only surviving Congress bastion in Uttar Pradesh (UP), in the lower House of Parliament since 2004. Irani responded to the Congress’s truant barb and listed a series of works initiated by her in a bid to help the voters in her constituency.“I ran an e-choupal programme and redressed around 1,900 complaints of the public,” she said while accusing the Congress leadership of “usurping the land of farmers”. “The Congress must first return the land to farmers that it has captured. The land was grabbed in the name of setting up a factory,” she said to a question, seeking her response to Rahul Gandhi’s allegation of misuse of state-run agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Front (NDA) government. She claimed that 22 development projects were launched in the Salon area of her constituency and all of them would be completed on time. She also reviewed the ongoing development projects.

Deepak Singh, a Congress member of the UP legislative council (MLC), took potshots at her visit. He alleged that she escaped to Amethi in a bid to avoid embarrassing questions that were being raised ahead of the three-phase Bihar elections. “The visit is a cover-up. It is nothing but political tourism. It is aimed more at ensuring that embarrassing queries don’t come her way during the Bihar poll campaign, where she might have been quizzed about her prolonged absence from her LS constituency. She is aware that the ‘missing MP’ posters have come up in the constituency and even her own party workers have been looking for her,” Singh alleged.“I shall share the details of how many hours she has spent in the constituency by the time her visit ends,” he further alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/smriti-visits-amethi-congress-calls-it-political-tourism/story-wcEsuw9V9DRv614gYjhAsN.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai hospitals ordered to test Covid-19 recovered patients for TB||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed all hospitals in Mumbai to test Covid-19 recovered patients for TB since both diseases are believed to have similar symptoms.In Mumbai, 135 TB patients were co-infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and 18 of these succumbed to the infection, mostly because of late diagnosis.“Most of these co-infection cases have been identified in new TB patients. They approached hospitals considering it to be just Covid-19 infection. But when their CT scan report showed different forms of clouding in lungs, their sputum culture confirmed that they were also carrying the bacteria of TB,” said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent, Sewri TB hospital. “Both these infections affect people with lower immunity,” he added.As per the World Health Organization (WHO), TB and Covid-19 are both infectious diseases that primarily attack the lungs and have similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty in breathing.“As the pandemic advances, more people of all ages, including TB patients, will be exposed to Covid-19,” reads a note released by WHO in May this year. Also Read: 40% citizens in Mumbai screened for Covid-19 under Maharashtra government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ initiativeIn view of the developments, all private and public hospitals have been instructed to follow up on their Covid-19 recovered patients to check if they have developed any symptoms similar to TB, such as coughing, loss of appetite and fatigue among others.“If any of them show such symptoms, we will run a sputum test to check if he/she has TB,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, deputy health officer, TB, BMC. “But so far, we have not diagnosed any recovered Covid-19 patients with TB,” she added.Also Read: Plasma therapy may not be used on patientsAlong with this, the BMC has also added TB as one of the diseases to look out for in the questionnaire being used for the door-to-door survey under ‘Your Family, Your Responsibility’ programme.“During the survey, if anyone is found with TB-like symptoms, we will also run a diagnosis on it,” Dr Tipre added.Social workers have welcomed the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-hospitals-ordered-to-test-covid-19-recovered-patients-for-tb/story-3TE9beq91CX4gBpNFEig1L.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Murder convict out on parole kills man over gambling dispute; arrested||A 25-year-old was stabbed to death over a gambling dispute, allegedly by a life convict in a murder case who was out of jail on parole, in south Delhi’s Tughlakabad village in the early hours of Tuesday, said police.The suspect, identified as 42-year-old Vishwajeet alias Chacha, who got parole as a step to decongest jails to stem the spread of Covid-19, was caught later the same day along with the knife allegedly used in the crime.A case of murder was registered against him at the Govindpuri police station. Vishwajeet was previously involved in six cases of murder, dacoity, robbery and for crimes under the arms act, apart from a decade-old murder in Chittaranjan Park for which he was convicted for life, the police said. Also read: 2 held for killing brother over property dispute, stuffing body in trunkPolice officials associated with the probe said the murder took place over Rs 70,000 that the victim, Vicky Gupta, won while gambling (playing cards) with his brother Kuldeep Gupta, Vishwajeet, and their friend Raja near the forested area in Tughlakabad village. “Vishwajeet accused Vicky of cheating during the game and demanded back the money he had lost. An argument ensued and Vishwajeet took out a knife, stabbed Vicky in his chest and fled,” a senior police officer associated with the case said, adding that Vicky was unemployed. Additional deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Kumar Gyanesh said the murder came to their notice around 5 am on Tuesday, after Kuldeep informed the police about it. “The injured man was taken to Safdarjung hospital by his brother where he was declared brought dead,” said Gyanesh, adding that a murder case was registered on the statement of prime witness Kuldeep who is an auto rickshaw driver by profession. As Vishwajeet was absconding, the teams of the Govindpuri police station conducted raids at his possible hideouts. “We caught Vishwajeet in the evening from one of his hideouts in south Delhi. The murder weapon, a knife, was also seized from him,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-murder-convict-out-on-parole-kills-man-over-gambling-dispute-arrested/story-W7qyJGm7N8woQRiSsH3o5M.html

This is the longest shutdown for KNPTR in its 112-year history.KNPTR authorities said that the park famous for its one-horned rhinoceroses and tigers would be formally reopened at 11 am on Wednesday by Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal at a function.All five national parks and 18 wildlife sanctuaries in Assam, including KNPTR, which usually remains shut for around five months annually due to floods, were closed in March following the Covid-19 outbreak.“This is the longest period of closure for KNPTR. Usually, the park remains closed from the end of May because of annual floods. However, this year, it was shut for an additional two and half months due to Covid-19,” said P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR.Also Read: Uttarakhand’s first radio-collared leopard found crossing Ganga near Haridwar“The usual precautionary measures such as wearing masks, using hand sanitisers and maintaining social distancing will be put to practise while allowing tourists to enter the park.

21-10-2020||Delhi||Amid pandemic, caution meets passionate debate||The grand finale of the 2019 Speak for India-Delhi edition was earlier slated to be conducted in March. However, the nationwide lockdown imposed from March 24 to arrest the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus delayed the event for nearly eight months. On Tuesday, the house witnessed the finalists debating whether the lockdown was the right step in tackling Covid-19 in India.The opening arguments made by the winner of 2019 Speak for India — Vinayak Gupta, a graduate from Delhi University’s Hindu College — emphasised that the lockdown gave the country’s inadequate health infrastructure time to prepare for the onslaught of cases that would hit it sooner or later. “If the lockdown hadn’t been imposed, there would have been more patients and no health infrastructure to deal with it,” said Gupta. His opponent Priyanshi Sharma, however, argued that it was too little, too late. “World Health Organisation (WHO) started speaking about Covid-19 disease in January itself. We took two months to impose the lockdown without consulting all stakeholders including labour ministry and bureaucrats. If such a lockdown were to be imposed at all, it should have been done at an earlier stage with more planning,” she said. Sharma also added that since the country has re-opened with checks in place, the same thing could have been done back then. Gupta, however, argued, “This alternative was only possible because the lockdown was imposed at the right time. Besides, the government did offer stimulus packages and benefit schemes to counteract the effects of migrant crisis and economic slowdown.”On Tuesday, candidates — armed with masks and sanitisers — continued to debate the effects of the lockdown in front of a group of 50 people. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions put in place, organisers had decided against a larger crowd to ensure social distancing measures.While the Covid-19 lockdown and the economic hardships arising out of it dominated the last round of Tuesday’s debate, the previous two rounds focused on the start-up culture and whether corporate jobs could be compared to slavery.While Ranu Sancheti, from the FORE School of Management, argued that corporate jobs put more value on human productivity than humans shifting from the traditional form of slavery, her opponent and runner-up Sharma contended that this can be construed as an argument against hard work.“Corporate jobs cannot be compared to slavery which was racist and forceful among other things because of the presence of choice. Growth in these companies is dependent on the extra hard work put in by people. If some don’t want to do so, it is their choice. They have that freedom,” said Sharma.In the first round, the debate was flagged by a discussion on the start-up culture and whether it was a fad or trend-setter. While Laiba, a graduate from Daulat Ram College who only goes by one name, argued that the start-up models were mostly borrowing business ideas from other country and applying it in India without taking into account the country’s culture, her opponent Bisathi Bharat argued that start-ups offered an alternative to reduce corporate inequalities since people coming from different backgrounds can become entrepreneur.Among the topics covered during the zonals and the semi-finals were the connection between unemployment and new forms of technology, Indo-US partnerships, authoritarianism, censoring shows on OTT platform, and whether celebrities make good politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/amid-pandemic-caution-meets-passionate-debate/story-zJCKFI6mUeFupKNes5YJDP.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s top debaters make mark on the biggest stage||Following months of intense verbal jousts between college-goers from across the National Capital Region (NCR), a History student from Hindu College and an Economics undergraduate from Daulat Ram College won the grand finale of the Federal Bank Speak for India — Delhi Edition debate competition held on Tuesday in association with Hindustan Times and Hindustan. The event, which was organised in Delhi-NCR for the first time, saw eight finalists from various Delhi colleges pitted against each other and showcased the importance of debate in strengthening a democracy. The jury comprised senior journalist Barkha Dutt, founding member of Delhi University’s National Democratic Teachers’ Front Inder Mohan Kapahy, and Shri Ram College of Commerce professor Abhinav Prakash Singh. While former parliamentarian and national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party Baijayant Jay Panda was the chief guest, renowned athlete and paralympian Deepa Malik and Aam Aadmi Party legislator and spokesperson Raghav Chadha were the guests of honour. Shyam Srinivasan, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Bank in a televised message, spoke of the event — the biggest debating event held in Delhi-NCR and six other Indian states — as a platform for bright young minds to meet and express their ideas. He added that it has been encouraging to witness the overwhelming reception the property received from about 62000 young aspirants in Delhi-NCR this year and the gripping performance of the eight finalists who spoke passionately for what they believed to be right.Civil Services-aspirant Vinayak Gupta, 21, and a graduate of History (Honours) in Hindu College won the debate, while Priyanshi Sharma, an Economics (Honours) graduate of Daulat Ram College came second. Gupta, who hails from small town Nautanwa, near Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh was awarded a cash prize of Rs1.5 lakh, a scholarship of Rs 50,000 and a college reward worth Rs 25,000, while Sharma, currently employed with Deloitte India as an executive won Rs 1 lakh and Rs 20,000 as college reward.The two faced off against each other on whether the lockdown was the right step in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in India.The finalists offered a study on the diversity of the country: B Bharath, of Indira Gandhi National Open University, is the son of a farmer from Andhra Pradesh, and is studying for his Civil Services examination; Sushovan Chakraborty of Hindu College hails from Guwahati, Ranu Sancheti of Gurugram is a student of the FORE School of Management in Delhi, while Manawwar Hussain developed an interest in public speaking during his formative years spent at a Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya school in Bihar.Over 62,000 participants from across Delhi and the NCR registered online for the debate, and over 1,000 students took part in the preliminary auditions. The initial rounds, which took place in January and February, were conducted in various Delhi University (DU) colleges, including Hindu College, Kirori Mal College, Aurobindo College, and Daulat Ram CollegeThough the finale was slated for March, the event was postponed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the disease.“I believe in the power of words and also in action. We don’t have an Indian Administrative Services officer in the family and that’s why I want to be one. A civil servant has great power and with that you can help other people,” said Gupta. The debate format was rigorous and conducted over three rounds. In the first, all eight participants were asked to debate on the topic: Is the start-up culture a fad or a trendsetter. Each participant was asked to blindly pick a side and were given a minute to gather their thoughts. They were then given two minutes to speak extempore. After their speech, each pair of participants was given three minutes to question each other, and an additional minute to present their closing argument. After the first round, two pairs — four participants — were chosen to go into the next round.“With the government encouraging incubation of ideas for start-ups, the middle class is warming up to it and this is the time for start-ups,” said Gupta. Hussain of Kirori Mal College, who won the popular Choice award said “simply launching a website doesn’t make a start-up...what is absent in the country is the infrastructure to support it”. The same process was followed in the second round — the topic of debate was whether corporate jobs were the new form of slavery — but this time around, the three judges were also allowed to ask questions from each participant.“We have signed up for corporate slavery and we are compliant of their demands due to paychecks, but in reality this is a culture that puts less value on the human being and more on his or her productivity,” Sancheti said. Sharma however took exception to the term “corporate slavery”, as it was reminiscent of the master-slave relationship of feudal times. “We now have more choice. Earlier there used to be a strong element of force. Now you can change a job if it doesn’t work for you,” she said. In the final round, apart from the existing format, both participants were also expected to present a minute-long monologue on the opposing viewpoint, which was referred to as the turncoat round. Some of the questions that the duo grappled with included: Was the lockdown an opportunity for the Indian economy? Did it do equally right for the poor, the middle class and the rich? Or was the impact on the economy negative? Could we have avoided the migrant crisis? While Sharma called it an “ill-timed and ill-planned step” done without adequate consultation with bureaucrats and the labour ministry, her turncoat viewpoint was that the government spread awareness through multiple campaigns and implemented the lessons it learnt from other countries. Gupta said that we must not get caught up in definitions of “good or bad lockdowns” . “More people died of hunger they they did of Covid,” he added. Lauding the contestants for upholding the most important principle of a debate, Panda said: “Getting to know what the other side is thinking is a quality that is important in politics, in corporate life and life in general.” Chaddha used the platform to exhort young of India to “join national politics. “The average of India is 29. I am 31. You and I have more reason to worry about high taxes, increasing poverty...we’ll be living longer than most politicians today,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-top-debaters-make-mark-on-the-biggest-stage/story-kE7kmsMrWQWKah8t0eUzVI.html
21-10-2020||Chandigarh||Legal experts differ on Punjab govt’s agriculture bills, as advocate general counts on ‘exceptions’||Legal experts see remote chances of the Punjab government’s farm bills (passed in the assembly on Tuesday) becoming a reality even as state advocate general Atul Nanda cited instances of ‘exceptions’ in the country’s constitutional framework. With the introduction of amendments by the Punjab assembly in the laws, a number of provisions in the legislations enacted by the Centre would stand negated provided the former get a nod from the governor and the President. “Our view is that agriculture falls in the state list. The state has powers to enact laws on the same. But, if there is an overlap (as who has powers to legislate these bills), our enactment is on Article 254 (II) and we have requested the President to give assent,” said Nanda. Article 254 (II) of the Constitution says a law made by the state with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to a law made by Parliament, the state’s legislation will prevail, if the President gives the nod. Nanda said there have been laws in the country which run contrary to the provisions of Central enactments. “We have a provision of anticipatory bail in Punjab which Uttar Pradesh does not have. It was also a Centre’s enactment to be implemented across the country. But during the Emergency, it was done away with in Uttar Pradesh,” said Nanda adding that there are a score of other such examples. But many legal experts were of the view that the bills are more of a ‘politico-legal’ move. “If any law is made by the Central government, the state assembly has no jurisdiction to override it. If there is any confusion, the state can say no and it can give a representation to the Central government or the President. Thereafter, they can approach the Supreme Court. But how will the country run if the assembly overrides Parliament,” said former Haryana advocate general Mohan Jain, who was also additional solicitor general in the former PM Manmohan Singh’s government. Other experts said since agriculture is a state subject, the Centre had no business enacting the laws. Some said since it involved inter-state trade, the Centre was well within its right to enact the laws. Assistant solicitor general Chetan Mittal said the state can’t interfere once the Centre has enacted a law. “If they have to (enact a law) to override any Central Act, power lies with the President. Otherwise, the Central legislation will prevail,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/legal-experts-differ-on-punjab-farm-bills-as-advocate-general-counts-on-exceptions/story-vpeXSw1RhlUN9ro1fDKNBN.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Into snack vendor’s heart||It’s the same blue sky, the same flowers and trees. All these things used to give him joy. But no longer.Durgesh Kumar Yadav is nursing a disappointed heart.“My love story has failed,” he says, his face hidden behind his mask.In his mid-30s, Mr Yadav is a “Bombay bhel puri” vendor in this sprawling public garden, in central Delhi. All day long he walks about the greens, a snack case perched on his head and a tripod-like wooden stand under his right arm. Sometimes he stops in front of a bench or under a tree, and sets up his stand for a few minutes, waiting for customers.This afternoon he stops by a jogging track and rustles out his establishment within a minute. A native of Badayun, in UP, he says his girlfriend is from “proper Delhi.” But then he suddenly freezes and corrects himself—“Hain nahin, thi (she was, not is, his girlfriend). We had a fight two days ago, here in this park, and we won’t meet again.”Mr Yadav has been living in the city for a decade. He met his “girlfriend” about four years ago. “She was the first to contact me,” he insists, saying that she had got his mobile number from a group of people who hail from his village and who live in her neighbourhood.“For the first few weeks we interacted on phone, and finally she came to this park to meet me... she knew that I worked here from late morning to late evening.”Whenever she would arrive, Mr Yadav would momentarily take a break from work and they would chat about “our families, my bhel puri business and about our future.” They would also listen to film songs on YouTube.But now it’s all over, he says, and “I’ll never marry... I will only have God as my jeevan-saathi (life companion).”Even while frustrated with the relationship, Mr Yadav has nice things to say about his ex. “She is a good person, her heart is sincere.”But.He raises his eyes, absent-mindedly removes his mask, pinches his lips, and ties the mask again.Taking out the mobile from his shirt pocket, Mr Yadav looks thoughtful. “Things can be different if she comes today and admit that mistakes were made on her side as well.”He now lifts the snack case, deftly places it on his head, clutches the tripod around his left shoulder and walks away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-into-snack-vendor-s-heart/story-gEAUv1Km4H1fiRpDE3zscI.html

21-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mayor left red-faced as BJP councillors skip MC meet||In an unprecedented move, 18 of the 20 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors on Wednesday boycotted the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s General House meeting, forcing their own party mayor Raj Bala Malik to adjourn it for lack of quorum.Only Malik and Maheshinder Singh Sidhu of the BJP were present in the meeting, held through video-conferencing, besides five of the Congress and an Akali councillor. Even the nine nominated members were absent.“Of the 27 elected representatives (including 26 elected councillors and the city MP), only eight were present, while as per MC Act, quorum requirement is of nine councillors,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.Apparently taken by surprise by her fellow party members’ move, the mayor said, “I don’t know the reason for the boycott.It is their own House and party. It is disappointing that they didn’t attend the meeting.”Contradicting Malik, BJP councillors insisted that she was informed by Dinesh Kumar, BJP organisational secretary, on October 19, that they would not attend the meeting if it is taken on a digital platform. Kumar didn’t respond to repeated calls.While the mayor was left red-faced, BJP councillors claimed they skipped the meeting because of MC officials.Party’s general secretary Rambir Bhatti released a press statement late at night, stating that “MC bureaucrats” were not allowing holding of a physical meeting of the House, which led to the boycott.“On October 16, BJP councillors had decided that the House meeting should be physical (in person) and not through a digital platform. The councillors, including Sood and Kumar, on October 18 reiterated the demand for holding a physical House meet. Kumar even informed the mayor about the party decision,” said Bhatti.Bhatti also alleged that MC officials were not allowing them to bring agenda of their choice, such as cut in water tariff. Tuesday meeting didn’t include it as an agenda. Contesting the claim, a senior MC official, who did not wish to be named, said: “They can always bring a table agenda if they think officials are blocking their agendas.”Just a month ago, a high drama was witnessed at the MC office in Sector 17 after a BJP leader allegedly slapped the commissioner’s private secretary. In turn, the BJP had accused MC employees of attacking the party delegation that had gone there to meet the commissioner. Counter complaints were filed in the case, but the matter was finally resolved.Sources said there is anger among BJP councillors against the mayor and MC officials for not calling a General House meeting in September, and not responding to their repeated requests.The mayor had recently recovered from Covid-19 and had even remained admitted to the PGIMER. “Even if the mayor was ill at the time, the officials should have called the meeting, which could have been chaired by the deputy mayor,” said a BJP councillor who didn’t want to be named.This is not the first time when the party’s internal feud has erupted in public. In the 2018 mayor elections, a rebel candidate stood against the party’s official choice.“It is extremely disappointing that the same people who were rebelling at that time are again playing petty politics in public against their own party mayor,” said a senior BJP leader, who didn’t want to be named.Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition in the House, called it a political stunt. “The mayor and those who boycotted the meeting are in it together. It is simply to avoid facing opposition on crucial issues, such as steep hike in water charges and poor development record of the BJP. We demand mayor’s resignation.”Hardeep Singh of the Shiromani Akali Dal said, “We are ready to represent the people’s interests on any platform. BJP councillors should face other elected representatives in the House. It exposes BJP failures, particularly in preventing a steep hike in water charges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mayor-left-red-faced-as-bjp-councillors-skip-mc-meet/story-nhiEHaebmgImzAoyoP5yZK.html

The tentative merit list was uploaded on the website on Monday. The senator stated that he has received grievances from many students who had applied admission for the five-year law course.In his letter to the V-C, Mehta stated that due to introduction of subject weightage of legal studies at the last moment and not calculating the weightage as per the handbook of information of 2020 like the NSS and other certificates, they are at some disadvantageous position.“In this regard, I submit that the decision of subject weightage for the optional subject ‘legal studies’ as communicated through a letter on September 2, 2020, is totally arbitrary, illegal, discriminatory and in violation of rules and natural justice. On the face of it, the sudden decision of introducing subject weightage is an afterthought exercise only,” states the letter.He added that students have claimed that the calculation of NSS weightage has not been done as per the information booklet.Gurman Geet Kaur Pandey, a student from Chandigarh who has also applied for the BA LLB (Hons) five-year course has also written to the PU V-C raising objections over the tentative merit list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ba-llb-5-year-course-panjab-university-senator-writes-to-v-c-over-objections-in-tentative-merit-list/story-rFNfWS6P3Vfr74KBZUGKpO.html
21-10-2020||Chandigarh||Heads roll in Chandigarh police dept day after shooting in Sector 25||A day after a criminal out on bail opened fire at a garments trader in Sector 25, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal issued a show-cause notice to DSP (central) Krishan Kumar for “lack of supervision”, while marking a departmental inquiry against Sector-11 station house officer Rajiv Kumar and putting Sector-24 police post in-charge sub-inspector Shiv Charan under suspension. Victim Sandeep, who is also a former president of the resident welfare association in Sector 25, has in fact alleged that sub-inspector Shiv Charan was behind the attack. “He was pressuring me to turn hostile in a case, but I had refused,” he claimed.“After the firing last night, I had asked the SP (City) Vineet Kumar to probe into the incident as well as the allegations. Based on the report, action has been taken against the three cops,” said the SSP.The main accused in the case has been identified as Vijay Kumar, who faces several criminal cases, including attempt to murder.Sources said the action has been taken against the cops as they failed to keep tabs on a criminal recently released on bail and freely moving in the area with a weapon. “They failed to check or gather information about the criminal moving around in their jurisdiction. Despite recent incidents of firings, no corrective measures were taken to avoid such a law and order situation,” said a senior police official, privy to the development. The incident occurred when Chandigarh Police are struggling to make a breakthrough in three back-to-back firings reported in the past 10 days, which left one man dead and triggered a gang war.Even UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had recently pulled up the police department for the deteriorating law and order. Following this, the SSP had warned all personnel, and had said that SHOs will be held accountable for any laxity under their jurisdiction. Victim accuse police post in-charge Sandeep was rushed to the PGIMER with two bullet injuries on Monday night , after two assailants walked into his garments shop and fired at him repeatedly. One bullet hit his shoulder and the other brushed past his head. Police recovered three shells from the spot. Police had claimed the firing was the result of an old rivalry between Sandeep and Vijay, who was identified on the basis of CCTV footage. However, Sandeep has alleged that he was attacked at the behest of the Sector-24 police post in-charge. The cop refuted the allegations.According to police, Sandeep was involved in illegal liquor trade, and had been earlier named in cases of gambling and rioting as well. “The allegations have been made against me as I curbed illegal activities, such as gambling and illicit liquor trade, in the area,” said SI Shiv Charan.Accused is a history-sheeter out on bail Accused Vijay Kumar was arrested in October last year, after he fired at a Sector-38 man. The two were gambling in Sector 25, when an argument erupted between them, leading to the shooting. At present, he was out on bail in this attempt to murder case. He is also facing a number of cases of gambling, liquor smuggling, rioting and assault at various police stations. Meanwhile, in the present case, he along with an accomplice has been booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides the Arms Act at the police station in Sector 11. Sources said the accomplice has been identified, and raids are on to arrest them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/heads-roll-day-after-shooting-in-chandigarh-s-sector-25/story-12XVAqgKvJmqmp3KOuKL5J.html
21-10-2020||City||Kharar-Mullanpur road: Travel time from Mohali to New Chandigarh to be reduced by 15-20 minutes||The road that will connect Mullanpur in New Chandigarh to Kharar on National Highway 21 will provide direct access to the towns of Ropar and Baddi in Himachal Pradesh to commuters coming from Ambala and Delhi, who would no longer be required to go through Chandigarh.The project was officially inaugurated on Tuesday by Sarvjit Singh, Punjab principal secretary, department of housing and urban development.The construction of the 200-feet wide road, that was delayed by four months, was allotted at a cost of ₹121 crore and had begun on October 10.

The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo moto PIL instituted by the HC in 2016 and a PIL filed by Punekar Dhyaneshwar Darwatkar, was informed by advocate Shekhar Jagtap that the plight of the children and women forced into begging continued unabated even though the HC had passed orders to curb it.Jagtap submitted that despite a specific direction to the state by an HC bench which included justice Kulkarni to devise a mechanism to rescue and rehabilitate children and women being forced to beg on streets and at traffic signals, nothing had been done. Justice Kulkarni concurred with Jagtap’s submission of begging continuing unabated and said he was very much pained to see children and women begging on the signal outside Mantralaya.Jagtap further reiterated that in the Covid situation also the children and women forced to beg had no relief and were exposed to the pandemic as they did not have any safe place to stay. He also submitted that the state should formulate a policy to provide skill training to such rescued persons so that they may start earning a livelihood.Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the bench that the state was not in a position to provide a livelihood to the rescued persons.After hearing the submission, the bench observed that as the issues raised in both the PILs were important and serious, it was expanding the scope of the PIL from Pune to the entire state and asked the state to file a detailed affidavit enlisting the measures it had taken to rehabilitate children and women who were into begging activity, by November 23. The court also sought the assistance of TISS and directed that it be added as a party to the PILs and posted them for hearing on December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-tiss-to-join-pil-to-address-begging-problem-in-maharashtra/story-RqVrJ3wChP5byWQ5c93wVL.html

Gohil, 52 and a snake rescuer, informed the forest officials about the rescue.The red sand boa looks like it has two heads as its tail is shaped like a head.Gohil received a call from Jai Shiv Shrusthi apartment in Shivganga Nagar, Ambernath, on Monday night, as residents claimed they saw the snake inside the complex. When Gohil reached, the snake had left the compound. However he managed to rescue it from the premises.“The red sand boa has a huge value in international markets, amounting to lakhs and crores of Rupees depending on its weight. I caught a red sand boa for the first time. Trading of this snake is illegal. The forest officials have asked me to take the snake to them on Wednesday,” said Gohil. This snake is harmless. The one rescued is around four feet in length and 2.2 kg in weight. The boas are listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protestion Act, 1972, which protects the reptiles. This means that anyone found with the boas needs to provide proper documentation of the snakes.

21-10-2020||City||Non-Covid hospitals treating Covid-19 patients will be closely watched: TMC||The Thane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) health department will keep a tab on private non-Covid hospitals that treat Covid patients. The department will form two teams to survey all the private non-Covid hospitals in the next 15 days to check if Covid patients were being treated and also if the patients have been tested before being admitted. The decision was taken at the TMC general body meeting on Tuesday. In the meeting, the councilors alleged that most non-Covid hospitals were treating Covid patients. Moreover, they do not conduct a Covid test for these patients, and merely a blood test and X-ray were conducted.Shiv Sena corporator Meenal Sankhe, who highlighted the issue, said, “The health department had earlier taken action against some of the private hospitals for treating Covid patients without permission. However, the practice is still going on. Some hospitals do not undertake Covid tests; instead they rely on reports of blood tests and X-rays. These hospitals are trying to make profit by treating Covid patients without permission.” Sankhe said that this could affect non-Covid patients in the hospital. Thane Mayor Naresh Mhaske added, “If the non-Covid Hospitals were treating Covid patients, this could lead to increase in the number of cases as other patients, their relatives and hospital staff could get infected. The corporation should keep a check on these hospitals.” He was seconded by all party corporators who demanded action. Dr. Raju Murudkar, health officer, said, “If any hospital is treating Covid patients, we will take action as per the law. We will form two special teams who will audit all the hospitals in the city over the next 10-15 days and take action against such hospitals. Moreover, if they have imposed exorbitant bills, action will also be taken for the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/non-covid-hospitals-treating-covid-19-patients-will-be-closely-watched-tmc/story-T98uPFtiGy2S2KmqabstNN.html

Khan always worked with new accomplices. As per his modus operandi, police said, the accused would steal from stores and then sell at cheaper rates. The crime branch received a tip-off from a resident who suspected the items to be branded as the price did not match the products. After verifying the information, the Unit 1 of the crime branch laid a trap and nabbed the accused. Police also recovered the stolen products from their house. “Khan, who has at least five cases of burglary against him in Thane and Navi Mumbai, often changes his looks to avoid the police from identifying him.

21-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government, Opposition at loggerheads over financial help for flood-affected farmers||While targeting Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Tuesday that the state government can borrow ₹60,000 crore to extend relief to the farmers instead of waiting for the assistance from the Centre. Revenue minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat hit back, saying the delay in releasing the pending compensation payments under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) had left Maharashtra in a financial crisis.More than 10 lakh hectares of crops in central and western Maharashtra were destroyed in the retreating monsoon last week. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, who toured Solapur on Monday, will visit flood-affected villages in Osmanabad on Wednesday. BJP leader Fadnavis has been touring Osmanabad over the past two days. Fadnavis said at a press conference in Osmanabad, “The state is entitled to borrow ₹1.20 lakh crore from various sources as per the parameters set by the Reserve Bank of India. The state has so far raised only ₹60,000 crore and an equal amount still can be borrowed. The MVA government should borrow to help farmers who have sustained heavy losses,” he said, adding that he was ready to do whatever was required to assist the farmers. “I have written a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, who heads a committee on Central assistance for natural calamities, to depute the Central committee to survey the losses in Maharashtra at the earliest. The Modi government is positive about the relief measures to the farmers,” he said.Fadnavis also said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has been shouldering the responsibility of defending the MVA government, comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. He played a video of Thackeray talking about last year’s unseasonal rain and reminded his estranged ally about their demand for financial aid to the farmers.On Monday, Thackeray had said that had the Centre released the GST compensation on time, Maharashtra would not have been compelled to ask for Central assistance for flood-hit farmers. On Tuesday, Thorat said, “Our compensation toward GST losses from the Centre has accumulated to ₹30,000 crore since April. We have borrowed ₹55,000 crore so far for salaries and other recurring costs amid the drop in revenue because of the lockdown. Maharashtra is one of the highest tax-paying states in the country, despite which the Modi government gives us stepmotherly treatment when it comes to financial assistance.”Meanwhile, Thackeray on Tuesday said the Union government should take permanent measures to ensure farmers receive compensation from insurance companies. During a meeting with Thackeray, the Banana Growers Association from Jalgaon claimed the conditions laid down by insurance companies benefit the companies and not farmers. Thackeray has instructed the agriculture department to convene a meeting with representatives of insurance companies immediately. “The crops and orchards are damaged due to various reasons. But it is very difficult for farmers to get compensation from insurance companies. The Centre should make permanent measures on this,” Thackeray said in a statement issued by the CM’s office.State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said that a committee with experts should be set up to study various models of crop insurance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-opposition-at-loggerheads-over-financial-help-for-flood-affected-farmers/story-xkocIqKJ1jYFf9xwCN5xGM.html
21-10-2020||City||Cheating case probe leads cops in Maharashtra to Gujarat man who killed wife, buried her body, planted seeds on it||Kashimira police on Saturday arrested a 35-year-old Gujarat resident for allegedly murdering his wife a year ago. The murder came to light when the police was investigating a cheating case. “The couple, Ashish and Nikita Ukani, who lived in Kashimira before 2019, were booked in several cases of cheating after they had allegedly duped an Andheri firm of ₹15.65 lakh in a credit card fraud in September 2019,” said senior inspector Sanjay Hazare of Kashimira police. After the alleged fraud, the duo fled to Mota Varachha in Surat and later changed their names and mobile numbers to live in Gujarat, said the police. According to the police, on October 15 last year, Ukani took Nikita to his native village at Selana in Gujarat’s Amreli district. The couple was consuming alcohol late at night when an argument broke out between them over money. In a fit of rage, Ukani pushed Nikita into a nearby well and she drowned. A while later, he pulled her body out of the well from a rope and dug a three-foot pit in the field, the police said. Ukani then put rock salt inside the pit for the body to decompose soon and buried the body. He also scattered cucumber seeds at the spot to grow the plant to prevent any suspicion. The police registered a first information report (FIR) in the cheating case in last year in December against the couple and were probing the allegations against them made by the firm. A year later, they traced Ukani to Gujarat and he was arrested. “During his interrogation, he confessed to the cheating case, but began evasive answers when he was questioned about his wife who is a co-accused in the cheating case,” said Hazare. Later, he admitted that he had killed Nikita. “We exhumed Nikita’s body in the presence of a judicial magistrate from Gujarat and sent the skeletal remains for forensic analysis,” said Hazare. Along with the charges of cheating, the police also filed charges of murder against Ukani. He was brought to Mumbai and remanded to police custody till Wednesday. The police said Ukani used to message Nikita’s parents from her phone owing to which they did not find anything amiss. The police have also discovered that Ukani is involved in another cheating case, worth ₹2.4 crore, in Surat, and are investigating it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cheating-case-probe-leads-cops-in-maharashtra-to-gujarat-man-who-killed-wife-buried-her-body-planted-seeds-on-it/story-eDkQOccYLn47DhpmkEDyOO.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body corporators did not fare well: Praja report card 2019-20||The overall performance of elected corporators of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation – India’s richest civic body – dropped to 55.7% in 2019-20, from 60.2% in 2018-19, as they had to prioritise campaigning for their parties, with two elections in the year, over their regular functioning and governance, according to the white paper on 2019-20 released by NGO Praja on Tuesday. The average attendance of corporators was 72.6%, from 77% in 2018-19 and 80.7% in 2017-18. This is the lowest since their five-year term began in 2017. There was also a dip in the number of questions asked and their quality compared to citizens’ complaints. The number of questions asked by corporators fell to 2,270 in 2019-20, 2,571 in 2018-19 and 2,609 in 2017-18. Of the 2,270 questions asked by corporators, questions related to roads were the highest (326), followed by renaming of roads/chowks (253), education (151) and health (147). Praja’s white paper further mentions: “More corporators asked poor quality questions in this term – 133 (60%) corporators in 2020 report received poor grade (less than 50%) for quality of questions asked, while in the third year (2015) of last term’s report, 83 corporators received poor grade. 199 corporators (90%) deliberation on civic issues was poor (less than 50% score) as compared to the complaints made by citizens.”Further, 13 corporators asked zero questions in 2019-20, of which Congress’s Supriya More, Manisha Rahate of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Gulnaz Qureshi of the AIMIM have not raised a single question in their entire term since 2017. Harish Chheda (BJP) from Borivli was ranked the best corporator, followed by BJP’s Nehal Shah from Matunga and Shiv Sena’s Anant Nar from Jogeshwari securing third rank. Of the top 10 corporators, five are from the BJP, three from Congress and two from Shiv Sena. In BMC, Sena has 97 elected corporators, followed by BJP (83), Congress (29), NCP (8) and Samajwadi Party (6), followed by two from AIMIM and one from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee, Praja Foundation, said, “Corporators act as people’s representatives in the government by speaking for their constituents and interests which makes their role extremely vital in a city’s functioning. It is our sincerest hope that the councillors in Mumbai focus their attention on the duties and responsibilities that they are already entrusted with and we hope this report card enables them to understand their strengths and weaknesses and work towards betterment of their performance in the coming years.”Mehta added, “Corporators have been in the forefront of ground-level relief and intervention in Covid-19 pandemic in many cities in India. Given the current structure of local governance in Mumbai, however, corporators have not been party to decision-making for the city in spite of being closest to the ground situation and having the most knowledge of the needs of their constituents.”The BJP on the other hand, said administrative work may have been affected owing to elections. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP corporator and group leader of BJP in BMC, said, “We have been taking up issues of the citizens at large every year and we also have five of our corporators in the top 10. However, elections lead to two things – party activities and imposition of code of conduct. This could have had some effect.”Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition in BMC and Congress corporator, said, “We have secured first rank once again, and this shows that though our numbers are lower than other parties, our quality of work has been much better. We have been actively playing the role of constructive opposition and at the same time taking up issues of our voters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-corporators-did-not-fare-well-praja-report-card-2019-20/story-GTA3YBQUtFYMOs10dN5IiK.html

The City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra (Cidco) has said that work on Nerul jetty is in its final stages and will be completed by March 2021.The Cidco, Bombay Port Trust (BPT) and Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) have planned a RoRo (Roll-on roll-off) service that will provide water transport from the city to Mumbai and Raigad.The water transport has been planned from Nerul to Bhaucha Dhakka and later from Nerul to Rewas, Mandwa. A water terminal has been developed at Bhaucha Dhaka by the BPT. The MMB had developed the terminal at Mandwa in Raigad and Cidco is developing the ₹111 crore terminal in Nerul.Thane member of Parliament (MP) Rajan Vichare inspected the progress of the work on Monday along with Cidco vice-chairman and managing director Sanjay Mukherjee. The inspection was attended by Cidco officials who briefed Vichare on the project.Vichare said, “I have been assured that the water transport from the jetty will start from March next year. It will help connect Mandwa to Nerul and Nerul to the Gateway of India.”He added, “This jetty will facilitate faster and cheaper transport to Mumbai and Alibag for the commuters. While it normally takes over two hours for the commuter, the time will be reduced to just 20-25 minutes. We are blessed with a long coastal belt in Thane district. Three more jetties have been planned to help connect Vasai-Vihar, Mira-Bhayander to Navi Mumbai as well.”Mukherjee said, “We are constructing the jetty and a marine terminal here at Nerul. Work on the project began in April 2018 and was to be completed in 24 months. However, there was a delay of 16 months owing to the clearances from the forest department and the Covid-19 pandemic.”He further added, “We are now targeting March 2021 for the completion of work. All the approvals are in place and the work is in the final stages. Once the jetty is ready, we will hand it over to MMB which will run the ferry services to Mumbai from Navi Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jetty-work-in-final-stage-water-transport-between-navi-mumbai-and-mumbai-to-start-in-5-months/story-hGiylhCzAhfciC8AbxnRKI.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Conduct physical meeting of standing committee on October 21: Bombay HC to Mumbai civic body||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to conduct a physical meeting of its standing committee on October 21, after it was informed that an application for the same was pending with the urban development department (UDD).The court upheld the contention of two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporators, who petitioned for the standing committee meeting to be physically held as there were 674 items on the agenda to be discussed. The petitioners pointed out that if the meeting is held through video conferencing, the issues would be passed without due deliberation.The HC held that in the interest of the public, the 27 members of the standing committee along with a dozen officials should attend the physical meeting in the general body hall of the BMC headquarters at Fort while observing Covid-19 protocols.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Makarand Narvekar, member of BMC’s standing committee and Prabhakar Shinde, BJP group leader in BMC, was informed by advocate Jeet Gandhi that the meeting was being held after almost six months. Gandhi submitted that as per the agenda of the standing committee issued by the civic authority on October 16, a total of 674 items would be put up for consideration. He said that the petitioners were apprehensive that as the meeting was to be held through video conferencing, there would be no opportunity for them to deliberate on the issues and resolutions would be passed arbitrarily. However, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy along with advocate Joel Carlos for standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav, informed the court that the apprehensions of the petitioner corporators were unfounded as the issues would be taken up serial wise. Chinoy further submitted that as no standing committee meeting was held in the past six months, the list of 674 items was a backlog which was listed in the agenda and in no way meant that all were to be approved and passed on the same day.He assured the court that the items would be discussed sequentially and items remaining at the end of the day would be taken up in subsequent meetings of the committee.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC informed the bench that it had written to the UDD for permission to conduct a physical meeting on October 14. However, they were yet to receive a response. He added that the meeting could be held with the 27 members of the standing committee and a dozen officials in the general body hall of the civic administration building by observing all Covid-19 protocols, as the hall has a 180-seat capacity. After being informed by the UDD that they had received the application on Tuesday and would require time to decide on it, the court said that it was passing orders for the physical meeting of the committee to be held in the general body hall. The court further observed, “The BMC is doing so much to control Covid-19. If it does not hold the physical meeting, it will send out a wrong signal to the society that the BMC is hesitant.” The bench further said that it was taking the submissions of Chinoy as an undertaking and directed the civic corporation to conduct the meeting physically on October 21.BJP corporators met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to raise the issue of hundreds of civic work proposals being tabled at the standing committee meeting. Vinod Mishra, BJP group leader, said, “He supported our contention, and said that a physical meeting of clearing so many important proposals is important as they impact every Mumbaiites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/conduct-physical-meeting-of-standing-committee-on-october-21-bombay-hc-to-bmc/story-7VmU0Jyyq5ev6RF1VSO0iK.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||ED attaches gangster Iqbal Mirchi’s bank accounts, properties worth ₹22.42 crore||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached seven immovable properties and bank balances in seven accounts totalling ₹22.42 crore, all belonging to kins of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi, under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.The fresh attachments include one cinema hall, a hotel in Mumbai and an under-construction hotel, a farmhouse, two bungalows and 3.5-acre land in Panchgani and bank balances, totalling to ₹22.42 crores, the ED has stated.The attachment was done under section 5 of PMLA.In the past, ED has attached assets totalling to ₹776 crore, including overseas assets valued at ₹203 crore in the case. Now the total attachment, in this case, has gone to ₹798 Crore.The central agency has initiated money laundering investigation against Mirchi and others on September 26, 2019.ED had arrested five accused persons including Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), and Humayun Merchant.A prosecution complaint has also been filed in the case on December 9 last year before the special PMLA court and cognizance of the same has been taken by the court.Open-ended non-bailable warrants have been issued against Asif Memon, Junaid Memon (both sons of Iqbal Mirchi) and Hajra Memon (wife of Iqbal Memon) for their role in the offence of money laundering.The ED probe so far has revealed that the DHFL allegedly extended loans to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which purportedly routed money to Mirchi, who died in the UK in August 2013. The DHFL came under the ED’s scanner when the agency was examining three properties linked to Mirchi in Worli.The ED’s investigation has shown that in 1986, Mirchi, an aide of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, bought three properties from the Mohammad Yusuf Trust, an organisation that Mirchi allegedly used as a front to negotiate with several developers. In 2010, when Mirchi was based in Dubai, Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd bought three properties from him and later developed them.According to the ED, Mirchi signed agreements in 2010, in which he received 90 million dirhams for development rights of these properties. All these are proceeds of crime, ED had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-attaches-gangster-iqbal-mirchi-s-bank-accounts-properties-worth-22-42-crore/story-9Ymp265sJKJMe622oSFj9M.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||Chaos over conducting school exams as Maharashtra education department fails to come up with uniform guidelines||In the absence of clear guidelines from the state education department on the conduct of exams, there is no uniformity in the way in which exams are being held across the state.While some schools are asking parents to submit solved answer sheets of students in schools, others are conducting exams with the help of Google forms. Several schools where students do not have adequate access to technology are struggling to conduct exams for such students. Recently, Shikshak Parishad, which represents teachers in the state, wrote to the education department pointing out the confusion that the lack of guidelines has led to. “Some schools have asked parents to physically submit answer sheets which is a very risky practice in the current situation. Many students are still in their hometowns, thus are facing difficulties concerning online education. Now, exams will add to the stress,” said Shivnath Darade, secretary of Shikshak Parishad. Several schools conducted their semester exams on Google forms and through different applications. “We had a lot of issues with the whole process because not all students were well-versed with the technology. Most of our students access online learning on their phones. For them to give their exams on phones is a bit difficult. We are hoping the government will come up with some solution for such students,” said the principal of an aided school in the eastern suburbs. Officials from the education department did not respond to calls and messages from HT.Parents said with all schools using their methods of conducting exams, it is not a level playing field for students. “Some are taking examinations very casually while others are very strict. This is unfair on students because they work very hard for the exams and ideally, there should have been some common format,” said Savita Mahipkar, a parent from Dadar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chaos-over-conducting-school-exams-as-maharashtra-education-department-fails-to-come-up-with-uniform-guidelines/story-DnywCfhfcuw3Z8EZmRBBEP.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||How Covid-19 lockdown put PhD dreams on hold, left aspirants in Mumbai struggling||For 34-year-old Akshay Raghavan (name changed), 2020 was the year “Dr” would be added as a prefix to his name. However, Covid-19 upended his dream. “The pandemic hit at a time when many PhD aspirants were ready to submit their final work to their respective universities. But lockdown was imposed, and that put an end to library/lab visits, fieldwork as well as basic internet facilities for many who got stuck in their hometowns,” said Raghavan, who is among the many aspirants who struggled to work on their PhD. After working on his thesis for more than four years, Raghavan had to wait till August to complete his fieldwork and add the finishing touches to his thesis. Now, he is waiting for his online viva appointment for the final submission, which will earn him his degree.While the 2020-21 academic calendar was reworked by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the pandemic has affected routine academic functions at universities and institutes across the country and institutions have struggled to provide students with appropriate facilities to complete their coursework. As students and higher education institutes grapple with the changes, among those reeling from the effects of the lockdown are PhD aspirants.Challenges during lockdown The lockdown put in place in end-March left several students in their hometowns and unable to return to the cities where they study. For many, working on their courses at home meant lack of proper e-learning resources; no access to science labs and/or libraries; poor internet facility, and other issues. “For most of us, the only access to research material is the university library, which was shut down from March till August. Even though the University of Mumbai (MU) has access to online journals, students were not given remote access during the lockdown and all this ended up delaying the submission of our final theses,” said PhD student Mandar Panchal.Many students were also affected by irregular disbursement of their fellowship funds. “Time and again we have taken up the matter of fellowship funds with MU authorities, but to no avail. In March, students staged a protest at MU’s Kalina campus and were assured by vice chancellor Suhas Pednekar of quick disbursement of fellowship funds. But six months later, students are still waiting,” said Shridhar Pendekar, a PhD candidate and member of the Chhatrabharati Student Organisation’s MU chapter.Phased approachIn July, the management of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) launched a “slow reboot plan” to restart research work in laboratories in a phased manner. As a first step, it asked around 128 PhD scholars and part-time Mumbai-based researchers if they were willing to resume their research or project work on campus. Between March and September, 169 defence examinations for PhD candidates were conducted and 138 theses were submitted for examination, said an IIT-B official. At the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), the institute approached its academic council and governing body, seeking extension of academic sessions for PhD and MPhil candidates. “Once lockdown was imposed, we encouraged all Masters’ students who finished their exams to head home and encouraged our research students, especially the ones who were in the writing and submission stage of their research work, to stay back in hostels and access the library and internet facilities in order to complete their work,” said Surinder Jaswal, deputy director and dean, School of Research Methodology, TISS, Mumbai.Online interviewsDuring the lockdown, TISS conducted an exercise of physical mapping of all their MPhil students to find out where exactly students were located. Online vivas were held for 196 out of their 200 MPhil students. Similarly, 70 PhD students defended their research projects in front of a team of external examiners and were awarded their doctorates during lockdown. “We annually manage to award around 35 PhDs every year, but this time round, double the number of degrees were awarded,” said Jaswal.In May, MU announced the first PhD degree awarded to a student after she defended her PhD thesis online, before external examiners, during the lockdown. By the first week of October, MU had conducted online vivas for 62 students, including two MSc research projects.“MU has a decentralised system in place where the research topics are approved by individual departments. Students therefore have been in constant touch with their mentors throughout the lockdown in order to continue work on their research. Since we had to keep the university campus shut for the first few months, some students found it difficult to work on their project. So we finally re-opened the library and some laboratories in August,” said a senior MU official.Every year, MU approves approximately 1,000 research projects based on their synopses and awards around 200-250 PhD degrees. “Last year, we awarded 250 doctorates and we hope to award similar number of degrees, if not more, this year,” said an MU official.Status of new PhD admissionsMU started inviting applications for the PhDs in March and received the highest number of applications since 2016 — 6,848 applications, including over 500 from students from other states. The total number of applications included 6,512 PhD students and 326 MPhil aspirants. “Since the start of PhD entrance test (PET) in 2016, this is the highest number of applications received by the varsity. However, in the last couple of months, we’ve received requests from students asking us to re-open the applications process. Once we’ve cleared the status of applications, we will announce dates of the PET exam too,” said a spokesperson for MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-covid-19-lockdown-put-phd-dreams-on-hold-left-aspirants-in-mumbai-struggling/story-vXJt4SWdj7afpaonSE01fP.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||88-year-old engineer and 15-year-old undergraduate student register for GATE 2021||An 88-year-old civil engineer from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and a 15-year-old undergraduate student from Rajasthan have registered to take the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), making them the oldest and youngest candidates for the competitive exam. GATE, an entrance exam for masters courses in science institutes, is being conducted by IIT Bombay this year. In addition to science students, the exam has been thrown open to commerce and arts students for the first time. “This year we have allowed third-year students of all courses — including science, commerce and arts — to apply,” said Deepankar Choudhury, organising chairperson and institute chair professor at IIT Bombay. More than 14,000 candidates from commerce and arts streams have applied for the exam this year.  A civil engineer from UP, born in 1932, has become the oldest GATE candidate, beating the record from two years ago when a 75-year-old had applied. “The beauty of the exam is that there is no age limit so anyone can take the exam with the minimum qualifying degree,” said Choudhury. The youngest candidate is a 2005-born instrumentation engineering student from Rajasthan. “We were expecting the minimum age would be a year lower. However, this candidate, who may be a child prodigy, has surprised us. He is in the third year of his engineering course,” Choudhury said. The GATE score is for admissions to Masters and doctoral programmes at IITs and Indian Institutes of Science (IISc), among other institutions. It is also a qualifier for placements in public sector undertakings and mandatory for many government scholarships and assistantships. More than 8.8 lakh candidates have registered for the exam this year. The exam will be held between February 5 and February 14, 2021. Candidates can choose from 27 subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/88-yr-old-engineer-and-15-year-old-register-for-gate-2021/story-tcTje9wv0zEen5UiKykKjO.html
21-10-2020||Mumbai||From today, all women can board Mumbai local trains||All women commuters can board local trains from 11am to 3pm and from 7pm onwards starting today as the Railways, after four days of letter-exchanges and friction with the state government, finally gave its approval on Tuesday. “I am happy to announce that Railways will allow women to travel on suburban trains from 21 Oct between 11am and 3pm & after 7pm. We were always ready and with the receipt of letter from Maharashtra government today, we have allowed this travel,” Railways minister Piyush Goyal tweeted.I am happy to announce that Railways will allow women to travel on suburban trains from 21 Oct between 11 am to 3 pm & after 7 pm. We were always ready and with the receipt of letter from Maharashtra Govt today, we have allowed this travel.Mumbai’s local trains, used by around 8 million people daily pre-Covid-19, were suspended on March 23 after the state went into a lockdown to stop the spread of the virus. Some services, however, resumed on July 15, with the state allowing only essential services workers, differently abled people and cancer patients to use the trains. The Central Railway currently operates 706 daily services, while the Western Railway runs 700 services as against their regular of 1,774 and 1,367 respectively.On October 16, the Maharashtra government sent a letter to Central and Western Railways (who together run the Mumbai suburban network) to allow all women commuters to travel by train, mostly during non-peak hours. The Railways, however, was reluctant to do the same for the fear of crowding . While one of the ruling parties, Congress, blamed the Railway ministry, BJP as well as railway officials said they were being cautious. Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday sent a reminder to both zonal railways. Also Read: Congress questions BJP over delay in allowing women in local trains in MumbaiThe women commuters allowed in non-peak timings. will have to purchase tickets, but will not require QR code (as was the practice with employees from designated essential services). “Four ladies special local trains will be added from Wednesday. A total of six ladies special trains will be operated. Further increase in services will be done after inspecting the passenger flow.” said a senior railway official.“Between 11am and 3pm and after 7pm ,there will be no checking of women for QR code or identity card and only tickets will be checked, as all women are allowed. Others will be checked for QR code and identity cards in addition to valid tickets. Except for emergency category staff, as identified by the state and women (between 11 am and 3pm and after 7pm), others are requested not to rush to the stations,” said a statement from Central and Western Railway.After a round of meetings last month and early this month, Maharashtra on October 16 wrote to the general managers of Central and Western Railways to allow all women commuters to travel in non-peak hours in suburban trains. The letter, signed by Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation, was made public by the government. Also Read: 53% Covid-19 patients from 30-59 age group, 5% children, teenagers: Mumbai civic bodyThis was the first step by the authorities towards opening of the suburban trains, the lifeline of city, for the common people. The Railways, however, shot back a letter to the state government, saying it was not possible for them to allow the additional force immediately unless the assessment of possible passenger burden was done. The Railways had asked the state for an estimate of the increase in number of commuters, along with other modalities. “The timings can still be an issue. This is because commuters arriving on railway platforms before the permitted time schedule can lead to crowding,” said a railway official on Tuesday.The delay in resuming services shown by the Railways led to friction between state government and Railways over the last four days.Nimbalkar wrote another letter to the Railways, saying the decision announced by the state was in accordance with the multiple meetings held with all stakeholders including Railways. “Latest of the meetings was held on October 13 and chaired by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar. The date of commencement was strategically chosen on weekend so that there would be no much of burden on the rail services. The Railways in its best capacity can assess the potential burden and plan accordingly,” the letter stated.Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, who had intervened and had spoken to the secretary in the ministry of home affairs on Sunday to expedite the matter, wrote a fresh letter to Central and Western Railways again on Tuesday morning, instructing them to implement the decision at the earliest. Also Read: Railways suggest colour-coded QR system for Mumbai train commuters based on staggered office timings“As per the decision taken during joint meetings with all stakeholders, we have requested you to allow all women commuters to travel during non-peak hours from October 17. The decision is yet to be implemented. The women commuters may be allowed to board the trains at the earliest,” the letter read. The letter-war also saw a political blame game between ruling and opposition parties as Congress raised questions if the Railways was deliberately making the issue complex. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Tuesday said, “The state government held four meetings with Railway officials regarding allowing women commuters to travel by suburban trains in the MMR during non-peak hours from October 17. However, on October 16, railway authorities expressed their inability to give permission. There is a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place as far as train services are concerned. Why does Railways want a fresh permission?”Congress’s political attack came in the backdrop of BJP’s statewide protest last week for the demand of opening of temples in the state. The BJP tried to corner the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)and Congress, by touching religious sentiments. Sawant questioned why BJP leaders, who have been advocating for opening of temples, are silent over the delay in operation of railways for women. Keshav Upadhye, BJP spokesperson, said, “The BJP or any of its leaders had nothing to do with the issue. Railway Board took its decision in due course and following all procedures. We do not take allegations by Sachin Sawant seriously. ”BJP’s vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “There was nothing wrong if Railway ministry raised a few questions over the modalities to operate additional services and took some time to complete the procedure. The MVA government had goofed up during the operations of Shramik trains meant for the migrant workers in May. It could not even arrange for adequate number of passengers after a fleet of trains was made available by the Railway ministry. The Congress has no right blame us as it has snapped its ties with real issues related to the common man.” While welcoming the Railway decision, Sawant later said, “It was a deliberate attempt by BJP leaders to stop the implementation of the state government’s decision. The announcement by Railway minister Goyal does not mention tissues raised by the Railways and has simply says that they are beginning operations after request by chief secretary of Maharashtra. This means the issues and reasons raised earlier by Railways were a sham,” he said. Meanwhile, the state government has convened a meeting with Railways again to discuss allowing more commuters from private sector by rolling out staggering of office timings in near future. “Allowing women in non-peak hours is the first step towards unlocking train services for all. We are taking stock of how much crowd can the trains handle keeping in mind social distancing. This is also an attempt to encourage the private sector to go in for staggered work hours. In the next phase, we may allow men to travel at odd hours, to see if it works. Senior citizens and families could be allowed at non-peak hours. The meeting convened on Wednesday is in continuation of the series of meetings being held deliberately over staggering of office timings,” said a state government official. From Wednesday, a total of six women special trains will be operated. Women commuters that have a valid railway pass ahead of March 22 will also be allowed to travel by local trains. Local train services were suspended from March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-today-all-women-can-board-mumbai-local-trains/story-TZ5xCrEFhni4bkJSMQhXzL.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||A third of Delhi’s active cases in red zones, says fresh govt data||At least a third of the city’s 22,317 active Covid-19 cases were in containment zones as on October 18, compared to less than a fourth a month earlier, according to government data accessed that shows how a tweak in the strategy has allowed for more people to be under hard isolation at a time when outdoor activities have increased. The data, accessed by HT, also shows some variations in how various regions of the city approach containment -- West Delhi’s Shahdara and the New Delhi revenue districts have over two-third of their active Covid-19 in containment zones. In terms of absolute numbers of active cases in containment, northwest Delhi recorded the highest with 3,458 cases, followed by South Delhi at 2,937 cases. HT reported on September 20 that 19% of active Covid-19 cases were located inside containment zones as on September 16. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDistrict officials said the increase has been caused by a change in the containment zones strategy. Zones are now further compressed, at times to a single house unit. “Under the new policy, several residences which have more than one Covid-19 case in the family, assigned home isolation, have been notified as containment zones. The policy of micro containment zones has enabled districts to scatter containment zones to conform with the scattered nature of cases. So, there are more active cases inside containment zones now,” said a district surveillance official, who asked not to be identified. Containment zones are in a hard lockdown, with access controlled and any business activity banned. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, “The change in containment zone policy is an administrative intervention. It is, however, difficult to ascertain what proportion of percentage increase in active Covid-19 cases within containment zones can be attributed to this administrative factor. In general, the trend suggests that there has been transmission within containment zones and the government has to scale up contact tracing and surveillance in containment zones.” Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore said, “The 33% active Covid-19 in containment zones as of now against 19% around a month ago would not be a fair comparison in my opinion, largely because of the major change in policy as mentioned by the administration. The situation is similar to the sero-surveys conducted in Delhi, where change in sample selection methodologies led to significant diversion from expected trends concerning prevalence of antibodies. The Covid-19 curve across India is witnessing a downward trend – though at different rates in different states – and Delhi is no exception to that.” According to Delhi revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, the government is “aggressively creating micro containment zones in order to break the chain of transmission at the earliest. The policy is to test, isolate and treat more people. However, it is important to mention that the focus of the government is on creating smaller containment zones so that fewer people are affected and more active cases can be brought under scaled-up surveillance. The status of the containment zones are periodically reviewed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-third-of-delhi-s-active-cases-in-red-zones-says-fresh-govt-data/story-LjO4QoLytE1EAhOeuQNI4I.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to launch awareness campaign on green crackers, ensure their availability in market: Gopal Rai||The Delhi government has planned a massive awareness campaign to promote ‘green crackers’ (low-emission varieties) ahead of Diwali and also ensure that enough stock is available in the market to prevent sales of illegal, polluting varieties, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Tuesday. “We have had a few meetings with the agencies concerned to chalk out a plan to make green crackers readily available in the markets this time. We have also met wholesale cracker dealers over the last week. Our aim this year will be to improve awareness about the impact of cracker burning on air so that the spike in pollution levels around Diwali can be reduced,” said Rai.In 2017, the Supreme Court had banned the sale and use of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR ahead of Diwali. However, in 2018, the apex court conditionally allowed sale of fireworks that meet the standards of low emission and noise levels. It had also limited the bursting of firecrackers from 8pm to 10pm for Diwali and between 11:55pm and 12:30am on other occasions such as Christmas and New Year. The strict regulations were put in place in view of the extremely high levels of air pollution during winters, which peak critically during Diwali.In the last two years, despite the ban on the sale of crackers, the low availability of low-emission cracker varieties—till last year only ‘phuljhari’ (sparkles), rocket and ‘anar’(flower pots) were available in the markets—and the limited quantity of crackers, led to citizens using regular crackers after buying it from other sides. This led to a major spike in the pollution level post-Diwali. Last year, a day after Diwali, on October 28, the city’s ‘air quality’ plummeted to ‘severe’ category for the first time in the season. Rai said the government would launch a large-scale awareness campaign across the national capital to encourage people to use green crackers this time instead of buying the illegal polluting varieties that are sold illegally or brought from other states. Narendra Gupta, president, fireworks and general traders association, Sadar Bazar, who has been attending the government meetings as a representative of the traders, said they have assured the agencies that only the permitted varieties of crackers will be sold in the wholesale markets. “We were asked to keep a check on the illegal varieties of crackers in our respective markets and we have assured them that only green, low-emission crackers will be sold in our markets. However, in Sadar Bazar and in areas near Jama Masjid, a lot of temporary stalls are set up right before Diwali that sell Chinese varieties, which are polluting. The enforcement agencies will have to keep a tab on them,” Gupta said. Cracker sellers also said that unlike the previous years, where there was were only three varieties available in the market, this time the industry is more prepared. This year at least 60 varieties of crackers will be available in the market, they said. “The cracker industry is still recovering from the losses incurred in the last three years. This year, of 90 traders only 10 are expected to apply for licences. This is because for the last three years, the cracker business faced major losses and many small traders have not been able to revive their businesses,” Gupta said. Rai said that with the limitations on account of Covid-19, the focus of the government this time in tackling pollution in Delhi would be based on raising awareness to ensure more public participation in measures to curb pollution. “Pollution does not have a readymade solution. There are limitations this time but that does not mean we sit idle. We will put in all our efforts this time,” Rai said. Referring to the Delhi government’s “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign, Rai said, “We think the pollution in Delhi affects all of us and all of us need to take the responsibility of resolving this issue. If we need a permanent solution, then the sources of the pollution will have to be controlled.I request people to turn off the engines of their vehicles if they spend more than 15 seconds at a traffic signal. It will save fuel and reduce pollution.” The campaign will be launched at 100 traffic intersections from today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-launch-awareness-campaign-on-green-crackers-ensure-their-availability-in-market-gopal-rai/story-w8CZxayCaR4SrWIScyPf2J.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi sees 3,579 new Covid cases, highest in 25 days||Delhi reported 3,579 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday, the highest in 25 days. The number of cases of the infection has been on the rise again in the city, with over 3,000 cases being reported each day in the last week, barring Sunday, when comparatively lesser number of tests were conducted . So far, the infection has affected over 336,000 people in the city and killed 6,081. The city on Tuesday had 23,922 active virus cases.Not only the absolute number of cases, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – has also been on the rise. Delhi‘s has notched an average positivity rate of 6.1% over the last seven days, as compared to 5.5% the week before and 5.4% the week before that.. The number reflects ongoing transmission of the infection, with a positivity rate of less than 5% maintained over two weeks, an indication of control of the spread. On an average, 13,900 RT PCR tests were done each day during the last seven days, as compared to 10,471 the week before, and 9,536 the week before that. At its highest – October 16 – the city conducted 15,660 RT-PCR tests. The RT-PCR tests accounted for about 26.5% of the total tests that were done during the last seven days. This is higher than the 21.7% of the total tests it accounted for the week before and 19.2% the week before that. The alternate for the government is using rapid antigen test — which is cheap, easy to deploy in clinics and dispensaries, and gives results within 15 minutes. However, the rapid antigen tests are much more likely to throw up false negative reports for people who might actually have the infection. “The sensitivity – or the ability of a test to detect true positive cases – is as low as 50% in rapid antigen tests depending on how samples are collected. This is much higher for an RT-PCR test at about 80 to 85%. It could be lower – on average 70% -- depending on how the sample was collected, how it was transported, and how many probes were used in the test. But it will pick up more cases than the rapid antigen test. So, if you increase the number of RT-PCR tests, the number of cases and positivity rate is likely to go up,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sees-3-579-new-covid-cases-highest-in-25-days/story-rXerasv4wCQo4YMTqFUZ3K.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Bar licence of Delhi Gymkhana Club suspended||The Delhi government has suspended the bar licence of Delhi Gymkhana Club for “misappropriation of liquor”, after a routine inspection by the state excise department found that the club was allegedly involved in the sale of liquor even during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, the city administration said on Tuesday. According to an order issued by deputy excise Commissioner Ranjeet Singh on Monday, the bar licence of the club has been suspended with immediate effect and the club officials concerned have been directed to appear before the excise department on October 27, for further proceedings in the matter. Other operations of the club will, however, continue as usual, senior government officials said. A detailed questionnaire sent to the email IDs of the managing committee members mentioned on the club’s website went unanswered till the filing of this report. An official who answered the phone said they are preparing a reply and would release it to the media soon. The Delhi government said the enforcement team of the excise department had inspected the club’s premises on September 17. “During the inspection, a bar sub-store was found in the club for which no approval of the excise department was taken. Further, a club official informed that some liquor stock was found to be missing from the bar sub-store as a former official had taken stock from there during the lockdown. This was done without bringing it to the knowledge of the manager or the members of the club’s managing committee,” a senior government official said. The order, which HT has seen, stated: “It is reasonably clear that the licensee was involved in selling of liquor during the period of lockdown in violation of this office order dated 21.04.2020, wherein all the licensees-wholesale, retail, hotels, clubs and restaurants were warned to refrain from indulging in the unlawful activities of sale of liquor during the lockdown.” In the order, the excise department has quoted the manager of the bar, who has accused a former office bearer of taking out at least 69 bottles of liquor during the lockdown. The order also mentions that the club management informed that office bearer was terminated from the club’s membership. HT contacted the former office bearer, who refused to comment saying he has approached court. “I have approached court against my illegal termination. The matter is subjudice,” he said. After being closed for over 170 days, bars in hotels, clubs and restaurants had reopened in Delhi on September 10 after the Centre released Unlock-4 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bar-licence-of-delhi-gymkhana-club-suspended/story-eBF3hQGKvooxMXM6QauW1N.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||Ensure patients are told about Covid-19 test results within 24 hours: Delhi High Court||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Delhi government to declare the results of the Covid-19 tests within 24 hours. The court said it is completely “unacceptable” that the reports are coming as late as four days with no intimation to the patients who are kept in isolation till the report comes out. Citing the example of a court staff who got the Covid-19 test report in four days, a bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said it has been seen in several instances that the turnaround time has crossed four days which is not acceptable when the person is kept in isolation. It also said that the reports are not given on weekends.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The court was hearing a plea by a lawyer Rakesh Malhotra seeking to ramp up testing in the national capital. It has been passing orders at regular intervals to monitor testing in the city. On an earlier date, the court had asked the expert committee constituted by the lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to design a strategy for ramping up tests in the city. The committee had held a meeting and given certain recommendations, including delivering the reports within 24 hours and ramping up RT-PCR tests in the city. According to Delhi government data, over 4 million tests have been conducted in the city. A Delhi govt spokesperson did not respond repeated requests for a comment.On Tuesday, the court also said that the patients should be told about the test result immediately. Also Read | Lockdown gone, Covid-19 virus hasn’t, cautions PM ModiThe HC directed that the process be streamlined so that the reports are given within 24 hours. “When the mobile numbers of the patients tested have been taken, then the lab can easily send a message to the person intimating the result,” the court said, adding that the issue needs to be addressed at the earliest. Additional standing counsel Satyakam, appearing for the Delhi government, assured the court that he would take immediate steps. The expert committee in its report said that at present more than 80% tests are conducted by rapid antigen method and in few districts it is up to 90-95%. Currently test positivity is 4.3% by RAT and 20.33% by RT-PCR as on Sep 24, 2020. It said that majority of testing has been done in the camp settings (like railway stations, bus stand, crowded localities) and hence majority of people tested were asymptomatic. The committee recommended that all high risk patients, all elderly and those suffering with co-morbidities (in containment zones) should be tested,” the report said. It said that the tests should be conducted between the fifth to the tenth day (since the last exposure) if asymptomatic or as soon as symptoms start. It also said that the turnaround time of testing with results to be given within 24 hours and till the test result—suspected case should be kept in strict isolation. During the hearing, the court also asked ICMR and CSIR to update the status on the approval of the new testing technique Feluda and asked them to file affidavits. It also asked the Delhi government to submit the report of fourth sero survelliance, which is likely to conclude soon, to the court on the next date while cautioning it not to leak it to the media. The matter would be now heard on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ensure-patients-are-told-about-covid-19-test-results-within-24-hours-delhi-high-court/story-EYJEPoUdr6QM2yhLAVk5jK.html
21-10-2020||Delhi||2 held for killing brother over property dispute, stuffing body in trunk||Two days after the body of a 35-year-old man was found in a trunk in outer Delhi’s Munak canal, police on Tuesday said they had arrested two men — brothers of the victim — and cracked the case. Police said the victim, identified as Dileep Jha, a resident of Raja Vihar in outer Delhi, was strangled by the two men following a dispute related to property. Police said Jha’s body was found stuffed in a lidless trunk in Munak canal near Haiderpur water treatment plant on Sunday. The body was sent to the mortuary in Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Gaurav Sharma said during preliminary probe it was found that the clothes the victim was wearing, had a logo of a tailor shop named - ‘Yadav & sons tailor Samaypur’ written on it. On this, it was clear that the man was a resident of nearby area. Missing reports from Samaypur Badli police station and other nearby police stations were checked and one of the missing complaints matched the description of the person, whose body we found,” Sharma said. The complainant, Vivek Jha of Raja Vihar, was called to the police station. He was shown a picture of the body and he identified it as that ofhis elder brother. “To confirm his claims, other family members including the deceased man’s elder brother Satish Jha was also called. When statements of both the brothers were recorded, they were variations. The two changed statements frequently and their behaviour was suspicious,” Sharma said. He said, when they questioned the dead man’s wife, she told police that they used to live with the families of his two brothers in a two-storey building. She said her husband had an ongoing property dispute with his brothers due to which she had been living at her parent’s house for the past two months. She also said that last Wednesday her husband told her over phone that he feared for his life, police said. “On this information, the two brothers were again interrogated and were confronted with information shared by Dileep’s wife. This time they broke down and confessed to have killed their brother. Vivek Jha admitted that on Thursday, they had a quarrel with him. Vivek said Dileep was drunkand taking advantage of that fact, they strangulated him to death, put his body in a small iron trunk and dumped it iin Munak canal. He then got a missing persons complaint registered to avoid suspicion,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-held-for-killing-brother-over-property-dispute-stuffing-body-in-trunk/story-DBWgZqo6yGdmaML9JwKLmL.html
21-10-2020||Education||Braving odds, 569 Delhi govt school students crack NEET||A 20-year-old whose mother works at a doctor’s clinic, the son of an employee at a small book depot earning Rs 5,000 a month, and a first-generation learner who could not attend coaching due to his family’s financial condition -- these are among Delhi government school students who cleared the country’s most competitive medical and engineering exams -- JEE and NEET -- this year. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who lauded these achievers, said on Tuesday that 569 Delhi government school students cleared the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) -- the entrance exam for medical courses -- this year, the results of which were declared last Friday. “379 (67%) out of the 569 Delhi government school students who cracked NEET this year are girls. At least 48 of these students scored more than 500 out of 720 in NEET. At least 29 of these students are from Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in MolarBand, 24 are from SKV Yamina Vihar (C1) and 23 are from SKV Noor Nagar. Girls from Delhi government schools performed really well in the medical entrance test,” Kejriwal said. Among the students lauded by Kejriwal during a digital press conference was Tamanna Goyal, 20, who did not know about the existence of NEET till she passed from Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Rohini Sec-11 in 2018. She lives with her mother, a staffer at a private doctor’s clinic, and a younger brother, in Shahbad Dairy. She has scored 695 marks in NEET and secured 11th rank in the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category. “My mother works at a clinic and she wanted me to prepare for medical exams after I finished schooling. I got in touch with my school and they suggested I take entrance exams for a coaching centre to get a scholarship and I managed to get one. My mother is so happy now as I am going to be the first-ever doctor in the family,” she said. Khush Garg, 18, who secured the 709 all-India rank in NEET could not join a coaching class due to his family’s financial condition. A resident of Krishna Nagar, whose father runs a small shop in Shahdara, Garg said that with the help of his school teachers in RPVV Gandhi Nagar, he managed to clear NEET. “The coaching centres were asking for Rs 2-3 lakh and we could not afford that. I decided to start self-study. With the help of my teachers and a strict study schedule, I managed to crack the exam,” he said. Kejriwal said “talent isn’t determined by money”. “This is a testament that Delhi government schools are undergoing a revolutionary change and students from poor families studying in these schools are paving the way to success. I believe providing equal and quality education to all is the only way by which we can eradicate poverty from this nation, an issue we have been fighting for the past 70 years. These students are inspirations for all those who are pursuing their schooling. If these students with limited means can do it, so can you,” he said. “I want to promise to every student that they need not worry about financial resources. For all the students who cleared 12th and who lack resources for higher education, but have secured admission in colleges, the Delhi government has scholarships to offer, And any student, rich or poor, can get a loan amount of up to Rs 10 lakh without submitting any collateral, from the Delhi government and can exercise their right to education,” he said. This year, 443 Delhi government school students cleared the JEE (Main) and, of them 53 further cracked the JEE (advanced) for admission in IITs. Among these students were Ayush Bansal, 18, who will join IIT-Roorkee. Bansal’s father works at a book store in Nangloi and earns Rs 5,000 a month. A student of RPVV Paschim Vihar, he gives credit for his success to his school. “I could not join any coaching due to our financial condition but my teachers helped me so much in self-study. I want to work to become an entrepreneur and start some start-up after my studies,” he said. Sujata Tamta, principal of Molarband School where around 30 students have cleared NEET this year, said the school had created a system where every teacher would adopt 2-3 students of class 12 and monitor their performance throughout the year. “Most of our students are from very poor backgrounds and can’t afford coaching. With our initiative, we helped them prepare for the entrance exam on their own,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/braving-odds-569-delhi-govt-school-students-crack-neet/story-jNwYqitOhnbdOHigNbfWSN.html
21-10-2020||Pune||Murdered advocate’s phone was thrown in an MP-bound truck by assailants||The phone of deceased lawyer, Umesh More, was thrown into a truck heading towards Madhya Pradesh, after he was killed, the Pune police said in Monday. A day after the body was recovered, the police have confirmed the identity of the body found in Tamhini ghat to be of Umesh More, believed to have been murdered on October 1. The three arrested in the case include a lawyer identified as Rohit Dattatray Shende (32), a resident of Santnagar, Market Yard; and two others, identified as Kapil Vilas Falke (34), resident of Ramdasnagar Audut Housing Society, Chikhali; and Deepak Shivaji Vandekar (28), a resident of Salewad village in Ashti, Beed. Falke and Vandekar were present in the car which had a fake number plate on it, according to police. The phone of the deceased was found by the truck driver who switched it on in MP. The other belongings of the deceased, like documents and a bag, were found at a spot close to the charred body. “We are investigating multiple angles, besides the ACB case, and it is too soon to be speaking about the investigation,” said Sanjay Shinde, additional commissioner of police, Pune. The murder is suspected to be related to a case of corruption that was registered in 2018 based on the deceased lawyer’s complaint. It had implicated another lawyer who used to be his friend. Arrests were made by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB ) that had led to the arrest of Shende, for working as a middleman for the office of the deputy director (land records), and accepting a bribe of Rs 1.7 crore to get an order in an ongoing land suit. The land in question is 50,000 square feet located in the Parvati area. “The body was found around 85-90 km outside of Pune. Very little remained of the body. It was sent for the DNA test. Relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) have been added to the case,” said Suhakar Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, Vishrambaug division, Pune. While the initial case was registered under Section 365 of IPC, after the recovery of the body, Sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), and 364 (kidnapping with an intent of murder) of IPC have been added. While one police officer claimed that the body was confirmed based on the history of a surgery on the face, another officer claimed that the body was conclusively found to be More’s after two of the three arrested men confirmed the location of the body during isolated interrogations, unbeknownst to each other. Both the officers chose to remain anonymous while sharing the information. Three teams of Shivajinagar police station officials, along with crime branch and the cyber crime cell, were working on the case. The three men are in police custody until October 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/murdered-advocate-s-phone-was-thrown-in-an-mp-bound-truck-by-assailants/story-lA2mdJRuQ7Yq4XozKVRcaM.html

This is to ensure the online learning of students in civic schools can take place without any impediments. The standing committee has approved the proposal. Standing committee chairman, BJP’s Hemant Rasne said, “Elected members are making such proposals. It is difficult to deny it immediately in the meeting. The standing committee approved it and sent it to the municipal commissioner for the administration’s opinion on it.” A senior BJP leader, on condition of anonymity, said, “Though the standing panel had approved the proposal for giving tablets to school students, it will not be easy to execute. PMC does not have the funds; and the second thing is, if the administration says yes, it would take time to purchase the same. In six months’ time, there is a possibility schools and colleges would reopen.” The tablets-for-all proposal is one among many sops that have been proposed in the recent months.Last week, a proposal to give Rs5,000 in cash to each saloon owner in the city, to counter the negative effects of the Covid-19 lockdown, was put forth.The municipal administration shot down the proposal.A senior civic official, also requesting anonymity, said, “It is getting very difficult to say no to such proposals, considering, the standing committee approves them. They know very well that without pressure from the mayor, or senior party leaders, the administration would never give positive feedback on such proposals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-plans-tablets-for-civic-school-students/story-RoHoO4PzgnY2f9FWk8asMP.html
21-10-2020||Pune||PMC clears Rs10.23 cr to shift pipelines on Navale bridge-Katraj chowk stretch||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has approved Rs10.23 crore for shifting water and drainage pipelines laid on Navale bridge to Katraj chowk road. The Public Works Department (PWD) has started the road widening work for the 3.88 km stretch passing through the city. As it is a national highway passing through PMC limits, MP Supriya Sule approved funds from the central and state governments. The project includes widening the existing 30m road between Navale bridge and Katraj chowk to 60m. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will also build a 7m wide service road and footpath. As the shifting of water and drainage lines come under PMC works, PWD writes to the civic administration offering to shift the pipelines if the latter release funds. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar placed the proposal before PMC standing committee and sought permission to hand over the cost. PMC Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “Though the stretch is part of the highway, it sees city traffic. It would be better to shift the pipelines when PWD is carrying out the road widening works.” Kumar said, “NHAI is unable to speed up the road widening work because of the pipelines. The go-ahead from PMC will help the central body meet the project deadline.” With the expansion of city and development of Ambegaon and Vadgaon areas, the Navale bridge-Katraj chowk stretch which was once part of city’s outer roads became an important roadway. Absence of service road caused traffic snarls and road accidents on this busy stretch.

We are always prepared when river water levels rise, but the October 14 flood was sudden. We did not get time to collect belongings and household things, and just ran to save our lives. We are yet to see any government official visiting us for panchanama (assessment),” said Shrikrishna Govind Nazarkar, resident of Kumbhar ghat area which was flooded during the torrential rains on October 14 and 15. More than 8,000 houses, shops and dharmashalas (rest houses) were submerged during the flood. Shubham Nazarkar, Nazarkar’s son and final year mechanical engineering student, said, “My final year exams are going on and all my study material is damaged. My engineering project related models and equipment are washed away.” The rising water damaged the shops on Tambda Maruti Temple road. Sudhir Vijay Karaskar, owner of Jagdish Pustak Bhandar, said, “The flood waters damaged half of the spiritual and traditional books at my store. I tried to collect some books when the water level started rising, but when it suddenly touched above 4 feet level, I ran to a higher plane. None of the government officials have come here for panchanama. With business already hit by the Covid pandemic, we hope that the government will provide us immediate financial help.” The flood affected parts in Pandharpur are Kumbhar ghat, Bhajandas chowk, Datta ghat, Mukhtabai Math road, Nath chowk, Kole Galli lane, Kranti chowk, Juni peth, Govind Pura, Sant peth, Ambedkarnagar and Kalika Devi chowk. Pandharpur is one of the most prominent pilgrim cities in Maharashtra where faithful visit to take darshan of Lord Vitthal. One of the dharmashala damaged due to flood was Ashadhi Dindi Mandal, Thane Dharmashala in Pandharpur. Kalyan Mulidhar Naravade, a worker at the dharmashala, said, “The occupants were very few because of Covid situation, otherwise this place is full during this time. We vacated the place the moment water entered the premises. It took us four days to clean the place from mud and slush. Some part of the wall is also damaged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-demand-immediate-assessment-of-flood-affected-parts-in-pandharpur/story-PXfqLS2Io6AMJZhwVixVCP.html

Six people died on Wednesday (October 14) as a newly constructed wall on Kumbhar ghat collapsed due to torrential rains. Four of the deceased were locals. The residents are demanding audit from the state authorities of the beautification work at the ghats. “Work on various ghats on the banks of Chandrabhaga river has been going on for two years. The wall collapse happened at one of the newly built ghats. The stone bricks and material used for construction is of very poor quality. The government should now carry out quality checks of works done at Pandharpur as it is an important pilgrimage city of the state,” said Anil Abhangarao, deputy nagar president of Pandharpur. Four of the deceased belonged to the same family — Gopal Laxman Abhangrao (70), his wife Radhabai Gopal Abhangrao (60), their son Raju Gopal Abhangrao (34) and their grandson (daughter’s son) Sangram Umesh Jagtap (14). All of them are from Koli community (boaters and fishing community). Sachin Abhangrao, brother of deceased Raju, said, “It was his birthday on October 14. When we got to know about increasing water level we rushed to pull our boats from the river. I was also standing with them near the wall, but as I went ahead to help someone, the wall collapsed. I saw my family members dying in front of my eyes. The contractor appointed by the government is responsible for the poor construction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kumbhar-ghat-wall-collapse-kin-of-deceased-blame-poor-low-quality-construction-for-six-deaths/story-vlgpuCvUyVk1NxERExOlAO.html

21-10-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi, Mnuchin near a deal, with post-election vote floated||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she “has a prospect for an agreement” with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, although it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday that the administration is aiming for an agreement within the next 48 hours. Pelosi later said she’s “pretty happy” about the talks, even though there are a few sticking points, like the scale of funding for state and local governments.“The last 24 hours have moved the ball down the field,” Meadows said on Fox Business Wednesday morning.Mnuchin and Pelosi are scheduled to speak again at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. Any agreement still faces a roadblock in the Senate, however, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell having warned the White House against agreeing to anything akin to Pelosi’s more sweeping proposal.McConnell “might not mind doing it after the election,” Pelosi said. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier that if the actual vote on a compromise has to wait until post-election, just announcing a deal before Nov. 3 would still be “very helpful to the economy and markets.”“There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent -- my goal -- or will it be shortly after,” Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC. “I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.”Stocks opened higher with the negotiations continuing, though gains faded. The S&P 500 Index was up 0.1% as of 1:31 p.m.Despite the comments from Pelosi and Kudlow, it could still be an uphill battle to get passage in the Senate after Nov. 3.“It’s pretty hard to predict because I think that what happens in the presidential election will determine that more than anything we know right now,” Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told reporters.Senate Republicans remain on an entirely different track, with a number of them opposing anything on the order of $1.8 trillion. Mnuchin has put forward $1.88 trillion, while Pelosi wants $2.2 trillion.GOP vote counters in the Senate won’t have the 13 Republican votes needed to pass a stimulus package as large as Pelosi is seeking, according to a Senate aide.Given the risk of a damaging public split in the party just days before they face voters, McConnell has warned the White House not to rush into an agreement before the election, according to a person familiar with the matter.Meadows denied such a “warning” had been given, though did say Tuesday that he recognized some GOP senators oppose another stimulus. He went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to speak with Senate Republicans.“We’re working with Speaker Pelosi right now trying to get her to be reasonable,” Meadows said on his way into a closed GOP meeting. “Once we get a deal there, hopefully we’ll be able to discuss the merits with our Senate colleagues.”McConnell plans to seek a vote on a scaled-down package Wednesday -- a maneuver he tried last month only to be blocked by Democrats insisting on a comprehensive bill.“Our Democratic colleagues have been happy to talk about further relief as long as it remained a hypothetical concept,” McConnell said Wednesday. He criticized Pelosi for insisting on getting everything she wants out of a deal, including “wheelbarrows of cash” for mismanaged states.The Senate Republican effort of $500 billion includes items that both sides support, but is stripped of the elements many GOP members oppose -- including large-scale assistance to state and local authorities, tax credits for working families and relief for airlines.Timing questionMcConnell said Tuesday his chamber would take up a comprehensive coronavirus stimulus package “at some point” if Pelosi and Mnuchin are able to resolve the final areas of disagreement and get a bill through the House. But he didn’t say whether he would support such a deal, or encourage GOP members to back it.The Senate majority leader is focused instead on speeding confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, with a potential vote expected early next week.Meadows said on CNBC Tuesday that if a deal does get done and through the House, “it probably will divide the Republican conference.” There are “some senators who really believe that we’ve done enough for the economy and want zero,” he said.Progress was made in recent days over a national coronavirus testing and tracing plan. Pelosi also said, in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday, she planned to bring a counter-offer to Mnuchin on a Republican push to provide businesses with liability protection against virus-related lawsuits.Meadows also said the “biggest issue remains state and local assistance.” While the administration estimates that those authorities have lost $250 billion to $275 billion in revenue thanks to the coronavirus crisis, Pelosi is seeking aid of “about twice that number,” or closer to $500 billion, he said.Meadows suggested a compromise could be found, however. “If we can add additional moneys in terms of transportation and onshoring I think there’s a deal to be made,” he said, referring to the White House’s desire for incentives to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-mnuchin-near-a-deal-with-post-election-vote-floated/story-LHb0oJ0KIrDu2Q8B9EBsaP.html
21-10-2020||World||Thai protesters give PM Prayuth Chan-ocha three days to quit||Thai protesters on Wednesday gave Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha a three day deadline to step down or face more demonstrations, but the leader who made the announcement was arrested within two hours.Prayuth had earlier said he was ready to lift emergency measures he imposed last week to stop the protests as a move to “de-escalate” the situation.Tens of thousands of people marched to his offices at Government House. The protesters have been demonstrating for months against Prayuth and to demand curbs to King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s powers.They claimed success after handing a mock resignation letter for Prayuth to an official outside.“Our fight isn’t over as long as he doesn’t resign. If within three days he doesn’t resign, he will face the people again,” protest leader Patsaravalee ‘Mind’ Tanakitvibulpon, 25, told the crowd.Also Read | Thailand anti-government protests explainedShe was subsequently arrested on charges police said were related to a protest on Oct. 15, joining a list of dozens of activists picked up in the past two weeks. Her lawyer said she was charged for breaching the emergency measures.As Patsaravalee was led away she said: “I’m not worried. This is the government’s game.”In a televised address, Prayuth had said he was ready to lift measures banning political gatherings of five or more people and publication of information deemed to threaten security.“I will make the first move to de-escalate this situation,” Prayuth said.“We must now step back from the edge of the slippery slope that can easily slide to chaos,” he added, saying talks should go to parliament, where his supporters have a majority.The protests have become the biggest challenge to Thailand’s establishment in years and have drawn the most open opposition to the monarchy in decades despite lese majeste laws setting jail terms of up to 15 years for insulting royalty.Water cannonMost demonstrations have been peaceful so far, but police used water cannon against protesters last Friday, further fuelling the anger of government critics.Riot police briefly held up Wednesday’s march at one point before letting the crowds through.Protesters say Prayuth rigged an election last year to keep hold of power he seized in a 2014 coup. He says the election was fair. Protesters accuse the monarchy of enabling years of military domination.The palace has a policy of making no comment to media.Prayuth said protesters should wait for next week’s emergency session of parliament, whose entire upper house was appointed by his former junta.“The protesters have made their voices and views heard,” Prayuth said. “It is now time for them to let their views be reconciled with the views of other segments of Thai society.”Also Read | Thai Cabinet approves parliament session to discuss protestsScores of Thai royalists and anti-government protesters earlier confronted each other at Ramkhamhaeng University. The yellow-shirted royalists advanced on student protesters and the two sides shouted abuse at each other. Some threw water bottles and other objects before the students pulled back and police stepped in to separate the sides.“I beg you, do what you will, but do not touch the monarchy,” one of the royalists, Sirimongkol Ruampan, 24, told Reuters. “I don’t believe in violence. I beg again, don’t bring the monarchy into politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-give-pm-prayuth-chan-ocha-three-days-to-quit/story-rzrjLF5Vxdboz8BVsIAbXO.html
21-10-2020||World||Barack Obama hits campaign trail for Joe Biden in final stretch of White House race||Former US president Barack Obama hits the campaign trail for Joe Biden on Wednesday in a bid to drum up support for his former vice president among young Americans and Black voters in the final stretch of the White House race.As the 59-year-old Obama makes his first in-person campaign appearance -- at a drive-in car rally at a sports stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- President Donald Trump is to visit North Carolina, one of the battleground states key to victory on November 3.Biden, 77, who is leading in the national polls, had no public events on his schedule for the third day in a row, leading the 74-year-old Trump to accuse his Democratic opponent of going “into hiding.”The Biden campaign said the former vice president was preparing for the second and final debate against Trump, which is to take place in Nashville, Tennessee, on Thursday.Obama remained on the sidelines during the Democratic presidential primaries but he threw his support behind Biden after his former deputy won the nomination.The Biden campaign is hoping the star power of America’s first Black president will help boost turnout among young voters and African Americans, who are key to Democratic hopes of recapturing the White House.African Americans voted in record numbers for Obama in 2008 and 2012 but their participation dropped off in 2016, a contributing factor to Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton.Obama appealed directly to young voters in a video released on Tuesday.“One of the most inspiring things about this year has been to see so many young Americans fired up, organizing and fighting for change,” he said.“Your generation can be the one that creates a new normal in America, one that’s fairer, where the system treats everybody equally, and gives everybody opportunity.”Obama said there was a “growing movement for justice, equality and progress on so many issues” and “that momentum only continues if we win this election.”“I know Joe better than almost anybody,” he added. “I trust him to be a great president. He’s on the right side of the issues.”‘Existential matter’Trump has spent much of his first term in office seeking to erase the legacy of his predecessor but Obama doesn’t view the election “as a personal grudge match with Trump,” Obama’s former chief strategist David Axelrod said.“He views it as an existential matter for the country and for democracy,” Axelrod told CNN.Axelrod said Democrats had been strategic in having Obama make his first appearance on the campaign trail at this late date.“In terms of his value, it’s been smart not to overuse him,” Axelrod said. “They’ve been using him in targeted digital appeals to constituencies that Democrats need to arouse in this election: young people and people of color.”“He’s always understood if he was out there constantly, people would want to turn this into a Trump-Obama race,” Axelrod added.While Biden has been keeping a low profile over the past few days, Trump is seeking to recapture the enthusiasm of four years ago with daily rallies in battleground states.Trump’s message has been a mix of optimism, telling Americans that the worsening coronavirus outbreak is practically over, and ever more extreme attempts to tar Biden as corrupt -- even saying Tuesday that he wants the attorney general to open an investigation into his rival.First Lady Melania Trump had been scheduled to join her husband in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday but -- in a reminder of the pandemic which has cast a shadow over his presidency -- she was forced to cancel at the last minute, complaining of a “lingering cough” following her own bout with the virus.Trump is to hold an outdoors campaign rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, on Wednesday, an event the Biden campaign said violated the state’s coronavirus guidelines.“President Trump still has no plan on how to get this virus under control,” the Biden campaign said in a statement.“Instead, he is attacking our nation’s leading scientists and public health experts, continuing to spread deadly misinformation about the virus, and holding rallies that fly in the face of North Carolina’s Covid-19 guidelines.”Democratic vice president Kamala Harris will also be in North Carolina on Wednesday, seeking to encourage voters to cast their ballots early.At least 40 million Americans have already voted, according to the US Elections Project of the University of Florida, nearly 30 percent of the total turnout in 2016.With the election less than two weeks away, Biden has an 7.9 point lead over Trump in an average of national polls, according to the RealClearPolitics website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-hits-campaign-trail-for-joe-biden-in-final-stretch-of-white-house-race/story-jpg3DDdQEMm123l0Q2P25N.html
21-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Why winning the Senate is important for both Republicans and Democrats?||Along with the presidential elections on November 3, elections will also be held for 33 out of the 100 US Senate seats. Special elections will also take place to fill the vacancies in the seats of Arizona and Georgia. So overall, 35 senate seats are up for election.Twelve of these seats are held by the Democrats and 23 by the Republicans. Currently, Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 53 seats. Democrats would need a net gain of four seats, or three in addition to winning the presidential election, to take control of the chamber. The vice president casts tie-breaking votes in the Senate.For the Democrats Colorado, Arizona, Maine, North Carolina, Georgia, Montana, and Iowa look very competitive. For Republicans two states hold the key: Alabama and Michigan. Importance of a Senate majorityNo US President can deliver on a bold agenda without a Senate majority. Therefore, it is very crucial for both the parties to ensure that along with the presidential win, they get a majority in the Senate as well. It is more important for Democrats to win the Senate as they have been promising change on key issues like health care, climate change and the pandemic. If the results of the election turn out to be like 2016, winning the Senate is even more pertinent for the Democrats.Even now, the Democrats and Republicans are at a standstill with respect to the Covid-19 relief package and therefore, the first priority for the Democrats if they win the majority in the Senate would be the relief package. The anti-corruption reforms, the Affordable Care Act, the criminal justice bill to combat police brutality against Black Americans, immigration reforms, the Build Better plan proposed by Joe Biden; all depend on the Democrats securing a majority in the Senate.The recent confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is an apt example of the power that lies with the Senate. Even though the Democrats oppose the nomination of Judge Barrett to the seat left vacant after the passing away of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, they are aware that their options are very limited as Republicans have a 53- 47 majority in the Senate. Therefore, the importance of a Senate majority is something that the Democrats cannot ignore as it is the Senate majority that Republicans are effectively using to push their agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-why-winning-the-senate-is-important-for-both-republicans-and-democrats/story-jvRWb5FSesHsL2jlIWVd7N.html
21-10-2020||World||UK-EU trade talks back on the table after the bloc’s olive branch||The British government and the European Union will resume stalled trade negotiations in London, the UK government said -- days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared the talks over.Johnson declared the talks at an end last week, accusing the bloc of expecting Britain to make all the concessions to get a deal. He said they could only proceed if the bloc made a “fundamental” change of policy.Since then, the EU has agreed to “intensify” talks — a key UK demand — and to discuss the legal text of an agreement. But Johnson’s Downing Street office said Tuesday that it wasn’t a big enough change to resume negotiations.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier struck a further conciliatory note on Wednesday and said compromise would be needed from both sides to get a deal. That turned out to be the key.Johnson’s office said that on the basis of Barnier’s words it was “ready to welcome the EU team to London to resume negotiations later this week” for “intensified” talks.Barnier told the European Parliament on that “despite the difficulties we’ve faced, an agreement is within reach if both sides are willing to work constructively, if they are willing to compromise.”Barnier spokesman Daniel Ferrie said EU negotiators would travel to London on Thursday.Downing Street seized on Barnier’s words about compromise and his acknowledgement that a deal would have to respect the UK’s “sovereignty,” a key word for British Brexit supporters.The two sides have been trying to strike a trade deal since the UK left the EU on Jan 31. They must do so within weeks if an agreement is to be ratified by the end of the year, when a post-Brexit transition period ends.Barnier played down the chance of ground-shaking change after all these months when talks on key issues moved at a glacial pace.“May I remind you that the European Union’s attitude in this negotiation has in no way shifted and it will not shift,” Barnier told EU legislators. “We will also remain firm and determined when it comes to defending the principles and the interests of each of the EU member states.”But Barnier’s emollient tone contrasted with the combative stance of European Council President Charles Michel, who rejected Britain’s insistence that the EU fundamentally change its negotiating stance and cede more to UK demands. Michel told the European Parliament that if Britain wants vast access to the 27-member bloc’s markets, it will have to keep its waters open to EU fishermen, something the UK is refusing to do.Michel said: “Yes, we want to keep access to UK waters for our fishermen. Exactly like the UK, too, want to keep access to our huge and diversified markets for its companies.”Any trade deal needs to go through legal vetting and legislative approval before Jan 1, so it makes the real deadline for a deal closer to the first week of November instead of New Year’s Eve.EU officials have said such time pressure made the UK decision to delay further talks even more baffling.The bloc accuses Britain of seeking the kind of unfettered access to its markets usually reserved for EU members.“The UK wants access to a single market while at the same time being able to diverge from our standards and regulations when it suits them,” Michel said. “You can’t have your cake and eat it too.”EU leaders also remain angry over the UK’s plans to disregard some parts of the legally binding withdrawal agreement it signed with the bloc.If passed, the Internal Market Bill will allow the British government to override parts of the legally binding Brexit withdrawal agreement relating to trade with Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to share a border with the EU.Johnson’s government says it needs the legislation as an insurance policy in case the EU behaves unreasonably after a post-Brexit transition period ends on Dec 31 and tries to impede the flow of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UKThe bloc sees it as a flagrant breach of an international treaty that could undermine the delicate foundations of Northern Ireland’s peace settlement, created by the 1998 Good Friday accord.It further feeds a general sense of mistrust of Britain, and complicates any trade deal since the EU will look at every single, tiniest paragraph to make sure the UK will be respecting it.Michel used it to highlight the need to respect high environmental and social commitments in any trade deal.“Our UK friends say they want to maintain the highest standards. If that’s the case, why don’t they commit to them? We don’t need words. We need guarantees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-trade-talks-back-on-the-table-after-the-bloc-s-olive-branch/story-hIV98wQf727uFqbci45e3K.html
21-10-2020||World||Controversies around third presidential debate in US: Topics, moderator and rules||The third and final presidential debate before the election in the United States is set to take place on October 22 between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The debate is consequential for Trump as polls show that voters are favouring Biden in the election. It is also important for Biden because as per US media, his lead is decreasing in the battleground states.The debate has already become controversial even before it has taken place which is certainly a reflection on the fact that the race to the White House is getting heated as November 3 is coming closer.Controversy over the debate topicsThe Trump campaign wants foreign policy to be one of the topics to be discussed in the debate. Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien wrote a letter to the US Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) urging them to include foreign policy as a debate topic. But, the list announed by moderator Kristn Welker doesn’t include this. Trump’s campaign has accused the organisers of deliberately leaving out the topic of foreign policy in order to “help” Biden.Controversy over the debate moderatorQuestions were also raised by the Trump campaign and the US President himself about the credibility of the debate moderator Kristen Welker. Trump attacked the NBC correspondent by calling her “fake news reporter”, “terrible” and “unfair”. Fox News (which is believed to be pro-Trump) did a segment on Welker and alleged that her parents “poured cash” into the Democratic Party and that Welker has “deep democratic ties”.Controversy over the debate rulesIn the first presidential debate, both Biden and Trump repeatedly interrupted each other and thus the CPD introduced a new rule of muting microphones and giving full, uninterrupted two minutes to each candidate at the beginning of each 15-minute segment. The Trump campaign agreed to the muting of the microphones, adding that the new rules are “last-minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favoured candidate”.The debate will be held at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/controversies-around-third-presidential-debate-in-us-topics-moderator-and-rules/story-n3oQDhH1uZtv3sqzRB74YO.html
21-10-2020||World||Out-polled and out-funded, Trump faces China account questions||As Donald Trump sought to escalate his corruption allegations against Democratic nominee Joe Biden and turn around a presidential race in which he has been badly out-polled and out-funded, the US president was hit by news reports of a bank account in China that he never declared.The account was controlled by Trump International Hotels Management, which paid local taxes in China, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. This was one of three foreign accounts the publication found during an analysis of the president’s tax records; the other two were in Ireland and Britain. None of them figured in public financial disclosures by the president. A Trump Organization spokesperson told NYT the China account was opened after an office was established there to “explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia”.Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns, had attacked Biden in recent days alleging corruption by the former vice-president and his younger and only surviving son, Hunter Biden, for latter’s business dealings in Ukraine and China. He has based his attacks on claims in a news report in a conservative-leaning paper that other publications have not been able to verify. Critics have raised the possibility of the report being part of a misinformation campaign by Russia to influence the elections. Biden has dismissed the allegations as a “smear campaign”.Trump has been trailing Biden in polls: by 8.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls on Wednesday, which was an improvement upon the double-digit deficit he faced a week ago. But the FiveThirtyEight weighted average had him steadfastly short by more than 10 points.The president has been also massively out-funded. According to filings with the federal election commission on Tuesday, the Trump campaign had only $63.1 million in the bank at the end of September, compared to Biden campaign’s $177.3 million.The president’s cash-strapped re-election campaign was unequally matched for the onslaught of hostile ads that has already started from the Biden campaign. Trump has had to bank on free airtime through more in-person rallies and a slew of interviews as one way of plugging the hole.One such interview did not go too well. Trump abruptly ended a sit-down session at the White House with a CBS 60 Minutes anchor on Tuesday and threatened to release his own recording to pre-empt whatever went wrong before the scheduled telecast coming Sunday.Biden, in the meantime, has gone off the campaign trail to prepare for the third and final debate. His former boss and President Barack Obama, the Democratic party’s most potent and popular canvasser, will address a drive-in rally in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-polled-and-out-funded-trump-faces-china-account-questions/story-zTniXvSjvcmjCTHX0IaRDP.html
21-10-2020||World||Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro rejects Chinese vaccine against Covid||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro overruled his own health minister on Wednesday, rejecting the announced purchase of 46 million doses of CoronaVac, a potential vaccine against Covid-19 being tested in Sao Paulo state.Health minister Eduardo Pazuello announced the purchase on Tuesday alongside Sao Paulo’s Gov. João Doria, a foe of Bolsonaro’s whose state government is participating in the vaccine’s development.The cost of the acquisition was estimated at 2 billion Brazilian reals (USD 360 million).“The Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig,” Bolsonaro said on his social media channels, adding that the shot made by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac is yet to finish its testing phase — which is true of all potential vaccines. “My decision is to not purchase such a vaccine.” It is common practice for governments to purchase doses of promising vaccines, to build a stockpile in case they are proven effective. That investment is usually not refundable if the shot fails.Brazil counts more than 153,000 deaths by Covid-19, second only to the United States. The South American nation also confirmed 5.2 million cases of the disease, the third biggest in the world, behind the US and India.Bolsonaro and Doria have had an adversarial relationship since the start of the pandemic, with each taking opposite stances regarding stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions on activity. The governor of Brazil’s most populous state heeded the counsel of public health experts and adopted such measures, which the president blasted, arguing the economic fallout could kill more than the disease.Doria, who supported Bolsonaro’s in the 2018 elections, has distanced himself from the president and is also widely cited as a likely challenger in the 2022 vote.Lawmaker Bia Kicis, a close ally of Bolsonaro’s, published on her social media channels another message that she said came directly from the president: “I warn that we will not buy a single dose of vaccine from China, and my administration does not maintain any dialogue with João Doria on the matter of Covid-19,” the message said.In June, Brazil’s government announced a deal with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to purchase 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-rejects-chinese-vaccine-against-covid/story-rhQil605Ovlmhqcr26wmiM.html

It tallied a record 927,000 confirmed cases over the last week.Based on a 14-day moving average, Switzerland now counts about 394 cases per 100,000 people, he said.“A month ago, it was less than 60,” Berset said, alluding to a previous level at which Swiss authorities had set as a warning threshold.He said the Swiss government would wait until next Wednesday to see if new measures can stem the spread, because it will take 10 days to determine their effect, and would tighten them if necessary.Those measures, announced Sunday, include a requirement for people to wear face and nose coverings in all publicly accessible indoor areas, such as railway stations, airports, schools, shopping malls, stores, places of worship, libraries and hotels.Gatherings of more than 15 people aren’t permitted in public, and new regulations were put on private events of more than 15 people. People were urged to work from home if possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-fear-rise-in-covid-19-cases-could-overburden-hospitals/story-5KLz5xTf3eVkPMQe6mvNtK.html
21-10-2020||World||Ajanta cave images, Bhagwad Gita deposited at eternal Arctic archive||High-resolution images of the iconic Ajanta caves and the Bhagwad Gita on Wednesday joined in a unique archive deep inside a decommissioned coal mine in the remote arctic island of Svalbard in Norway, where items of world memory are stored to last nearly 1,000 years.The Arctic World Archive, the unique repository for the benefit of future generations, was opened in 2017. Several governments have since deposited items there for long-term storage in a facility designed to withstand natural and man-made disasters.Supported by India’s ministry of culture, the Ajanta images and a paper on the caves, titled ‘Revelation of Ajanta Caves’ by noted photographer Benoy K Behl, were deposited by a group that included representatives of the National Museum of Norway, Unicef Norway, the Norwegian Defence Museum and Mjøndalen Sports Association.The Bhagwad Gita was deposited in the archive in February 2018, a spokesperson of Norwegian data-storage company Piql AS that created the archive with the National Museum of Norway said. The Ajanta items were deposited by Indian data enterprise Sapio Analytics, which has been working with various ministries on the project.Ashwin Srivastava of Sapio Analytics said: “This deposit is the initiation of deposits of digitised and restored murals of Ajanta Caves. We are starting off with one of Benoy Behl’s masterpiece photographs of Ajanta paintings, widely regarded to be the best ever art by any human being. We also have a few other restored works and papers in this deposit. This marks the start of preserving the gateway of culture of Asia for eternity.”Behl added: “The murals of India have been established as one of the greatest and most sublime traditions of the art of the world. The murals on Ajanta Caves are one of the greatest art created ever in the history of humankind.” “This is India’s deepest cultural connection to all the countries of Asia. The paintings of Ajanta are recognised and deeply revered by art historians and Buddhist priests. I am proud to see my work on Ajanta Caves getting saved.”The Ajanta items were the first deposit in the archive from any Unesco heritage site, and among several others deposited on Wednesday. Since the Ajanta paintings cannot be photographed with lights, a special low-light photographic technique was used. Deep learning artificial intelligence was also applied, with inputs from historians, to restore broken images.Rune Bjerkestrand of Piql said at the event: “The data you have deposited today (physically or virtually) contributes to richer picture of our era for the generations to come”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ajanta-cave-images-bhagwad-gita-to-be-kept-in-eternal-arctic-archive/story-BoktlULRDWyU5dBeZl7RxI.html
21-10-2020||World||‘So much work to do’: How Joe Biden is planning for transition||If Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump next month, he’ll quickly face a new challenge: standing up a new administration to lead a divided nation through a series of historic crises.After making Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign, Biden will have to show that his team can better handle the public health calamity. He will also have to contend with what Democrats say is the damage the Trump administration has done to the bureaucratic machinery in Washington, as well as low morale throughout the civil service.And he’ll face pressure from liberals to deliver early wins with personnel and Cabinet picks to ensure their buy-in for his big policy fights to come.With the election less than two weeks away, Biden and his aides are most focused on maintaining his advantage in polls against Trump. “No decisions, from personnel to policy, will be made until after the election,” Biden transition spokesman Cameron French said Wednesday.Still, some Democrats are beginning to prepare for the challenges that may swiftly unfold once the campaign is over.“This will be one of the most important, most difficult and yes most costly transitions in modern American history,” Chris Korge, the Democratic National Committee’s finance chair, warned donors in a recent letter obtained by The Associated Press. “There is so much work to do.”According to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that advises presidential candidates on the transition, Biden will have to name more than 4,000 political appointees to fill out his administration, including more than 1,200 requiring Senate confirmation. There are 700 key executive branch nominations that must go through Senate confirmation, 153 of which are currently vacant.Chris Lu, executive director of President Barack Obama’s 2008 transition, said there are vacancies in some of the departments that will be key to addressing the country’s standing globally and the climate crisis.“There’s a lot of expertise that’s just gone now — in particular, when you look at places like the State Department and the gutting of the Foreign Service or, you know, in climate agencies like EPA or Interior,” he said.Launching a team to address the pandemic would probably be Biden’s top priority.Chief among Biden’s first priorities as president will be moving quickly to address the pandemic. He would likely move quickly to announce Cabinet picks that would be key in the response, according to people involved in transition planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Those roles include leaders of the treasury and health and human services departments and the director of the National Economic Council.Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a longtime Biden ally and friend, is seen as a top contender for secretary of state, and he has been increasingly vocal about foreign policy in recent weeks. He wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs and participated in a recent panel discussion on the future of US foreign policy.Biden is also expected to look to some of his former opponents and those he vetted as his potential running mate for top Cabinet positions.Rep. Karen Bass of California, whom Biden considered for vice president, is seen as a potential housing and urban development secretary.Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who was also included in Biden’s vice presidential shortlist, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former primary opponent, are discussed for secretary of veterans affairs. One person familiar with the transition planning said Buttigieg could also be an ambassador to the United Nations.Other news reports have suggested Michèle Flournoy, a top adviser to two secretaries of defense under Obama, is a top contender for defense secretary, and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is a possible energy secretary.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, could be a candidate for treasury secretary, though she could face confirmation challenges, depending on the makeup of the Senate, if she’s seen as too progressive.The Biden team is looking at a few other departments as opportunities to make history: There’s never been a female or a Black defense secretary, nor a Black interior secretary or female veterans affairs secretary.Biden might face his first real fight over possible White House aides.His team is expected to roll out a chief of staff and director of the National Economic Council within days of the election. He’s believed to be considering former chiefs of staff Steve Richetti, Bruce Reed and Ron Klain to reprise their old positions, and Jeff Zeints and Brian Deese, both top officials on the National Economic Council under Obama, to return.Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive advocacy group geared toward putting pressure on Democratic administrations to appoint liberal nominees and top officials, said those picks will have potentially pivotal implications for the success of Biden’s first 100 days in office.“The potential honeymoon for a Biden administration with progressives will be very short, if he is making impactful decisions that seem to augur four years of moderation in the face of things believed to be serious, a serious crisis,” he said.Hauser said the left views Richetti and Reed as “really bad” picks because Reed is seen as a moderate and Richetti is a longtime lobbyist.Zeints and Deese are similarly concerning for progressives; Hauser said they’d prefer Heather Boushey or Jared Bernstein, both of whom are current Biden campaign economic advisers, to lead the National Economic Council.If Biden wins, it’s unclear how closely Trump administration officials would work with the incoming team. Alan Kessler, a prominent Democratic fundraiser, said he worries about the possibility that Trump could direct his top officials to resist sharing key details with the transition.“When you have the president saying, ‘I’m not going quietly, and if I lose, it’s because it was rigged and there’s fraud,’ that’s a concern,” he said. “Is it going to mean the Biden campaign’s not going to be able to conduct the transition? No. But it will be a lot harder if the current administration doesn’t cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-so-much-work-to-do-how-joe-biden-is-planning-for-transition/story-LlrKYnLKNuze06ys9ONJpM.html
21-10-2020||World||Sindh Police chief kidnapping plot by Rangers fans Pakistan political crisis||The high-profile kidnapping of a police chief in Pakistan by official paramilitary troops signals further turmoil in a country already bracing for more protests against Prime Minister Imran Khan.Troops known as rangers raided the house of Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar, the inspector general of police in southern Sindh province. Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, a spokesman for opposition politician Bilawal Bhutto Zardari -- whose party rules the state -- told Dunya TV the rangers forced the police chief to sign an order to arrest another opposition leader, Safdar Awan.While Khan’s pro-military government has not yet addressed the issue, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa ordered an inquiry. A spokesman for the prime minister was not immediately available to comment, and the office of the rangers in Karachi declined to do so.Since the incident, Mahar told his officers to delay leave until the completion of the probes by the army and state government, the Sindh police said on Twitter late Tuesday. Top ranking police officers in the province have sought leave for being “ridiculed,” Khokhar said.The incident comes amid the worst turmoil in Pakistan since Khan’s rise to power about two years ago. An alliance of 11 opposition parties is holding nationwide rallies seeking his removal over food shortages and inflation, and demanding the military stop meddling in politics.The army, which has directly ruled Pakistan for about half of its existence since 1947, has historically played a key part in shaping foreign and national security policy, but has expanded its role under the current government. The army and the judiciary cannot be criticized publicly under Pakistan’s constitution.The rangers are headed by a military officer and operate under the interior ministry, according to the force’s website.The alleged kidnapping happened before the police arrested Awan -- husband of Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who is the daughter and political heir of three time premier Nawaz Sharif. Awan, who was charged with raising political slogans during a visit to the tomb of the nation’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi, secured bail from the Sindh High Court.It follows the arrest of journalists and opposition leaders, some whom have been charged with treason by Khan’s government for criticizing the army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/high-profile-kidnapping-plot-fans-pakistan-political-crisis/story-to9ZWyBnVgAOTnCqAqTPKM.html
21-10-2020||World||Donald Trump abruptly leaves CBS interview after 45 minutes||United States President Donald Trump abruptly concluded a solo interview with CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Tuesday, and did not return for an appearance he was scheduled to shoot with US Vice President Mike Pence, sources said.After camera crews set up at the White House on Monday, Trump sat down with host Lesley Stahl for about 45 minutes on Tuesday before leaving abruptly the interview and told the network he believed they had enough material to use, according to two sources, CNN reported.CBS News did not instantly respond to a CNN request for comment. When reached for comment, the White House did not dispute CNN’s reporting.Later, Trump posted on Twitter a clip of the reporter at the White House attacking her for not wearing a face mask.“I am pleased to inform you that, for the sake of accuracy in reporting, I am considering posting my interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, PRIOR TO AIRTIME! “ he added. “This will be done so that everybody can get a glimpse of what a FAKE and BIASED interview is all about ... “ Trump tweeted.Also Read| US Presidential Elections 2020: Donald Trump tends to his electoral map, Joe Biden prepping for debateHowever, a source later informed CNN that Stahl had a mask on from the time she entered the White House to when the interview started. The image from the tweet only showed her standing with her producers before she went back to her belongings to wear the mask.According to CNN, with about two weeks until the election, “Trump has spent this week lobbing scatter-shot attacks and growing upset at depictions portraying his campaign as doomed. His truncated taping on “60 Minutes” seemed an extension of what has been Trump’s visible irritation as he enters the campaign’s final days.”Along with Trump and Pence, former Vice President Joe Biden and California Senator Kamala Harris also gave interviews with CBS and all four are scheduled to appear in a programme on Sunday. Trump and Pence were scheduled to appear on the Sunday programme together, as they did four years ago for a walk and talk session before Trump decided to end the interview without reason. Biden and Harris, however, filmed their interviews separately.Trump is facing a massive national polling shortage against Biden.He even called the director of NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Dr. Anthony Fauci a “disaster” on Monday, and called the news media “criminals” for not reporting unproven accusations against Biden.Trump also demanded his attorney general to work “fast” to investigate the unfounded accusations against Biden before the elections. After the panel organizing Thursday’s debate announced that the candidates’ microphones would be muted for certain parts of the event, Trump accused them of bias.Also Read: Trump says he could be ‘king’ of all fundraisers, slams Biden for being ‘servant’ of lobbyistsTrump has also expressed anger over news stories commenting that his campaign is fated for defeat. He has even questioned why the Republicans are appearing to distance themselves.Trump told reporters, “I’m not running scared,” “I think I’m running angry.”Polling in states where Trump won in 2016, shows Biden to be ahead this time. Trump admitted that he was upset while standing on the tarmac in Arizona on Monday.While speaking to Trump off-camera in 2016, Stahl said that he admitted his attacks on the press were meant to demean negative stories that are published about him.As per CNN, “He said, ‘You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.’ He said that,” Stahl said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-abruptly-leaves-cbs-interview-after-45-minutes/story-FM3IyWar11vFUQMF3fuxSN.html
21-10-2020||World||Special Taliban unit ambush Afghan forces butchering 34 during peace talks||A special unit of Taliban militants ambushed a convoy of Afghan security forces on Tuesday evening, killing as many as 34 even as the insurgent group holds peace talks with the Kabul government to end the 19-year-old war.The night raid by Taliban fighters, some armed with night-vision goggles and laser-assisted rifles, took place in Afghanistan’s north as the convoy made its way to the city of Takhar, said Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the province. Hejri said many soldiers and police officers were wounded and still missing. Abdul Qayum, the head of the province’s public health department, confirmed the death toll by phone.The attack is the worst in two weeks after a days-long battle in southern Helmand province displaced about 30,000 Afghans and resulted in heavy casualties to both sides. Another suicide car bomb attack in Ghor on Sunday, which Kabul blamed on the insurgents, killed 15 people and wounded more than 80 others.The Taliban have continued to ratchet up violent pressure while talks are being held in Doha between the group and Afghan government. They have yet to reach an agreement on even the most basic issues. These include procedural rules and whether a landmark February agreement between Washington and the Taliban should serve as the basis for talks.Violent LeverageThe Kabul administration has accused the insurgents of mounting attacks across the country in a bid to gain leverage in the negotiations. The Taliban haven’t made any comment on the ambush and Hejri said the insurgents also suffered heavy casualties.The talks began after the U.S. signed the agreement with the Taliban that called for the departure of all foreign military forces by May 2021. However, US President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he wants all American forces in Afghanistan home by Christmas, comments that the Taliban welcomed.Experts have said that continued violence enacted by the Taliban is a worry that would be exacerbated by the Americans leaving before the intra-Afghan peace talks make any real headway. Afghanistan is the site of the US’s longest war, and 5,000 American soldiers are currently serving there. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and cost the US almost $1 trillion since its invasion in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/special-taliban-unit-ambush-afghan-forces-butchering-34-during-peace-talks/story-lwAP1Z5AjPaSVj34DW0XlJ.html
21-10-2020||World||Durga Puja, Diwali turn virtual in UK in wake of Covid-19||The Midlands city of Leicester is reputed to hold the largest Diwali celebrations outside India, and Durga Puja in the popular London Sharad Utsav attracts many, but the Covid-19 pandemic has forced organisers to adopt innovative ways to ring in the festive spirit this year.The Leicester City Council that funds and promotes celebrations on the arterial Belgrave Road said that this year will be the city’s first virtual Diwali Day celebration. There will be no gatherings on the road for traditional entertainment and fireworks.Instead, the council has invited people to join the celebrations from the safety of their homes. It said in a statement: “Members of the public can send in their personal video messages, which could feature in an hour-long package of entertainment that will be streamed on the Visit Leicester website on Diwali Day – Saturday 14 November.”The council said each video filmed on a mobile phone should be around 30-45 seconds long, shot in landscape format and recorded in English. People can use their video to wish a friend, or a family member, a Happy Diwali, or they could share their tips for a socially-distanced celebration with people around the world.Leicester has a large population of Indian origin, many of whom migrated after being expelled by Idi Amin in Uganda in the early 1970s. Several Indian banks, shops and restaurants catering to the population are based on Belgrave Road.Deputy city mayor Piara Singh Clair said: “We all need to find different ways to celebrate important festivals like Diwali and Christmas this year. Although we can’t meet up with our extended families in person this year, our virtual Diwali celebration will help bring people together”.“We hope that people will enjoy recording their messages, and we look forward to sharing as many of them as possible as part of our Diwali Day programming,” he added.The council said that besides the video messages, the Diwali Day programme will feature music, story-telling, dance and the traditional lighting of the ‘diva’ lamp. It will not organise fireworks, but footage of the spectacular displays from previous years will be included in the virtual event.In London, this year’s theme for the London Sharad Utsav is ‘A Ray of Hope’ to pay tributes to the legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray (1921-1992) on his birth centenary year, as well as reflect optimism in the time of pandemic. Its organisers are also making use of innovative technology. Suranjan Som, vice-president of London Sharad Utsav, said: “No one will miss our Pujo. Anyone will be able to offer Anjali or pray during Sandhi Pujo from their home. We are using Google VR technology to ensure London Sharad Utsav reaches every home and mobile device across the world. “With a relatively inexpensive Google Cardboard VR headset, they will feel that are sitting right in front of our idol, while our priest carries out the regular ceremonies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/durga-puja-diwali-turn-virtual-in-uk-in-wake-of-covid-19/story-THDrRpUjnMRmcrSZTP44zO.html
21-10-2020||World||US govt sues Google: What is the antitrust case and how will it impact the tech giant||The Justice Department of the US government has sued Alphabet owned Google accusing the company of illegally abusing its dominance in internet search and harming competitors and consumers. Here is everything you need to know about this lawsuit:What is the US government’s stand?The government has accused Google of illegally protecting its dominant position in the market for search and search advertising through deals signed with big companies like Apple and other smartphone makers, all of who have Google as the default search engine on their devices. This makes Google dominant in the search market, a “monopoly gatekeeper for the internet” as described by the Justice Department. Other than that, digital advertising on Google is also under the scanner which includes search, web display and video ads. The lawsuit alleges that Google’s behaviour in the digital advertising space is that of a monopolist, “exclusionary” as it stifles smaller competitors and inhibits innovation resulting in a huge disservice to the consumers. What is Google’s stand?Google has consistently maintained that their services are useful for the consumers and free for everyone to use. It has also emphasised that all the deals it has made are legal and help the companies.Is this politically motivated?While questioning a single company holding so much power is more of a policy concern that has been repeatedly raised by senators like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Occasio Cortez, this lawsuit has immediate implications as it comes just two weeks before the US 2020 presidential elections. Attorney General William Barr is said to have moved rather quickly on this lawsuit as taking on the Big Tech giants was one of Trump’s election promises.Has such a lawsuit ever happened before?A similar case happened 22 years ago in 1998 against Microsoft as the company was accused of bundling all products around Windows. At the time of the Microsoft lawsuit, Google was just a startup and had claimed that Microsoft’s practices were “anti-competitive”.What will happen next?The US government and Google could reach a settlement but if that doesn’t happen, both of them are headed to the court. The outcome of the case will certainly take years to come but the lawsuit is the first significant step taken against Google.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-sues-google-what-is-the-antitrust-case-and-how-will-it-impact-the-tech-giant/story-5MBLVjsSa4YuJBbQ8UFfFM.html
21-10-2020||World||Thai protesters continue rallies, ask court to revoke order||Student activists applied to a court Wednesday to try to revoke a state of emergency that Thailand’s government declared last week in an effort to rein in the country’s growing anti-government protests.Demonstrations have continued daily in a movement that calls for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to step down, for a more democratic constitution and for reforms to the monarchy — a revered institution traditionally treated as sacrosanct in Thailand.Protesters gathered Wednesday for an eighth straight day, even though many of their top leaders have been detained and the state of emergency bans public gatherings of more than four people.The main group of a few thousand at most met at Bangkok’s Victory Monument, and then began marching to Government House, the office of the prime minister.A taped televised speech by the prime minister, meanwhile, was scheduled to be broadcast Wednesday evening. He was expected to call for a peaceful resolution of the political crisis through parliamentary means.Even the forcible dispersion of a rally by riot police backed by water cannons in Bangkok last Friday failed to faze protesters, who appeared in equal or greater numbers on subsequent days.Since Friday, police have not confronted the protesters directly, instead trying to disrupt their gatherings by selective shutdowns of mass transit and seeking to block their online organizing activities.The six university students who went to a civil court in Bangkok on Wednesday are suing Prayuth, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan and national police chief Suwat Chaengyodsuk. They want the court to temporarily revoke the emergency decree until a full legal ruling can be issued on its legality.The students, who read their petition to the media in Thai, English and German, said the decree restricted the legal right of assembly and “excessively, unfairly and shamelessly violated the rights and freedoms of people” with no respect to the constitution.The court did not act on their petition but may rule Thursday on a similar appeal that was filed Tuesday by the opposition Pheu Thai party.Separately Wednesday, two protest leaders sought to be released on bail at a Bangkok criminal court. After a hearing, however, the court refused to release them, saying they could pose a threat to public order.The two — Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak and Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul — were initially taken into custody during an attempted overnight rally outside the prime minister’s office on the night of October 14. They were released Tuesday but immediately rearrested on other charges.As he was being driven into the court compound in a prison van, Parit opened a window, flashed a three-fingered salute — the protesters’ symbol of defiance — and shouted, “The court must side with the people!”Another activist was arrested Wednesday morning in connection with last week’s protests. Suranart Panprasert is accused of involvement with acts of harm against the queen when her motorcade passed a small crowd of demonstrators. Depending upon exactly what he is charged with by a court, he could face a life sentence if convicted.According to witnesses and video footage, no violence occurred as the motorcade passed, but a small group of people made the three-finger protest gesture and shouted slogans at the car carrying Queen Suthida, the wife of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.The calls for reform of the monarchy have galled conservative Thais. Royalists have stepped up their presence online and held a small rally Wednesday.Thailand’s Parliament is reconvening for a special session next week to deal with the political pressures of the protests. The government has also sought to censor reporting of the demonstrations, citing “distorted information” that could cause unrest and confusion, but the targeted outlets continued to broadcast Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-continue-rallies-ask-court-to-revoke-order/story-teJHGahO6Go3z2fbasB2mM.html
21-10-2020||World||Hurricane Epsilon, the tenth of a busy season, nears Bermuda||Hurricane Epsilon, the 10th of this very busy Atlantic season, was moving toward Bermuda on Wednesday.Epsilon is expected to make its closest approach to the island on Thursday night, and there is a risk of a direct impact, according to the US National Hurricane Centre. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Bermuda and residents have been urged to closely monitor the storm.Large swells generated by Epsilon are already affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the Leeward Islands, and are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.The Miami-based hurricane centre said Epsilon had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) on Wednesday morning. The storm was located about 450 miles (725 kilometres) east-southeast of Bermuda, and was moving northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).This year’s hurricane season has had so many storms that the Hurricane Centre has turned to the Greek alphabet for storm names after running out of official names.Epsilon also represents a record for the earliest 26th named storm, arriving more than a month before a storm on November 22 in 2005, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-epsilon-the-tenth-of-a-busy-season-nears-bermuda/story-jfcjqBZIF75k1BHh4MZTkM.html
21-10-2020||World||China preparing PLA for long haul at LAC, upgrading weapons, logistics||China is rapidly upgrading infantry weaponry and logistical support for its border troops stationed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) amid the ongoing boundary tensions with India in eastern Ladakh, state media reported.The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Western Theatre Command (WAC), under which the long and disputed India-China border falls, is commissioning new and precision-based weapons and upgraded winter clothes and permanent barracks for its troops.The upgrades come in the backdrop of the months-long stand-off in eastern Ladakh, which has seen both sides amassing troops and equipment along the LAC.India has consistently opposed presence of PLA troops across LAC. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week that it presents a critical security challenge to India.“It has obviously had a very deep public impact and a very major political impact and it has left the relationship profoundly disturbed,” he said, referring to the large numbers of Chinese forces deployed at friction points on the LAC. “I haven’t got a reasonable explanation...from them [Chinese] on this matter,” he said, adding that the concentration of Chinese troops at the disputed border represented a “critical security challenge”.However, it seems clear that the PLA is equipping and readying itself for the long-haul in areas of Tibet and Xinjiang, which witnesses some of the harshest winters in the world.By all indications, even if the current border friction is resolved and troops disengage – even if partially – PLA troops are unlikely to fully pull back as they are expected to be prepared for the winter chill.Besides heavy artillery, the PLA is focussing on arming its soldiers with light, precision-based infantry weapons.The news comes as the two sides are set to hold the eighth round of military-diplomatic talks next week on disengagement in the Ladakh theatre.Read: The LAC is the new LoC | HT EditorialEarlier this week, the PLA Tibet Military Command announced that its soldiers, especially from special operation forces, will receive new QBU-191precision rifles with a 30-bullet magazine and variable long-distance magnification.The new gun is expected to replace the QBU-88 sniper rifle currently used by the troops, state media reported.The Tibetan plateau’s extreme cold will help test the rifle’s performance in extreme environments, collecting first-hand data for its future optimisation, state media reported.Earlier, this month the Tibet command also tested, for the first time, the latest “truck-based multiple rocket-propelled mine launchers” at high altitude.The drills were carried out at over 14,000 feet, state media reports said.Not only weapons, the PLA is also getting itself enough layers to keep its soldiers warm in the coming months.On Tuesday, the PLA Daily, the PLA’s official newspaper, reported that the powerful Central Military Commission – headed by President Xi Jinping – has commissioned specially-made quilts, tents, inner-wear and boots for Chinese border troops.These new sets of clothing can withstand temperatures as low as -40-degree centigrade.A Chinese clothing manufacturer which makes winter wear for China’s national mountaineering team members – including those climbing Mount Everest – has developed the new quilts and tents for PLA soldiers.“The clothing supplier urgently developed and produced a batch of new cold-proof quilts for the plateau border troops. This batch of materials is specially tailored for military officers and soldiers…good thermal insulation effect, and light overall material. They will be delivered to frontline officers and soldiers in the near future, providing strong guarantee for completing various training and duty tasks under extreme cold conditions,” the PLA Daily report said.Besides the tents and sleeping bags, the soldiers will soon have new cold-proof down jackets, boots and insulated inner-wear to withstand severe winter.The new barracks for PLA soldiers in the remote Ngari area of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) at nearly 15,000 feet come equipped with new technologies to conserve heat and are built to ensure more oxygen supply for troops.“While facilitating the daily life of officers and soldiers to the greatest extent, the new generation of plateau barracks also enhances the function of training and preparation for war,” the report added.Recently, the PLA’s Army Engineering University developed and handed over “ready-to-assemble” thermal shelters for border troops.The shelters comprising dormitories, canteens, washing rooms, toilets, warehouses, microgrids and heating equipment are expected to function in temperatures as low as -55 C and at an altitude over 15000 feet, the PLA Daily reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-preparing-pla-for-long-haul-at-lac-upgrading-weapons-logistics/story-lA8t5kSPnfMHjFkYrIMU4J.html

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has sought a detailed report of the incident from the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-killed-20-injured-in-explosion-in-pakistan/story-VotIdJ6ZzNKPvhL4SUIJfP.html
21-10-2020||World||Thailand anti-government protests explained||Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the world has been witnessing anti- government protests in Thailand for the past few months. Among other things, the protesters have been demanding reforms to the monarchy and the resignation of Thailand’s PM Prayuth Chan- ocha.Who are the protesters?Most of the protesters are young people and the protests have largely been leader- less much like the Hong- Kong protests. Some groups like Free Youth Movement, the United Front of Thammasat and Demonstration, Bad Student movement of highschoolers have been actively participating in the protests. The symbols used by the protesters are the “anti-coup” three-finger salute from The Hunger Games series, and gestures like hands crossed over the chest, and hands pointing above the head. Why are they protesting?The protests began last year after the disqualification of opposition politician Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit as a Member of Parliament after which a ban was put in place on his party Future Forward. The party was largely supported by the youth of Thailand. The pandemic halted the protests but they resumed again in July. Protesters are demanding the dissolution of parliament, PM’s resignation, constitutional changes to curb the power of the monarchy and an end to harassment of critics and dissenters.Why are the protesters angry with the King and the PM? The current ruler, Maha Vajiralongkorn, became king in December 2016. Prime Minister Chan-ocha came to power through a coup in 2014 that is said to be endorsed by the king. Protesters are also angry with the king as he spends most of his time in Europe and in 2017 increased his constitutional powers. A scrapping of the strict lese majeste law that protects the monarchy from any criticism is also being demanded by the protesters. What has been the government’s response to the protests?The government has continuously stymied the protests by using water cannons, banning gatherings of five or more people in Bangkok, banning publication of information about the protests and even blocking access to some websites. The government has also arrested several demonstrators but the protesters have only increased in numbers, thus creating a lot of pressure on the government and also on the monarchy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-anti-government-protests-explained/story-fj1imurm8vFZdn8BWm3HFI.html
21-10-2020||World||US Presidential Elections 2020: Donald Trump tends to his electoral map, Joe Biden prepping for debate||President Donald Trump is hopping from one must-win stop on the electoral map to the next in the leadup to a final presidential debate that may be his last, best chance to alter the trajectory of the 2020 campaign.Democrat Joe Biden has been taking the opposite approach, holing up for debate prep in advance of Thursday’s faceoff in Nashville, Tennessee. Trump, trailing in polls in most battleground states, stopped in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and was bound for North Carolina on Wednesday as he delivers what his campaign sees as his closing message.“This is an election between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression,” the president said in Erie, Pennsylvania. “You will have a depression the likes of which you have never seen.” He added: “If you want depression, doom and despair, vote for Sleepy Joe. And boredom.”But the Republican president’s pitch that he should lead the rebuilding of an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by a series of fights. In the last two days he has attacked the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and a venerable TV newsmagazine while suggesting that the country was tired of talking about a virus that has killed more than 221,000 people in the United States.Before leaving the White House for Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Trump taped part of an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that apparently ended acrimoniously. On Twitter, the president declared his interview with Lesley Stahl to be “FAKE and BIASED,” and he threatened to release a White House edit of it before its Sunday airtime.Also trailing in fundraising for campaign ads, Trump is increasingly relying on his signature campaign rallies to maximize turnout among his GOP base. His trip to Pennsylvania on Tuesday was one of what is expected to be several visits to the state in the next two weeks.“If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” Trump said in Erie.Erie County, which includes the aging industrial city in the state’s northwest corner, went for President Barack Obama by 5 percentage points in 2012 but broke for Trump by 2 in 2016. That swing, fueled by Trump’s success with white, working-class, non-college-educated voters, was replicated in small cities and towns and rural areas and helped him overcome Hillary Clinton’s victories in the state’s big cities.But Trump will probably need to run up the score by more this time around as his prospects have slipped since 2016 in vote-rich suburban Philadelphia, where he underperformed by past Republican measures. This raises the stakes for his campaign’s more aggressive outreach to new rural and small-town voters across the industrial north.His aides worry that his opponent is uniquely situated to prevent that, as Biden not only hails from Scranton but has built his political persona as a representative of the middle and working classes.Trump, who spoke for less than an hour, showed the crowd a video of various Biden comments on fracking in a bid to portray the Democrat as opposed to the process. The issue is critical in a state that is the second leading producer of natural gas in the country. Biden’s actual position is that he would ban new gas and oil permits, including for fracking, on federal lands only. The vast majority of oil and gas does not come from federal lands.Three weeks of wrangling over the debate format and structure appeared to have subsided after the Commission on Presidential Debates came out with procedures meant to reduce the chaotic interruptions that plagued the first Trump-Biden encounter last month.This time, Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off while his rival delivers an opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics, the commission announced. The mute button won’t figure in the open discussion portion of the debate.Trump was to have been joined in Erie by first lady Melania Trump, in what would have been her first public appearance since she and the president were sickened with Covid-19. But her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham, said Tuesday that Mrs. Trump has a lingering cough and would not accompany the president.As Trump was on the road, Biden was meeting at his lakeside home in Wilmington, Delaware, with senior adviser Ron Klain, who is in charge of debate preparation. Also on hand: a group of aides that the campaign has purposely kept small to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.Biden, who taped his own interview with “60 Minutes” on Monday at a theater near his home, had no public events Tuesday or Wednesday and wasn’t scheduled to travel — except to the debate — on Thursday. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, was out campaigning, and he was expected to receive a late boost from Obama, who was to host an event Wednesday in Philadelphia.Biden is now tested about every two days for the coronavirus and has never been found to be positive. He suggested before last week’s planned second debate in Miami that the proceedings shouldn’t happen if Trump was still testing positive for Covid-19 after contracting the virus earlier in the month.The candidates instead held dueling town halls on separate networks after the commission said the debate should occur virtually, citing safety concerns, and Trump rejected the idea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2020-donald-trump-tends-to-his-electoral-map-joe-biden-prepping-for-debate/story-n9tljYPrRdEowRGyRCdgOI.html
21-10-2020||World||FATF needs to take hard look at Pakistan to ensure it comply with terror-related obligation: Report||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) needs to take a hard and objective look at Pakistan’s attempts to leverage “nuisance value” to ensure that the country fully complies with terror financing and money laundering obligations before it can be de-listed, Global Watch Analysis reported.The FATF, the global money-laundering and terror-financing watchdog, is holding its plenary session from October 21 where it will decide the fate of Pakistan. The country is in grey-list since 2018. Early this month, the FATF’s Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering has kept Pakistan on “Enhanced Follow-up List” for its slow progress on the technical recommendations of the FATF to fight terror financing. Pakistan’s progress has remained unchanged -- non-compliant on four counts.According to a report by Roland Jacquard, Chairman of Roland Jacquard Global Security Consulting (RJGSC), published in Global Watch Analysis, the APG’s latest report of September 2020, based on the evaluation conducted after a year, Pakistan’s report card remained more or less unchanged with the country being able to move one of its partially compliant parameters to fully compliant.“The APG has a stringent set of monitoring processes while evaluating a country’s compliance with AML/CFT measures. It has a scale of 40 parameters based on which it prepares its evaluation report on any country. These parameters range from the presence of effective laws and supervision to prevent terror financing or money laundering to identifying non-profit organisations that act as fronts for terror groups,” he said. “In Pakistan’s case, the APG, in its Mutual Evaluation Report in October 2019 had found the country compliant on 1, non-compliant on 4, partially compliant on 26 and largely compliant on 9 of these 40 parameters. In the APG’s latest report of September 2020, based on the evaluation conducted after a year, Pakistan’s report card remained more or less unchanged with the country being able to move 1 of its partially compliant parameters to fully compliant,” he added.Jacquard said that the APG is a non-political body and its opinion is not binding on the final decision of the FATF, adding that the FATF’s Joint Group Progress Report of October 2020 has taken a more “lenient stance” on Pakistan.Pakistan is in the FATF’s grey list since June 2018 and the government was given a final warning in February to complete the remaining action points by June 2020. Another review meeting will be held later this month.The FATF extended the June deadline to September due to the spread of coronavirus that disrupted the FATF plenary meetings.The country is facing the difficult task of clearing its name from the FATF grey list. As things stand, Islamabad is finding it difficult to shield terror perpetrators and implement the FATF action plan at the same time.In recent weeks, Pakistan has been trying to paint a picture that it has started the reforms, including the passing of some Bills in order to prevent blacklisting by the FATF.In late July, Pakistan Financial Monitoring Unit Director-general Lubna Farooq told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the country is yet to comply with 13 conditions out of the 27-point Action Plan of the FATF, including curbing terror financing, enforcement of the laws against the proscribed organisations and improving the legal systems. Jacquard said the reason for the FATF leniency is Trump administration’s hurry to leave Afghanistan and therefore its dependence on Pakistan to convince the Taliban for an honourable exit.“However, since the APG is a non-political body, its opinion is not binding on the final decision of the FATF. As a result, despite APG’s recent evaluation, the FATF’s Joint Group Progress Report of October 2020 has taken a more lenient stance on Pakistan,” he writes.“As per this group’s assessment, Pakistan has fully complied with 21 of the 27 action points and more or less complied with the remaining 6, thereby indicating that it was more or less on the path of being de-listed. The reasons for this tempered position on Pakistan can only be speculated. The most obvious reason is the Trump administration’s hurry to leave Afghanistan and therefore its dependence on Pakistan to convince the Taliban for an honourable exit,” he adds.Jacquard said that the important institutions like the FATF should not be allowed to be pressured into taking a decision based on political considerations.“Whatever may be the case, important institutions like the FATF should not be allowed to be pressured into taking a decision based on political considerations, especially when the ground situation in Pakistan tells an alarming story,” he noted.A closer look at the Pakistan-based social media accounts conveys a different tale of UN proscribed Pakistani terrorist groups like the Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and their leaders being allowed freedom of movement and activity in the country, Jacquard highlighted.While these groups openly collect fund in the name of jihad, the Pakistan government tries to convince the FATF that its recently passed Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism laws were evidence of its commitment to act against terror groups, he said. “The FATF, therefore, needs to take a hard and objective look at Pakistan’s attempts to leverage its nuisance value, in the larger interest of preserving its credibility as a global financial watchdog and ensure that Islamabad fully complies with terror financing and money laundering obligations before it can be de-listed. In this connection, one is reminded of the case of Iceland that was ‘greylisted’ for lesser infractions and took more than a year to get delisted,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-needs-to-take-hard-look-at-pakistan-to-ensure-it-comply-with-terror-related-obligation-report/story-ZSReY76NMn92xHAmmMufjP.html

It suggests that ‘long Covid’ affects around 10% of 18 to 49-year-olds who become unwell with the virus.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “The findings from researchers at King’s College London are stark and this should be a sharp reminder to the public – including to young people – that Covid-19 is indiscriminate and can have long-term and potentially devastating effects”.“The more people take risks by meeting up in large groups or not social distancing, the more the wider population will suffer, and the more cases of ‘long Covid’ we will see. The powerful new film we’re releasing today…should act as a stark reminder to us all,” he added.New figures as part of the ‘Hands, Face, Space’ campaign reveal uncertainty around how long it takes to recover from the virus.Over a third of people (34%) believe symptoms disappear after four weeks, while 1 in 5 (20%) of the 18 to 34 age group stated they thought this would take two weeks. Over a third (31%) of the same respondents admitted they are unsure how long it would take to recover from the symptoms.Nearly a third (29%) of people aged between 18 to 34 said they were not aware it is possible to have the virus without displaying symptoms, meaning many people could also be at risk of acting as a ‘carrier’ and passing it on to vulnerable family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-covid-can-affect-the-fit-and-young-warns-uk/story-9Aux1upBmhyDgbWAcSaRnN.html

He shook hands and leaned in to chat privately with each one.While the clerics wore masks while seated during the audience, all but one took his mask off to speak to the pope. Only one kept it on, and by the end of his tete-a-tete with Francis, had lowered it under his chin.Vatican regulations now require facemasks to be worn indoors and out where distancing can’t be “always guaranteed.” The Vatican hasn’t responded to questions about why the pope wasn’t following either Vatican regulations or basic public health measures to prevent Covid-19.Francis explained to the audience why he didn’t plunge into the crowd at the start of the audience as he usually would do. But he said his distance from them was for their own well-being, to prevent crowds from forming around him.“I’m sorry for this, but it’s for your own safety,” he said. “Rather than get close to you, shake your hands and greet you, I greet you from far away. But know that I’m close to you with my heart.”He didn’t address his decision to forego wearing a mask.Francis did, however, wear a white face mask throughout an interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome on Tuesday, removing it only to speak. He had previously only been seen wearing one once before as he entered and exited his car in a Vatican courtyard on Sept. 9. Italian law requires masks indoors and out.At 83 and with part of a lung removed when he was in his 20s due to illness, the pope would be at high risk for Covid-19 complications. He has urged the faithful to comply with government mandates to protect public health.In the past week, 11 Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have tested positive.In Italy, coronavirus cases are surging, with the Lazio region around Vatican City among the hardest hit. Lazio has more people hospitalized and in intensive care than any other region except Italy’s most populous and hardest-hit region, Lombardy.Inside the Vatican auditorium Wednesday, the crowd wore masks as did the Swiss Guards. But Francis and his two aides didn’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-reverts-back-to-mask-less-old-ways-at-indoor-audience/story-jxLYZIBpTeBRSLongtIkhL.html
21-10-2020||World||Spain’s parliament debates no-confidence vote to oust govt||Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is facing a no-confidence debate in parliament brought by the nation’s far-right Vox party, but it appears the maneuver lacks the necessary votes to topple the government.The parliament is hearing arguments for and against the motion on Wednesday before a vote scheduled for Thursday. Vox argues that Sánchez’s government must depart for what the party says is the poor handling of the pandemic by authorities.If the no-confidence vote were to succeed, it would replace the current left-wing coalition government with one led by Vox leader Santiago Abascal.The leading opposition party, the conservative Popular Party, however, has already said it won’t back Vox. Without the Popular Party’s votes, the motion has no chance.“With victims, outbreaks and infections, the truth is that this no-confidence motion is a waste of time,” Popular Party secretary-general Teodoro García Egea said before the start of the debate.Many observers of Spanish politics consider the no-confidence vote as a way for the upstart Vox to put more pressure on the Popular Party. The Popular Party has been very critical of Sánchez, but Vox’s rise in recent years has come at the expense of the Spain’s traditional right-wing force. Now it must choose between one adversary or the other.Spain is set to become the first country in Western Europe to reach 1 million reported infections of the virus. The country has confirmed more than 34,000 deaths from COVID-19, but experts say the true death toll has likely been impossible to record because of a shortage of tests in the first weeks of the health crisis.“Sánchez’s government is the worst in the world that has faced the coronavirus,” Abascal told the parliament’s lower house. He said that the current government is the “worst in 80 years of (Spanish) history” signaling his preference for the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco that ruled from the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939 to after his death in 1975.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-s-parliament-debates-no-confidence-vote-to-oust-govt/story-tAvOFt3CM30U39zn5DhE8O.html
21-10-2020||World||Trump says he could be ‘king’ of all fundraisers, slams Biden for being ‘servant’ of lobbyists||Joe Biden is a “servant” of lobbyists and “Washington vultures” who got rich by bleeding America dry, US President Donald Trump has claimed while responding to his Democratic rival’s unprecedented fundraising in September, asserting that he could be the “king” of all fundraisers, but does not want to do it.Biden raised a whopping USD 383 million for his election effort in September, a record-breaking sum that eclipses the unprecedented fundraising from the previous month. “He (Biden) is a servant of the globalist, lobbyist, wealthy donors, and Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know I said the other day… I never thought of it because they’re raising a lot of money, (USD) 300 million. I could be the king of all fundraisers. I would be the greatest that ever lived the president of the United States,” Trump alleged at an election rally here on Tuesday.Biden holds a massive cash advantage over Trump in the last leg of the campaign, The Hill newspaper reported, citing latest figures from the Federal Election Commission.Biden has over USD 177 million in the bank, compared with USD 63.1 million for the president.In September, Biden raised USD 383 million, while Trump raised USD 247.8 million. The month before, Biden raised a then-record of USD 364.5 million, compared with USD 210 million for the president, the report said. “All I have to do - give me a list of the top 100 companies. I’ll call the president of everyone. They will pay me whatever I want. I would set every record. The problem is I owe them. Because when they call and have a problem for a lot more money than we’re talking about you know, it’s like hard to say no. Hey, they were nice. They treated you good,” he said.“I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do that. We don’t need the money. I don’t’ want to do that. I don’t want to do it. But when you see them raise USD 300, 350 million in a month and a half, you know deals are being made- just so you understand. Deals are being made. Big deals. Look at the deals that he is making for himself. Deals are being made,” Trump said. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this depraved political establishment and elect an outsider as president who is finally putting America first, he said. “The fact is whether you like it or not, whether you want to hear it or not, Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He is a corrupt politician. And smoking gun emails show that the Biden family sold the Vice Presidency for a very, very substantial amount of money. More money than anybody would believe. He let China plunder our jobs while his family raked in millions of dollars from China and foreign nations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-could-be-king-of-all-fundraisers-slams-biden-for-being-servant-of-lobbyists/story-Q6FtuLmF1jCEaHRgJfITWI.html
21-10-2020||World||Five takeaways from US government’s lawsuit against Google||The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google alleging antitrust violations marks the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. The lawsuit claims Google has abused its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and harm consumers.Here are five things to know about the lawsuit and what might be coming down the line.GOVERNMENT BRANDS GOOGLE A MONOPOLY After years of hemming and hawing over the matter, the U.S. government has now formally described Google as an illegal monopolist.Just being a monopolist isn’t illegal. And that’s been good for Google, since it dominates roughly 90 per cent of the market for internet searches. But abuse of monopoly can easily land a company in trouble.The Justice Department went there, calling Google a “monopoly gatekeeper for the internet” that has used “anticompetitive tactics” to maintain and extend monopolies in both search and search ads. The lawsuit alleges that Google stifled competition and innovation from smaller upstarts and harmed consumers by reducing the quality and variety of search options — and that the company also uses its monopoly money to lock in its favorable position on smartphones and in browsers.GOOGLE: FREE! FREE IS GOOD! YOU LIKE FREE! Unsurprisingly, Google sees this differently. The company argues that its services are useful and beneficial to consumers, that they face ample competition and that they’ve unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives.What’s more, those services are free for consumers to use, at least in monetary terms. What Google doesn’t often remind its users is that it’s handsomely reimbursed by all the search ads it runs on behalf of outside advertisers, which it targets using the personal information its users hand over, often unknowingly, while taking advantage of its “free” services.Google also emphasises that its services hold down the cost of smartphones and that its lucrative exclusive deals to make Google Search the default on many phones — what the government calls its “exclusionary agreements” — don’t stop users from changing to rival search engines if they want to.Also Read | How Google evolved from ‘cuddly’ startup to antitrust targetDO POLITICS LURK BEHIND THE CASE? From the timing of the case to its co-plaintiffs, the Justice Department’s lawsuit raises unanswered questions about the politics behind the move. For starters, there’s the fact that it filed the suit exactly two weeks before Election Day, a time when most administrations generally try to avoid making splashy moves for fear of being seen as attempting to influence elections.It also did so in conjunction with just 11 states, all of whom have Republican attorneys general, despite the fact that all 50 states kicked off an investigation of Google roughly a year ago.The attorneys general of New York, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah released a statement Monday saying they have not concluded their investigation into Google and would want to consolidate their case with the Justice Department’s if they decide to file.GOOGLE AS THE NEW MICROSOFT The case against Google bears a strong resemblance to one the government brought 22 years ago against the Goliath of the time: Microsoft. But Google’s days as the fledgling startup looking to “do no evil” are long behind it.Back then, Google cast itself as the underdog fighting against a technological bully. The Justice Department’s Google case today revolves around the company bundling products around its dominant position in search — much like the 1998 case against Microsoft revolved around its bundling of other products around Windows.Tuesday’s lawsuit notes that back then, Google claimed Microsoft’s practices were anticompetitive, “and yet now, Google deploys the same playbook to sustain its own monopolies.” Also Read | US says Google breakup may be needed to end violations of antitrust lawGoogle sniped back in its own response to the lawsuit. “This isn’t the dial-up 1990s, when changing services was slow and difficult, and often required you to buy and install software with a CD-ROM,” the company said in a blog post. “Today, you can easily download your choice of apps or change your default settings in a matter of seconds.” ADVERTISERS AS ... THE VICTIMS? Google will hold more than 29 per cent of the U.S. digital advertising market by the end of this year, with Facebook following second with 24 per cent and Amazon third, according to research firm eMarketer. But that’s all digital ads — in search ads only, Google is by far the heavy, holding nearly three-quarters of the market.This, the DOJ argues, unfairly shuts out any would-be competitors, and can leave advertisers themselves with subpar service and few alternatives.The lawsuit charges that Google’s “exclusionary” conduct stifles competition in search advertising, thus harming advertisers. By suppressing competition, Google has more power to manipulate the “quantity of ad inventory auction dynamics” — that is, how much advertisers pay for their ads — in ways that allow the company to charge advertisers more than it could in a competitive market, the lawsuit says.Plus, Google can also offer businesses lower-quality ad services if it wants to, the lawsuit argues — for instance, by restricting the information it provides them on their own marketing campaigns. Without viable competition, who’s to stop it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-takeaways-from-us-government-s-lawsuit-against-google/story-NaIQBFS8F2vPjXJJRfqu8N.html

In the May 2014 email, Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi asked Hunter Biden to “use [his] influence” to support the Ukrainian company politically. In another email, dated April 2015, he thanked Biden Jr. for arranging a meeting with his father for him.The emails were allegedly sourced from the hard drive of Hunter Biden’s damaged personal laptop that was dropped off for repairs at a local store in his home state of Delaware. If proven to be authentic, they would challenge Joe Biden’s campaign claims that he had never had anything to do with his son’s business dealings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-has-hunter-biden-laptop-does-not-believe-emails-tied-to-russia-reports/story-BU7XX0viZr2j96PPBFzhJP.html

The country received a first batch of the Russian “Sputnik-V” coronavirus vaccine in early October as part of the Phase Three clinical trial, and the government said about 2,000 volunteers would participate. The delivery was the first in Latin America. Maduro in September proposed administering the Russian coronavirus vaccine to nearly 15,000 candidates in upcoming legislative elections so that they could campaign safely.Venezuela has strengthened diplomatic ties with Russia amid an aggressive sanctions program by the United States meant to force Maduro from office.In August, Russia licensed a vaccine for Covid-19 after less than two months of human testing, an achievement celebrated by Moscow but questioned by several experts.But Russia is so confident in its Covid-19 vaccine that it will shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong, rather than requiring buyers to take on the full risk, the head of the state fund bankrolling the project told Reuters. In Venezuela there are more than 87,000 coronavirus cases and about 747 deaths, according to official data. But medical associations say the number of infections is likely higher.

21-10-2020||World||Less carbon, more electric vehicles: Automakers prepare for potential Joe Biden win||Automakers are gearing up for tough new vehicle emissions rules and policies favoring electric vehicles if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the White House. Biden and US President Donald Trump both need the votes of auto workers in Midwestern swing states such as Michigan and Ohio, and both say they want automakers to create more auto jobs in the United States, rather than Mexico or China.From there, Trump’s and Biden’s policies for autos and transportation diverge, presenting automakers with very different sets of risks and rewards. If elected, Biden is expected to quickly reinstate the legal basis for California’s zero-emission vehicle rules and begin the process of reversing the Trump administration’s decision to ease fuel efficiency and carbon emission requirements through 2025. Automakers could also face sharply higher penalties for failing to meet fuel-efficiency requirements. The Trump administration rolled back those penalties, which the industry said saved at least $1 billion in annual compliance costs, but a federal appeals court in August reversed the administration action. However, Biden’s positions offer the auto industry some offsetting gains. Under Trump, the White House rejected new tax credits for electric vehicles while making it easier to sell gas-guzzling SUVs. Biden promises new tax incentives including rebates to buy EVs and a dramatic expansion of charging stations for electric vehicles - policy measures automakers have long advocated. Days after Trump won the 2016 election, the trade group representing major automakers in Washington called on him to reconsider fuel-efficiency standards proposed by the outgoing Obama administration, and backed by California and other coastal states. Now, the industry is divided. Ford Motor Co

The organisers of the rally, the joint opposition front Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), had alleged that the arrest came after Pakistan paramilitary abducted Punjab local police chief and made him register cases against Awan and 200 others including Maryam Nawaz for sloganeering at the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.The probe order came after more than 20 senior-most officers of the provincial police force, including the police chief, decided to go on leave to protest against the abduction and the demoralising effect the action had on the police force.After the inquiry was ordered, police chief Mushtaq Mahar said he would be taking back his leave application and urged his colleagues to do the same and instead wait for the outcome of the inquiry.Awan’s arrest came hours after Maryam addressed the PDM’s protest rally, targeting the administration of Prime Minister Imran Khan.“Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar,” Maryam had tweeted. Safdar was charged with “violating the sanctity of the mausoleum” of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi. The police action reportedly came after Khurram Sherzaman, a member of Imran Khan’s ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Party, lodged complaints against Maryam and Safdar at a local police station in Karachi.PTI leaders were reportedly angered by “slogans raised at the mausoleum” targeting Khan’s administration. Video clips circulating on social media apparently showed Safdar and several others chanting slogans from the inner circle of the mausoleum. Political activities are banned inside the mausoleum and its immediate surroundings.Earlier on Sunday, Maryam, her husband and PML-N supporters had visited the mausoleum to offer prayers ahead of the PDM’s rally that was held in Karachi’s Jinnah ground, located near the mausoleum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-chief-orders-probe-into-kidnap-of-police-chief-to-force-arrest-of-nawaz-sharif-s-son-in-law/story-9g7Sfb2bFPqp3o0AJjzakN.html
21-10-2020||World||Donald Trump and the strongmen: How US leader fell for autocrats||He “fell in love” with Kim Jong Un, praises Vladimir Putin and calls Recep Tayyip Erdogan “a friend”: President Donald Trump’s flattery of autocrats has confounded US allies and raised questions about his regard for democratic norms.But analysts expect America’s traditional friendships to be restored in a post-Trump era, saying his fascination with unfettered power is a personality quirk that has not translated into an official change in foreign policy.“He’s psychologically terrified by weakness,” Peter Trumbore, professor of political science at Oakland University in Michigan said.Trump’s attraction to power was on display long before he won the White House on a promise to “make America great again.”In a 1990 interview with Playboy magazine, the billionaire property developer declared that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped end the Cold War, had “not a firm enough hand” with pro-democracy demonstrators.Three decades later, he continues to lavish praise on leaders who wield power ruthlessly while bashing longtime democratic allies such as Canada and Germany.In a recording, the US president admitted he was fond of authoritarian leaders, telling journalist Bob Woodward the “tougher and meaner” they are, “the better I get along with them.”‘President for life’ In 2017, he threatened dictator Kim Jong Un with “fire and fury” if “Little Rocket Man” endangered the US, only to shake his hand in a historic visit to North Korea two years later.While Trump’s outreach to Kim won plaudits, his assessment that the mercurial North Korean, who is accused of gross human rights violations, had a “great and beautiful vision for his country” was met with widespread derision. With China too, his message has swung wildly, lurching between tough talking on trade and the spread of Covid-19, to praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping after China’s ruling party abolished term limits in 2018.“He’s now president for life... I think it’s great,” Trump declared.While some surmised the remark was made in jest it chimed with the warm words he has had for Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has also steadily increased his own powers and whom Trump calls a “friend.”But it is the Republican’s relationship with Russia’s Putin that has attracted the most attention, in light of claims that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s chances, allegations which Russia denies.At a summit with Putin in 2018, Trump appeared bowled over by the former secret services chief, saying he believed him over the FBI on the allegations of campaign interference, and describing his counterpart as “very, very strong.”‘Real man’ rule For Trumbore, it’s plain to see: Trump is “envious of the power these strongmen wield”.“When he sees Erdogan or (Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor) Orban he sees democratically elected presidents who have essentially used institutions of democracy to turn their states into soft authoritarian regimes. I think Trump wants that for himself.”Charles Kupchan, professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, also ascribed Trump’s rapport with autocrats to envy, tinged with “a certain macho inclination.” “He probably likes that Putin rides a horse without a shirt on and appears like a ‘real man’,” Kupchan said.The Trump administration argues he has made America safer by cultivating ties with longtime foes.But analysts say his approach has yet to show results.For Maud Quessard, a US specialist at the Institute for Strategic Research in Paris, Trump’s message is chiefly aimed at “showing his electorate that he is a strong president.” The leader who campaigned as a deal maker extraordinaire lacks the patience needed for diplomatic success in Kupchan’s view.“Diplomatic breakthroughs do not come when two leaders sit down together with no preparation. They come through years of hard work and preparation.”“With North Korea, none of that happened. It went nowhere”.Meanwhile, relations with old allies in continental Europe took a beating, with Trump cheering Britain’s decision to quit the EU and claiming the union was created merely “to take advantage of the United States”.For Brooks Spector, a former US diplomat based in South Africa, the main risk of a second Trump term “would be a greater confusion” on the international stage.“What are the goals of the US policy? What are the expectations? What does the US realistically expect from Iran, Russia, with its trade disputes with China? “There’s a lot of head scratching in world capitals about what exactly the US wants to see happen. People look for the strategy or tactics and they don’t seem to find it very easily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-and-the-strongmen-how-us-leader-fell-for-autocrats/story-h8HdkLqboEofRjOBWXBdrN.html
21-10-2020||World||Kamala Harris turns 56, Joe Biden says will celebrate her next birthday at White House||Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned 56 on Tuesday, with the party’s presidential nominee Joe Biden greeting her on the big day, saying they would celebrate her next birthday at the White House. Biden took to Twitter to post a photograph showing their hands clasped together. “Happy Birthday, Kamala Harris. Next year, let’s celebrate with some ice cream at the White House,” tweeted Biden, who had in August picked her as his running mate. If elected, she would be the first-ever woman vice president of the United States. Biden will celebrate his 78th birthday next month. Harris in a tweet said her birthday wish is that everybody should go out and vote. “My birthday wish this year? For everyone to go vote,” she said. October 20 also happens to be the birthday of her niece, Meena Harris. “I couldn’t let the day go by without wishing my niece, Meena, a happy birthday too!” she said. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Kamala Harris on her birthday. “In two weeks, we could call this birthday girl Madam Vice President,” said Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate as she asked people to go out and vote. “Happy bday to @KamalaHarris. ! Celebrate this big day by voting for the #BidenHarris ticket and Democrats up and down the ballot,” said Sabrina Singh, the Democratic vice presidential nominee’s spokesperson. “Happy birthday, @KamalaHarris! Hope you’re showered with love on your special day,” tweeted former First Lady Michelle Obama. “The best way to celebrate Kamala is by making sure you’re registered and have a plan to vote at http://iwillvote.com. And once you do, share how you’re voting with us!” she said. Later in the evening, Harris held a virtual fundraiser with Senators Tom Udall, Congressmen Ruben Gallego, Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords. “Joe and I are so proud of the fact that we have built one of the broadest coalitions that we have ever seen, bringing together of course Democrats and independents and Republicans, bringing together leaders across the spectrum including, I have to say the great Cindy McCain, and so many others who are standing up saying. ‘look, we got to fight for our country,” Harris said in her remarks during the virtual fund raiser. Harris also participated in a virtual Milwaukee rally to kick off the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin. Former Second Lady Jill Biden tweeted a “happy birthday” graphic overlapping a photo of hers with Harris. Husband Doug Emhoff sent her birthday wish on Instagram. “Blind date, love at first sight, marriage, family, and an incredible life together. Through it all, no matter what, she is ALWAYS there for me and our family without hesitation. Happy Birthday to my amazing wife @kamalaharris!” “And her birthday wish...VOTE EARLY!” Emhoff also reminded people of her wife’s wish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-turns-56-joe-biden-says-will-celebrate-her-next-birthday-at-white-house/story-tU6Mr8I8FkNxaeJef3Z3qN.html
21-10-2020||World||India, US will hold third 2+2 ministerial meeting in New Delhi next week||India and the US will hold their third 2+2 ministerial meeting in New Delhi next week, US secretary of defence Mark Esper said on Tuesday.He did not rule out the possibility that the two sides may sign a widely anticipated maritime information sharing agreement.Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo will travel to New Delhi for day-long in-person meetings, a rare but significant departure given the Covid-19 pandemic and the global shift to virtual interactions, with their Indian counterparts Rajnath Singh and S Jaishankar on October 27.Separately, a bipartisan group of 14 US senators jointly expressed “strong support” for India’s decision to formally invite Australia to the upcoming Malabar naval exercises with the US and Japan saying it’s an “invaluable” move from an operational perspective and of “symbolic” importance.“Secretary Pompeo and I will be there next week,” Esper said at Atlantic Council, a think tank, responding to a question about the upcoming 2+2. “It’s our second two plus two with the Indians, the third ever for the United States and India and it’s very important.”When pressed on the maritime information sharing agreement that has been widely reportedly to be on the agenda, Esper said, “We have a number of things we’ve been discussing with the Indians for, for some time w’ve made good progress on a number of them but we’ll release information on that when it’s appropriate.”This will be the third edition of the India-US 2+2 that started with India hosting the first in 2018 in New Delhi; the United States hosted the second in Washington DC in 201.9.An official announcement with details of the meetings and agenda was expected shortly. The two countries are also reported to sign BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) on sharing of geospatial information, considered the fourth and last of the foundational agreements.Speaking broadly of ties with India, Esper said India will be “the most consequential partner for us, I think, in the Indo-Pacific for sure, in the century,” noting “they face off every day, the Chinese aggression in the Himalayas, specifically along that line of actual control”.Of significant developments in the defence sector in the last one year, Esper listed out the first-ever tri-service military exercise – TIGER TRIUMPH – with India, USS Nimitz’s drills with the Indian Navy and the first ever US-India defence cyber dialogue in September.“As we expand our collaboration into new domains. Together, these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century,” he said.His strong endorsement of ties with India came as14 US senators jointly commended India’s invitation to Australia, in a jointly signed letter to Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US.“We write in strong support of India’s decision to formally invite Australia to participate in the annual Exercise Malabar,” the senators wrote. “From an operational perspective, the addition of such a uniquely capable and stalwart partner, like Australia, to this naval exercise is invaluable, providing increased interoperability, strengthening threat assessment abilities and enhancing the maritime roles and missions of the four naval powers. Equally important, they said, was the “symbolic nature” of the development marking the first time the four countries will engage collectively at the military level since the formation of the Quad and the Quad-plus-Singapore naval exercises held in September 2007.The signatories were John Corny and Mark Warner, the Republican and Democratic co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus and Republicans Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, David Perdue, James Lankford, Josh Hawley, Dan Sullivan, Marsha Blackburn, Kelly Loeffler, Martha McSally, Thom Tillis and Kevin Cramer and the second Democrat Chris Coon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-will-hold-third-2-2-ministerial-meeting-in-new-delhi-next-week/story-JEeq0GnVdpSiSHajVipHIP.html

21-10-2020||World||India returns Chinese soldier who crossed Line of Actual Control: Chinese military||India on Wednesday handed over the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldier detained after he had crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh on Sunday, the Chinese military said. He was handed over to Chinese border troops early on Wednesday, PLA said in a brief statement.“According to the relevant agreement between China and India, a Chinese soldier who was requested by the herders to help find a lost yak was handed over to the Chinese border troops by the Indian side in the early morning of October 21,” said the statement released by the PLA Daily on social media.The PLA had confirmed late on Monday one of its soldiers had gone “missing” along the LAC on Sunday night and had requested the Indian army to return him according to protocol.The Indian army on Monday said it had apprehended a Chinese soldier, identified as a corporal, in eastern Ladakh’s Demchok sector after he had strayed across the LAC.It had also received a request from the PLA enquiring about the whereabouts of the soldier.The incident comes amid the ongoing border tension with China in eastern Ladakh, where both sides have carried out heavy deployment of soldiers and military equipment.Issuing a statement on the missing PLA soldier on Monday night, spokesperson of the Western Theatre Command, Col Zhang Shuili said the soldier went missing while looking for lost yaks on the evening of October 18 – he did not identify the soldier.“After the incident, Chinese border guards took the initiative to report the situation to the Indian side as soon as possible and hoped that the Indian side would assist in search and rescue,” Zhang said in the statement.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing on Tuesday that China hopes India hands over the soldier as soon as possible and works with China to promote the implementation of the consensus reached at the 7th round of talks.“India’s move (of returning the soldier) is a goodwill gesture ahead of the eighth round talks,” Sun Shihai, an expert at the South Asia Research Center of Sichuan University, told the Global Times.In September, Chinese state media had branded as spies five Indians who had strayed across the border in Arunachal Pradesh and were detained by the PLA. The five civilian porters from the Tagin tribe of Arunachal Pradesh went missing early September.Ahead of their release in the second week of September, state-run nationalistic tabloid, Global Times claimed in a report that five were “spies” working for the Indian army.The five had disguised themselves as “hunters”, the report said, quoting an anonymous source, adding that they were “India’s intelligence staff”.“They recently trespassed the China-India border and entered the Shannan prefecture of Tibet,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-returns-chinese-soldier-who-crossed-line-of-actual-control-chinese-military/story-10x9eZgN3gWXZj4nwa9ERN.html
21-10-2020||World||Canada PM Trudeau puts fate of government on line with call for confidence vote||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday put the fate of his Liberal government on the line, saying an opposition push to probe how Ottawa is tackling the coronavirus would be put to a confidence vote on Wednesday.The Liberals, who only won a minority of seats in an October 2019 election, need backing from another party to survive. Trudeau’s fate depends on the left-leaning New Democrats, whose leader Jagmeet Singh said he had no interest in a vote.“I will not give the Prime Minister an excuse to plunge the country into an election. My goal is to help people and I will continue doing that,” said Singh, who nevertheless did not say how his party would vote on Wednesday.The Liberals are under attack from the official opposition Conservatives, who allege some of the more than C$200 billion ($152.5 billion) handed out in coronavirus aid programs has been misspent.The Conservatives want to create a committee to examine what they call the government’s ethical problems. One area of focus is payments to Trudeau’s wife and mother by a charity chosen to manage a student grant program.Trudeau, who insists he does not want an early election, said the mandate of the proposed committee showed the opposition had lost confidence in him. There is some speculation in Ottawa that he wants to go to voters before some of the expensive aid programs are wound down. But a Canadian Broadcasting Corp aggregate tracker of recent opinion polls put the Liberals at 36.5% public support, with the Conservatives at 30.8%, which strongly suggests another minority for Trudeau.“The opposition is going to have to decide whether they want to make this minority parliament work or whether they have lost confidence in the government,” said Trudeau, who is proposing a committee with a broader mandate to probe the response to a pandemic that has killed 9,778 people in Canada.Singh told reporters he had his own suggestions on how the committee should work and said the two sides were close.But he also blasted Trudeau’s stance as ludicrous and farcical, and accused the Prime Minister of seeking an election while blaming the opposition. The vote is set for around 3:15 p.m. Eastern (1915 GMT).Conservative leader Erin O’Toole - who must decide whether he wants to continue his efforts - earlier told reporters that what he called a misuse of funds should be probed.The Canadian dollar was little changed on the news. It had earlier edged higher against the greenback as investors weighed the prospects for U.S. economic stimulus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-trudeau-puts-fate-of-government-on-line-with-call-for-confidence-vote/story-jVzNqIyKFkwkH5lxdTqQXO.html
21-10-2020||World||What is ‘human challenge’ that UK cleared to speed up Covid-19 vaccine trial?||After mulling over the idea for a few days, the UK government on October 20 has given a go-ahead to start ‘human challenge’ trial so that an effective vaccine can be produced at the earliest. The concept of human challenge trial is not new, but it remains controversial as participants in such a trial are injected with the virus.Here is all you need to know about human challenge trial and UK’s plan:1. Amid the ongoing pandemic, the race for a fast and effective vaccine has now become intense. Russia has become the first country to have announced its vaccine against Covid-19, which has been tested amid a small number of people before its registration, which is why questions over the efficacy of the vaccines remain. The United Kingdom is also leaving no stones unturned to become a frontrunner in this race.2. UK’s human challenge trial plan has an investment of 33.6 million pound from the National Health Services.3. Under this programme, the participants will first be administered a vaccine candidate that has proven safe so far. Then they will be exposed to the Covid-19 virus in a safe and controlled environment. The participants will be monitored by researchers who will thus explore how the vaccine is working, how much virus can infect a group of healthy people etc — aspects that will bolster the vaccine research.4. Since human challenge trial is risky, it will only involve healthy people belonging to the age group of 18 to 30.5. About 90 participants, who will be compensated by the government, will take part in UK’s human challenge trial.6. Human challenge trial will help researchers find out which vaccine is the most promising one.7. The researchers are also hoping to find answers to whether vaccines can prevent only illness or whether vaccine can stop transmission.8. The participants will be monitored for up to a year to find out if there is any long-term illness.9. UK’s plan is subject to the approval of regulators and the ethics committee. Once approved, the study will start in January and the results are expected by May 2021.10. Human challenge studies were conducted for cholera, typhoid, malaria, influenza, tuberculosis, dengue etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-human-challenge-that-uk-cleared-to-speed-up-covid-19-vaccine-trial/story-JcHkpFUcEgDmwgOl5mjPCN.html
21-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Ahead of third debate, Trump holds rally while Biden opts for preparation||President Donald Trump pushed into arguably the most important state on the electoral map on Tuesday, opting for a rally in Pennsylvania instead of formal debate practice two days ahead of the final presidential debate that may be his last, best chance to alter the trajectory of the 2020 campaign.Democrat Joe Biden took the opposite approach, holing up for debate prep in the leadup to Thursday’s faceoff in Nashville. But Trump, trailing in polls in most battleground states, continued his travel blitz in the race’s final fortnight, and delivered what his campaign has wanted to be his closing message.“This is an election between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression. You will have a depression the likes of which you have never seen,” the president said in Erie. “If you want depression, doom and despair, vote for Sleepy Joe. And boredom.”But the president’s pitch that he should lead the rebuilding of an economy ravaged by the pandemic has been overshadowed by a series of fights. In the last two days he has attacked the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and a venerable TV newsmagazine while suggesting that the nation was tired of talking about a virus that has killed more than 220,000 Americans.Before leaving the White House, Trump taped part of an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that apparently ended acrimoniously. On Twitter, the president declared his interview with Lesley Stahl to be “FAKE and BIASED,” and he threatened to release a White House account of it before its Sunday airtime.Also trailing in fundraising for campaign ads, Trump is increasingly relying on his signature campaign rallies to deliver a closing message to voters and maximize turnout among his GOP base. His trip Tuesday to Pennsylvania was expected to be one of several to the state in the next two weeks, underscoring its electoral importance.“If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” Trump in Erie.Erie County, which includes the aging industrial city in the state’s northwest corner, went for President Barack Obama by five points in 2012 but broke for Trump by two in 2016. That swing, fueled by Trump’s success with white, working class, non-college-educated voters, was replicated in small cities and towns and rural areas and helped him overcome Hillary Clinton’s victories in the state’s big cities.But Trump will likely need to run up the score by more this time around as his prospects have slipped since 2016 in vote-rich suburban Philadelphia, where he underperformed by past Republican measures. This raises the stakes for his campaign’s more aggressive outreach to new rural and small-town voters across the industrial north.His aides worry that his opponent is uniquely situated to prevent that, as Biden not only hails from Scranton, but has built his political persona as a representative of the middle and working class.Three weeks of wrangling over the debate format and structure appeared to have subsided Tuesday after the Commission on Presidential Debates unveiled a rules change meant to reduce the chaotic interruptions that plagued the first Trump-Biden encounter last month.This time, Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off while his rival delivers an opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics, the commission announced. The mute button won’t figure in the open discussion portion of the debate.Trump’s team is calling for a more in-depth focus on foreign policy in the debate, believing it to be a strong suit for the incumbent, but there is not expected to be any shift away from the announced topics, which include a segment devoted to national security.Before Thursday’s debate, the president was grumbling that he’d be at a disadvantage to his challenger.“I just think it’s very unfair,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from Arizona on Monday evening. “I will participate, but it’s very unfair that they changed the topics and it’s very unfair that, again, we have an anchor who’s totally biased.”Trump was to have been joined in Erie by first lady Melania Trump, in what was to be her first public appearance since she and the president were sickened with COVID-19, but her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham, said Tuesday that Mrs. Trump has a lingering cough and would not accompany the president.As Trump was on the road, Biden was huddling at his lakeside home in Wilmington, Delaware, with senior adviser Ron Klain, who is in charge of debate preparation. Also on hand: a group of aides that the campaign has purposely kept small to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.Biden, who taped his own interview with “60 Minutes” on Monday at a theater near his home, has no public events on Tuesday or Wednesday and wasn’t scheduled to travel except to the debate itself on Thursday. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris was out campaigning, and he was expected to receive a late boost from former President Obama, who was to host an event Wednesday in Philadelphia.Biden is now tested about every two days for the coronavirus and has never been found to be positive. He suggested before last week’s planned second debate in Miami that the proceedings shouldn’t happen if Trump was still testing positive for COVID-19 after contracting the virus earlier in the month.The candidates instead held dueling town halls on separate networks after the commission said the debate should occur virtually, citing safety concerns, and Trump rejected the idea.Biden has been tightlipped about his preparation for the Nashville debate, saying only that he has focused on watching Trump’s past statements on key issues. Biden’s advisers see the final debate as a chance to discuss foreign policy, which they, too, see as one of their candidate’s strengths. Biden has praised the Trump administration for helping to broker deals that the Gulf states of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed recognizing Israel, but otherwise has accused the president of shunning allies and making foreign relations more volatile at most points around the globe.The debate comes as Trump again defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 Americans and to attack his Democratic rival for pledging to heed the advice of scientific experts.Trump insisted Tuesday that he gets along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, while also complaining on “Fox & Friends” that the doctor who has clashed with him at times over the coronavirus is not a “team player.”A day earlier, Trump said on a call with campaign aides that “People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” adding of the doctor: “Every time he goes on television, there’s always a bomb. But there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci’s a disaster.”___ Weissert reported from Wilmington, Delaware. Miller reported from Washington.

21-10-2020||World||How Donald Trump plowed through $1 billion, losing cash advantage||President Donald Trump’s sprawling political operation has raised well over $1 billion since he took the White House in 2017 — and set a lot of it on fire.Trump bought a $10 million Super Bowl ad when he didn’t yet have a challenger. He tapped his political organization to cover exorbitant legal fees related to his impeachment. Aides made flashy displays of their newfound wealth — including a fleet of luxury vehicles purchased by Brad Parscale, his former campaign manager.Meanwhile, a web of limited liability companies hid more than $310 million in spending from disclosure, records show.Now, just two weeks out from the election, some campaign aides privately acknowledge they are facing difficult spending decisions at a time when Democratic nominee Joe Biden has flooded the airwaves with advertising. That has put Trump in the position of needing to do more of his signature rallies as a substitute during the coronavirus pandemic while relying on an unproven theory that he can turn out supporters who are infrequent voters at historic levels.“They spent their money on unnecessary overhead, lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous activity by the campaign staff and vanity ads,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican consultant who advised John McCain and Jeb Bush and is an outspoken Trump critic. “You could literally have 10 monkeys with flamethrowers go after the money, and they wouldn’t have burned through it as stupidly.”For Trump, it’s a familiar, if not welcome, position. In 2016, he was vastly outraised by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but still pulled off a come-from-behind win. This time around, though, he was betting on a massive cash advantage to negatively define Biden and to defend his own record.Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien insisted money was no issue. “We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” he told reporters Monday.Biden, Stepien added, was “putting it all on TV,” as he eschewed most door-knocking because of the pandemic, while Trump has roughly 2,000 field staffers across the country knocking on doors and making calls for his campaign.“Where we have states that are sort of tipping, could go either way,” Trump told campaign staffers Monday, “I have an ability to go to those states and rally. Biden has no ability. I go to a rally, we have 25,000 people. He goes to a rally, and he has four people.”The campaign and the Republican National Committee will offer a glimpse of their financial situation Tuesday when they file mandatory monthly campaign finance reports.Advertising spending figures, however, offer a bleak picture.While a half-dozen pro-Trump outside groups are coming to the president’s aid, Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to dump $142 million into ads in the closing days of the campaign, outspending Republicans by more than 2-to-1, according to data from the ad tracking firm CMAG/Kantar.On Monday, the firm Medium Buying reported Trump was canceling ad buys in Wisconsin; Minnesota, which Trump had hoped to flip; and Ohio, which went for Trump in 2016 but now appears to be a tight contest.It’s a reversal from May, when Biden’s campaign was strapped for cash and Parscale ominously compared the Trump campaign to a “Death Star” that was about to “start pressing FIRE for the first time.”The ad campaign they unrolled over the next three months cost over $176 million but did little to dent Biden’s lead in public opinion polling.Trump is now in a position that’s virtually unthinkable for an incumbent president, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks advertising spending.“Advertising obviously isn’t everything. But we do think ads matter for a couple percentage points in a presidential race. And it’s just not a good sign for the Trump campaign,” Ridout said.A review of expenditures by Trump’s campaign, as well as the Republican National Committee, lays bare some of the profligate spending.Since 2017, more than $39 million has been paid to firms controlled by Parscale, who was ousted as campaign manager over the summer. An additional $273.2 million was paid to American Made Media Consultants, a Delaware limited liability company, whose owners are not publicly disclosed.Campaigns typically reveal in mandatory disclosures who their primary vendors are. But by routing money to Parscale’s firms, as well as American Made Media Consultants, Trump satisfied the basic disclosure requirements without detailing the ultimate recipients.Other questionable expenditures by Trump and the RNC that are included in campaign finance disclosures:— Nearly $100,000 spent on copies of Donald Trump Jr.’s book “Triggered,” which helped propel it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.— Over $7.4 million spent at Trump-branded properties since 2017.— At least $35.2 million spent on Trump merchandise.— $38.7 million in legal and “compliance” fees. In addition to tapping the RNC and his campaign to pay legal costs during his impeachment proceedings, Trump has also relied on his political operation to cover legal costs for some aides.— At least $14.1 million spent on the Republican National Convention. The event was supposed to have been held in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Trump relocated it to Jacksonville, Florida, after a dispute with North Carolina’s Democratic governor over coronavirus safety measures. The Florida event was ultimately cancelled, as well, with a mostly online convention taking its place.— $912,000 spent on ads that ran on the personal Facebook pages of Parscale and Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson.— A $250,000 ad run during Game 7 of the 2019 World Series, which came after Trump was booed by spectators when he attended Game 5.— At least $218,000 for Trump surrogates to travel aboard private jets provided by campaign donors.— $1.6 million on TV ads in the Washington, D.C., media market, an overwhelmingly Democratic area where Trump has little chance of winning but where he is a regular TV watcher.There are signs Trump’s grassroots fundraising operation has slowed, too. Once a driving force, the campaign is now spending about 77 cents for every dollar it raises, typically through online ads asking supporters to chip in a few dollars.Between July and September, it cost the campaign $181 million to raise $235 million through such small contributions. That’s a considerable break from earlier in the year, when it raked in hundreds of millions while spending far less.Some of Trump’s wealthy supporters are also exploring their options.Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, recently donated $75 million to Preserve America, a new pro-Trump super political action committee that is not controlled by Trump World political operatives.One of the reasons the group was founded in August is because there is deep distrust among some GOP donors that the existing pro-Trump organizations would spend the money wisely, according to a Republican strategist with direct knowledge of the matter. The strategist spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive discussions with donors.Dan Eberhart, who has given over $190,000 to Trump’s election efforts, said many Republican donors are now focused on keeping control of the Senate in GOP hands — not Trump’s chances of winning.“The Senate majority is the most important objective right now,” he said. “It’s the bulwark against so much bad policy that the Democrats want to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-donald-trump-plowed-through-1-billion-losing-cash-advantage/story-jBPwUXhIVIdRRh1SoNcKDO.html

It shows the officer wearing a blue, white and red Trump 2020 mask containing a phrase with a curse word.“This is city funded voter intimidation,” Simeonidis tweeted, calling for the officer’s suspension.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez held a press conference Tuesday to address the situation. He said the officer was in line to vote, and the mask violated department and polling place policy because it promoted a political candidate. He said the officer would be disciplined and said a suspension was a possibility.“There were people claiming it was voter intimidation,” Suarez said. “Officers have a responsibility … to protect our residents and they have to do that in an impartial manner and they can’t be making political statements or making political stances while they are wearing a uniform.”Suarez said officers are allowed to vote while in uniform.“Had he not been voting it would have been a much more serious situation,” the mayor added.Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina issued a statement Tuesday calling the behavior “unacceptable” and a violation of departmental policy. He said the action was being “addressed immediately.”It was unknown whether the officer was on duty at the time, Suarez said.Tommy Reyes, president of the officer’s union, said in a statement that police officers have free-speech rights under the U.S. Constitution, and state law allows officers to vote in uniform. Reyes also pointed out that the union, Fraternal Order of Police, has endorsed Trump’s re-election bid at the national level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-miami-police-officer-wears-trump-mask-in-uniform-faces-suspension/story-4EgRWwBDMipsFlIEo6zEkI.html

Among them are Special Branch AIG Imran Yaqoob, Forensic Science Division AIG Dr Samiulah Soomro Counter Terrorism Department DIG Omer Shahid Hamid, Headquarters DIG Saqib Ismail Memon, Hyderabad DIG Naeem Ahmed Shaikh, East Zone (Karachi) DIG Capt (r) Asim Khan, South Zone (Karachi) DIG Javed Akbar Riaz, Larkana DIG Nasir Aftab, Special Branch DIG Qamar-uz-Zaman and SSP Intelligence Tauqeer Muhammad Naeem, Sukkur SSP Irfan Ali Samo, Anti-Violent Crime Cell SSP Abdullah Ahmad, Badin SSP Shabir Ahmed Sethar, SSP Korangi Capt (r) Faisal Abdullah Chachar and East Zone (Karachi) SSP Sajid Amir Sudozai.As per the applications submitted to Sindh Inspector General Mushtaq Mahar, the officials said that it had become hard for them to “discharge [their] duties in a professional manner”.“It is respectfully submitted in the recent episode of registration of FIR against Capt (R) Safdar in which police high command has not only been ridiculed and mishandled but all ranks of Sindh Police have been demoralised and shocked. In such a stressful situation, it is quite difficult for me to discharge my duty in a professional manner, wrote Imran Yaqoob Minhas, Additional Inspector General of Police, Special Branch Sindh wrote in his application.He added, “In order to come out of this shock and settle down, I may kindly be granted 60 days of leave with effect from October 26.”According to Dawn, at least three station house officers (SHO) also applied for a leave of absence, citing similar reasons. The applicants include Korangi SHO Inayatullah, Shahra-i-Noorjehan SHO Imdad Ali Khowaja and Tipu Sultan SHO Shahrafat Khan.PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz appreciated the police “I salute the Sindh Police!” she tweeted, alongside a quote of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.This comes a day after the arrest and subsequent release on bail of Safdar in Karachi.

All of the new infections were imported.The country also reported 24 new asymptomatic patients, compared with 33 a day earlier. As of Monday, mainland China had 85,704 confirmed Covid-19 cases, the health authority said. China’s coronavirus death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.In Italy, the northern Lombardy region prepared to impose a night-time curfew, the most restrictive measure the country has seen since emerging from a national lockdown in the spring. The curfew from 11pm to 5am is expected to begin on Thursday night and last till November 13. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn the vaccine front, Moderna’s chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel said he expects interim results from its vaccine trial in November and the US government could give an emergency use nod in December, The Wall Street Journal reported. Bancel said sufficient interim results from the study takes longer to get and the government’s nod to use the vaccine may not come until next year.A World Health Organization (WHO) expert said on Monday that Europe and North America should follow the example of Asian states by persevering with anti-Covid measures. Mike Ryan, the WHO’s top emergency expert, said, “Too many countries have put an imaginary finishing line... The countries in Asia, south Asia, the western Pacific that have been successful have really continued to follow-through on those key activities.”Healthy, young volunteers aged 18 to 30 years in the UK are to be inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine candidate and then exposed to the virus in a controlled environment to expedite the eventual development of a safe and tested vaccine for the entire population.The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday said that only a vaccine candidate that has proved safe in initial trials - such as the one at the University of Oxford - will be given to some 90 volunteers for the so-called “human challenge” trial.Medics will closely monitor the effect on the volunteers 24 hours to see exactly how the vaccine works and to identify any side effects. The “human challenge” method of trial has long been used, including in colonial India to develop the vaccine for smallpox.The trial is due to begin in January 2021, with results expected by May, officials said, adding that such human challenge studies have been performed safely and have played important roles in accelerating the development of treatments for diseases such as malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu. Deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said, “A safe, fully approved, and meticulously controlled human challenge model for Covid-19 that is conducted by experienced experts may help in the search for safe and effective vaccines.”With inputs from Prasun Sonwalkar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-cases-in-china-europe-tightens-curbs/story-IsGEwHuQ0Qxce5YOqVLPMP.html
21-10-2020||World||US mortality data indicates Covid-19 death toll nearly double reported toll: Report||The true death toll from Covid-19 likely exceeds 400,000, nearly twice the official tally, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based on an analysis of “excess deaths” in the first eight months of the novel coronavirus pandemic.The report defined excess deaths as the number of persons who have died from all causes, compared with average mortality, using data from 2015-2019 as the basis for comparison.“Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66 per cent) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25-44 years and among Hispanic or Latino persons,” the report said on Tuesday (local time).The excess novel coronavirus deaths would be in addition to the official toll of 216,025 published by the CDC on October 15, the report said.The total number of excess deaths ranged from a low of 841 for people under age 25 to a high of 94,646 among adults aged 75-84 years. However, the average percentage change in deaths compared with previous years was largest for adults aged 25-44 years (26.5 per cent), the report said.The report noted that measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of past pandemics, as well as natural disasters, particularly when there are questions about potential undercount.Official tallies of Covid-19-related deaths could be limited by factors such as the use of diagnostic testing, including postmortem testing, and inaccurate cause of death information on death certificates, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mortality-data-indicates-covid-19-death-toll-nearly-double-reported-toll-report/story-54liDsJJnh3KHwQOTYuPCP.html
21-10-2020||World||Focus on action against Pakistan as FATF meet begins||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will begin a three-day virtual plenary meeting on Wednesday that will decide on the next course of action against Pakistan with regard to steps taken by the country to crack down on fund-raising by terror groups. Pakistan’s case The multilateral watchdog, which counters money laundering and terror financing, put Pakistan on its list of “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or “grey list” in 2018 for not doing enough to curb financial activities of terror groups. The grey list now has 18 countries, ranging from Iceland to Mauritius and Panama, and most of these nations have been cited for lax money laundering regimes and none face as serious charges related to terror financing as Pakistan. After a plenary meeting in February, FATF warned Pakistan that all deadlines set for implementing an action plan against terror financing had expired, and that the country had largely addressed only 14 of 27 action items in the plan. According to a more recent assessment, Pakistan is understood to have largely addressed about 20 action items. However, FATF’s regional affiliate Asia-Pacific Group (APG) concluded last month Pakistan has fully complied with only two out of 40 recommendations to curb money laundering and terror financing. The abuse of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and registered charities by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba was cited by APG in its latest report as a “significant threat”, and the group retained Pakistan in its “enhanced follow-up” category. Terror financing Combating terror financing has been a priority for FATF since 2001. FATF plays a key role in global efforts to fight terror financing by setting global standards, assisting countries to implement financial provisions of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on terror, and evaluating their ability to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute the financing of terrorism. FATF carries out assessments throughout the year of countries on the grey list, though this work has been curtailed in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of its work in Pakistan has been focused on getting the government to introduce laws to enforce UN sanctions, improve coordination between different government organisations and law enforcement agencies, and prosecution of terrorists involved in fund-raising. Though Pakistan has arrested LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and a handful of other terrorist leaders and successfully prosecuted several of them – Saeed was given a prison term of five-and-a-half years in February – there have been other developments that have been criticised by Western nations. For instance, Pakistani authorities have removed some 3,800 names from a terror watch list this year. Pakistan has also enacted some 10 new laws for freezing and seizing the assets of terror groups and to impose fines and prison terms for terror financing but FATF has said enforcement and prosecution needs to improve further. What’s nextPakistan is widely expected to remain in the grey list, with very little chance of it being included in FATF’s list of “high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action” or “black list” – which currently has only two countries, North Korea and Iran – for a variety of reasons. Some Western countries are reluctant to push for stiffer action against Pakistan at a time when it is perceived as crucial for the trouble peace process in Afghanistan, while the backing of just three of FATF’s 39 members is adequate to keep it out of the black list. Pakistan has China in its corner and its leadership has reached out to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey for support. What remains to be seen is how much leeway FATF will give to Pakistan to deliver on the action plan against terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/focus-on-action-against-pakistan-as-fatf-meet-begins/story-R0SH7gQTb67Vtg0DmWjiUM.html

21-10-2020||World||Slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s family sues Saudi Crown Prince||The family of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of personally ordering Khashoggi’s brutal execution in order to silence the high-profile government critic.The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Khashoggi’s fiancee Hatice Cengiz and Democracy for the Arab World Now or DAWN, the human rights organization that Khashoggi founded shortly before his death. It names Prince Mohammed and a host of Saudi Ministry of Interior officials, accusing them of a “brutal and brazen crime” that was the result of “weeks of planning” and premeditation.Also Read | Turkey prepares second indictment on 6 Khashoggi murder suspects: Report“Jamal believed anything was possible in America and I place my trust in the American civil justice system to obtain a measure of justice and accountability,” Cengiz said in a statement Tuesday.Khashoggi disappeared on Oct. 2, 2018 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, seeking documents that would allow him to marry Cengiz, a Turkish national who was waiting outside the building. He never emerged.Turkish officials allege Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate. His body has not been found. Turkey apparently had the consulate bugged and shared audio of the killing with the C.I.A., among others.Western intelligence agencies, as well as the U.S. Congress, have said the crown prince bears ultimate responsibility for the killing and that an operation of this magnitude could not have happened without his knowledge.A prominent government critic, Khashoggi had founded DAWN in order to push for democratic and human rights reform in Saudi Arabia and throughout the Arab world. Tuesday’s suit alleges that the defendants “saw Mr. Khashoggi’s actions in the United States as an existential threat” to their political interests and sought to lure him inside the consulate where a specially dispatched hit squad awaited.“Defendants resolved to put an end to Mr. Khashoggi’s efforts by any means necessary,” the suit states.Saudi officials initially offering conflicting accounts, including claiming that Khashoggi had left the building unharmed. But amid mounting international pressure, they settled on the explanation that Khashoggi’s death was a tragic accident, saying that the team was under orders to merely persuade him to return to the kingdom. The official account is that the meeting unexpectedly turned violent, resulting in Khashoggi’s accidental death.In September, a Saudi court issued a final verdict sentencing five mid-level officials and operatives to 20-year jail sentences. The court had originally ordered the death penalty, but reduced the punishment after Khashoggi’s son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia and has received financial compensation from the royal court for his father’s killing, announced that he forgave the defendants. Three others were sentenced to lesser jail terms. The Saudi court did not implicate Prince Mohammed or other senior Interior Ministry officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slain-saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-s-family-sues-saudi-crown-prince/story-46laUckfiHcZEa26XbCOTM.html

The first lady’s case was described as having been considerably milder.However, last week she revealed details of the illness in an unusual statement entitled “My Personal Experience with Covid-19” in which she said the aftermath had been difficult.“It seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after.

21-10-2020||World||In new online abuse menace, AI bot turns women’s photos into nudes||Unidentified cyber criminals have rolled out a service that allows anyone to create fake nude images of women from a regular photograph, a cyber research agency tracking deepfakes said in a report released on Tuesday, uncovering a growing ecosystem that has already targeted at least 100,000 women and threatens to open a new front in online sexual abuse. A deepfake is any manipulated media created by an artificial intelligence technique called deep learning. The technology first gained attention in 2017 and evolved rapidly, with experts warning that it can affect democracy and law since, among other things, deepfakes can be used to create convincing fakes about rival politicians and generate false evidence to implicate someone in crime. It has also been used to create deepfake pornography of celebrities, but Netherlands-based Sensity’s report now uncovers its first widespread use in targeting virtually any individual whose images are available. The tool works only on images of women. “Our investigation of this bot and its affiliated channels revealed several key findings. Approximately 104,852 women have been targeted and had their personal “stripped” images shared publicly as of the end of July, 2020. The number of these images grew by 198% in the last 3 months,” said the report.At present, most of the roughly 104,000 users and most of the victims appear to be from Russia, the report added, citing a poll in one of seven Telegram groups linked to the service – the name of which has been withheld in order to avoid publicity. At the core is a bot that lets a person upload a photograph of a woman. The bot feeds back a version with any clothing deleted and replaced by fake but at times authentic, but often evidently fake skin and private parts. The tool is available for free, but the photos will be watermarked. Users can pay $1.5 (about ₹110) to remove it, the report said.“The activity on the bot’s affiliated Telegram channels makes for bleak viewing. On the image sharing galleries, thousands of synthetically stripped images of young women taken from social media and private correspondence are constantly being uploaded,” said Henry Ajder, an expert on deepfakes and the lead author of the report who has since left Sensity. “The bot’s significance, as opposed to other tools for creating deepfakes, is its accessibility, which has enabled tens of thousands of users to non-consensually strip these images,” Ajder said, adding that the most concerning aspect of the investigation was the discovery of images of underage girls. “Up until now, we’ve seen a relatively low amount of activity with deepfakes and paedophilic content, but this investigation provides a stark warning that this trend is definitely over,” he added. According to Sensity’s investigation, the tool appears to be a version of DeepNudes, a software first released anonymously in 2019 before criticism forced its developer to pull it down.But, “on July 19th 2019, the creators sold the DeepNude licence on an online marketplace to an anonymous buyer for $30,000. The software has since been reverse engineered…” Sensity added. The key difference between that the first software and this service is now the fact that people do not need access to powerful graphics processing hardware and some degree of expertise to create such nudes. “In terms of photorealism, the level of the technology is still quite primitive and in many cases, it will be possible to distinguish them (the photographs) as a fake. Still, it does not mean that this material isn’t a reputation threat for people,” said Giorgio Patrini, CEO and chief scientist at Sensity. “Imagine someone posts a naked photo that you didn’t even take — the quality of the image is really not what makes the difference,” he added.According to Patrini, it is not established for certainty who are behind the new service. “We can state confidently that the individuals involved in the bot creation are very likely to be Russian native speakers, given the presence of this language among the users and the fact that a large part of the victim are Russian nationals,” Patrini said.Deepfake nudes do not fall in specific legal definitions in most countries, making it uncharted territory for law enforcement. Experts said it is closest to crimes known as revenge pornography and non-consensual sharing of intimate images. In India, such crimes are usually tried under Section 499 (criminal defamation) and Section 354C of the Indian Penal Code (voyeurism), and Section 66E (depicting private parts of a person) and Section 67A (section against sexually explicit materials) of the Information Technology Act, according to a 2018 analysis by Yesha Paul, then at the Centre for Communication Governance (CCG), National Law University (NLU) Delhi. “It is unlikely to be the case that the punishment using these laws will fit the crime because we are dealing with cyber crime as a service -- particularly cyber crime against women as a service,” said Gunjan Chawla, programme manager, technology and national security at CCG, NLU Delhi. There are also concerns of jurisdiction and evidence, when the illegal material is generated by an algorithm. “The courts might be significantly challenged to analyse the evidence to see whether or not that meets the standard of proof required in criminal trials - to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt,” she said.The use of AI to create fake nudes demonstrates the risk of putting out personal photographs, Patrini added. “People must think twice when sharing visual content online, visible to anyone. Even if the content itself is innocuous, unfortunately one day it might be repurposed and utilised maliciously against you,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-new-online-abuse-menace-ai-bot-turns-women-s-photos-into-nudes/story-BMQ2BTvIuFxB4D4zE9VAFJ.html
21-10-2020||World||Three-day FATF meet begins from Wednesday, Pakistan’s fate hangs in balance||The global terror financing watchdog, Financial Action Task Force (FATF), will hold a meeting from October 21 to 23. In this three-day virtual plenary meeting, the FATF will decide on whether Pakistan will remain in the “grey list” or not based on Islamabad’s commitment towards cracking down on money laundering and terror financing.This meeting was earlier scheduled in June but Islamabad got a breather of four months as the Paris-based watchdog temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines due to the coronavirus pandemic. The FATF is an inter-governmental body that was established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. Currently, it has 39 members including two regional organisations - the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. FATF and PakistanPakistan was put in the grey list in 2018 for not doing enough to curb the financial activities of terror groups. In February, the FATF warned Pakistan that all deadlines set for implementing an action plan against terror financing had expired, and that the country had largely addressed only 14 of 27 action items in the plan. Asia-Pacific Group, the FATF’s regional affiliate, concluded last month that Pakistan had fully complied with only two out of the 40 recommendations that were made. Since it is in the grey list, it has become increasingly difficult for Islamabad to get any financial aid from International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union. In order to get out of the grey list, debt-ridden Pakistan imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.What next for Pakistan?If the FATF in its meeting concludes that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, the country could be put in the “Black List” along with North Korea and Iran. In August, Prime Minister Imran Khan had warned that if blacklisted at the FATF, Pakistan’s entire economy will be destroyed due to inflation and a massive fall in Pakistani Rupee. In order to stay out of the black list, Pakistan needs the backing of only three members of FATF’s 39 members. Pakistan has China’s support and has also reached out to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Therefore, it is being expected widely that for now Pakistan will remain in the grey list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-day-fatf-meet-begins-from-wednesday-pakistan-s-fate-hangs-in-balance/story-EeoKBBT4oulxAfELtdKOQL.html

He addressed the Punjab chief minister as “Raja Sahib”. “Raja Sahib, you amended the laws of the Centre. Can a state change the laws of the Centre? No. You resorted to drama, mislead the people. The laws that you passed yesterday, will the farmers of Punjab get MSP after that? No. Farmers need MSP not your false laws,” Kejriwal said.“Raja Sahib, do not betray the farmers of Punjab. If you want real benefit of the farmers, then pass an MSP law that the crop the central government does not pick up on MSP, the Punjab government will take it on MSP,” he added.Hitting back, Amarinder Singh made a series of tweets and said Kejriwal’s reaction smacks of total ignorance and he should have done his homework before rushing to make remarks. “Your reaction smacks of total ignorance ArvindKejriwal though I can’t blame you as Delhi is not really a state. But I expected you to do homework before rushing to react to my remarks, that were made in interest of farmers, who I thought you might have some concern for.“And frankly, ArvindKejriwal I thought you knew your Constitution, which clearly says that u/Article 254 (II) states can seek amendment to central laws for local & contextual needs, as has been done in many cases, specially in CPC & CrPC laws. Maybe you could check it now!“So instead of questioning my govt’s Bills why don’t you get out of your IT mindset and ask your AAPPunjab unit to back us in our fight for farmers, unless their support to our Bills was just a facade? The ball is in your court - are you with farmers or against them?” he said.Kejriwal accused the Punjab chief minister of betraying farmers and said the Centre is not going to accept the amendments made by the state government. “Raja Sahib, you are accepting yourself that the state government cannot change the laws of the Centre. The central government is not going to accept your amendments. Then what did you distribute laddus yesterday? Cheated the farmers? First, you cheated by making an anti-farmer bill sitting in the committee of the Centre. And now this second betrayal?” he said.Punjab Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution rejecting three farm laws enacted by the central government as also the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill with the chief minister later leading a delegation to the Governor VP Singh Badnore urging him to give his assent to three bills passed by the assembly.Punjab is the first state to reject the three farm laws which were enacted after passage of relevant bills in the monsoon session of parliament last month.The assembly passed three bills “unanimously” to “protect MSP and check hoarding of foodgrains”.The House also passed by voice vote an amendment to CrPC for exempting farmers from the attachment of land up to 2.5 acres. The assembly passed Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-amarinder-singh-in-war-of-words-on-twitter-over-farm-bills-passed-by-punjab-assembly/story-dG03aNnlACzTFVBSMRmShI.html
21-10-2020||India||‘Theaterisation to take number of years,’ says army chief General Naravane||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Wednesday said the proposed creation of theatre commands to increase synergy among the three services would be a “deliberate and thoughtful” process and its fruition would take a “number of years”. He said “mid-course corrections” might be required along the way. His comments came during an address to officers and faculty at the Secunderabad-based College of Defence Management. The army chief spoke about a raft of issues including tri-service integration, theaterisation and modernisation of the armed forces. Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a Theatre Commander. Such commands will come under the operational control of an officer from any of the three services, depending on the function assigned to that command. As India’s first chief of defence staff, General Bipin Rawat’s mandate includes facilitating the restructuring of military commands for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about so-called jointness in operations, including through establishment of theatre commands, in three years. On the government’s decision to appoint the CDS and create the department of military affairs (DMA), an army statement quoted Naravane as saying it was “a momentous” decision and that the services needed to “demonstrate great wisdom and statesmanship in enabling the CDS, a long-standing demand of the armed forces.” The next logical step in the process of defence reforms was the “formation of integrated theatre commands to synergise the capabilities and combat potential of the three services during war and peace,” the statement further quoted the army chief as saying. The statement said the army chief explained to the officers that there was a need for everyone to work in a spirit of togetherness and trust, with national security interests being paramount. Sounding a cautionary note, he said there might be a requirement for “mid-course corrections”. He was, however, optimistic about the future of the military’s integration, which he described as “an inevitability” as it would lead to “tri-services synergy” and optimisation of resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theaterisation-to-take-number-of-years-says-army-chief-general-naravane/story-fVgTOGc3yeAd8YylR0OKXO.html

A police officer said that 15 members of Karni Sena, led by Uttar Pradesh unit president Sandip Singh, were stopped at Boodhanpur intersection and were detained at Koyalasa block auditorium around noon. In their support, 19 Karni Sena members from Ghazizpur and Sultanpur also reached there. All of them were booked.Superintendent of police (Rural Area), Azamgarh, Siddharth said that the Karni Sena members were booked under section 151 of the IPC.

According to the officer, Karni Sena had planned to organise a programme in favour of MLA Surendra Singh and Durjanpur shootout’s main accused Dhirendra Pratap Singh. But the Ballia district administration did not give permission for the event.

21-10-2020||India||Telangana agriculturist floats marriage bureau meant only for farmers||At a time when most of the parents are in search of grooms with high qualifications, lucrative jobs and fat bank balances for their daughters, a 40-year old farmer from Telangana’s Karimnagar district has come up with an initiative to find brides for youth who take to agriculture as a profession. Kethireddy Anji Reddy, an agriculturist from Timmapur village on the outskirts of Karimnagar town, started a marriage bureau last week exclusively to find alliances for farmers. Called ‘Rythu Marriage Bureau’, it is meant only for farmers, irrespective of their caste, creed and religion. “There have been marriage bureaus for all castes, religions and communities in every part of the country. But I have noticed that most of the profiles of grooms registered with these bureaus are that of employees, businessmen, engineers, doctors and various other professions, but not farmers,” Reddy said. Even if there are a few agriculturists registered with the marriage bureaus , they are big landlords involved in other ventures. “One can hardly find any groom on their lists who depends completely on agriculture for his livelihood. Even if any educated farmer registers his name with the marriage bureau, he won’t get much response. That is precisely why I chose to start a marriage bureau exclusively for farmers,” he said. According to Reddy, till recently, agriculture was a respectable profession in the villages and it was easy to find alliances within the villages. “But the present generation of women from agriculturists’ families is also well-educated and ambitious. They are looking for educated and well-settled grooms. As a result, youth who take up farming as a profession are finding it difficult to get marriage alliances,” he argues. Moreover, agriculture has become an unpredictable profession of late and is subject to vagaries of weather, pesticide attacks and lack of remunerative prices. “It is not a lucrative job. Because of this uncertainty, even farmers prefer to get their daughters married off to employed grooms, if not software engineers or doctors,” he said. Reddy said his initiative is meant to find good alliances for grooms who are solely dependent on agriculture. “The response in the last one week has been overwhelming. I am getting hundreds of calls every day from prospective grooms for registration. Interestingly, there are also a few inquiries from families of brides too,” he said. He declared that unlike the other marriage bureaus , no commission would be collected from brides or grooms at his Rythu Marriage Bureau for arranging the marriage. “We collect a nominal registration fee of Rs 500 from those who can afford it only to run this office. If they are poor farmers, they don’t have to pay even that amount,” he said. Reddy said his objective was to ensure that young farmers also lead a happy married life and should not be stigmatized for taking up farming as a profession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-agriculturist-floats-marriage-bureau-meant-only-for-farmers/story-zxPcxcJH7HBj1hTi0IC1JL.html

Kerala Covid-19 tally now stands at 3,61,841 out of which 2,67,082 have recovered and the number of active cases is 93,425. There were 26 casualties taking the death toll 1,231.The state’s test positivity rate (TPR) is 13.49% against the national average of 8.2 %. According to the latest union health ministry data at least 22 states are below the national average and six are above it. On Wednesday, Kerala’s health ministry announced that the cost of RT-PCR tests to detect Covid-19 has been reduced to Rs 2100 from 2750 and two-phase TrueNat which was at Rs 3000 will be priced at Rs 2200 but antigen tests will remain at Rs 625.It has also decided to permit Covid-19 testing kiosks outside all hospitals and labs approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Though tests are free in government hospitals, huge backlogs force many to turn to private laboratories and hospitals. The government has capped prices to avoid overpricing by private laboratories, it said. Despite medical experts’ advising the government to double Covid-19 tests, Kerala’s rate of testing is poor compared to neighboring states. On Wednesday it conducted 62,030 tests. Last week Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said the state would conduct at least one lakh tests a day but statistics show it never crossed 70,000. “We have been warning the government for quite some time. We have to increase tests considerably. The government should heed healthy criticism and advice rather than targeting them,” said Dr S S Lal, a public health expert who had earlier served with the World Health Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-slashes-cost-of-covid-19-tests-as-fresh-cases-continue-to-mount/story-IeNJ3PuSHjhfvfzVAJ92MJ.html

The decision implies that the CBI will need the state’s permission to enter its jurisdiction to carry out any investigation, effectively stripping the central agency of its powers to probe cases in Maharashtra.At least three non-BJP-ruled states - Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal - have already withdrawn its general consent to let the CBI investigate cases in their jurisdiction.Officials said the Maharashtra government’s decision would not impact the CBI investigation into the Sushant Singh Rajput death case since this probe is being conducted on orders of the Supreme Court and not under provisions that require a state to give its consent.Wednesday’s order issued by Maharashtra’s home department comes just a day after the Uttar Pradesh government registered a First Information Report on one aspect of the Television Rating Points case and promptly handed over the case to the CBI.The Maharashtra government had viewed this move as an attempt by the UP government to lay the foundation for the CBI to wade into the ongoing probe by Mumbai police against Republic TV. Leaders of the ruling alliance in Maharashtra had called the CBI registering the case in the TRP scandal as an attempt to “dilute” the case against Republic TV.Also Read | Kangana Ranaut, sister Rangoli summoned by Mumbai Police next week; FIR includes charges of seditionThe Mumbai police probe initiated against Republic TV earlier this month has set up a fresh face-off between the Thackeray-led coalition with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party’s Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA. In this case, the Mumbai police had named Republic TV as one of three channels accused of trying to fudge its television ratings. Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami has denied the charges.The scam had come to light when rating agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) complained that certain channels were rigging TRP numbers to lure advertisers.TRPs of a channel or programme is used to measure the popularity of channels by advertising agencies which affect pricing. The points are calculated in India by BARC using a device installed in over 45,000 households across the country called “Bar-O-Meter”. The device collects data about a programme or channel watched by members of these households on the basis of which weekly ratings are issued by BARC. It was alleged that some families at whose houses metres for collecting data of viewership were installed were being bribed to tune into a particular channel.Eight people have been arrested by Mumbai police in this case, two of them on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-blocks-cbi-from-probing-cases-in-maharashtra-withdraws-general-consent/story-nxPNzXjsKWVsCcLJ1JIY9M.html

It has not included 11 Gorkha community in the list of Scheduled Tribes.We feel cheated, so we are walking out of NDA today,” Gurung said at the press meet at a hotel here.The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader further said that he lived in New Delhi for three years, after fleeing the Hills, and moved to Jharkhand just about two months ago.“I don’t have any problem if I get arrested today,” Gurung, who has been charged with more than 150 cases for alleged involvement in the agitation, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bimal-gurung-s-gjm-to-support-tmc-in-bengal-assembly-polls-2021-exits-nda/story-lehSkDg7xBPgKCLKBtEDlL.html

21-10-2020||India||Couple of Covid-19 vaccines likely by early next year, says WHO chief scientist||At least a couple of vaccines could be available for use against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by the early part of 2021, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, World Health Organisation’s (WHO), chief scientist said on Wednesday.“One of the major lessons learned, and a positive one, during this pandemic has been the role of science and scientists, and also the global collaboration that we have had between scientists to take forward the advances in knowledge in an accelerated way,” Swaminathan said.She was speaking virtually at the 15th JRD Tata Memorial Oration, titled ‘Reimagining Health: Lessons from the Pandemic.’“Even product research and development has progressed in an unprecedented rate; we now have a number of new diagnostics including the rapid antigen tests for Covid-19. We are working on vaccines, which hopefully by the early part of 2021 we will have at least a couple of vaccines that have been proven to be safe and effective and that we can then start using in the most vulnerable and high-risk populations,” she added. Among the most important lessons learned during this pandemic, Swaminathan said was investing in public health and primary healthcare.“Of the lessons that I have learned over the last nine or ten months, the most important one is the importance of investing in public health and primary healthcare. We see examples of countries where investments in primary healthcare over the past decade or two have paid off. On the contrary, you have high income countries where they’ve been overwhelmed and haven’t been able to put in place some of the mechanisms that have been needed,” she said. The Population Foundation of India (PFI) streamed the oration as JRD Tata was one of the founders of PFI.Swaminathan emphasised the differential impact of the pandemic on women and children, and identified certain key factors that would address the gendered impact.The factors include including violence against women in the package of essential services; social services for women employed in the informal sector; the importance of sex and age disaggregated data and importance of universal health coverage schemes such as Ayushman Bharat. Underscoring the importance of gender analysis and gender responsive public health policies, Swaminathan said that there was a need to collect gender disaggregated data. Also, there was a strong need for infodemic management, given the excessive influx of misleading and false information on Covid-19. Apart from that there is also need to identify and address triggers of behaviour change; imaginative use of technology and empowering the frontline workers, who are the foundation of India’s public health system.Dr K Srinath Reddy, a board-member of PFI, said, “Science must light up the path for human progress in an ecologically sustainable world. Rejecting science will lead to future failures in averting or attenuating diseases, including pandemics. Dr Swaminathan gives a clarion call to hold the standard of science aloft as we march into a healthy future after the victory over Covid-19. To do so, we must vanquish not only the virus but also the virulent anti-science movement that has vitiated thinking and resisted a rational global public health response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/couple-of-covid-19-vaccines-likely-by-early-next-year-says-who-chief-scientist/story-BmI91saAbhdw8GleTUw9cJ.html

Noor is the third leader from the erstwhile Northern Alliance, which was backed by India in its campaign against the Taliban, to visit New Delhi in recent weeks. He was preceded by Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in September and Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, earlier this month. There was no official word from the external affairs ministry on the meeting between Jaishankar and Noor, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the two leaders discussed the Afghan peace process and the troubled talks currently underway between the Taliban and the Afghan government in Doha. The Indian government decided late last year to expand its contacts with different ethnic groups and political parties in Afghanistan, though it is yet to decide on the crucial issue of whether it should open a channel of communication with the Taliban. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Abdullah had said the Afghan leadership would have no concerns if India decides to engage the Taliban. In Indian circles, Noor, the chief executive of the Jamiat party, is best known for the personal role he played in countering a terror attack on the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif in January 2016, when he was the governor of Balkh province. “He personally took up arms to defend the Indian consulate when it was under attack,” an Afghan diplomat said on condition of anonymity. Noor’s visit to New Delhi coincided with a trip to Islamabad by Hizb-i-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a known India-baiter who has opposed any role of the country in Afghanistan. Hekmatyar, also known as the “butcher of Kabul” for his alleged links to civilian deaths in the 1990s, met foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday to discuss the peace process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-afghan-leader-ata-mohammad-noor-meets-external-affairs-minister-jaishankar/story-VeHRV23Z5IyAlpcuMF7mgP.html
21-10-2020||India||Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung surfaces after 3 years, dumps BJP, allies with TMC||One of West Bengal’s most wanted men, Darjeeling’s Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader Bimal Gurung surfaced in Kolkata on Wednesday evening three years after he went underground and swore to help chief minister Mamata Banerjee win the assembly polls due in another six months. Charged by the state government under anti-terror law for violence in the Darjeelng hills, Gurung had been in hiding since 2017. As an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Gurung helped the state’s principal opposition force win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat in 2009, 2014 and 2019. He was in hiding during the last election“I am no longer an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Central government, be it the Prime Minister or the Union home minister, did not keep the commitment made to us. I was in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for our cause but they did nothing. Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, does what she says. In 2021 we will go all out to help her win the seats in the Darjeeling hill region,” Gurung told the media at a hurriedly called press conference at a hotel in central Kolkata.  In 2019, the BJP had an alliance with the GJM’s Gurung faction, the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and other smaller hill parties. BJP’s Raju Bista won the seat. The GJM has influence over voters in around 15 assembly seats in Darjeeling hills and the Terai and Dooars region in the foothills and plains.“I proudly say that today I want to break away from the NDA and in the coming assembly polls we want to have an alliance with Mamata Banerjee and give a reply to the BJP,” said Gurung. “In politics, there are no foes and friends. Our demand is Gorkhaland and a permanent political solution. We will see which party addresses our issues and decide our strategy for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” said the Gorkha leader. Gurung, who founded the GJM which enforced a 104-day shutdown in the Darjeeling hills in 2017 in demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland, was on the run ever since he was charged by the state under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Asked whether he was afraid of being arrested or whether he had a meeting with TMC leaders or government officials before appearing in public in the state capital, Gurung said, “I am not a criminal. I am a political leader. If I am arrested I will still speak for our cause. I did not meet any TMC leader. We will possibly have a meeting in a day or two.” The press conference was preceded by a two-hour drama. Gurung’s followers in Darjeeling informed the media that he would meet journalists at Gorkha Bhawan at Salt Lake in the eastern fringes of Kolkata at 5 pm after holding a secret meeting with some senior leaders of the ruling TMC. Gurung arrived at Gorkha Bhawan around 4.30 pm in a white luxury SUV with an unidentified person who was dressed in saffron attire. However, the staff at Gorkha Bhawan who owe allegiance to Gurung’s rival faction in the GJM did not open the gates. More than a dozen officers and constables of the Kolkata Police were present at the spot. They shouted at the staff, asking them to come out and open the gates. When no one responded, Gurung headed for Kolkata. His followers said he would hold the press conference at a hotel in central Kolkata. The fact that the Kolkata Police did not try to arrest Gurung who is wanted under anti-terror law for the violence that rocked the Darjeeling hills in 2017 indicated that the TMC leadership has taken a soft stand in the run-up to the crucial assembly polls. There was no comment by any TMC leader but the party tweeted in the night, “We welcome Bimal Gurung’s commitment to peace & decision to withdraw support from NDA while reposing faith in @MamataOfficial’s leadership. BJP’s attempts to use Gorkhaland issue for petty politics & their untrustworthy nature now lay fully exposed before people of Bengal.”“We’re confident that all the key stakeholders in hills, including political parties & GTA along with civil society will work together & join hands with us for the peace & prosperity of our motherland,” the party said in a second tweet. Gurung’s trusted lieutenant Roshan Giri signed the tripartite Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) accord in July 2011. GTA is the local autonomous body in the Darjeeling hills, which is now headed by the Binoy Tamang-led faction of the GJM that supports the TMC. In November 2017, Gurung’s erstwhile lieutenant Tamang suspended him and his aides in their absence. Keshav Raj Pokhrel, a spokesperson of the Tamang faction said, “Gurung’s arrival will have no impact on hill politics because people see him as a selfish person. Gurung dumped them and fled in 2017 when the police slapped criminal charges against him.” Since 2009, the BJP has been promising to find a permanent political solution to the long-pending demands of people of Darjeeling, Siliguri, the Terai and the Dooars region. The promises were made in the BJP’s election manifestos in 2014 and 2019 as well. In the first week of October, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) sent a letter to the state government and the Gurung-led faction of the GJM to attend a meeting in Delhi on October 7 to discuss “issues related to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration”. The state government skipped the meeting but followers of Gurung attended it and demanded a permanent political solution to the Gorkhaland issue. “Gurung had been demanding the creation of Gorkhaland for years. We too want a solution to this problem. The Centre tried to help the hill people but the TMC government did not cooperate. This is a tactical move by Mamata Banerjee prior to the polls. There are criminal cases pending against Gurung. She possibly thinks that this factor can be used for leverage,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh told the media. Political expert and former principal of Presidency College, Prof Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay said an alliance between Gurung faction of the GJM and the TMC would have little impact on election results in 2021. “Bimal Gurung faces several criminal charges. If he has comes to Kolkata then it means that the government is not going to take any step against him. That also means that Banerjee sent feelers to Gurung. TMC is losing ground in Bengal. She is trying to secure at least the seats in the hill areas. But Gurung has little influence and power in the hill region at the moment. This alliance will be misadventure for Banerjee,” said Mukhopadhyay. “Mamata Banerjee feels that everything is fair in love and war. That is why a wanted man can be seen in Kolkata in the presence of policemen. She is making a move purely in view of the assembly polls,” said state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gorkha-leader-bimal-gurung-surfaces-after-3-years-dumps-bjp-allies-with-tmc/story-gsKfl48Ar2fI6HCvgOAwwO.html
21-10-2020||India||Bombay HC questions ‘investigative’ journalism by news channels in SSR death case||The Bombay high court on Wednesday sought to know from Republic TV how its statements that asked the public to decide on who should be arrested in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case could be termed as investigative journalism. It also questioned the News Broadcasters Federation (NBF) on why it did not initiate suo motu action on complaints about alleged media trial in the SSR case.The court while hearing the responses of various news channels on the allegations made by the petitioners in the various public interest litigations against them was informed that the reporting was not intended to influence or prejudice the minds of the judges or the court and the contentions of the petitioners were unfounded. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the responses of the NBF was informed by advocate Siddharth Bhatnagar that the self-regulating authority had been abiding by the standards set out in the Cable TV Regulation Act. Bhatnagar submitted that various courts including the Supreme Court had refrained from interfering in the existing mechanism. Bhatnagar was, however, unable to respond to the court’s query as to why the NBF had not taken any suo motu action against member channels after receiving complaints of the media trial being conducted in the SSR case. Advocate Malvika Trivedi, counsel for Republic TV started countered the claims of the petitioners that the channel had tried to malign the Mumbai police by accusing it of not carrying out proper investigation in the SSR case. “There was some lacunae in the investigation by Mumbai police which the Supreme Court observed and hence allowed the investigation to be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” she said.She added that the demand for transfer of investigation was made by the family of the late actor and the public was also curious to know the facts. She further submitted that the reporting was part of the investigative journalism undertaken by the channel. The court referred to hashtag ‘arrest Rhea Chakrabarty’ which was publicized by the channel and sought to know from Trivedi whether asking the public on who should be arrested was investigative journalism, Trivedi responded saying that it was on social media.“These are public tweets and public opinions. The petition does not ask for relief pertaining to this. I am only saying that there is a reason and context of these tweets. Any person who is aggrieved and has a locus standi, can approach the self-regulatory authority and get relief.” The bench while assuring the channel that it was not singling out Republic TV, sought to know that when investigation was underway in the SSR case on whether it was homicide or suicide, why had the channel had taken a stand that it was murder and whether the stand was part of the investigative journalism. Trivedi then drew the attention of the court to previous cases wherein the media had played a vital role in the investigations and had also received applause for its contribution based on which arrests were made. “The Supreme Court has appreciated the work done by Republic TV in one of the cases,” said Trivedi. While hearing responses of other channels, the court observed that it did not intend to throttle the voice of the media but expected the media to exercise restraint while reporting on sensitive issues and not cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ which was referred to by the petitioners. The court will continue hearing the matter on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-questions-investigative-journalism-by-news-channels-in-ssr-death-case/story-kKoDXgFR8s9SHhWeUUf5dJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Palghar lynching case: 208 new accused named, 50 arrested||The state Crime Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday named 208 new accused in the April 16 Palghar lynching case and arrested 50 people.The 50 arrested will be produced before the Dahanu court on Thursday, confirmed their lawyer Amrut Adhikari.With this development, the total arrested in the case stand at 376 out of which 11 are minors. However, 28 accused and 9 minors have been released on bail as the CID in its chargesheet did not name their involvement in the lynching and hence sought default bail.Meanwhile, the bail hearing of the 62 accused in the case will be heard by Special Sessions Judge PP Jadhav at Thane on Thursday, said Adhikari.The killing of the two saffron-robed men and their driver in April this year had sparked off national outrage after video clips showed policemen heading to safety inside the police station and leaving the three men at the mercy of hundreds of people who suspected the three were thieves.Kalpvrush Giri, 70, Sushil Giri, 35, and driver Nilesh Telgade, 30, were dragged out of their vehicle and thrashed by the mob in Gadhchinchale village, about 110 km from Palghar. The seers belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri in Surat.Five months after Gaurav Singh, former superintendent of police (SP), Palghar, was sent on compulsory leave by state home minister Anil Deshmukh following the lynching incident, he has now been posted as a superintendent of the Maharashtra Police Academy, Nashik, by the state home ministry.The state government in a reply to the Supreme Court to a petition seeking handing over the case to a central agency, had last Wednesday, mentioned that no dereliction of duty was found from Singh’s side and thus was given a clean chit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/palghar-lynching-case-218-new-accused-named-50-arrested/story-nZ33lsDM24hWVj8lQRq4sI.html
21-10-2020||India||Day after returning request, Chhattisgarh Governor calls assembly session||Convinced by the reply of the state government on a query about the reason behind the assembly session, Chhattisgarh Governor Anusuiya Uikey has agreed to convene a two-day special Assembly on October 27 and 28.A notification in this regard has been issued by the Chhattisgarh Assembly secretariat on Wednesday. The Chhattisgarh government will bring a legislation in this special assembly session to bypass newly enacted central farm laws, a senior official posted in the chief minister’s office said.Earlier on Tuesday, Governor Anusuiya Uikey had returned the state government’s proposal seeking to convene a special session of state legislative assembly with a query regarding the reasons behind the session. Reacting to the development, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said that the Governor cannot prevent a government, which has full majority, from holding a special assembly session in the state.However, a senior official posted in the Governor’s house told Hindustan Times on Wednesday that the Governor had only asked the state government about the ‘topic’ for the special session.“It was never a conflict between the state government and Governor. The Governor only asked for the reason behind calling a special assembly session on which the state government has submitted its reply and subsequently the proposal was accepted,” said an official posted with the Governor House and did not wish to be named.Earlier this month, the Congress government had proposed to call the special Assembly session on October 27-28 to bring a legislation to bypass newly enacted three central farm laws and a labour law to protect the interest of farmers and labourers of the state. Chhattisgarh cabinet in September had rejected the Centre’s agriculture laws and decided to pass its own farm laws by calling a special session of the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-returning-request-chhattisgarh-governor-calls-assembly-session/story-3FppOsV730cfLCHyJyqfJO.html
21-10-2020||India||Meghalaya minister sounds alarm over leak from uranium effluent tanks in remote village||A minister in Meghalaya said Tuesday that he has seen uranium effluents leaking from storage tanks once owned by the Atomic Minerals Directorate (AMD) and later operated by the Uranium Corporation of India in a remote village in South West Khasi Hills which he termed as “dangerous”.Community and rural development minister, Hamletson Dohling who visited the Nongbah Jynrin village in South West Khasi Hills, 135 km west of Shillong, with a group of student and youth leaders after learning about the leakage, also flagged “unauthorised repairs.”Dohling said he was surprised to see signs of repairs in the tanks in one of Meghalaya’s most inaccessible places that remains largely cut off from the rest of the state.“I have seen that there were cracks in the tanks, but it is very surprising that there were signs of repair. I don’t have knowledge about who gave the order to repair,” he said.The minister went on to say, “If there was nothing, why should it be repaired in the first place? What I saw is very dangerous.” Dohling asserted, while endorsing what the local youth have been reporting in recent weeks.With this admission, the government is likely to step up efforts to ensure the safety of residents of the area.Last Friday, the state government had decided to probe into the reports of leakage of toxic waste from tanks containing uranium wastes in the Domiasiat-Nongbah-Jynrin area. There are four effluent storage tanks and two other reservoirs at the location which have developed wide cracks causing leakage of toxic waste, locals have alleged.Following a high-level review meeting it was decided to immediately set up an expert panel to probe the reports of radiation emission, Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong had said. Chief secretary MS Rao has been tasked to constitute the panel.“We have written to the Central Pollution Control Board as well as the North-Eastern Hill University and other experts. Once they respond, and we identify the expert team and will formally issue an order by next week,” Tynsong stated.Chief minister Conrad K Sangma had earlier said that his government would examine a demand for an independent inquiry into the matter. He also said that experts and government agencies have inspected the concrete tanks and assured him that no such leakage has been detected.However, on Monday evening he told journalists, “We will get the demand examined… and after holding discussions with the forest and environment department and other agencies, we will take a call on how to move forward on this matter. We are equally concerned about the situation. As I said, all agencies working on this have clearly indicated that no such leakage has occurred.”Meghalaya is the third most uranium-rich state in the country after Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand accounting for 16 per cent of the nation’s reserves with deposit estimates pegged at 9.22 million tonnes spread across 422 hectares of land.Exploratory work by the Atomic Minerals Directorate (AMD) began in the 1970s and there was a move to initiate open-pit mining of the precious mineral. Work continued till 1993 but after a lot of outcry over health hazards and its impact on the environment the mines were directed to be shut.Though AMD left, they did so allegedly without properly clearing up the tools, effluents etc. as per laid down protocols.“It was summoned back and in 1995, built huge concrete tanks to put in all the remnants, processed uranium decay,” revealed London-based environmental economist and co-founder and CEO of EcoFriend World Dr Bremley WB Lyngdoh who has been actively following this matter with local pressure groups primarily the Khasi Students’ Union which has been spearheading the campaign.In 2009, the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) was granted permission to carry out pre-mining activities. But the permission was permanently cancelled by the state government in 2016. UCIL packed up operations for good in 2018 after repeated protests and violent incidents.Last month the matter came into the limelight again with locals reporting of foul smell in the area and cracks appearing in several places where the storage tanks were set up. Though initially the South West Khasi Hills district administration conducted an enquiry and gave a clean chit, the pressure groups did not give up and pursued the matter.Khasi Students Union (KSU) leaders visited the site along with Dr Lyngdoh on October 9 last. According to Forwardman Nongrem, South West Khasi Hills District’s KSU president, the geiger counter — an instrument to detect and measure ionising radiation — detected very high levels of radiation in the area. Dr. Lyngdoh said, “When we visited the site, I got the shock of my life — the radiation level recorded by the geiger counter was at 1,083 count per minute,” said Dr Lyngdoh, adding that he had personally apprised the chief minister of the situation.KSU’s Nongrem said that appointing an expert committee was all well and good, but they wanted the government to prioritise two things. “First, the government should repair any cracks/leaks in the tanks and second, the radiation level should be reduced so that people in the surrounding areas are safe from the emissions,” he said. There are at least seven villages located up to a radius of 3 km from the site.HT tried to reach out to AMD officials but no one was willing to go on record on the matter citing a government gag order. But according to a source, AMD took note of mainstream media and social media reports and sent a team of experts from the nuclear division to the site and thorough inspection revealed that “some miscreants may have tried to dig in thereby causing the cracks which have been accordingly repaired.” The visits took place on September 22 and October 6, the source said.When queried if the state government has communicated to them on the expert panel till date, the source replied in the negative. “However we have received a set of questions from the Assembly and the same have been sent to our headquarters for response.”On the claim of high levels of radiation emanating from the spot, the source said it could be a possible misreading of the gadget from “micro to milli” but did not elaborate any further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-minister-sounds-alarm-over-leak-from-uranium-effluent-tanks-in-remote-village/story-w4K6VrH5jNlt8n4vSGIJRM.html

And the leaders addressing these meetings, the commission said, did that without wearing masks.“By doing so, the political parties and candidates are not only flouting the guidelines of the commission with impunity, but exposing themselves as well as the public attending the rallies/meetings to the danger of infection during the pandemic,” the Election Commission said.It also said that during elections, political parties are the most important stakeholders in the electoral process. They duty bound to observe the norms determined by the commission for electioneering, the ECI further said.The commission once again asked the political parties and candidates “to demonstrate utmost vigil and care during electioneering”.“CEOs and the District Machinery would be expected by the Commission to invoke appropriate and relevant penal provisions against the candidates concerned as well as the organizers responsible for such violations,” the ECI said.The top electoral body said that instructions to ensure compliance have been issued to Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) and state governments where elections are scheduled to be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-guidelines-being-flouted-with-impunity-election-commission-warns-parties-busy-in-campaigning/story-K90Xu8ed4jlIbbFljo4SRP.html
21-10-2020||India||India gifts a submarine to Myanmar, gains edge over China||India’s provision of a submarine to Myanmar was a move that helped New Delhi get an edge over Beijing, which is seeking to push its military hardware among countries in the neighbourhood, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The 3,000 diesel-electric submarine INS Sindhuvir, which has been renamed UMS Minye Theinkhathu, was showcased during the Myanmar Navy’s Bandoola fleet exercise on October 15, the same day the external affairs ministry announced that India had gifted the submarine to the neighbouring country. “The Kilo-class submarine is an old design but it underwent extensive refits and upgrades before being handed over to Myanmar. It is significant that India handed over one of its submarines at a time when such vessels are needed to keep an eye on regional waters due to the increased activities of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy,” said one of the people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity. The move also coincides with growing concerns among some of India’s neighbours about the quality of Chinese military hardware, which is often offered on favourable terms and comes with lines of credit to back purchases. “There is a frequently used phrase in Myanmar – ‘tayokeset tayet-soke’ – which means ‘Chinese machine, broken in a day’. There are reports that Myanmar’s military leadership is unhappy with the quality of some Chinese equipment supplied to them and they have started diversifying their imports and looking towards India,” said a second person, who too didn’t wish to be identified. The discovery of Chinese-origin weaponry among militant groups in Myanmar, such as the Arakan Army, too has become a “source of annoyance” in some quarters, the people said. The people noted that two Ming-class Type 035G submarines sold by China to Bangladesh under a $200 million deal in 2017 were from the 1970s and had faced problems related to serviceability. There were also reports that two Chinese Type 053H3 frigates provided to Bangladesh in 2020 had faced problems with their navigation radar and weapons systems, the people said. In Nepal, flag carrier Nepal Airlines decided to ground two types of Chinese-origin aircraft –Y12e and MA60 – that were acquired through a government-to-government deal after concluding that they were unsuitable for the country’s terrain, the people added. Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House and a former envoy to Myanmar, said New Delhi’s outreach to Naypyitaw, including the gifting of the submarine and a recent visit by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and army chief General MM Naravane, was significant. “Myanmar is grappling with international opprobrium and lack of funds and the provision of the submarine helps them overcome both. The Chinese have been trying to do the same thing but this time, India beat them at the game. The visit, especially the army chief’s presence in the team, was a high-profile attempt to engage with all elements of Myanmar’s leadership,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gifts-a-submarine-to-myanmar-gains-edge-over-china/story-fblOtZRy3hOaJDi6CKkjuK.html

Rooms, other service areas, seats/tables will be sanitised each time a customer leaves,” the DDMA had said in its SOPs last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-delhi-govt-directs-clubs-hotels-liquor-shops-to-ensure-strict-compliance-of-sops/story-Baowr5x7WvR80Hhpcj8dTM.html
21-10-2020||India||Melinda Gates: ‘Life will change forever… we will build back in a better way’||Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) launched three innovations around emerging technologies at the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting earlier this week. These include integrating tradition and technology for fermented foods for maternal nutrition, new approaches to integrating molecular surveillance into malaria control, and smart farming for small-scale crop and livestock producers.Melinda Gates, the co-chair of BMGF, spoke to Sanchita Sharma about innovation, livelihoods, and how coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will change the world. Excerpts from the interview:Four women won the Nobel Prize this year; three for their work in physics and chemistry. Do you think women’s leadership in science is finally getting global recognition?I sure hope so, and I think the reason that is so important is little girls can only be what they can see. And so, when they see women winning Nobel Prizes in the sciences, they say, wow, I also can be a scientist. I aspire to do cutting-edge research. I can get there. And so, I sure hope it is a moniker and a marker in time of, wow, we really are turning the corner on women in the sciences.How else can science be made more exciting for girls so they choose careers in research, engineering and technology?We know that young girls and women are much more interested in the sciences if they’re working on a real problem that they see out in society. If they see anything that they know will benefit their community or benefit their family or it’s a real-world example instead of just a theoretical example, they’re much more likely to persist in the sciences.So, they like to address real-world problems?Exactly. They like to address real-world problems.Also Read: Working on Covid-19 vaccine delivery system: PM ModiHow can countries reopen their economies without health risks?I think that’s a great question to ask the women’s self-help groups in India. As you know, there are millions of women in self-help groups in India who are out in the villages. They’re the ones who know, okay, how can people get a different life and livelihood here? What are the opportunities? Are there opportunities if they have access to digital? Are there different kinds of opportunities in terms of what they actually decide to grow on their small plot of land? Quite often, if they can get into a different type of agriculture, something that is more drought resistant or pest resistant or is more desired by people, sometimes switching their crops so that they’re meeting market need is a potential opportunity, or getting sometimes into poultry or livestock.Can Covid-19 end without a vaccine?We need a vaccine.Has Covid-19 changed life as we know it forever?I do think life as we knew it has changed, will change forever, but sometimes out of a crisis comes something beautiful. I look back at some of the wars and you think about what was rebuilt after the war to maintain peace and stability around the globe. Look at the World Health Organization that was formed to make sure that we have information about health and share that around the globe. I think we will have to build new institutions. We’ll have to do more to protect everybody and the vulnerable.There are signs that people want something different. They already wanted something different before the pandemic. And I think the pandemic has exposed the cracks in all of our societies, the gaps and the people we don’t take care of, and now it’s in our face. Women’s unpaid work; no one can turn away from that. It’s in our home every single day, women taking care of the children or taking care of the elderly during the pandemic. I think there are ways that we will be able to build back and build back in a better way.What differentiates the Grand Challenges from other initiatives to boost innovation?Grand Challenges was set up to bring some of the most innovative ideas forward in global health and global development, which are the foci of our work. Other awards are quite often focused on other problems. We’re quite intent as well on making sure that it is a diverse set of voices bringing the ideas forward from many of the countries that aren’t high income countries, and there are a female scientists bringing ideas forward.Is it safe to reopen schools?Well, in terms of reopening schools, those are very local decisions that need to be made based on the number of Covid-19 cases that are in a particular community. You can really only decide on a local basis whether to reopen the schools. It doesn’t matter whether you’re in the United States or you’re in India or you’re in Europe, you have to make it with local data and local health authorities advising you. And then if the schools, if the health authorities say the schools are safe to open, it’s vitally important that people employ and use the only tools we have today, which are masks, hand washing and social distancing. Those messages have to be given very strongly and also enforced in the schools.Also Read: Very large portion of Covid-19 vaccines likely to be manufactured in India: Gates Foundation CEOWhich Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are worst impacted by the pandemic?Well, that data is still being collected. If you go SDG by SDG, we don’t know in some of them, but I can tell you some of the ones we do know. We know that the global immunization rate dropped already 84% to 70%. That’s a 25-year setback in the global immunisation rate, and where we will probably see the impact in the years going forward is as we measure infant mortality, which is going to be really sad. I mean, the other places that we know we’ve lost gains are in malaria and tuberculosis. Five years of gains have been erased just since March. It’s pretty dire in area after area.How has Covid-19 increased iniquities?We know in country after country, domestic violence is up. When women don’t have safe spaces to go to or they’re locked in or a child is locked in with an abusive parent or a woman is locked in with an abusive partner, domestic violence rises, and we’re seeing that. You’re hearing the reports of it in Canada, in Europe, in South Africa.One of the things I’ve been pleased to see is some of the really innovative programming that’s being done. Out of Africa put out more money to the local women’s organizations who are already fighting these issues. In France they decided to have safe spaces that women could come and report at a grocery store or at a pharmacy. Canada opened their hotels for domestic violence survivors. We’re seeing a huge increase in that, which is an enormous barrier for a woman.The other impacts we’re seeing on Covid for women are these what we call shadow pandemics, more girls out of school and less likely to return at the same rate that maybe their brother might, interruptions in contraceptive supply chains, women not being able to get an ambulance to go into hospital or clinic to give birth. Those are all things that are affecting women.And how do we take vaccines to reach everyone who needs it?Well, you first make sure that your front-line health workers get it, right, and 70% of those are women. There are 15 million healthcare workers out around the world. They should get it first, because they’re the ones who are taking care of everybody else. Then you start to look at who are your most vulnerable populations, which people have chronic underlying illnesses, obviously, as you said, what’s the age cohort? And so, then that really takes government planning to decide, okay, how are we going to get it out to those people as the next tier and then out to the next tier and the tier below that who need it? In your country that will be the government of India. I think one of the fortunate things that India has is Serum Institute is incredibly good at making vaccines. They have the know-how and they have the capability and the manufacturing capability. I think India is going to be very lucky in that regard compared to some other countries.Is the world better prepared for the next pandemic? Are partnerships the way forward?Yes, we’re seeing global cooperation in a way we have never seen it before as a globe. I mean, look at how the scientific community is coming together to move as rapidly as they can to learn about vaccines, learn about medicines, figure out diagnostics. We’re trying to learn from each other in terms of countries of what works well for testing and tracing. How do you get good messages out about social distancing and mask wearing? We’re seeing global cooperation and partnership. It really is the only thing that’s not only going to get us out of this crisis, but get us prepared.You asked earlier, you know, preparing for the next pandemic, there will be another pandemic sometime in the next hundred years. But there is a lot we can do with our data and information sharing, with stockpiling at times different types of vaccines, sharing information about what is known and alerting people as soon as there’s an outbreak. There’s a lot we can do, and I think global cooperation and partnership is finally on display in full force.And yes, we were one of the founders of GAVI (The Vaccine Alliance) back in 2000. That has been an unbelievable institution that we are lucky to have as a world during this pandemic. It will be able to get vaccines out to countries into the far corners of the earth. That institution had to learn over time. It had to make some mistakes, come back from those mistakes, get better and better, make sure it constantly had a good governing board and good leadership. We need to build some institutions like that. We have one called the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It was funded but not funded at a very high level. After this, I think you’re going to see country after country putting money in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, so that we are prepared for the next pandemic.You told BBC Radio some months ago that you’ve been storing food and water in your basement for years in preparation for a pandemic. What’s your advice to people with no basements?Well, my advice actually to everybody is we ought to be investing in our primary healthcare system. I mean, if you have a robust primary healthcare system, it is the first line where people go. That is where their needs are met. We have to, have to, have to as a world invest in those, and we haven’t paid enough attention, quite honestly, to the primary healthcare. That’s my message to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/melinda-gates-life-will-change-forever-we-will-build-back-in-a-better-way/story-a5MkRGUaROGxcxzmMX7fsJ.html

21-10-2020||India||On India-US agenda, a plan to share defence intel from Ladakh to South China Sea||The 3rd two plus two ministerial meeting next week will see both India and the United States consolidating military-to-military relationship between the two democracies to move towards institutionalised intelligence-sharing agreement and go beyond tri-services exercises into unmanned, space and underwater platform domains, people familiar with the matter said.On October 26-27, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper in national capital Delhi for the third round of the top strategic dialogue agreed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump back in 2017. The two sides are expected to sign off on a geo-spatial military foundational agreement called BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) that is a precursor to India acquiring armed drones such as the MQ-9B from the US that use spatial data for pinpointed strikes.The two sides are expected to build on past gains at the meeting being held weeks before the US Presidential elections on November 3, comfortable in the knowledge that there is bi-partisan consensus within the US on deepening India-US strategic relationship.Also Read: Charting the future of India-US ties | OpinionThere is a strong possibility that the two sides could work out a pact that allows institutionalised relationship between the Defence Intelligence Agencies of the two countries. India and the US already share real-time intelligence through the communication agreement called COMCASA. But the new pact would allow the two allies to share vital tri-services intelligence on developments in all defence matters ranging from the South China Sea to Ladakh. This proposal has been hanging fire for quite some years without any results.Although BECA is still to be formally cleared by PM Modi’s Cabinet, the agreement will enable India to buy armed unmanned aerial and underwater platforms from the US. These would be loaded with neighbourhood terrain maps for pin-pointed destruction of acquired targets. The terrain maps will also help in precision flying of US made platforms acquired by India and hence enhance military capability of platforms like Apache attack helicopters and Chinook heavy lift helicopters.While a decision to acquire armed drones has been communicated to the US, the two countries are going beyond mere exercises and into hitherto unexplored domains like space and undersea.The two sides will also discuss the People’s Liberation Army’s aggression in Ladakh and its muscle flexing in the South China Sea and the countermeasures that the four-nation QUAD - that also comprises Japan and Australia - needs to take to remain committed to free and open Indo-Pacific for global trade and commerce.The peace in Afghanistan and terror in Pakistan will be also on top priority as India fears more violence in Kabul once the American forces leave the Islamic Republic after 19 years. Even though India participated in the Doha intra-Afghan talks, it is concerned about the Pakistani deep state’s hold on the Taliban and has told the leadership of the present government in Kabul to present a united face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-meet-to-step-up-military-ties-with-intel-sharing-space-cooperation/story-6hGznJ1wcL0Xq4bmkD10TN.html
21-10-2020||India||MP High Court frowns upon large political rallies amid Covid-19 pandemic||The Gwalior bench of the Madhya Pradesh high court on Tuesday restrained district magistrates in 9 districts from giving permission to any political party or its candidate for any physical public meeting irrespective of its size if there is a possibility of a virtual election campaign.The districts include Gwalior, Guna, Morena, Bhind, Ashok Nagar, Datia, Shivpuri, Sheopur and Vidisha. The court which had been displeased by the conduct of political parties and candidates for assembly bypoll campaign, observed that right to health and life of a common man is comparatively more exalted, sacred and precious compared to the right to canvassing and campaigning for a candidate. “Thus, the right of a candidate to campaign has to yield to the right to health and life of the electorate,” a two-judge bench comprising justice Sheel Nagu and justice Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava said in an interim order.The court observed that unfortunately, political parties are doing everything to draw the common man out of the security and safety of his home to become a part of a congregation “to achieve their ulterior motive of gaining popularity to obtain votes, and leaving gullible and innocent common man to go home carrying Covid-19 virus with him and transmit the disease to his family members and friends”. “The district magistrates of all nine districts falling within the territorial jurisdiction of this court are restrained from giving permission to any candidate/political party for holding physical congregations of any number of people unless the political party applying for such a congregation is able to satisfy the district magistrate concerned that conduction of a virtual election campaign is not possible and the district magistrate passes a speaking order recording reasons of being satisfied of the inability of candidate/political parties to conduct virtual campaigning,” the order said.The court said the district magistrate’s permission to conduct the physical meeting ‘shall become effective only after the Election Commission of India (ECI) approves the same in writing’. At the same time, the court said, holding of physical congregation even if permitted by the DM and ECI can take place only after the political party/candidate concerned deposits money with the DM, which is sufficient to purchase double the number of masks and sanitizers required for protecting and sanitizing the number of people expected in the congregation. The candidate will have to file an affidavit that “he shall be personally liable to distribute masks and sanitizers to all the members of the congregation before the meeting/congregation starts,” the order said. The interim order passed is the third one from the court on a petition filed by a Gwalior-based advocate Ashish Pratap Singh who in his petition and subsequent interlocutory application pointed out gross violations of Covid-19 safety norms by political party leaders ahead of bypolls to 28 legislative assembly constituencies in the state slated for November 3. The court appointed three advocates as amicus curie to submit their own reports on the election meetings. Earlier, the court had directed the collectors in these districts to invoke penal provisions of Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code not only against the defaulting members of the congregation who fail to follow the Covid-19 protocol but also against political/governmental/state or social functionaries in whose name or on whose behest and behalf the said congregation take place. On being pointed out by the petitioner that FIRs were not lodged against Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and state Congress president Kamal Nath despite the court’s previous orders, the court directed the collectors concerned to ensure registration of FIRs against the two political leaders for breach of Covid-19 protocol. The court said instances pointed out in the past nearly 15 days gave a clear indication that functionaries, members of the political parties whether a common worker or the person at the helm, were taking no steps to avoid physical congregation. “The common agenda of the political parties appears to be to conduct as many and as large a congregation as possible with the ultimate objective of gaining popularity during the election campaign. This obviously is done at the cost of health and lives of those gullible and innocent citizens of this country who come from lower strata of society and are unaware of the risk they incur to their lives by being a part of such congregations”, said the court.Both the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress said they were studying the court’s latest order.State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “We are looking into the high court order. Election meetings are held to educate voters. Hence, restrictions on public meetings will limit the opportunities of the political parties to convey its policies and programmes to voters. We will see if we can make a prayer to the court to pass an order in consultation with ECI to make the campaigning a smooth one.” State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “We are studying the court’s interim order. Hence, we can’t comment on it right now. However, till now there are no amended guidelines from the ECI. We are bound to follow the ECI guidelines in respect with elections. We will see if the ECI issues any fresh guidelines for elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-high-court-frowns-upon-political-rallies-in-bypoll-campaign-amid-covid-pandemic/story-r1xhoSBPosK5NVNKpHY6lJ.html
21-10-2020||India||India-Bhutan hydropower project bags prestigious Brunel Medal||The Mangdechhu hydroelectric project, an India-Bhutan venture, has been awarded the prestigious Brunel Medal for excellence in civil engineering by the UK-based Institute of Civil Engineers. India-backed hydropower projects in Bhutan are an example of win-win cooperation, providing a reliable source of inexpensive and clean electricity for New Delhi and generating export revenues for Thimphu, said officials who declined to be named. The 720-MW Mangdechhu run-of-river project was jointly inaugurated by the prime ministers of the two countries in August 2019, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Bhutan. It is one of seven hydroelectric projects being developed by Bhutan with India’s support as part of the Himalayan country’s plans to generate 10 GW of hydropower. The Brunel Medal was conferred on the Mangdechhu hydroelectric project authority on October 5. The Institute of Civil Engineers said the project provided employment opportunities to the local community, particularly families affected by the venture, and facilitated local people to take up business activities. The project also supported schools and health facilities by upgrading existing infrastructure. Several drinking water facilities and irrigation channels were developed by the project. With the coming on stream of Mangdechhu project, Bhutan’s electricity generation capacity created with India’s assistance crossed 2,000 MW. Both countries have listed hydropower development as one of the most important areas of bilateral cooperation. Since its commissioning, the project has earned revenues of Rs 1,300 crore, higher than the projected target of Rs 1,200 crore. Most of the 18.7 million units generated every day by the project meet the energy needs of Bhutan, and the surplus is exported to India. During the project’s construction between 2012 and 2019, authorities took up several social and environment projects for the local community, including a basic health unit and infrastructure for schools in Trongsa district of Bhutan. The project, completed at an approximate cost of Rs 5,000 crore, was funded by India through a 70% loan and 30% grant. The Indian government has constructed four hydropower projects in Bhutan – the 1,020-MW Tala project, the 336-MW Chukha project, the 60-MW Kurichhu project and the Mangdechhu project. Three more – the 1,200-MW Punatsangchhu-I, the 1020-MW Punatsangchhu-II and the 600-MW Kholongchhu – are under construction. Kholongchhu is the first joint venture model project between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bhutan-hydropower-project-bags-prestigious-brunel-medal/story-YI65UJQGxp1e1DBRYj2HAN.html

21-10-2020||India||Goa CM accuses Independent MLA of land deal ‘setting’, he withdraws support||Independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar has announced withdrawal of support to the BJP government in Goa after a war of words with chief minister Pramod Sawant, who had publicly accused him of attempting to do ‘setting’ over the acquisition of land for establishing an IIT in Goa. Gaonkar had lent his support to the BJP-led government in Goa since 2017.Gaonkar, a first time MLA, elected as an independent from the Sanguem constituency, has in a press conference, termed the chief minister’s utterances as irresponsible and completely unwarranted. “I have supported this BJP government through thick and thin earlier when Manohar Parrikar was the chief minister and they didn’t have the majority and even after Pramod Sawant was elected the chief minister,” Gaonkar said. “I challenge the chief minister to prove that I have been involved in any kind of land deals or ‘setting’ as alleged by him,” Gaonkar said. On Monday evening, Sawant, while speaking to reporters had claimed that Gaonkar was involved in attempts to push through ‘land deals’ and do ‘setting’ in the name of the IIT. Also Read: Porn clip shared from Goa deputy chief minister’s phone, blames ‘miscreants’Gaonkar’s withdrawal of support to the BJP led government will have no impact on the Pramod Sawant led government which enjoys the support of 27 MLAs, a majority of whom were not elected on BJP tickets back in 2017, but have since switched allegiances. Of the three MLAs who helped the BJP form the government back in 2017, only one -- minister of art and culture Govind Gaude continues to support the government. Gaonkar had earlier said that since there was opposition to setting up of the IIT campus at Melaulim village in Sattari taluka, it would be just that the sites identified within the constituency he represents in Sanguem be reconsidered. A permanent campus for the Goa IIT was first proposed to be set up in Canacona in South Goa where it faced opposition and therefore three possible villages were considered at Sanguem for the project. However, after present chief minister Pramod Sawant took charge, the government decided to set up the campus in Melaulim on a stretch of land, which is forested and is not being surrendered by villagers who claim to live off the produce from the land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-accuses-independent-mla-of-land-deal-setting-he-withdraws-support/story-DhBvVpaRbY93pExQnYilgP.html

21-10-2020||India||‘Lost’ river that ran through Thar Desert 172,000 years ago found||Researchers have found the evidence of a “lost” river that ran through the central Thar Desert, near Bikaner, as early as 172 thousand years ago, and may have been a life-line to human populations enabling them to inhabit the region. The findings, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, represent the oldest directly dated phase of river activity at Nal Quarry in the central Thar Desert. The study by researchers from The Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, Anna University in Tamil Nadu, and IISER Kolkata indicates that Stone Age populations lived in a distinctly different Thar Desert landscape than we encounter today. This evidence indicates a river flowed with phases of activity dating to approximately up to 172 thousand years ago, nearby to Bikaner, Rajasthan, which is over 200 kilometres away from the nearest modern river. These findings predate evidence for activity in modern river courses across the Thar Desert as well as dried up course of the Ghaggar-Hakra River, the researchers said. The presence of a river running through the central Thar Desert would have offered a life-line to Paleolithic populations, and potentially an important corridor for migrations, they said. The researchers noted that the potential importance of ‘lost’ rivers for earlier inhabitants of the Thar Desert have been overlooked. “The Thar Desert has a rich prehistory, and we’ve been uncovering a wide range of evidence showing how Stone Age populations not only survived but thrived in these semi-arid landscapes,” said Jimbob Blinkhorn from The Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. “We know how important rivers can be to living in this region, but we have little detail on what river systems were like during key periods of prehistory,” Blinkhorn said. Studies of satellite imagery have shown a dense network of river channels crossing the Thar Desert, according to the researchers. “These studies can indicate where rivers and streams have flowed in the past, but they can’t tell us when,” explained Professor Hema Achyuthan of Anna University. “To demonstrate how old such channels are, we had to find evidence on the ground for river activity in the middle of the desert,” Achyuthan said. The team studied a deep deposit of river sands and gravels, which had been exposed by quarrying activity near the village of Nal. The researchers were able to document different phases of river activity by studying the different deposits. “We immediately saw evidence for a substantial and very active river system from the bottom of the fluvial deposits, which gradually decreased in power through time,” Achyuthan said. The researchers used a method called luminescence dating to understand when quartz grains in the river sands were buried. The results indicated that the strongest river activity at Nal occurred at approximately 172 and 140 thousand years ago, at a time when the monsoon was much weaker than today in the region. River activity continued at the site between 95 to 78 thousand years ago, after which only limited evidence for the presence of a river at the site, with evidence for a brief reactivation of the channel 26 thousand years ago, the study found. The river was flowing at its strongest during a phase of weak monsoon activity in the region, and may have been a life-line to human populations enabling them to inhabit the Thar Desert, the researchers said. The timeframe over which this river was active also overlaps with significant changes in human behaviour in the region, which have been linked with the earliest expansions of Homo sapiens from Africa into India, they said. “This river flowed at a critical timeframe for understanding human evolution in the Thar Desert, across South Asia and beyond,” said Blinkhorn. “This suggests a landscape in which the earliest members of our own species, Homo sapiens, first encountered the monsoons and crossed the Thar Desert may have been very different to the landscape we can see today,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lost-river-that-ran-through-thar-desert-172-000-years-ago-found/story-RCuBibrYEGcJsL9QmSC06N.html

The idea is to have a long-term plan instead of a knee-jerk reaction every time such a conflict occurs and prioritise the resources adequately. Funds under different schemes would be spent under the master plan,” Sharma said on Tuesday.The announcement came as rampaging elephants from neighbouring Jharkhand killed four persons in Mayurbhanj, Sundargarh and Angul districts taking the human casualty in man-elephant conflicts to 52 since April this year.In Mayurbhanj district, a 65-year-old woman was trampled to death while plucking flowers near her home on Tuesday morning. Subhadra Rana of Palashamundali village in Mayurbhanj district was chased by a tusker that had entered her village on Monday night. Two others in the village suffered injuries in the melee. On Sunday, 70-year-old Srikant Behera of Sarumula village in the same district, too, was trampled to death while returning home after watching a football match.Similarly, a farmer in Angul district was trampled to death by a tusker when he was in his paddy field. Farmer Bhaskar Bhukta was trying to drive an elephant away from his paddy field in Kamalpur village under Athamallik forest range Tuesday morning when the elephant charged at him, giving him little time to escape.On Sunday, 60-year-old Krishna Malar of Banki village under Bisra forest range of Sundargarh district came face to face with an elephant which trampled him to death. Villagers alleged that a herd of eight to 10 elephants has unleashed a reign of terror in the area.Also Read: Intense rain warning for Odisha, coastal Andhra and N-E IndiaIn 2019-20, Odisha recorded 115 human casualties and 132 injuries due to man-elephant conflict in a year, probably the highest ever in India. Retaliation by people with electric fences, live wire poaching, poaching for ivory etc have taken a heavy toll of elephant lives too.Wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty said to mitigate human-elephant conflict, the government has taken up several steps but sadly they have not been effective as more and more people are losing their lives, limbs, crops and properties. Also Read: Kangana Ranaut gets rape threat from Odisha lawyer, he claims account was hacked, deletes it: report“The first step should be to reduce resentment among losers, mostly farmers. In case of injuries caused to humans by elephants or other wild animals, the compassionate guideline provides for a measly amount even when people have become permanently handicapped. To keep elephants off farmlands and human habitations, several steps can be taken but they have to be community based practices. Safe methods of driving away elephants must be practiced and abiding by the Supreme Court order should be a must. Fire crackers or projectiles should not be allowed. Crops that are unpalatable to elephants must be farmed in highly vulnerable areas,” said Mohanty.He added that to prevent most of the human casualties, elephant herds and lone males are required to be tracked to anticipate conflicts and warn locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-pins-hopes-on-task-force-to-ease-man-animal-conflicts-4-trampled-to-death-in-3-days/story-DxSsA7ALnv87MteulzCqYI.html

Singh, along with Aam Aadmi Party MLA Harpal Singh Cheema and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sharan Jit Singh Dhillon met the governor to submit a resolution against three farm laws -The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 - passed by the Centre during the monsoon season of the Parliament last month. On being questioned about talks of president’s rule being imposed in the state, the chief minister said, “Punjab’s voice has reached the Governor, he’ll pass it on to the President... I don’t care about the President’s rule. You want to sack my govt? Sack my government, I don’t give a damn. I am doing this for farmers of the state and the country.”  #WATCH: "Punjab's voice has reached the Governor, he'll pass it on to President... I don't care about President's Rule.

21-10-2020||India||Should India review its relations with Taiwan?||China has reacted angrily to reports of possible talks between India and Taiwan on a trade deal at a time when there is a growing debate in New Delhi on whether the government should review its relationship with Taipei against the backdrop of the border standoff in Ladakh. India’s relations with Taiwan: India and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic relations but since 1995, both sides have maintained representative offices in each other’s capitals that function as de facto embassies. However, in a sign of the sensitivities involved, both offices don’t mention the word “Taiwan” in their names. Taiwan has the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi, and India has the India Taipei Association in Taipei. India has backed the “one-China principle”, whereby countries formally recognise and have diplomatic ties only with China, and this has found mention in bilateral documents. In mid-2018, when relations between India and China were on the mend following the military standoff at Doklam, state-run Air India changed the name of Taiwan to Chinese Taipei on its website, in line with similar moves by other airlines following protests from Beijing. At the time, the external affairs ministry spokesperson had said the decision was “entirely consistent with international norms and our own position on Taiwan since 1949”. Also Read: China’s shaky victory at United Nations elections reveals its great fall | AnalysisHowever, India and Taiwan recently posted highly regarded diplomats as de facto envoys in each other’s capitals, signalling a desire to give impetus to their ties. India named Gourangalal Das, an up-and-coming diplomat handling relations with the US, as its representative in Taipei. Taiwan appointed Baushuan Ger, who was director general of the department of East Asian and Pacific affairs and had served in the US, as its representative in India. At the time, Taiwan News portal reported “the relationship with India is likely to become one of Taiwan’s most important diplomatic priorities in the future”. China’s position: At the end of China’s civil war, the defeated nationalists made Taiwan their seat of government in 1949 and the island nation was known as “National China” before the name of “Republic of China” was chosen for it. The Communists, who established the People’s Republic of China on the mainland, have threatened to use force to reunify Taiwan. Against the backdrop of China’s increasingly aggressive actions in recent months, fears have grown among experts about a possible military action against Taiwan, largely because of the US ceding its dominant security role around the world, though it continues to have a strong military relationship with Taiwan. Taiwan’s defence minister Yen De-fa told Parliament this month the air force had scrambled 2,972 times against incursions by Chinese aircraft this year, reflecting the gravity of the threats. Beijing has also been angered by the Indian media’s coverage of Taiwan in recent weeks, with the Chinese embassy sending a letter to journalists with dos and don’ts for covering Taiwan’s national day on October 10. President Tsai Ing-wen and foreign minister Jaushieh Joseph Wu have both raised their profiles in India with a string of tweets highlighting the need for closer ties between the two sides. Also Read: China warns India on trading with Taiwan, slams US-Tibet govt-in-exile meetingWhat’s next: These developments have coincided with a debate in New Delhi for a review of India’s ties with Taiwan in areas ranging from trade to Taipei’s presence at meetings of the World Health Organization (WHO), especially against the backdrop of the border standoff with China. The government has maintained a studied silence on the matter, though experts believe India needs to proceed with caution. Sana Hashmi, Taiwan fellow at the Institute of International Relations at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said negotiating a possible trade deal with Taiwan wouldn’t violate India’s adherence to China’s one-China principle, since countries such as New Zealand and Singapore are benefiting from economic agreements with Taiwan. Taiwan, she said, can be a perfect fit for India in its efforts to de-couple from the Chinese economy. “Considering strong complementarities and changing political equations, this is the apt time for India and Taiwan to engage in serious trade negotiations,” she added. “India should de-hyphenate its Taiwan policy from its relations with China. Economic and cultural relations with Taiwan can go parallel with India-China ties. India is a sovereign country and Beijing should not dictate how New Delhi, or any country for that matter, manages its commercial relations,” she said. “With a non-accommodative stance on the border and sending a diktat to Indian media on how to report on Taiwan, China is interfering in India’s internal affairs,” Hashmi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-could-review-relationship-with-taiwan-amid-border-standoff-with-china/story-e1FUQf9drB948CdpSWg1ZO.html

She also posted a video of a farmer alleging corruption in crop procurement at the Mohammadi Khiri mandi.“The BJP government is holding a government Khat Sammelan on the bills, which are against the interest of the farmers, but is not listening to the pain of the farmers. In almost all places in UP, farmers are forced to sell their paddy at Rs 1,000 to 1,100 per quintal Rs 800 less than the Rs 1,868 per quintal MSP,” she tweeted (roughly translated from Hindi).In the following tweet, she said, “This is when the MSP is guaranteed. Imagine what will happen when the MSP guarantee is removed.”This comes amid the protests against the recently enacted farm laws by opposition parties and farmers’ organisations at several places across the country. The opposition has alleged that the new farm laws do not guarantee MSP for the farmers.The BJP, on the other hand, has said that it is committed to continuing the MSP.Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last week termed the recent agriculture sector reforms “a very important step in improving the agriculture sector of the country and increasing the income of farmers” and assured that MSP and government procurement would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-farmers-forced-to-sell-crops-at-less-than-msp-even-now-priyanka-gandhi/story-r9Dc831FBuwhhTxRJSPceN.html

21-10-2020||India||Centre may review fare of repatriation flights||The Centre may review the pricing policy for repatriation flights being operated by local carriers to bring back Indians stranded abroad after several lawmakers expressed concern that the passengers were being charged exorbitant fares, people familiar with the situation said. Under the Vande Bharat Mission, which started on May 6, more than 2.2 million passengers have been flown home. The Air India group alone has operated a total of 3,588 flights carrying 590,000 passengers from different locations until October 19. Regular international flights have been suspended since March 22 because of Covid-19. The government has also created temporary travel bubbles, or reciprocal arrangements with other countries, under the Vande Bharat Mission. India has put in place such arrangements with 13 countries, including France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States. Private carriers, too, have been allowed to fly special flights in these air bubbles. At a recent interaction with lawmakers, civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola also heard complaints related to refund of fares and cancellation charges apart from exorbitant fares, the people cited above said. Leaders including the Revolutionary Socialist Party’s NK Premachandran pointed out that for flights between the Gulf region and Kerala, passengers were being charged six to eight times the peak season fares. The civil aviation ministry also faced several complaints over delays in the refund of tickets and imposition of cancellation fees. Lawmakers pointed out that many passengers had not received full refunds even after the Supreme Court order.

21-10-2020||India||Very large portion of Covid-19 vaccines likely to be manufactured in India: Gates Foundation CEO||A very large portion of Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be manufactured in India through the country’s strong and robust private sector partners, said Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman.In an interview to PTI, Suzman noted that India is doing everything it can right now with the resources at hand to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.“I think India is doing everything it can right now with the resources at hand, but we are all hopeful that next year as some of these vaccines should come out...and our expectation is that a very large portion of these are likely to be manufactured in India through the strong and robust Indian private sector partners and then that will be the key area to focus on in the next phase of the Covid pandemic,” he said.He underlined the need to have equitable global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.“We believe passionately that there needs to be equitable global distribution, so everything we are doing is to make sure that the developing countries will be able to have access at the same time and at the same volumes as wealthy countries, because for a global pandemic that is essential, but then the exact pacing and distribution within the countries is going to depend on national guidelines with some of the global recommendations,” he said.He said the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has been working at multiple levels to combat Covid-19.“We have been providing support, so called upstream, or research and development. We work with this organization, CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, which has been a leading partner in investing in the potential vaccines. We have developed something called a therapeutic accelerator which has raised over $125 million to help find treatments that are going to be effective against Covid,” he said.He said the foundation has been working to support a lot of work around diagnostics as well. “And in that context, we are strong supporters of this global effort, which India is part of, called COVAX, which is a multilateral initiative to procure vaccines at scale and then distribute them through the GAVI vaccine alliance to countries including India,” Suzman added.“And last but not least, we have also been directly supporting some specific investments, again some with Indian partners like Serum Institute of India and GAVI around particular vaccines which are very promising in order to make sure many of the products are being manufactured in real time and even ahead of regulatory approval for potential distribution because we want to make sure that the distribution goes to developing countries at the same time as rich countries, that you don’t have the time lag with rich countries having bought up early available market, which have been the risk,” he said.He said the biggest learning from the pandemic is that at all levels, global, regional, national, there needs to be a permanent infrastructure in place that is prepared and ready to go which will keep the world much better prepared for the next one, which will come.“It is not as if the pandemic was really that much of a surprise, maybe the scale, the speed and the exact nature of the pathogen could not have been predicted but as Bill Gates and others have been warning for years, this has been one of the most likely global crises,” he said.“But we know that unknown pathogens have the potential to come in and wreak havoc so we should never again be caught flat footed. We need a global infrastructure, regional infrastructure and national infrastructure and right down to the community health level,” he added.Responding to a question on how the Grand Challenges platform is relevant for the current pandemic situation, he said some of the networks and groups of scientists that joined the Grand Challenges are working hard on many aspects of Covid-19.“They also provided the platform that looks at related issues which is empowering scientific leadership in developing countries, particularly women, to think about what the long-term issues of the future are going to be or the present and the future, including but beyond Covid-19,” he said.Grand Challenges India was set up as a partnership of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012, and Wellcome also joined the partnership. Grand Challenges India works across a range of health and developmental priorities ranging from agriculture, nutrition, sanitation, maternal and child health to infectious diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-large-portion-of-covid-19-vaccines-likely-to-be-manufactured-in-india-gates-foundation-ceo/story-BKMEGjFexnyFuCXLeH9QSL.html

The report said that India had the highest burden of infant deaths due to air pollution followed by Nigeria (67,900), Pakistan (56,500), Ethiopia (22,900), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (1,200).Also Read: India recorded highest air pollution exposure globally in 2019: ReportIt is based on a growing body of research and evidence that suggests mothers’ exposure to polluted air during pregnancy is linked to increased risks to infants weighing under 2,500 grams at birth or those born before 37 weeks of gestation, as opposed to 38 to 40 weeks. Low weight and premature birth are linked to a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea, other serious infections as well as brain damage and blood disorders, jaundice that can be potentially fatal.“Although the biological reasons for this linkage are not fully known, it is thought that air pollution may affect a pregnant woman, her developing foetus, or both through pathways similar to those of tobacco smoking, which is a well-known risk factor for low birth weight and preterm birth,” the report said.Kalpana Balakrishnan, the director of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health, said around 116,000 infant deaths can be prevented if air quality is as per the World Health Organisation’s standards. “That is how the attributable burden is identified. But the number seems large because population risks are often not perceivable because they have tiny risk on an individual level. For example, smoking, anaemia or maternal nutrition are all individual risks that can be dealt with on an individual level. But when it comes to air pollution, a very large population is at risk because of high overall exposure. India also has an underlying prevalence of low birth weight which also makes the risk pronounced.”Balakrishnan said the evidence from over 70 studies, including that of ICMR in India, show that exposures to household and ambient air pollution are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. “India has a long history of addressing multiple risk factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes including maternal nutrition, anaemia, access to antenatal care, to name a few.”Balakrishnan said the recent evidence shows that air pollution must be included alongside these risk factors to address the burden of low birth weight and preterm births. Clean household energy initiatives offer some strategic near-term opportunities that can be directed at these vulnerable groups, Balakrishnan added. “Results from on-going randomised control trials In India are expected to strengthen the case for such interventions.”Balakrishnan said addressing the impacts of air pollution on adverse pregnancy outcomes and newborn health is important for low- and middle-income countries. “...[it is] not only because of the high prevalence of low birth weight, preterm birth, and child growth deficits but because it allows the design of strategic interventions that can be directed at these vulnerable groups.”Of all neonatal deaths attributable to air pollution globally, household air pollution accounted for about 64% of them. The rest were due to outdoor air pollution. The highest percentage of deaths attributable to household air pollution (80%) was estimated to be in the sub-Saharan region. The lowest was in high-income regions (less than 2%).Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India last year, making air pollution the largest risk factor for deaths among all health risks.Based on experience from the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak between 2002 and 2004, the report said air pollution could lead to both a higher number of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Pallavi Pant, a scientist at Health Effects Institute, said the evidence on the link between air pollution and Covid-19 is rapidly growing. “It is clear that long-term exposure to air pollution can cause many of the health conditions associated with increased vulnerability to Covid-19 such as diabetes and chronic heart and lung diseases. Evidence increasingly suggests that people living in areas with high air pollution are likely to experience more severe outcomes from Covid 19,” said Pant. “Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, India carried a heavy burden of chronic respiratory and other diseases and India has also experienced high exposures for a long time. Exposures to air pollution have been shown to affect the human body’s immune defence making an individual more susceptible to respiratory infections such as pneumonia.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-100-000-infants-in-india-did-not-survive-a-month-due-to-severe-air-pollution-in-2019-report/story-EaUP0546eW2ghlWrfominO.html

A total of 1,397 people have died due to Covid-19 since the first case was detected in the union territory in March. Most of the deaths were reported from summer capital Srinagar which accounted for 335 casualties followed by the winter capital Jammu where 239 people have died. Currently, there are only 8,124 active cases of Covid-19.Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, Head Community Medicine, Government Medical College Srinagar said the fight against Covd-19 is a continuous process and those susceptible are at risk of getting infected. “It’s obvious cases will recover and some percentage would remain active at a given point of time,” he said.As against a daily average of 1,245 cases of Covid-19, October has recorded slightly more than half of that which is around 699 cases per day till date, according to official figures.In terms of fatalities also, the average daily deaths in October have been around 11 as against 16 in September. A total of 478 people died of Covid-19 in September, while 207 have died this month till October 19.However, health experts warned against complacency as many people with Covid-19 are being treated in their homes instead of hospitals. “Less patients are coming to hospitals now as many are receiving treatment at their homes and are recovering. The cases are on decline but people should not violate SoPs,” said a senior doctor posted at Chest Disease Hospital Srinagar. “With winter around the corner the people need to take more precautions to avoid the disease.”Dr Javaid Malik, Professor and Head of Department Chest Medicine SKIMS Medical College Bemina also cautioned people against lowering their guard. “If people follow the SoPs the cases will come down but if they start violating norms the cases can go up again. So everybody should be cautious about Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-fights-back-to-halve-active-covid-19-cases-in-3-weeks/story-X54J2fxLCXGkfHevz0LFHP.html

The court has raised the cap on the number of puja committee members who can enter the pandal and also allowed dhakis (drummers) to enter the premises. More members, including local residents, can now enter the pandals to take part in the puja and the rituals. Earlier, the court had permitted the entry of 15-25 committee members and has now set the limit at 45 members for big puja pandals at a time. The committees are required to prepare a list of 60 names in advance. The names can be changed every day, court said and added that in case of small pujas the list would contain only 15 names and not more than 10 members would be allowed to enter at a time. The list can change every day and has to be prepared by 8 am. The ruling comes following a review petition filed by prominent puja organisers in Kolkata on Tuesday that cited “practical problems” in executing the court’s order. “The applicants state that this court may appreciate that the directions as given in the order dated October 19, may not be workable in view of the variable in-situ issues which the individual organisers are required to address whole holding the Durga Puja in the locality,” the petition stated, adding that Kolkata’s Durga Puja has been nominated for UNESCO’s 2020 list. “There are some practical problems as nearly 80% of the pujas in Kolkata are held in lanes which are not more than 18 – 24 feet wide. If they put up barricades, there would be no space left for visitors to pass through and people will virtually have to go back without seeing the puja,” Saswata Basu, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab, had said. The court had on Monday banned the entry of visitors inside the pandals virtually declaring them as ‘no entry zones’ to prevent any gatherings that may lead to a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as doctors have warned. Though Durga Puja begins on Thursday, pandal hopping has already started in the state. Monday’s ruling was welcomed by doctors. They described it as “historic” said that if clubs and puja committees adhere to the directive the Covid-19 transmission would definitely be restricted to a certain level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-high-court-partially-eases-order-declaring-durga-puja-pandals-no-entry-zones/story-rxZwduPupOYb4AEir3VkLP.html

The comment was made by junior home minister G Kishan Reddy who was answering to the question whether any of the central agencies have reported any case of love jihad from the southern state during the last two years.“Article 25 of the Constitution provides for the freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health. Various courts have upheld this view including the Kerala High Court,” G Kishan Reddy had said.Social media users dug up some old tweets of Sharma where she was seen making fun of women, politicians and women politicians. The tweets date back to 2012 to 2014, before she became NCW chairperson. In August 2015, Rekha Sharma was appointed the NCW chief and prior to that she was the BJP district secretary and media in-charge in Haryana.Following the Twitter outrage, Rekha Sharma has now protected her Twitter account. Her old tweets are not accessible anymore. ‘Love jihad’ is a term popularised by radical Hindu groups to describe what they believe is an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to force or trick Hindu women into conversion and marriage. The purported motives include expanding India’s Muslim population and aiding the Islamic State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-ncw-chief-rekha-sharma-came-under-twitter-fire/story-zj82vLViKNuQ9R9ysaCKLK.html

21-10-2020||India||India recorded highest air pollution exposure globally in 2019: Report||India recorded the highest annual average PM 2.5 concentration exposure in the world last year, according to the State of Global Air 2020 (SOGA 2020) report released on Wednesday. India was followed by Nepal, Niger, Qatar and Nigeria in high PM 2.5 exposures. This means people in India are exposed to the highest PM 2.5 concentrations globally.Also Read: India must wage an immediate, unified war against pollutionThe report also said that India has been recording an increase in PM 2.5 pollution since 2010 contrary to Centre’s claims that annual air pollution levels in the country are coming down. Out of the 20 most populous countries, 14 have recorded a gradual improvement in air quality but India, Bangladesh, Niger, Pakistan and Japan are among those that have recorded a modest increase in air pollution levels.SOGA, released by US-based Health Effects Institute and Global Burden of Disease (GBD), uses both data from ground monitors and satellite to make their assessments. To estimate the annual average PM2.5 exposure, or concentrations, GBD scientists link the concentrations in each block (they divide the globe in blocks or grids) with the number of people living within each block to produce a population weighted annual average concentration.Out of 87 health risk factors based on total number of deaths caused in 2019 assessed by the team, air pollution has the fourth highest risk globally preceded by high systolic blood pressure, tobacco and dietary risks. But in India, air pollution is the highest risk factor because of the huge burden of premature deaths it contributes to.India is also among the top ten countries with highest ozone (O3) exposure in 2019. Qatar recorded the highest O3 exposure followed by Nepal and India. Among the 20 most populous countries, India recorded the highest increase (17%) in O3 concentrations in the past ten years.On average, global exposure to ozone increased from about 47.3 parts per billion (ppb) in 2010 to 49.5 ppb in 2019. O3 is a major respiratory irritant which is not released directly into the air but is formed in a complex chemical interaction between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. NOx is emitted from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) in motor vehicles, power plants, industrial boilers, and home heating systems. Volatile organic compounds are also emitted by motor vehicles, as well as by oil and gas extraction and processing and other industrial activities.The only silver lining for India though is that it has managed to reduce the number of people exposed to household air pollution. China reduced the percentage of its population exposed to household air pollution from 54% to 36%, while India reduced its percentage from 73% to 61% over the decade.Since 2010, over 50 million fewer people have been exposed to household air pollution. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG programme and other schemes have helped to dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially for rural households, Health Effects Institute said in a statement.“At this time, the data indicates that there was a modest increase in outdoor PM2.5 levels In India over the last decade. We know from experience elsewhere that the air pollution problem is unlikely to be solved in the short-term. With the National Clean Air Programme and introduction of BS-VI emission standards, India has begun to take steps towards improving air quality and it is critical that the efforts are continued and expanded over the next few years in order to see improvements in air quality. This will require concerted action at both at the national and state and local levels,” said Pallavi Pant, scientist at Health Effects Institute.“Given the high exposure and staggering health burden of air pollution, India must show urgency and recognise air pollution as a regional-scale problem. The National Clean Air Program should be expanded beyond the urban centres with an air-shed approach prioritising the local and regional mitigation measures to achieve clean air goals for India,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor, IIT Delhi.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar has said in various platforms that Delhi’s air has improved significantly since 2016 while Central Pollution Control Board’s reports suggest that air pollution in India is towards a decline. Javadekar had said in the Lok Sabha last year that the government would resolve the toxic air pollution problem in Delhi in less than 15 years—the time Beijing took to curb a similar problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-recorded-highest-air-pollution-exposure-globally-in-2019-report/story-oOH8OTQEf276Sy0vrYMXyH.html

They are also engaged in Covid duties. So a special campaign for their immunisation at their doorsteps has been arranged,” said Dr Jaiswal who is also the Mission Director of NHM.He added that with the immunisation, the antibody test against Covid-19 was also done simultaneously.Medical officer Dr Arpita Sinha said that keeping in mind that comorbidity could be more dangerous if affected with Covid, especially among this section of people, these special health camps were being organised. “Hence, two vaccines are being administered among the door-to-door garbage cleaning workers of the AMC, besides health check-up for non-communicable disease profile.”The AMC workers have thanked the organisers for the initiative.Babul Das, who is engaged with garbage collection since 1995, said that he participated in such a camp for the first time in his career on Tuesday. “Every moment, there is life risk in my job; not only for me, but my family members as well. The risk factor has increased several fold during the ongoing pandemic. So the immunisation camp is of great benefit,” he said.Another worker Anil Chandra Sarkar appreciated the camp, during which he was immunised against two potentially fatal diseases and got a health card.The AMC workers will also get free health check-ups, besides soap, sanitisers, masks and other safety gear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agartala-civic-body-holds-screening-immunisation-drive-for-its-sanitation-workers/story-p6c1avy3X0UlBeImzisLIN.html

Over 67 lakh people have recovered from the infection so far. Since the last week of September, Covid-19 cases on Oxygen support (in ICUs, ventilation, oxygen-supported beds) have shown a significant decrease, the ministry said adding that this trend aligns with the national decline of active cases to less than 10 per cent of the total cases.“The Centre’s focussed and comprehensive strategies have resulted in enhanced medical infrastructure, use of oxygen as part of the Standard Treatment Protocol for clinical management of patients, and extensive arrangements of oxygen supply across the country,” the ministry said.“There was no shortage of medical oxygen in last 10 months and won’t be any in future also. However, we have always believe in proactive and graded response to the pandemic and therefore taken proactive steps to augment the oxygen supply,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday, announcing the installation of oxygen generation plants in 246 hospitals in the country.Maharashtra, Karnataka, Keralam West bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh continue to be the worst-hit states accounting for 64 per cent of the total active cases.

As of now, under the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), digital ID is not mandatory and will not become so in future, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. “The NDHM, as it exists today, does not make a digital ID or health ID mandatory to receive service under the digital ecosystem that NDHM is creating.

21-10-2020||India||Assure procurement of crops at MSP by state govt if Centre falters, demands SAD||Stressing that a lot still needs to be done to secure the future of Punjab’s farmers, the Shiromani Akali Dal(SAD) on Tuesday sought an assurance from chief minister Amarinder Singh that the state government will procure crops at Minimum Support Price(MSP)even if the Centre falters.The party’s statement has come in the wake of the State Assembly passing four Bills and adopting a resolution against the Centre’s contentious farm laws. The SAD and the Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) backed the Bills in the assembly while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has two MLAs in the state, stayed away from the special session called against the farm laws.Commenting on the passage of the Bills, SAD leaders claimed that the Congress government brought these after an ultimatum by farmers.“Still a lot needs to be done to secure the future of Punjab farmers,” said SAD legislature party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon.The SAD leaders said their legislators were ready to resign en masse to ensure that the Centre gives the state its due. “The fight to secure justice for the ‘kisan’, ‘khet mazdoor’ and ‘arhtiyas’ (farmers, farm labourers and commission agents) as well as three crore Punjabis has just started,” Dhillon added. “Now, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh must give a categorical assurance that the state government will procure all crops, including wheat, paddy, cotton, and maize, at the minimum support price (MSP) if the Centre defaults on the same,” Dhillon said. Dhillon, along with senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, said, “It is now clear that the Congress government, which was running away from calling a special session, was forced to do so due to an ultimatum served on it by farmers.”Majithia said even as all parties presented a united stand in the fight against the Centre, it was unfortunate that the Congress government did not share the proposed Bills with all stakeholders, including farmers and legislators before the House was convened. He said it would have been better had the government passed a Bill under the agriculture head by moving to make the entire state a single principal market yard to negate the implementation of the Centre’s farm laws. “Any such Bill would have received both the Governor’s as well as the Presidential nod for being a state subject. A huge opportunity has been missed,” Majithia claimed. Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema, whose party AAP had backed the Bills, later in a statement said, “The Punjab government is fooling people of the state”. He said they had been demanding that copies of the Bills to be brought by the government in the assembly should be given to legislators in advance but since these were tabled at the last moment, they did not have enough time to go through these. Cheema said after the Assembly proceedings for the day got over, they sought opinion about the state Bills from farmer leaders, legal experts and intellectuals. He said the question which arose was “can any state government negate the laws passed by Parliament”, and if not, then why is the state government fooling people, he asked. Meanwhile, farmers organisations decided to meet on Wednesday to chalk out the future course of action. Representatives of 30 farmers’ organisations will be meeting to decide the future course of action, Darshan Pal, member of their coordination committee told PTI. On the bills passed by the state Assembly, he said, “It remains to be seen whether the governor will give approval to the Bills passed by the state assembly.” He said while they would like the Union government to repeal or amend the farm laws, it was heartening that entire Punjab, including its people, political leaders and farmers were speaking in one voice. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday again appealed to farmers to call off their “rail roko” agitation to allow the transportation of coal, urea and foodgrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assure-procurement-of-crops-at-msp-by-state-govt-if-centre-falters-demands-sad/story-UYHvMk4F27eIakBpfnkapM.html
21-10-2020||India||Principle of self-determination continues to be deliberately misused by particular delegation: India slams Pak at UN||In a thinly-veiled reference to Pakistan, India said the principle of self-determination continues to be “deliberately misinterpreted and misused” by a particular nation, even though it was not established by the United Nations(UN) to be used as a justification for undermining the territorial integrity of any member state.“Since the principle of self-determination, as considered on the agreed agenda of this committee, continues to be deliberately misinterpreted and misused by a particular delegation, it is pertinent to highlight once again that the United Nations has established the principle as a vehicle for the worthy cause of decolonization of the 17 Non Self-Governing Territories (NSGTs) on the agenda of this committee, and not as a justification for undermining the territorial integrity of any member state,” India said in a statement on ‘NSGTs and decolonization.’ India said it strongly believes that pursuing a pragmatic approach towards decolonization would surely lead to fulfilment of legitimate wishes of the people of NSGTs. “We must also strive to enhance cooperation with international agencies and actors and channelize resources for the 17 NSGTs.This would surely enable them to build capacities in their just and noble quest towards achieving long cherished goals,” the statement said. India said that as a former colony, it has always been in the forefront of the struggle against colonialism and apartheid since its own independence over seven decades ago. Since the creation of the UN, more than 80 former colonies have gained their independence and joined the family. “However, the process of decolonization that began with our own independence remains unfinished,” it said on Tuesday. In 2011, the General Assembly had proclaimed the current decade, 2011-2020, as the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, a period which is coming to an end this year. India noted that there still remain 17 NSGTs, which are in various stages of the decolonization process on the agenda of this committee. “We need to step up our efforts to conclude this long-drawn process,” the Indian side added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/principle-of-self-determination-continues-to-be-deliberately-misused-by-particular-delegation-india-slams-pak-at-un/story-WTG6nVsV9BOAUUI18zsAhO.html

However, there is no data or evidence to show that influenza vaccine will help. We know that in influenza vaccine the strain changes every year. It is highly unlikely that the vaccine will benefit in the treatment Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Bhargava.Influenza viruses are of four types: A, B, C and D. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal diseases.According to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC), influenza A viruses are known to cause flu pandemics. Usually, Influenza type C infections cause mild illness and are not known to cause human flu epidemics. Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to cause illness among humans.Also Read: Covid-19: FELUDA test likely to hit the market within the month“Flu-like symptoms can be caused by several viruses, including the influenza virus, rhinovirus, and even some coronaviruses other than Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. However, the influenza viruses and coronaviruses belong to two different families. So far, there is no evidence that the flu shot might help against Covid-19. But, I have been receiving a lot of requests from the public because of growing fear and panic about the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr GC Khilnani, a former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi.Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (H1 through H18 and N1 through N11, respectively).Current subtypes of influenza A viruses that routinely circulate in humans include A(H1N1) and A(H3N2).Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but instead are further classified into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.Also Read: Indian trials on multiple Covid-19 drugs make progress, have Atmanirbhar Bharat tilt“One influenza A (H1N1), one influenza A (H3N2), and one or two influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccine) are included in each season’s influenza vaccines… Seasonal flu vaccines do not protect against influenza C or D viruses. Flu vaccines will not protect against infection and illness caused by other viruses that also can cause influenza-like symptoms,” said CDC.Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the family Coronaviridae, which envelop viruses that possess extraordinarily large single-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid) genomes. According to a paper published in the International journal of biological sciences, titled, Sars-CoV-2, An Emerging Coronavirus that Causes a Global Threat, “Currently, at least seven coronavirus species are known to cause diseases in humans. The viruses of 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 only cause common cold symptoms, which are mild. Severe illness can be caused by the remaining three viruses, namely Sars-CoV, which resulted in the outbreak of Sars in 2002 and 2003 3,4; the coronaviruses that are responsible the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers-CoV), which emerged in 2012 and remains in the circulation in camels 7; and Sars-CoV-2, the viruses emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan in central China... “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/d-g-icmr-s-influenza-virus-from-same-family-as-sars-cov-2-comment-incorrect/story-GVhB5dzaNLW7kULMnrRjGL.html
21-10-2020||India||After Bihar Assembly Election 2020, another reshuffle in Congress on the cards||Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to execute another organisational reshuffle soon after the assembly elections in Bihar, introducing some new faces in different wings of the party, including the all-important communications department, people familiar with the development said. A Congress functionary said on the condition of anonymity that there are two vacancies as far as in-charges of states are concerned. While Shaktisinh Gohil is in charge of Bihar and Delhi, Dinesh Gundu Rao holds the charge of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa. “Delhi and Goa are likely to have new in-charges,” he added. In September this year, the Congress president announced major organisational changes, revamping the party’s highest decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), and removing some key faces, including senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge, as general secretaries. Also Read: Chirag Paswan’s LJP to fight on 137 seats, releases 3rd list of candidatesShe also formed a five-member special team that will help her in day-to-day matters and reconstituted the party’s Central Election Authority, which will conduct organisational polls to elect a new party president. The reshuffle came against the backdrop of 23 Congress leaders, including four CWC members (Azad, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik and Jitin Prasada), writing to Gandhi on August 7, calling for full-time leadership and an introspection behind the “steady decline” of the 135-year-old organisation while outlining an 11-point action plan. The functionary quoted above said the head of the party’s Kisan cell, Nana Patole, is the Maharashtra assembly speaker, OBC (Other Backward Classes) department chairman Tamradhwaj Sahu is the home minister in Chhattisgarh. Also, Scheduled Caste department head Nitin Raut is the energy minister in Maharashtra. Surjewala, who is also the chairman of the party’s communications department, has been elevated as a general secretary and given the charge of Karnataka. “All these vacancies will be filled soon,” said the functionary. He said the move to revamp the central election committee (CEC), a panel that finalises the Congress candidates for any election, was deferred due to the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar. “This too will be taken up after the Bihar polls,” he added. Also Read: PM Modi has abdicated his responsibility in tackling Covid-19 pandemic: Sonia GandhiThe committee to help Sonia Gandhi in organisational and operational affairs, comprised AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik and Randeep Singh Surjewala, the party’s chief spokesperson. Wasnik was one of signatories of the letter. The five-member CEA will be headed by Madhusudan Mistry and the members are Rajesh Mishra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani and Arvinder Singh Lovely, another letter-writer. The newly inducted general secretaries include Surjewala (Karnataka), Jitendra Singh (Assam) and Tariq Anwar (Kerala and Lakshadweep). The new in-charges were Dinesh Gundu Rao (Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa), Manickam Tagore (Telangana), Vivek Bansal (Haryana), Pawan Kumar Bansal (administration), Rajeev Shukla (Himachal Pradesh), HK Patil (Maharashtra), Devendra Yadav (Uttarakhand), Manish Chatrath (Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya), Bhakta Charan Das (Mizoram and Manipur), and Kuljit Singh Nagra (Sikkim, Nagaland and Tripura). Those who were retained as general secretaries are Harish Rawat (Punjab), Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (Uttar Pradesh), Oommen Chandy (Andhra Pradesh), Ajay Maken (Rajasthan) and KC Venugopal (Organisation). Among the in-charges retained were RPN Singh (Jharkhand), Rajani Patil (Jammu and Kashmir), PL Punia (Chhattisgarh), Shaktisinh Gohil (Bihar and Delhi) and Rajeev Satav (Gujarat, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu). The functionary further said the Congress high command will also shift its focus on states, especially those going to polls in next two years. Many state units will have new chiefs, he added. Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat holds a ministerial position in the Shiv Sena-led coalition government in the state. Odisha Congress chief Niranjan Patnaik had offered to step down from the post soon after the Lok Sabha elections but was asked to stay put. The Congress leadership had also rejected the resignation offer of the party’s Punjab unit chief Sunil Kumar Jakhar. Last month, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury was named the party chief in West Bengal, which will be going to polls in April-May next year. Along with West Bengal, assembly elections will be held in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. In 2022, state elections are due in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. The mega team of 56 All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretaries will also see a major restructuring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-bihar-assembly-election-2020-another-reshuffle-in-congress-on-the-cards/story-CXBcZUE723A2Q9ljgp9HVI.html
21-10-2020||India||Covid-19: FELUDA test likely to hit the market within the month||India’s first indigenously developed test for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) based on the genetic editing tool CRISPR/Cas-9 is likely to hit the market within the month, confirmed an official from the science ministry. The test, which was developed by researchers from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, will be marketed by Tata Sons. The device had received the approval from the Drug Controller General of India last month. It was found to have high sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%, meaning it can accurately detect both positive and negative cases up to 96 or 98% of the time. Also read: Indian trials on multiple Covid-19 drugs make progress, have Atmanirbhar Bharat tiltAt least two other tests developed by institute from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research have been submitted for approval and one other test has just been validated on clinical samples. The cost-effective and quicker test has been named after the fictional Bengali detective Feluda, who stars in series of novels by filmmaker Satyajit Ray. It is also an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay. The test barcodes the Cas9 protein – a component of the CRISPR gene editing system – to interact specifically with the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. This complex of Cas9 and CoV2 is then applied on a paper-strip test, which gives the result in the form of two lines for a positive and a single line for a negative just like the home pregnancy test. As the test uses a lateral flow paper-strip for giving a negative or positive result, it can be interpreted visually by anyone and does not require trained personnel. For the new test, samples are collected using a throat and nasal swab just the way it is done for RT-PCR tests. But once the RNA is extracted from the swab, testing the sample will be faster. The thermocycler machines used to process the samples is about 100 times cheaper than the traditional RT-PCR machines and are much readily available in smaller laboratories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-feluda-test-likely-to-hit-the-market-within-the-month/story-UO2jZyhnuXBeyMHcAOFp8I.html

21-10-2020||India||Eye on China, govt to bar universities from pacts with India’s neighbours||The education ministry, after consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs, is considering making it mandatory for Indian universities to obtain prior permission from the government before signing any memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with educational institutions of countries that share land borders with India.The proposal was mooted by the education ministry after an August 9 review of China-funded Confucius Centres attached to universities here and also MoUs signed between Indian and Chinese universities. The Confucius program is financed by the Office of Chinese Language Council International which has been linked to China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD) now headed by President Xi Jinping. Ostensibly meant to teach Chinese language and culture, the Confucius program has been accused of promoting China’s viewpoint and act as a vehicle for propaganda. Several countries including Australia and the US have previously had issues with the institutes.The Confucius Institute had tied up with seven universities in India: Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University has an MoU; and the centres attached to the University of Mumbai and the School of Chinese Language, Ballygunge, Kolkatta are already active. As of April 1, 54 MoUs have been signed between Indian and Chinese educational institutions including for the exchange of students and faculty.While the ministry of external affairs was initially hesitant in mandating approvals for such partnerships with institutions from friendly countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal that share land borders with India, HT learns that South Block now has no objections to the education ministry’s plan. “ We have discussed the matter with the education ministry. They will now have to implement this through an order,” said a senior South Block official who asked not to be named.This is a change from the past where universities signed MoUs with institutions in foreign countries without informing either the education or foreign ministries . The education ministry has also asked both the Mumbai University and Kolkata School of Chinese Languages to submit documentation pertaining to their partnership and details of their exchange activities with Confucius Headquarters in China for review.JNU has signed 12 MoUs with Chinese universities but there has been no activity on eight of the agreements. IIT Kharagpur has signed four MoUs, IIT Bombay has two, IIT Madras has four, IIT Delhi has four, IIT Guwahati has five, IIT Gandhinagar has one, IIT Roorkee has two and IIT Bhubaneswar has three MoUs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-china-govt-to-bar-universities-from-pacts-with-india-s-neighbours/story-VW3fbasiWN2FikFSrr1fEJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Intense rain warning for Odisha, coastal Andhra and N-E India||A low-pressure area has developed over the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, which is likely to bring widespread and intense rainfall to coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP), Rayalaseema, Telangana and Odisha during the next three days and over Gangetic West Bengal and north-east India between Thursday and Saturday (October 22 to 24).The low-pressure area is likely to become more marked and move north-westwards during the next 48 hours and then north and north-eastwards over the next three days. Also read: Andhra CM asks officials to send speed boats for relief ops Under the influence of this weather system, widespread and heavy rainfall is likely over coastal AP, Rayalaseema, Telangana and Odisha during the next three days; over Gangetic West Bengal on Thursday (October 22) and over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on Friday and Saturday (October 23 and 24), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its Tuesday bulletin.The monsoon withdrawal line is passing along Faizabad, Fatehpur, Nowgong, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Vidyanagar and Porbandar. Weather conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal of monsoon from the remaining parts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Jharkhand, the rest of Madhya Pradesh (MP), the northern parts of Chhattisgarh, the rest of Gujarat and north Arabian Sea, parts of central Arabian Sea and the northern parts of Maharashtra during the next two-three days.Fishermen are advised not to venture into the central Bay of Bengal until Thursday (October 22), into the north Bay of Bengal between Thursday and Saturday (October 22 to 24); along and off northern AP and southern Odisha coasts on Wednesday and Thursday (October 21 and 22); along and off northern Odisha-West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between Thursday and Saturday (October 22 to 24).“North-easterly winds will start picking up. Rainfall has also reduced significantly over central India and parts of UP and Bihar. We are not expecting a complete withdrawal of monsoon immediately, as the low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal is likely to bring intense rainfall to peninsular and north-east India,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre (NWFC). “In north-west India, we are expecting minimum temperatures to dip further amid dry winds,” she added.IMD had declared the end of monsoon season on September 30. During the post-monsoon season -- between October 1 and 20 -- the country has recorded 8% of excess rainfall. Widespread and heavy rainfall is also likely over Karnataka during the next two-three days; over Tamil Nadu (TN), Puducherry and Karaikal during the next two days and over Kerala and Mahe during the next 24 hours.A change in wind direction is also likely over north-west India in the next couple of days, according to the regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC). On Monday, moderate winds of up to 16 kilometres per hour (kmph) were recorded. The wind aided in dispersion of pollutants. North-westerly wind is blowing over western UP, Haryana and Punjab, where stubble burning is in progress. On Tuesday, wind speed had reduced to around 10 kmph. “Usually, wind speed reduces temporarily because of a change in direction. At present, the direction is north-westerly. However, we are expecting an easterly to south-easterly change in wind direction in the next couple of days, which may bring temporary relief from the impact of stubble fires,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, RWFC.Air quality index (AQI) in Delhi may worsen to the “very poor” category on Wednesday, according to the air quality early warning system under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES).AQI between 301 and 400 is considered to be in the very poor category.The ventilation index was around 15,000 square (sq) metres (m) per second on Tuesday. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq m per second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.Some parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains, including Varanasi, Muzaffarnagar, Moradabad and Ballabgarh, also recorded very poor category AQI on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intense-rain-warning-for-odisha-coastal-andhra-and-n-e-india/story-Ei0fTomduU16lPl8j3D9eM.html
21-10-2020||India||Naga groups slam NSCN (IM) on peace talks, back political solution||Against the backdrop of Nagaland government and civil society urging negotiating groups in the Naga peace talks to come together towards achieving ‘One Solution for One People’, the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs), who have been engaged in talks with Centre since 2017, on Tuesday questioned the soundness of the ‘Framework Agreement’ of 2015 signed between the Centre and the NSCN (IM).Without naming NSCN (IM) directly, the NNPGs blamed the organisation for making toxic political expletives in statements and interviews, and for unprecedented labelling of apex Naga tribal bodies and civil societies as ‘anti-Naga’ and ‘traitors’ without compunction.This allegation comes close on the heels of an interview given by the NSCN (IM) chief Th. Muivah to a media house where he claimed that Nagas did not accept the union of India and there would be no settlement without a separate Naga flag and Constitution.“After twenty-three years of political talks, when a negotiator declares that Nagas do not accept the union of India or the Indian constitution, it could only mean political dialogue was a circus exercise for personal gains. The much-touted FA agreement of 2015, by the very utterance, becomes invalid,” asserted N Kitovi Zhimomi, convener, NNPGs. He said whether the statement was an emotional outburst or otherwise, the organisation owed an explanation to the Naga people.The working committee (WC) of NNPG in a statement stated that obsolete minds may consider 23 years of negotiations with the government of India as some sort of achievement and while they glorified themselves, generational catastrophe over lost decades have cost Naga society and polity dearly.The committee is of the view that there is massive expectation of the Naga people on the ‘Agreed position’ signed between the NNPGs and the government of India in 2017 as it offers the Naga people opportunity to chart their destiny as a people in consonance with their distinct history and identity while maintaining enduring, inclusive peaceful co-existence with the government of India.Also Read: Need to focus on roadmap for solution of Naga political issue, says CM Neiphiu Rio“As per the desire of the Naga people, WC-NNPGs will prepare itself to find an acceptable and honourable political solution with firm commitment that all unresolved matters shall be pursued through democratic and political process subsequent to the agreement with GoI. This aspiration of the Naga people must be given due space, time and respect by all entities who wish to stay away from an impending solution,” the statement of WC-NNPGs further said.Also Read: NSCN (IM) reaffirms flag and constitution demand for Naga peace dealThe statement comes amidst speculations that the Centre and Naga political groups were likely to ink the final agreement to resolve decades’ old Naga political issue anytime soon.Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, whose government had recently convened an all stakeholders meet, has conveyed that the government of India has made its stand clear that there will be only one solution for the Indo-Naga political issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naga-groups-slam-nscn-im-on-peace-talks-commit-to-political-solution/story-zB8DKqVyjWmwlfmefWPPxH.html

The PLA soldier was identified as Corporal Wang Ya Long. In a statement released earlier, the Indian army had said that it had received a request from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier.“As per established protocols, he will be returned to Chinese officials at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point after completion of formalities,” the army statement had said.The PLA had issued a statement on Monday night saying a soldier went missing while looking for lost yaks on the evening of October 18. “After the incident, Chinese border guards took the initiative to report the situation to the Indian side as soon as possible, and hoped that the Indian side would assist in search and rescue,” Colonel Zhang Shuili, spokesperson of the Western Theatre Command, added. As the Ladakh theatre continues to remain tense, during the seventh round of military commanders’ talks on October 12 to defuse tension along LAC, the Indian side demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April. The two sides have agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh.India and China are expected to hold the eighth round of military talks this week, although a date has not been announced yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hands-over-pla-soldier-who-strayed-across-contested-lac-in-ladakh-to-china/story-HPtUaZsFsHxKKxpPfvMLhN.html

21-10-2020||India||Delhi HC asks ICMR, CSIR to reply on pendency of approval to FELUDA test for Covid-19||The Delhi High Court asked Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to file affidavits regarding pendency of approvals to ‘FELUDA’, a test used for detecting Covid-19 infection.A direction from the division bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad came when the petitioner Rakesh Malhotra informed the bench that despite the fact that the Drug Control Authority has granted its approval to a test called ‘FELUDA’ on September 20, the same has not come out in the market due to the pendency of approvals at the end of ICMR/CSIR.Ahluwalia, Central Government Standing Counsel sought time to obtain instructions on this regard.The court also asked Delhi government to file an updated status report before the next date of hearing, i.e. November 11.Advocate Satyakam, representing Delhi government, has informed the court that the Sero-surveillance 4 in Delhi will conclude by day after tomorrow when all the samples shall be collected and it will take at least three weeks for the samples to be processed.The court asked the Delhi government to file report of Sero Surveillance-4 and cautioned them not to make it public through a preliminary or tentative reports of any nature before filing it in the court.The bench also noted that there have been repeated instances where the turnaround time for declaring the results has been crossing four days and said these things are unacceptable when a person tested is required to be isolated in that duration.“There have been occasions when the samples collected by the Delhi Government are sent to laboratories that do not entertain any queries for the reports, least over Saturdays and Sundays, leaving the persons concerned in a quandary more so when the Government has declared Un-lockdown 0.5 which requires all employees to report for work regularly; nor can the self-employed persons/professionals be expected to remain in isolation unnecessarily,” the court said.The turnaround time for declaring the results is far exceeding 24 hours and in fact extending to 84 hours, the court noted. The court also asked Delhi Government to look into the position and state in the next status report as to how the system is being streamlined to ensure that the turnaround time for declaring the results is strictly adhered to and the results, whichever way they may be, are conveyed to the person tested within 24 hours.The court was hearing petitions surrounding rapid testing of Covid-19 in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-asks-icmr-csir-to-reply-on-pendency-of-approval-to-feluda-test-for-covid-19/story-F0GvK33wkD3740BsWjtzYJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Outcry after Kashmir Times office sealed||Jammu and Kashmir authorities have sealed the Srinagar office of Kashmir Times, one of the region’s oldest and most prominent English-language newspapers, the publication said on Tuesday. Political parties and journalists criticised the move, but the state’s estates department said the premises were not being used as an office, but as a residence by the newspaper’s employees.The action came a week after a house allotted to Anuradha Bhasi, executive editor of the newspaper, in Jammu was re-allotted to the brother of a former legislator by the Jammu and Kashmir Estates Department. “Today, Estates Deptt locked our office without any due process of cancellation & eviction, same way as I was evicted from a flat in Jammu, where my belongings including valuables were handed over to ‘new allottee’,” wrote Bhasin,52, on Twitter on Monday.“Vendetta for speaking out! No due process followed. How peevish!,” she added.Bhasin has been a vocal critic of the government over curbs imposed on communications when the Centre on August 5, 2019, pushed through constitutional changes divesting Jammu and Kashmir of its special status under Article 370 of the Constitution, and reorganising the state into two Union territories 0-- J&K and Ladakh. She filed a petition in the top court demanding restoration of communications and measures to ensure the free and safe movement of media personnel. It was because of her petition that the court in January directed the administration of Jammu and Kashmir to review curbs on communications every week.On its website, the newspaper wrote that its office in a government building in Press Enclave that houses several other newspaper offices was “sealed without serving any cancellation or eviction notice to Kashmir Times or following any due process of law.”“The Estates Department employees who came to the office to lock it out told the Kashmir Times staffers working inside to move out. When the Kashmir Times management asked for the orders, the Estates Department officials said that they had no orders and asked them to approach the senior officers instead,” it said in a news report.Mohammad Aslam , deputy director of the Estates Department, said the newspaper was occupying two premises in Press Enclave, one of which was taken over by the department “amicably”.He said the premises that were taken over had been allotted to the late Ved Bhasin, founder of Kashmir Times and father of Anuradha Bhasin, in his individual capacity and after his death in 2015, its allotment had expired and was cancelled.“Their office is running in another quarter while this quarter was not in the name of Kashmir Times. It was being used for residential purposes by its employees and we requested for its vacation some two-three months back. Yesterday, they themselves handed over the facility,” he added.Political parties and journalists came out in support of Kashmir Times and Anuradha Bhasin.Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party leader Mehbboba Mufti wrote on Twitter: “Anuradha was one of the few local newspaper editors in J&K who stood upto GOIs {government of India’s} illegal and disruptive actions in the state. Shutting down her office in Srinagar is straight out of BJPs {Bharatiya Janata Party’s} vendetta playbook to settle scores with those who dare to disagree.”Another former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah wrote on Twitter:: “This explains why some of our ‘esteemed’ publications have decided to become Government mouthpieces, printing only government press handouts. The price of independent reportage is to be evicted without due process.”A group of 11 journalists offered their professional services free to Kashmir Times to support its editorial team in sustaining “the paper in these difficult times”.“We are aware that Kashmir Times, and its editor, have been at the forefront of fighting against government curbs on communications and press freedom in Kashmir, especially post August 5 clampdown last year, when the majority of the local press was found wanting in reportage, choosing silence over speaking truth to power.”“In view of these government-sponsored intimidation attempts to silence an independent newspaper, we express our solidarity and support to its editors and our colleagues there,” the journalists said in a statement.The Kashmir Editors Guild (KEG) said it regretted the sealing of the Kashmir Times office.“The Guild sees the sealing as the continuation of an abnormality being enforced on Kashmir media for a long time, especially since 2010. In the last 10 years, successive regimes have created a very unpleasant history as for as operations of the media in Kashmir is concerned. Preventing circulation of newspapers, blacklisting the newspapers from getting government advertisements in Srinagar and Delhi, and interrupting negatively in the routine operations have adversely impacted the media. These are in addition to the issues that reporters face on a daily basis while gathering information, “ it said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outcry-after-kashmir-times-office-sealed/story-Euql8BWLpxBdqXDnAy4ThO.html

21-10-2020||India||Enforcement Directorate seizes Iqbal Mirchi kin’s assets||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth ₹22.42 crore including a hotel and a film studio in Mumbai belonging to the family members of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi, officials said on Tuesday. Other assets, attached under prevention of money laundering act, include a farm house, two bungalows and 3.5 acre land in Panchgani, they added. So far, ED said in a statement, it has attached assets worth ₹798 crore belonging to Mirchi’s family. These assets include overseas properties worth ₹203 crore. Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was alleged to be the right-hand man of terrorist Dawood Ibrahim for drug trafficking and extortion crimes. “He (Mirchi) was an international drugs dealer and smuggler who had amassed huge wealth and acquired various immovable properties and businesses across the globe,” the ED had said last year in a statement. According to the anti-money laundering probe agency, Mirchi indirectly owned various properties in and around Mumbai. It has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family and others last year to probe money laundering charges linked to their alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of real estate assets in Mumbai. The probe is based on multiple FIRs lodged by the Mumbai police over the years. A charge sheet had also been filed against the family members before a Mumbai court in December 2019 and the court had subsequently issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi’s sons Asif Memon and Junaid Memon and wife Hajra Memon. HT could not locate their legal representative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-seizes-iqbal-mirchi-kin-s-assets/story-VkwG2mhtA4D8TyWjzwa9sI.html
21-10-2020||India||Plasma therapy may not be used on patients||India is likely to remove convalescent plasma therapy from the National Clinical Management Protocol for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after it showed no benefits in treating patients of the viral disease.Convalescent plasma therapy involves transfusing critically ill Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma (antibody-rich plasma from patients who recovered from the disease) so that they can fight the disease better.“We have had discussions at the National Task Force (NTF) and we are discussing further with the Joint Monitoring Committee. This (plasma therapy) may be deleted from the national guidelines,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, India Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Click here for full Covid-19 coverageICMR had conducted a pan-India study to determine the role of plasma therapy, and the Union health ministry had added it as one of the investigational therapies in the national protocol for treating Covid-19 patients.“The largest trial on plasma therapy has been done in India with 464 patients in 39 hospitals and 350 doctors. This paper was accepted in the British Medical Journal and we have received the proof and it is going to appear very soon. It is a full paper with more than 10 pages of hardcore science talking about the role of plasma in curing Covid-19,” said Bhargava.The primary outcome of the study was to check the proportion of patients remaining free of mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcome of the study was to monitor, among other things, mortality, duration of hospital stays, duration of intensive care unit stays, requirements of vasopressor (medicine to treat severely low blood pressure in critically ill patients) and days free of dialysis. “…and it clearly demonstrated no benefit in reducing mortality in moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. It also did not arrest the progression of disease from moderate to severe {cases}…,” Bhargava had said last month while releasing the interim study’s results.As reported by HT on Friday, October 16, Dr Bhargava confirmed that the national task force on Covid-19, and Union health ministry’s joint monitoring group, were also reviewing whether to continue the drugs remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as part of the national Covid-19 treatment protocol, after the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s Solidarity Trial showed little or no benefit of these drugs on patients of the coronavirus disease. “India has been a participant for WHO’s 30 country Solidarity Trial. WHO has just put up their interim results of this trial on their website. This has not yet been peer-reviewed. However, we find that these drugs are not performing as we had expected. So, debate and discussion is ongoing at the national task force and the joint monitoring group. It will take into cognizance the results of these trials. And issue the advisories accordingly,” said Dr Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-may-not-be-used-on-patients/story-wcQ0Rhtxl44xmjIJ1NLOiL.html
21-10-2020||India||Festival season, small gatherings aid spread of Covid-19, warn experts||Small gatherings at home, jagratas, and shopping trips during Navratra is likely to lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, according to experts who pointed to infection trends following some recent festivals that seeded new infections in states like Kerala and Maharashtra. The caution was also sounded on Tuesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said the lockdown may have gone but the virus hasn’t, and people must maintain precautions till a vaccine is administered to the masses. “We have seen an increase in the number of cases after festivals – take the example of Ganesh Chaturthi in Maharashtra or Onam in Kerala. This is because people gather in large numbers and do not follow preventive measures like wearing masks, washing or sanitising hands, and maintaining social distance,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, associate director of internal medicine at Max hospital, Saket. The Capital too recorded a post-festival surge, which was evident following the Rakshabandhan and Eid weekend (July 31 to August 3). While India overall has recorded a sustained decline in new infections, Delhi has been reporting over 3,000 cases for a week (except on Sunday when fewer tests are conducted). On Tuesday, 3,579 cases and 41 deaths due to the infection were reported from Delhi. Household gatherings At a time when much of the current concern has been linked to large gatherings at Durga Puja pandals, experts said small gatherings at homes can also lead to a spread of infections. In the United States, for example, officials from Centres for Disease Control (CDC) found that small household gatherings were driving the pandemic and issued fresh warnings for Thanksgiving. “It is festival season and gatherings will happen. The problem is that people tend to get relaxed with their relatives around and do not follow safety measure. People eat together with their masks off at a distance lesser than 6ft. There are children around and you cannot keep an eye on them all the time; they might not get a severe form of the disease but they can transmit it to others who might develop severe symptoms,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDr Suranjit Chaterjee, consultant of internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital, agreed. “Families tend to come together during festivals, increasing the risk of transmission of Covid-19 from younger members who might get the infection from outside and pass it on to the elders, who in turn may develop severe symptoms. So, to protect everyone, even the young members of the family have to curtail their movement and try to stay away from the elders,” he said. Speaking or singing loudly At gatherings, people also tend to speak loudly or, at events like Jagratas, even sing. This too can spread the virus readily. “If you look at the evidence, when people are talking loudly or are singing, more virus is emitted and it travels further, increasing the risk of transmission. This is the reason several choirs and other such events have become super-spreaders,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research. A study from Lund University in Sweden shows the number of aerosol particles emitted when a person just breathes is 135/second. This doubles to 270/s when they talk normally. However, when they talk loudly, this number shoots up to 570 particles/sA person was noticed to having emitted 690 aerosol particles per second when singing (opera) and 980 particles per second when singing loudly. The emission dropped to 410 particles/s when the person sang loudly, but with a mask on. The particle emission was measured for 14 singers. “But people have a habit of taking off their mask when speaking to someone. This should be avoided, people need to keep their masks on at all times,” said Dr Broor. Pollution threatAir pollution levels are already on the rise in Delhi – an AQI of 223 was recorded on Tuesday – and it might further shoot up with Diwali just around the corner. “An increase in the number of cases is expected; the effect of Navratra and Durga Puja will be felt after ten to fifteen days. By then, it will be time for Diwali. The ensuing increase in pollution levels will also lead to people developing severe disease and more and more people needing ICU care,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at AIIMS. A study from Italy showed that Covid-19 mortality in northern part of the country stood at 12% as compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country. The researchers associated the high mortality with higher levels of air pollution in the region. Another study from Europe – Italy, France, Spain, and Germany – showed that 78% of all the Covid-19 deaths happened in five regions with higher levels of Nitrogen Dioxide. And a study by Harvard University showed that with every 1 μg increase in PM 2.5 long term exposure, the Covid-19 mortality went up by 8%. “When over 1 lakh people have died in India and over 10 lakh across the world, people need to understand that the situation is not normal and exercise constraints. They should give celebrations a miss this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/festival-season-small-gatherings-aid-spread-of-covid-19-warn-experts/story-3UzT32Mw6MwhbPgLnFxTMJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||What does the handle of a water pump have to do with a counter to the Great Barrington Declaration, which has struck a chord with the Trump White House?Dispatch 183 on October 15 referred to the Great Barrington Declaration. The operative part of this declaration is: “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.”In effect, the declaration , named after Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where it was drafted on October 4 at the American Institute of Economic Research — a libertarian think-tank that doesn’t really believe in the climate crisis — advocates herd immunity as the way out of the pandemic. It was authored by Dr Sunetra Gupta, an Indian-origin epidemiologist at Oxford University; Dr Jay Bhattacharya, also of Indian-origin, and a professor of medicine at Stanford; and Martin Kulldorf, a professor of medicine at Harvard. There’s no denying the academic credentials of the authors. And the declaration has its share of supporters; among others, Dr Scott Atlas, one of President Trump’s advisers, has supported the declaration. Atlas is Bhattacharya’s colleague at Stanford, and was in the news recently for claiming that masks are not effective in the fight against Covid in a tweet that pointed to an article by the American Institute of Economic Research that claimed this. Atlas subsequently walked back on his position, and over the weekend, Twitter removed his original tweet.In response to the Great Barrington Declaration, another group of experts published the John Snow Memorandum in The Lancet on October 14.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThis memorandum reinforces many of the truths we have come to know about Covid-19 (and which regular readers of this column and newspaper will be familiar with): that “Sars-CoV-2 spreads through contact... and longer-range transmission via aerosols, especially in conditions where ventilation is poor”; that it spreads rapidly across communities; that the fatality rate of Covid-19 is higher than that of other flus; that there is such a thing as long Covid; that “it is unclear how long protective immunity lasts”; and, most importantly, that the “transmission of the virus can be mitigated through physical distancing, use of face coverings, hand and respiratory hygiene, and by avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces”.The memorandum also advocates the test-trace-isolate approach that many countries, including India, have adopted in their fight against Covid-19.The authors speak of the dangers of any approach that pushes for herd immunity, pointing out that this is “unsupported by scientific evidence”, that “uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant morbidity and mortality across the whole population” and that a rash of infections could “overwhelm the ability of health care systems to provide acute and routine care”.The John Snow Memorandum is named after a 19th century Englishman considered the founder of modern epidemiology. Urban legend has it that Snow curtailed a sharp outbreak of cholera in a part of London by identifying and removing the handle of a water pump in Soho, although, like most urban legends, the explanation is more nuanced. Snow’s contribution to epidemiology is actually far more significant — he conducted among the first known double-blind studies (when investigating the cholera outbreak, which he believed came from water supplied by a utility). In his seminal book On The Mode of Communication of Cholera (1855), Snow spoke of how he was able to conduct his study on a huge sample which was completely random (“three hundred thousand people of both sexes, of every age and occupation, and of every rank and station, from gentlefolks down to the very poor, were divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge”) with one group getting water he suspected was unclean (because the companies supplying it sourced it from the Thames and didn’t treat it). Even today, the so-called randomised double-blind study is a valued technique in epidemiology, and such studies where one of the two groups is given a placebo form the basis of human clinical trials.Jon or John, I’ve always been on the side of the Snows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-evqaXcqBVnZWiDwBE7OQhJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Prime suspect in murder of 8-year-old dies by suicide within hours of recovery of boy’s body||A man suspected to be involved in the murder of an 8-year-old boy allegedly died by suicide in Ujjain, 190 km west of Bhopal, on Tuesday, police said. Ujjain police recovered the body of the boy, who went missing on Monday evening, from the room of the man who died by suicide later. His body was found hanging from a tree branch in Ambodiya village of the district on Tuesday morning, police said. He used to live as a tenant in a portion of the boy’s house in Shakti Nagar locality of Ujjain. The deceased didn’t belong to the locality where he lived as a tenant and the village where he died. He came from another town of the district, according to the police. Ujjain, superintendent of police, Satyendra Shukla said, “Kanha Prajapati, 8, son of Mukesh Prajapati, a resident of Shakti Nagar locality went missing on Monday evening. When the parents and relatives’ extensive search for the boy yielded no results the whole night Mukesh informed Nilganga police station about his missing son. The suspect accompanied Mukesh in the latter’s frantic search for his son.” “On Tuesday morning, police inquired about a locked room in Mukesh’s house. He informed the police team that the room was rented out to a resident of a town of the district aged between 30 and 35. When the police team opened the room it recovered the body of the boy Kanha covered with a mattress. The body of the boy had bruises and marks and he was killed with a sharp-edged weapon. When police inquired about the man living as a tenant in the room he was found missing,” said the SP. Police were trying to nab the accused as he was a prime suspect in the murder of the boy but in the evening his body was found hanging from a tree branch in the nearby village, said the SP.“The suspect was a habitual drunkard. As of now, we didn’t find any motive behind the murder of the boy.Police is investigating the matter,” the police officer said.

21-10-2020||India||30 million frontline workers to get Covid-19 vaccine in phase 1||India is looking at vaccinating about 30 million people, including healthcare specialists, who are on the frontline of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the first phase once protection against the viral disease becomes available, Union health ministry officials said on Tuesday.The 30 million include 7 million doctors and paramedics, in addition to 20 million other frontline health workers, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on the sidelines of a Covid-19 media briefing on Tuesday. The country has the infrastructure already in place to vaccinate the 30 million, Bhushan said. “We have the cold chain, vials, syringes and everything,” he added.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe first phase of vaccination has been tentatively scheduled between January and June 2021.“In the deliberations of the national expert committee on vaccine administration we have come up with a draft prioritisation plan. We have also tried to match the numbers which have come from this draft plan to the number of doses that would become available from tentatively January to July 2021. And we think if the present trials proceeded according to plan, and succeed, then the number of doses that will become available from January to July 2021 would be sufficient to immunize the priority list persons. That we are working on…,” said Bhushan. They added that even after a vaccine is made available, people cannot afford to let their guard down. “The same precautions (against the disease) will have to be continued even after the Covid-19 vaccine is developed. We have to remain cautious... we have to test, treat and isolate for a good time. The requirement for this may gradually reduce over time, but there is no scope for relaxation,” said Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Dr Balram Bhargava.India has been running a successful Universal Immunisation Programme for the past 50 years, vaccinating about 25 million children and adults each year.“As a result we have more than 28,000 cold storages already existing across the country that are used to store several vaccines administered under the programme. All these facilities have temperature trackers that help upload information in real-time on our centralized server,” said Bhushan.“We also have our own digital platform that has all updated information — from vaccine procurement to storage, cold chain and transportation in refrigerated vehicles. If non-refrigerated vehicles are used, then to transport vaccines in them, a special kind of refrigerated boxes are used where temperature is regulated. This facility already exists in India, and what the government is contemplating is how to augment this facility to be able to deliver Covid-19 vaccine. For this, we have a national-level expert committee in place,” he added.Certain private hospitals are claiming that they have the infrastructure to store and administer large doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The health secretary said the government was engaging with private entities.“We are in constant engagement with private sector health care providers and going ahead as the contours of the plan develop we would be sharing it with you. We have surplus capacity for both vials as well syringes domestically in the country. We are in constant touch with the manufacturers. We also have an existing inventory within the ministry of health and family welfare which most of the people are not aware of. So, we will be utilizing our inventory, and we would also be utilizing the inventory that is presently available in the domestic industry,” Bhushan said.Experts say that it is good to stay prepared.“No one knows when the vaccine will be available for use but when it does many countries will be in line to procure it. It makes sense to start preparing now,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-million-frontline-workers-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-phase-1/story-W76e1pJ7toA4aod3hH234O.html
21-10-2020||India||Punjab passes bills to block Centre’s farm laws||The Punjab assembly on Tuesday passed four bills and a resolution to counter the three agriculture marketing laws enacted by the Centre last month, and pledged to safeguard the interests of the state’s farmers, who are concerned that the central legislation would deprive them of government-fixed minimum support prices (MSPs) for their produce and put them at the mercy of big agribusinesses.After a five-and-a-half-hour discussion, the bills were unanimously passed by all members of the ruling Congress, the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) who were present in the House. After the passage of the bills, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, flanked by leaders of the opposition parties, met governor VP Singh Badnore and handed over copies of the four bills. “The government will take legal recourse if the governor does not sign the amendment bills passed in the state assembly to save the farmers and agriculture,” Singh said.The Punjab version of the central legislation is aimed at addressing the concerns of farmers and may be adopted by other non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-ruled states, including a provision to protect the MSPs that government procurement agencies pay for farmers’ produce. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 were pushed through in Parliament last month. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say the Centre’s farm reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the system of MSPs and that deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before.Because the state laws are in conflict with the central laws, which have been signed by President Ram Nath Kovind, they would require presidential assent to be enacted.Singh said he had sought an appointment with President Ram Nath Kovind between November 2 and 5, and all Punjab legislators will together go to meet him to seek his intervention in the interest of the state. Singh was accompanied by Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, among others, to the meeting with the governor. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – the party in power at the Centre and behind the three central laws – has two members in the state assembly and both were conspicuous by their absence. The amendment bills — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020 — guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for wheat and paddy growers, and provide for imprisonment of not less than three years and fine for its sale or purchase below the MSPs. “No sale or purchase of wheat or paddy shall be valid unless the price paid for such agriculture produce under a farming agreement is equal to, or greater than, the MSP announced by the Central government for that crop,” reads section 4 of the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2020. The state also seeks to reserve the powers to levy a fee on private entities for buying the produce of farmers anywhere in the state as well as regulate or prohibit the supply of and impose stockholding limits on essential food items.The House also adopted a resolution which demanded the annulment of the three “anti-farmer” laws and a proposed central Electricity Bill on power tariffs, which seeks to bar states from offering power subsidies, along with the promulgation of a fresh ordinance making the procurement of foodgrains at MSPs a statutory right of farmers.The fourth bill, an amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, bars courts from attaching landholdings below 2.5 acre in recovery proceedings.The two-day special session of the assembly was also extended by a day as the legislative business also included seven other bills which could not be taken up because the House adjourned to allow the CM and other legislators to meet the governor to hand over the bills. These remaining bills will be taken up on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-passes-bills-to-block-centre-s-farm-laws/story-M4f81IFhQ5ORDN21TBgWWJ.html
21-10-2020||India||One sentenced to death, 24 to life imprisonment for lynching 73-year-old Assam doctor||One person was sentenced to death and 24 others given life imprisonment on Tuesday by a court in Assam’s Jorhat in connection with lynching of a 73-year-old doctor last year. District and session judge Robin Phukan sentenced accused Sanjay Rajwar to death for murdering Dr. Deben Dutta, a resident doctor of Teok Tea Estate hospital in Jorhat district in August last year. On October 12, the court had pronounced 25 of the total 32 accused in the case as guilty while acquitting 6 others. One accused had died during trial. “Besides death sentence to one and life imprisonment to 24, the court directed all the 25 accused to pay a fine of Rs 1000 each, failing which they will have to undergo additional one month’s imprisonment,” said a prosecution lawyer after Tuesday’s verdict. An irate mob, mostly comprising tea garden workers, had assaulted Dr Dutta on August 31, 2019, holding him responsible for the death of a patient in Teok TE. He was rushed to the Jorhat Medical College, where he was declared brought dead. The pictures of the assault, which soon went viral on social media, created a sense of terror among doctors posted in tea gardens across Assam. At least seven doctors, who were working in tea gardens, had resigned within a week of Dr Dutta’s murder. Police had arrested 32 people, including three brothers of the deceased patient, following the barbaric attack under various sections of Indian Penal Code and the Assam Medicare Service Persons & Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2011. The incident was condemned by Indian Medical Association (IMA) and doctors in Assam resorted to a one-day strike in protest. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had also ordered an inquiry into the incident. Investigation into the case was concluded within a record time of 21 days and a voluminous 602-page charge sheet submitted on September 21 last year. According to Assam Police, this is the first case in the country where ‘witness identity concealment approach’ was used. A total of 60 people including tea garden employees, journalists, the doctor’s family members, police personnel and forensic experts were named as witnesses. Of them 56 deposed during the trial of the case. According to reports, seven of the witnesses are being kept under a witness identity protection scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-sentenced-to-death-24-to-life-imprisonment-for-lynching-73-year-old-assam-doctor/story-KvrgzKvLEZOnQ7tnJOEKiJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Uttarakhand’s first radio-collared leopard found crossing Ganga near Haridwar||After the Uttarakhand forest department started monitoring leopards via radio-collaring recently, the first radio-collared leopard has been found to be swimming and crossing the Ganga River near Haridwar in the search of prey, which has surprised wildlife officials. Chief wildlife warden JS Suhag said, “We recently witnessed the first radio-collared leopard swimming and crossing the Ganga River in Haridwar forest division. It was a pleasant surprise for us. By radio-collaring the animal, we want to study the nature of the leopard, the areas it moves around, how much time it spends in what type of area, around what time it moves and habitat that the animal prefers.” The Uttarakhand forest department has started radio-collaring leopards to study their movement pattern and behaviour. Two leopards have been successfully radio-collared in the state in Haridwar and Narendra Nagar forest divisions since the last week of September. This leopard found swimming and crossing the Ganga was radio-collared in the last week of September in Haridwar forest division. The chief wildlife warden said that the leopard might have crossed the river in search of prey. On Tuesday, the chief wildlife warden informed that a second leopard was successfully radio-collared in Tehri Garhwal district. “Radio collaring of a second leopard was done after examining the health parameters of the animal by a team of the state forest department and Wildlife Institute of India. We checked the functionality of the radio collar took the animal deep inside the jungle in the night around 11:00 pm on Monday and released it. The signals are clear and are being tracked,” said Suhag. The chief wildlife warden further said that a total of 15 leopards are being radio-collared in different areas of the state, predominantly the Rajaji landscape. According to Neeraj Sharma, divisional forest officer (DFO) Haridwar division said, “This is the first time we have documented a leopard crossing the Ganga though radio-collaring. We are keeping a target of five leopards each from Haridwar and Dehradun forest divisions and another five from the Rajaji Tiger Reserve for radio-collaring and studying their behaviour. After learning about their movement, we will be able to form better strategies on how to reduce the man-leopard conflict.” AG Ansari, state-based wildlife expert said that leopards are known to be ace swimmers. “Leopards are ace swimmers and cross rivers in search of prey. From the Sundarban region, there are records of leopards swimming across water bodies crossing distances of three to five kilometres,” said Ansari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-s-first-radio-collared-leopard-found-crossing-ganga-near-haridwar/story-yZYZTOORl9bsqNg0xweHiN.html

The 1,837 new cases in the state during the last 24 hours pushed the state’s total tally to 2,06,961 with 1,011 fatalities. Of these, Patna accounted for the maximum of 33,257 cases and 247 deaths. Patna had reported 422 cases on August 19 that was its previous highest single-day surge in cases. The state capital’s death toll was 114 then. It has now gone up to 247. Prior to that, 399 cases were reported on August 13, when Patna’s toll was 91. The surge in Covid-19 infections was attributed to heavy influx of people due to the upcoming assembly elections and the festival season, said a senior health officer, requesting anonymity. “We have increased testing and are trying to motivate people who have tested positive to go in for home or institutional isolation. We are also increasing our information, education and counselling activities to educate people take precautions against Covid-19 in the upcoming festive season,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh. Patna has 12 containment zones, with over 3,500 people residing in 438 households. Eight deaths were reported through the health department’s bulletin on Tuesday. Gopalganj reported two deaths while Buxar, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Rohtas and Samastipur one each.

The deceased’s family members have alleged that he was cremated without their knowledge.Duryodhan Behera, 45, of Barda village in Dhenkanal district had suffered chest pains on September 28 after which his family members rushed him to Dhenkanal district headquarters hospital for treatment. After testing positive for Covid-19, Behera was admitted to the Covid Care Centre in Dhenkanal town on September 29.However, his son Pradipta Behera, who visited the Covid centre the next day to give him some personal articles, was told that his father had been shifted to SCB Covid-19 hospital in Cuttack with another patient on the night of September 29.The nightmares of Behera family was about to begin as they ran from pillar to post to get information about him.Also read: Delhi HC hears over 40k cases virtually since March, popular mode among advocates“I visited all Covid-19 hospitals in Cuttack from October 1, including the SCB Covid Isolation Center, but all of them denied receiving any such patient. I then contacted the Dhenkanal district collector who advised me to meet the chief district medical officer. I met CDMO Sujatarani Mishra who asked me to visit SCB Covid-19 hospital in Cuttack,” said Pradipta Behera.The family waited for the next two weeks and finally decided to complain against the Dhenkanal CDMO and the district magistrate at the town police station on October 16. Soon after the FIR, a medical team was sent to Cuttack on October 17 and all records were checked with Mangalabag police station under which the SCB Medical College and Hospital falls. The Mangalabag police station informed the Dhenkanal town police station that Behera has been cremated on October 7 after his body was kept in the mortuary of the SCB hospital for 3 days as an unidentified body.Alleging gross negligence by the authorities, Behera’s son said the ambulance carrying his father and another Covid-19 patient from Dhenkanal to Cuttack left both patients outside the SCB Covid Isolation Centre. “The second patient was admitted to the Covid isolation centre in SCB Medical College and Hospital as he had an attendant. There was no one to attend my father. He died outside the isolation centre unclaimed and unidentified and was later cremated. This is gross negligence,” said Pradipta Behera.“We had sent Behera to the Covid isolation ward in Cuttack. What can we do if the driver of the vehicle left him outside the isolation ward?” asked Dhenkanal CDMO Sujatarani Mishra. Bhubanananda Maharana, emergency officer of SCB Medical College and Hospital, said they would have known about Behera had he been admitted to the isolation ward. “It was the driver’s fault. He should have admitted the patient to the ward,” he said.The brother-in-law of the deceased however accused the officials in Dhenkanal of gross negligence. “Without informing us, they took my brother-in-law from Dhenkanal to SCB Hospital. While the government claims to be doing so much for Covid patients, why did they act irresponsibly? Strict action needs to be taken against those responsible,” said Suresh Behera, Duryodhana’s brother-in-law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-covid-19-patient-goes-missing-from-hospital-cremated-without-family-s-knowledge/story-bdED9qlK6s3MGgqqWTZaCK.html
21-10-2020||India||DRDO tweaks manual for ‘self-reliance’ push||The Defence Research and Development Organisation’s new procurement manual has raised the limit of advance payment to vendors, allowed awarding contracts to the second lowest bidder (L2) if L1 (the lowest bidder) backs out, and done away with the need to furnish performance bank guarantees — key measures that seek to provide a boost to the indigenous defence industry, DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday released the procurement manual (PM-2020) that seeks to encourage more participation from Indian industry, especially start-ups and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), for achieving self-reliance in the defence sector, the defence ministry said in a statement. The changes in the manual were suggested by a high-powered committee after a year-long study. The current industry base of DRDO consists of 1,800 MSMEs, defence public sector undertakings, ordnance factories and large-scale industries. “The new DRDO procurement manual will facilitate the indigenous defence industry by simplifying the processes and ensure their participation in design and development activities,” Singh said. The last major revamp of the manual was carried out in 2006, with some changes introduced a decade later in 2016. “Some more enabling measures of PM-2020 are exemption of bid security and performance security up to ₹10 lakh, no negotiations for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items/services wherever price discovery is happening through market forces and procurement of stores from development partners,” the ministry said, adding that the PM-2020 will facilitate faster execution of R&D projects.  The DRDO’s annual budget for procurement, R&D and grant-in aid is around ₹15,000 crore. Reddy said the new manual has simplified internal processes as well. “What took six months earlier will now be achieved in a month. Procurement will move at a faster pace. The delivery period extension process has been simplified too, with project directors being empowered to take quick decisions.” He added that PM-2020 has introduced a provision for leasing of equipment required for a short period if it is a better option to an outright purchase. “In the new PM-2020, the liquidated damage (LD) rate for development contracts has been reduced,” the statement said. The changes in the procurement manual were suggested by a high-powered committee set up in October 2019 and headed by director general (naval systems and materials) Samir V Kamat. The new manual incorporates at least 60 changes, most of them focused on supporting MSMEs. Raising the limit for advance payment to vendors/partners is seen as a significant step by analysts. Until now, they were receiving only 15% of the cost as advance but the new manual has raised it to almost 40%, the DRDO chief said. The decision to place orders with L2 if L1 backs out will do away with the need for re-tendering that causes delays in procurement, Reddy added. CII national MSME council co-chairman Ashok Saigal said MSMEs would benefit significantly from the increase in advance from 15% to 40%. “It is an important move as it will help MSMEs sustain themselves during the long gestation period of product introduction, qualification and coming into use in commercially meaningful quantities,” Saigal said. CII has around 9,000 members, with MSMEs accounting for 70% of that figure.In August, DRDO came out with a list of 108 systems and sub-systems that it would help the Indian industry design and develop to strengthen the local defence ecosystem — from mini unmanned aerial vehicles to fire detection systems and bullet proof vehicles to tank transporters. The other items on the list include NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) shelters, missile canisters, navigation radars, satellite navigation receivers, mine-laying equipment and armoured engineering reconnaissance vehicles. The government has already announced that it will ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years, a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector. The negative import list included artillery guns, light military transport aircraft, conventional submarines and long-range land attack cruise missiles. The detailed list of equipment published by the defence ministry in August also spelled out that the embargo on import will kick in between December 2020 and December 2025 for different categories of military hardware. The military hardware on the negative import list includes assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-tweaks-manualfor-self-reliance-push/story-YClki9Zf8HwEbcPSySEUsJ.html
21-10-2020||India||Lockdown gone, Covid-19 virus hasn’t, cautions PM Modi||Days before the start of an extended festival season, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday warned citizens that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was still active and present in India, there was no vaccine yet, and citizens would be putting their own lives and those of their family members at risk if they were irresponsible about safety measures such as social distancing norms and wearing masks.Modi, in an address to the nation, stressed that there was tremendous work being done — on a war footing, both globally and in India — to develop vaccines, some of which were in the advanced stages of trial. “The government is working on a plan to ensure that vaccines reach all citizens,” he said.“But till there is no medicine,” he cautioned, “don’t let your guard down.”The Prime Minister offered global examples — from the US and European countries — to suggest that any laxity could lead to a spike in infections. He also gave Indian examples, citing recent videos and photographs, to suggest that there was a pattern of growing carelessness and Covid-19 fatigue at home.He asked citizens to spread awareness about the risks of the disease as an act of national service.“This is not the time for carelessness. It is not the time to think that Covid-19 has gone or that there is no danger from Covid-19. We have seen videos and photographs in recent days where it is clear that people are either not following precautions or have been complacent. If you are being careless and are going out without a mask, you are putting yourself, your families, your elders and your children at risk,” he said. The PM’s remarks – in a 12-minute speech that served as an advisory and appeal, rather than one that made announcements about measures or guideline – come days before the Vijayadashami festival, which often sees large congregations at pandals, especially in West Bengal. It also comes before other festivals such as Dussehra, Eid, Chatth, and Diwali, many of which are public festivals. The onset of this period has brought forth tension between public health imperatives (which stipulate distancing) on one side; and religious traditions (where the expression of faith is often public), and economic considerations (this is a season which witnesses higher consumer spending) on the other.Weighing in favour of public health needs, but with some degree of festivity and economic activity, the PM said: “From the Janata curfew (March 22) to now, Indians have traversed a long journey. With time, economic activity has also slowly picked up. A majority of us are coming out of our homes. There is activity in the markets too. But we must not forget that even if the lockdown has gone, the virus hasn’t gone yet.” Saying that India had achieved relative success in the battle against Covid-19, Modi said that there was a “controlled situation” at the moment, but this must not worsen, and instead the effort must be to build on it. He cited data — 5,500 cases and 83 deaths per million in India against close to 2,500 cases and 600 deaths per million in countries such as the United States and Brazil — to stress that India has both a high recovery rate and low fatality rate. India also, he said, now, had nine million beds for Covid-19 patients, 12,000 quarantine centres, and 2,000 labs; and is close to completing 100 million tests. India has 7.65 million Covid-19 cases – the second highest in the world after the US, but its fatality rate of 1.5% is significantly better than most severely hit countries as well as the global average of 2.8%.The PM pointed to the US and Europe, and said that after a dip in cases, there was a “worrying spike” in cases in these geographies again, and said that until there was a vaccine, there must not be any weakness in the battle against Covid-19.Also Read | ‘Markets are bright again amid festive season but...’: Top quotes from PM Modi’s addressThe Congress said that that the Prime Minister should come out with concrete solutions to control the Covid-19 pandemic and revive the economy instead of giving “plain speeches”. After the PM’s address, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the Modi government has “failed” on both the fronts and India has become the “Corona capital” of the world with the “highest” number of daily cases and deaths. “It is easy to give sermons. The country does not need plain speeches but concrete solutions,” he said in a tweet, quoting a phrase from saint Tulsidas.Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said: “Addressing the nation for the seventh time since the imposition of the lockdown PM Modi brushed aside all shortcomings in the tackling of the pandemic claiming the governments handling as a success.”“It is a very good thing that the Prime Minister raised the issue of the festival celebrations... even if festivals have to be celebrated, people should do so with their families within their homes rather than going out shopping or to crowded places,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-gone-covid-19-virus-hasn-t-cautions-pm-modi/story-BmdChs9VD3JZIBupe22n8K.html
21-10-2020||India||Shudder when I think of Oct 1947 carnage: Survivor of Pak-based violence in J&K||Shanti Devi was 22 when she fled her home in Chatra village in what is now Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, two young children in tow. A tribal militia was pillaging its way through her village, killing people and torching huts. Devi, now 105, remembers that the attackers -- aided by members of the Pakistani army -- abducted young children, killed adult men and raped the women. It was October 22, 1947, and the militia was part of a Pakistani design -- ultimately unsuccessful -- to forcibly capture Jammu and Kashmir. Her husband, Duni Chand, was a marginal farmer. Her family, along with hundreds of other Hindu and Sikh families, settled in Jammu’s Poonch district. Seven decades later, Devi says the carnage left an indelible scar. “Today I am 105 but I still remember the carnage in 1947. I still shudder whenever I think of it. It was a nightmare,” she said. Now a resident of Degwar near the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch in a neighbourhood called ‘Mohalla Purani Poonch’, Devi said the tribal raiders were especially cruel with Hindu and Sikh women, who were abducted, raped and forced to accept Islam. “Those who refused were slaughtered,” she added. Horror stories like that of Devi and hundreds of others are set to take centrestage on Thursday as India spotlights Pakistan’s role in instigating violence and terror in Kashmir months after Independence in 1947, when Islamabad-sponsored tribal militia, along with the Pakistani army, attacked the civilian population, wreaked humanitarian destruction, killed thousands, and came close to capturing the capital Srinagar before being repelled by Indian forces. The refugees forced to flee their homes have always marked October 22 as a Black Day. Now, after years of being in the shadows, they look forward to tell their stories but also hope for more government support. “We survived the carnage in PoK and continue to live in penury. We have a small land holding and a cow ---our only source to livelihood,” said Devi’s son Suresh Kumar. “I have a differently abled son and a daughter. No government ever thought of our miseries and we continue to live in oblivion,” he rued. Advocate Bakshi Dwarkanath, 82, said he was seven when he fled Chatra village, and on a clear day, their old hutment can be seen from across the LoC. “These raiders attacked Hindus and Sikhs in the night and raised Islamic slogans,” he said. At least 170 Hindus and Sikhs were herded into a house before it was set on fire by the raiders. “We slept in the maize fields every night out of fear that raiders may set afire our houses,” he added. The terrorised family saw their money and jewellery looted, but weren’t willing to convert; after walking for three days, they reached Pooch town. “I remember my aunt Shiv Dei, around 50 years old at that time, stayed back with her grandson. Being a rich lady, she gave her money and ornaments to the raiders to save their lives. They also converted to Islam,” said octogenarian. He also recalled some acts of kindness from their Muslim neighbours. Another resident of the locality, ex-serviceman Sardar Bachan Singh, 82, said his village of around 1,000 people in the erstwhile Bagh sector was wiped out by the militia. “Raiders with active help by Pakistani forces wanted to usurp the entire J&K. We had to flee with whatever belongings we could lay our hands on,” he recalled. He was 10 at the time. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shudder-whenever-i-think-of-the-oct-1947-carnage-it-was-a-nightmare-survivor-of-pak-based-violence-in-j-k/story-wmtMHdN9qf2Rg1Fd4Z82FO.html
21-10-2020||India||How the Punjab bills will negate new laws||Punjab Assembly on Tuesday passed three bills to counter some provisions of the Central farm reform laws approved in the monsoon session of Parliament last month to protests by farmers’ groups. The Punjab version of bills is aimed at addressing the concerns of farmers and may be adopted by other non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-ruled states, including a provision to protect the Minimum Support Price (MSP) that government procurement agencies pay for farmers’ produce. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 were pushed through in Parliament last month. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say the Centre’s farm reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the system of MSPs and that deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than beforeHere is an explainer on the new provisions inserted in the Central laws by the Punjab government.Has the Punjab government nullified the Central laws?No. The Punjab government has added additional provisions in the three farm laws, providing safeguards to farmers while adopting the basic structure of the Central laws, which allow the private sector in production and trading of agriculture produce. The Punjab laws allow private entities to buy farm produce or enter contract farming, as the Central laws envisaged, but have included provisions that farmers’ bodies in the state have demanded. Has Punjab ensured MSP protection?Yes. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill 2020 has added a Section 4, which guarantees MSPs notified by the central government for wheat and paddy to all farmers, unlike the central legislation, which allowed the markets to decide the best price for the produce. Section 5 of the bill overrides any price mechanism suggested in the Central bill. The bill also provides for penal provisions for those who pay less than MSPs for farmers’ produce; they would be punishable with a jail term of no less than three years and a fine. The Punjab version of the contract farming bill makes it illegal to sign a contract with farmers for selling their produce below MSP. What is there by way of protection for agricultural markets?The bill also gives the Punjab government the right to levy a fee on private entities for buying the produce of farmers in any form --- physically or electronically --- anywhere in the state, thereby extending the mandi system to the entire state. The Central law had exempted private entities from paying any fees outside the mandis. The contract farming bill restores the primacy of agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs) in the sale and purchase of agriculture produce, which was diluted by the Centre. What are the other safeguards?The bill also allows farmers to approach a civil court against private agribusinesses in addition to a sub-divisional magistrate’s court provided for by the central laws. Punjab has also introduced an amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, barring courts from attaching land holdings below 2.5 acres in any recovery proceedings; 86% of the farmers have less than 2.5 acres of land in the state.The Punjab CM has also introduced a bill to amend the Centre’s Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, nullifying its impact by maintaining status quo ante as of June 4, 2020, when this Central law was promulgated as an ordinance. The central law allowed the Centre to regulate supply of certain foods such as cereals, pulses, potato, pulses, onion and edible oilseeds only in circumstances such as a war, famine, a grave natural calamity and an extraordinary price rise. The bill restores the state’s power to regulate essential commodities and enforce hoarding limits on agriculture produce.Can Punjab directly implement these laws?As agricultural markets and lands are state subjects under entries 14, 18 and 22 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the state can frame laws covering them. However, entry 33 of the concurrent subjects, on which both the Centre and states can legislate, allows the central government to frame laws on the control of production, supply and distribution of products of any industry, including agriculture. Using this provision, the Centre has introduced the farm reform bills. It would now be a bone of contention between the Punjab government and the Centre, whether the changes proposed by the central laws are legally correct or not.Can the Centre negate Punjab laws?Yes, it can. As the Punjab laws are in conflict with the central laws, the Centre, by using its powers under Article 254 (2) of Constitution, can ask the Punjab government to seek approval of the President before notifying these laws. The President, normally, approves the bills after getting the Centre on board and can refuse to approve the bills. In case Punjab does not send the bills to the President for approval on grounds that agriculture is a state subject, the Centre can amend the Punjab farm laws to ensure uniformity of legislation across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-punjab-bills-will-negate-new-laws/story-woYTiStfiNzB50Ye6cP8AP.html
21-10-2020||India||Soon, mid-day meals likely in kindergarten||The Union education ministry has started working on a plan to expand its mid-day meals (MDM) scheme to children in kindergarten , and to also offer breakfast, and has written to the states and the union territories for their suggestions on the proposal. In a letter to the states on October 12, education ministry joint secretary R C Meena mentioned that the ministry was in the process of revision and modification of the existing scheme, adding that it was in keeping with suggestions made by the recently adopted National Education Policy (NEP) -- inclusion of pre-primary classes in the MDM scheme and the provision of a simple and energetic breakfast under the scheme.Currently, the MDM scheme caters to 116 million children from classes 1 to 8 in 1.134 million government schools. The centre contributes 60% of the cost of the scheme and the states put in the rest. The administration is by the state governments. In the budget for 2020-21, the Centre has budgeted ₹11,000 crore for the scheme.It is expected that the inclusion of kindergarten students will add another couple ofmillion beneficiaries. That, and the provision of breakfast, are likely to increase the budget significantly. Meena said in his letter that the suggestions from the states and UTs will be discussed by the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC). ‘“It is recognized world over that 85 % capacity of cognitive and analytical brain develops in the first six years of a child,” said eminent educationist DrInder Mohan Kapahy, adding that the decision to extend MDM to young kids was an important decision for future of the country.Proposals by government departments, especially new ones that involve substantial financial implications, are reviewed by EFCs before they get the go-ahead.In the letter to the states, the education ministry also said that it had already taken on record the states’ suggestion that the honorarium paid to cooks-cum-helpers be increased and said that these were among the issues it was factoring in as it modifies and revises the scheme.Former Union secretary Uday Kumar Varma said the MDM scheme was brought in with two aims – to provide improved nutrition and to bring down the school drop out rate. Providing breakfast takes the aim of the scheme further, he said. “However, since substantial resources are needed, greater community participation is desirable. People with surplus foodgrains, resources etc should be encouraged to contribute to the scheme and committees at various levels can oversee the process,” he added.Last month, on the advice of the agriculture ministry aimed at helping farmers, the education ministry suggested that states and UTs include honey and mushrooms in the diets provided under the scheme. This would boost bee-keeping and mushroom production in the country, the ministry said then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-mid-day-meals-likely-in-kindergarten/story-kwvxR4RQPvJ3ygWvduy5sI.html
21-10-2020||India||2 doctors connected to Hathras case asked to go by hospital||Two medical officers at the JN Medical College (JNMC) in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) connected to the case involving the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras were removed from their posts on Tuesday.One had contradicted the state police’s claim that the victim wasn’t raped, while the other had signed some reports of the woman. Their removal comes a day after a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team visited the hospital and questioned doctors and staff in the hospital in connection with the case.The university authorities said the two men were recruited on a temporary basis because many doctors had fallen ill, and called their removal a routine step. One of the doctors, however, suggested that the version he had put forward may have led to his removal.The woman, who was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi when her condition didn’t improve, died on September 29 of the injuries she suffered in the September 14 assault. Her forced pre-dawn cremation the following day triggered widespread public protests The two doctors who were removed by JNMC were Dr Mohammad Azimuddin Malik and Dr Obaid Imtiazyul Haque.Also Read | CBI questions youth who was first to reach crime spot in Hathras case againMalik had contradicted the version of UP police that the woman hadn’t been raped, saying the medical tests on her had been conducted too late to come to that conclusion. He questioned the gap between the day of the crime. September 14, and the day the tests were conducted, September 22. The UP police based their claim of no rape on a report by a forensic science lab, which received the samples on September 25. In a phone conversation, Dr Malik said that this may have led to his removal, but added that AMU authorities may be better aware of the reasons for his removal. “For concrete finding of rape, one needs to go for a test within four days of the incident and the test conducted after 11 days serves no purpose. This was all I had said and did not mention it in regard to the Hathras victim’s case,” said Dr Malik.Dr Haque said he was shocked at the termination of his services.“I joined when many of doctors at JNMC were ill and worked for two-and-a-half months amidst Covid-19, but came to known today (Tuesday) that my services are not required. I had not interacted with the media about the Hathras victim, which was sub judice, but had signed some medical papers related to the victim.” AMU authorities termed the removal of the doctors a routine administrative exercise;both Dr Malik and Dr Haque were working on leave vacancies after many doctors at JNMC had fallen ill and the hospital was in need of doctors. “Both these doctors were not permanent and were working on leave vacancy. Their term ended as regular doctors got well and joined their duties,” said Prof Shafey Kidwai, spokesperson for AMU. “A doctor on duty, even if contractual, is an authorised person assigned duty by the institution. His version should be acknowledged,” said a senior member of the Indian Medical Association, Lucknow, who requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-amu-removes-2-medical-officers/story-S5WygzatK22WrA7zzazL8L.html
21-10-2020||India||Farm laws: After Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan likely to follow suit||After Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan may be the next Congress-ruled states to introduce bills to counter the Centre’s farm reform bills in special sessions. Farmers’ leaders in different parts of the country, including those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), urged their state governments to follow suit for safeguarding the interests of cultivators.The Punjab assembly on Tuesday passed the bills and pledged to protect the interests of the state’s farmers, who are concerned that the central legislation would deprive them of government-fixed minimum support prices (MSPs) for their produce and put them at the mercy of big agribusinesses.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Tuesday proposed a special session of the state assembly on October 27 and 28 to introduce similar provisions.His proposal was returned by state governor Anusuiya Uikey, who sought the reason for holding the session. “In the proposal sent by the state government, the ‘subject’ of the special session was not mentioned, hence the governor has asked for it, and it is nothing more than that,” an official at Raj Bhavan said.Baghel told reporters that the governor cannot prevent a government that has a full majority from holding an assembly session. “If governor has made some queries, then we will file {responses} by Tuesday evening and I don’t think permission will not be granted after that,” he said. Rajasthan transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the Punjab bills were in the interests of farmers, and said the state government will soon call an assembly session to introduce similar bills. In September, the state government issued an order extending the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) law to the entire state to regulate private entities buying produce directly from farmers.With Punjab passing bills to provide farmers MSP protection, farmers’ bodies in neighbouring Haryana are building pressure on the state government led by the BJP to introduce similar safeguards. Like Punjab, 90% of the wheat and paddy produced in Haryana is procured by the government at MSPs.“Punjab chief minister has taken a bold step and now Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar should also follow him and pass similar laws in the assembly so that the farmers of Haryana continue to get the benefit of MSP,” said farmers’ leader Sewa Singh Arya.Haryana president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Gurnam Singh Charuni, said non-BJP state governments across the country should follow what he said was “the path the Punjab government has shown.” Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said the Congress government in Punjab was “misleading innocent farmers”.“Congress should stop playing politics over MSPs,” he said. Shivkumar Sharma, president of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, an organisation of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, said: “Punjab has taken a welcome step. I will request all the non-BJP ruled states to follow the Punjab model.”Madhya Pradesh’s farmers welfare and agriculture development minister Kamal Patel said: “Punjab government’s step in introducing its farm bills is a politically motivated move.”The BKU in Uttar Pradesh wants the state government to protect the interests of farmers. “We have not placed any demand to the Uttar Pradesh government to act like Punjab but we have been consistently demanding the Centre to amend the laws, addressing our reservations on some issues and also provide statutory guarantee on continuation of MSPs to farmers,” BKU leader Naresh Tikait said. A senior UP government official said on condition of anonymity that Uttar Pradesh had no plans to dilute the central laws. “Doing so is neither legally possible nor needed,” he said.

The proscribed Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) is expected to use both sectors to infiltrate terrorists across the Line of Control (LoC) in coming months, intelligence reports reviewed by HT suggest, with the help of remnants of erstwhile Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami (HuJI) network that are still operational in the area, and target Jammu and south Kashmir.According to a dossier prepared by Indian security agencies, these channels have been used in the past with terrorists involved in Nagrota army camp (November 2016), Sujwan (February 2018), Jhajjar Kotli (Sept 2018) and Nagrota toll plaza attack (January) having entered India through this channel, using the Bein nullah in Shakargarh to crossover into J & K.The dossier notes that Kashif Jan, Irfan Jhangvi and Shahid Latif, who coordinated the terror attack at Pathankot airbase in 2016, were actively involved in launching terrorists into India from Dehira and Sarjal in Shakargarh. A number of JeM terrorists have infiltrated India through the same route including Umar and Usman, sons of JeM’s chief Mazood Azhar, his elder brother and main accused in the 1999 IC-814 hijacking, Azhar Ibrahim, bodyguard of JeM’s defacto leader, Mufti Rauf Asghar, Mohammed Ismail, and an explosive trainer at Balakot camp , Rasheed Ghazi,. All these high profile terrorists infiltrated India in 2018.In January , senior JeM commanders Azhar Ibrahim and Masood Azhar’s son Abdullah are known to have supervised the terror group activities at launch pads in the Sialkot sector and regular movement of Jaish terror cadre has been reported there since February.Another Jaish operative Abdul Manan aka Doctor is also quite active in Sarjal in Shakargarh, according to the dossier. He was one of the key conspirators in the Nagrota Toll Plaza attack and works with a Pakistan-based Indian fugitive from Pulwama, Ashiq Ahmed Nangroo. A truck driver by profession, Nangroo is responsible for smuggling arms from Sialkot sector and move along the Jammu-Samba-Pathankot highway in the past.The Bhimber-Samani sector’s unique topography allows Pakistani terrorists easily access to Jammu-Rajauri-Shopian (Mughal Road) and enables them use this axis to carry out strikes in Jammu, Rajauri and Reasi and also allows them a route to tap south Kashmir, which is always on the boil.To push infiltrators, the Pakistani deep state has reactivated networks of former HuJI terrorist Nassarullah Masood Langryal, who is working through his key HuJI key operatives Mohammed Imran Zaffarwal of Bhimber in Occupied Kashmir and Tariq Bhai of Narowal in Pakistan Punjab, according to intelligence inputs. Langryal is also known to be in touch with a PoK based HuJI commander.Also Read | Pak fails to fulfil 6 key mandates of FATF; no action against Masood Azhar, Hafiz SaeedAccording to the dossier, given that the Taliban is its ideological Deobandi brother, the JeM has moved around 300-350 cadre for weapons training from Balakot and Peshawar camps in Pakistan to Taliban run camps in Kunar, Nuristan and Jalalabad provinces along the Durand Line.The dossier says that movement of terror cadre into Afghanistan could be to escape Balakot type of Indian air strike in the future or under pressure from Pakistan which is seeking to get itself white listed at the Paris plenary of FATF this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pak-terror-plan-to-use-2-routes-pathankot-airbase-attack-coordinator-is-key/story-7b6EzMslq1FSj9DvDpJcAM.html

Their families said crop damage and pressure of replaying debt pushed them to suicide.The body of one of the farmers, who was 35 years old, was found in a highly decomposed state hanging from a tree on Friday. He was reported missing on October 5. A member of his family said the 35-year-old was overburdened with loans due to damage to his crops over the last two years. “He sowed soybean seeds this year in his two-acre farm and but this year, too, the crop was damaged and he got the farmland levelled. Since then he was upset. He has two daughters...”Sub-divisional police officer Anurag Pandey said the farmer’s body has been sent for a post-mortem examination. “An investigation is going on.”The son of the second farmer, who was 50-year-old, said his father’s body was also found hanging from a tree. “My father was shattered as there was no growth in the crop in our agricultural field. He had taken a loan from moneylenders for farming also that he was not able to repay it.”Pooja Sharma, a local police officer, said the cause of death, in this case, can be ascertained only after the farmer’s post-mortem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-farmers-found-dead-in-madhya-pradesh-s-sagar-suicide-suspected/story-2AjJLXr1j2xKjSwO8Vrc3M.html

The rainfall may increase from October 21. Probability of rain is more between October 22 and 24,” said an official at IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Kolkata.North Bengal is likely to get some rain also in the run-up to the festival.Durga Puja will be celebrated from October 23 to October 26. But the festivities and pandal hopping are expected to start on October 19.“A low pressure is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal around October 19. It could intensify thereafter. The system is expected to move towards Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Moisture-laden winds from the sea will gush because of this, triggering rain,” said the official quoted above.October and November are part of the post-monsoon cyclone period and such systems often develop over the sea around this time. Some of the systems intensify into cyclones. Cyclone Bulbul, which killed scores of people, hit West Bengal in November 2019.The monsoon withdrawal from West Bengal is also likely to get delayed because of the low-pressure system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rains-expected-in-bengal-during-durga-puja-says-imd/story-bs2dcY2M3gPFNagtCRm8gI.html
21-10-2020||Editorials||The growing federal discord||In India’s governance scheme, both the Centre and the states derive their authority from the Constitution. A specific set of subjects, outlined in the Union and State Lists, delineates responsibilities, while both units of government have powers over areas in the Concurrent List. But beyond the technical division of powers, Centre-state relations have been governed by the political dynamics of the moment and gone through different phases — of a strong Centre and relatively pliant states, both ruled by the Congress, in the first four decades after Independence; of a weakening Centre and stronger states, with the emergence of the coalition era and regional parties between 1989 and 2014; and of a strong Centre and weaker states, both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) post-2014. But this equilibrium is shaken, primarily because of the BJP’s growing unilateralism at the Centre and diminished control over states. Forces which are in the Opposition at the Centre govern a range of important states — including Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, and West Bengal. This means that when there are contentious legislations, which are opposed by these parties at the Centre, states governed by them begin asserting themselves and carving out their own policy positions. The sparring over the terms of reference of the Fifteenth Finance Commission (with southern states worried about allocation if new population figures are taken into account), the controversies around the Goods and Services Tax regime (with states unhappy with the Centre for failing to meet its commitments on compensation payments); the spate of resolutions in assemblies against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act; the debate around the role of governors; and now, Punjab’s decision to bring in its own legislative framework on the farm bills all point to a new trend. This new trend — of a fracture in ties between the Centre and states ruled by non-BJP formations — is worrying. A degree of political jostling is inevitable and parties have to take positions to protect the interests of their base. At the same time, on key governance and policy issues, the breakdown of the federal consensus can undermine the cohesion of administrative structures, bring in scattered and fragmented policies in different geographies depending on who is ruling, and deepen regional divisions. The BJP must be more consultative in its political approach; the other parties must be more respectful of constitutional norms and electoral mandates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-growing-federal-discord/story-2JH9pbCW9eudefYShGohiO.html
21-10-2020||Editorials||Being a woman politician in India||Madhya Pradesh (MP)’s former chief minister and Congress leader, Kamal Nath’s sexist remark against state minister, Imarti Devi, merits unequivocal condemnation. It is to the credit of the Congress’ former president, Rahul Gandhi, that he has pulled up his senior party colleague and expressed his disagreement with the language used by Mr Nath. And it is Mr Nath’s failure that he is yet to express an unqualified apology for the incident. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has used the remark to mount an aggressive campaign against what it calls the Congress’ anti-women attitude.The episode, however, throws up a larger question about the challenges faced by women in politics. At every step — joining a political party; participating in political programmes; working with male colleagues and experiencing varying degrees of harassment; getting a ticket; winning elections; finding space within power structures; and dealing with misogyny and often sexist taunts and accusations — women have it far more difficult than men in India’s political theatre. And no party is an exception.While the current Lok Sabha has the highest number of women representatives in its history, it still falls short of the promise of 33% seats (which is in the long-pending women’s reservation bill). But representation is only one, though critical, element of women’s participation in politics. How women politicians are perceived and how their colleagues and opponents frame their approach on the question of gender are equally important. Mr Nath’s statement reflects a larger mindset — and until this mindset is fought and defeated, the quest for gender equality in the political space will remain unmet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/being-a-woman-politician-in-india/story-oEElUcSw58jjyluuinqhoJ.html
21-10-2020||Editorials||Get the vaccine strategy right||Over the past week, India’s top leaders and officials have proffered more clues about when and how the country plans to begin vaccinations for Covid-19. Mass volumes are likely to begin shipping around March, if the trial and the approval process follow projected timelines. The first shots will likely be administered as the country heads into the next summer. Initially, somewhere around a fifth-to-a-quarter of the population, accounting for the most vulnerable and those at the highest risk, are likely to get it. The specifics are likely to be complicated, as they need to strike a balance between what India can achieve, given its institutional capacity, and what it must in a short period of time, to secure its citizens. Among the clues into India’s strategy is a crucial confirmation by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi himself. On Monday, the PM said a vaccine delivery system was in the works and it will utilise the upcoming national digital health ID — an initiative that he first announced during his Independence Day speech. This is crucial for two reasons. First, it appears to address how authorities will administer and track the coronavirus immunisation of possibly each of the country’s 1.3 billion-plus citizens. The process, unprecedented in scale for any democracy, needs to be precise, efficient and quick. A viable vaccine is likely to be in two doses, with a predetermined gap in between.Second, it will mark the rollout of one of the world’s most ambitious public health management systems — the National Digital Health Mission. The idea behind the programme is to digitise the health records of citizens. Its benefits, especially in the context of the coronavirus immunisation, are clear, for it will provide easy access to standardised data. But its rollout in the context of the pandemic can also be controversial. India is yet to adopt a personal data protection legislative framework, and if access to a Covid-19 vaccine is made contingent on signing up for a national health ID, the programme becomes virtually mandatory. Till now, officials have said that sign-ups are voluntary. To be sure, the specifics of the vaccine delivery are still not final. These details will need to balance legal, ethical and, ultimately, public health considerations before they are set in stone. Getting the vaccine strategy right is critical for the entire edifice of the recovery process from the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/get-the-vaccine-strategy-right/story-1uCzov0lp48i32GZ5QVwFN.html
