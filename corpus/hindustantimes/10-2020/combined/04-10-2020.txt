The Indian Army has conceded that the Armed Forces Special Protection Act (AFSPA) — meant to provide protection to its men operating in conflict areas — was “exceeded”. An initial enquiry conducted by it has established that three youth from Rajouri, who had travelled for work to South Kashmir’s Shopian, were likely killed in a fake encounter. Their DNA samples have matched with their family members, who had written to the UT’s Lieutenant -Governor (L-G), Manoj Sinha, seeking justice. Their bodies have now been exhumed and taken home for burial in compliance with legal procedures; this speaks further of the Army’s transgression. The fake encounter is a test case for the new L-G who is seeking to reach out to an angry population, stunned by the sudden and overnight hollowing out of Article 370 that gave the former state its special status. Sinha needs to ensure that the disciplinary proceedings, initiated by the Army after the initial enquiry established excesses under AFSPA, are taken to their logical conclusion. The post-mortem report of the young men reveals that their deaths were caused by “multiple firearm injuries causing hemorrhagic shock, leading to cardio-respiratory arrest and death”. There are too many instances of the Army shielding its own men despite their having been proved guilty. In the past, ordinary Kashmiris have been passed off as foreign terrorists after they have been killed and their bodies burnt. In 2010, Kashmiris took to the streets after the Army killed three civilians in a fake encounter and passed them off as infiltrating terrorists. The violation was proved beyond a doubt. Unsuspecting civilians had been lured to Machil, a forward sector along the Line of Control, and killed in cold blood. Despite an Army court martial pronouncing five of its men guilty and sentencing them for life, the Armed Forces Tribunal suspended the sentence, arguing that civilians ought not to have been in a forward location, wearing “Pathan suits”. In 2016 too, the civilian toll crossed 100 after stone pelters — angry with the killing of militant commander Burhan Wani — took to the streets. Kashmir gave vent to deep anger and betrayal — not only because Wani was eliminated — but because the trust deficit between the Valley and Delhi had eroded over the years. The pellet gun became the symbol of oppression. It blinded, maimed and killed. The government, however, dismissed a report released by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in July last year. The report called out the basic tenets of injustice: “There is no information about any new investigation into excessive use of force leading to casualties. There is no information on the status of the five investigations launched into extrajudicial executions in 2016… No prosecutions have been reported.” The government — both at the Centre and in the UT — needs to pursue justice for the Rajouri families who had sent their sons in search of sustenance. The three had rented a room, not far from an Army camp, but their bullet-ridden bodies were found in an apple orchard, about 12 km away. These brazen killings must not go unpunished, not only because they are a violation of human rights; but also because, in Kashmir, they feed into the cycle of violence. Sinha has been attempting several outreach programmes. He also visited the hallowed Hazrat Bal mosque in Srinagar but the people are not going to respond to such optics. Several standard operating procedures appear to have been given a miss on July 18 when the three young men were killed. The Army went into an operation alone, instead of taking the local police along. The three were not given a chance to surrender as is common practice during most encounters. All of this will, of course, be examined in the course of the disciplinary proceedings. The clear message, at the end of the day, must be that the lives of the residents of Jammu and Kashmir matter. This is imperative. The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/shopian-deaths-ensure-justice-break-the-cycle-of-violence/story-mEBpoBHuphL1NBmdW7rXgN.html
04-10-2020||News||AI: A force for social empowerment||The success of Digital India has set a new global benchmark for leveraging digital technologies for inclusive growth, good governance and empowerment. The benefits of digital technologies have now become accessible for everyone. Rapidly-changing technology requires continuous evolution of systems, faster regulatory responses and building capacities. The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just an incremental change, but a paradigm shift which must be harnessed for humanity’s well-being. Data is the basic building block for any AI system. India, with over 700 million internet subscribers, 1.21 billion phone-users and 1.26 billion Aadhaar users generates massive amounts of data daily. It has the largest user-base for some of the major global internet companies; it also offers the most affordable internet services in the world; and the information technology (IT) sector ensures the availability of competent human resources. These, coupled with the leadership of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, a champion of technology as a way to improve people’s lives, puts India at the cusp of the AI revolution. In 2018, the National AI Strategy was published by the government. Since then, there have been several initiatives to develop a strong AI ecosystem. The Centre of Excellence in Data Analytics (CEDA) has been established to provide expert data analytics services to government departments. In collaboration with the IT industry, Centres of Excellence have been set up in Bengaluru, Gandhinagar, Gurugram and Visakhapatnam where, so far, 113 start-ups have been incubated, 29 Intellectual Properties have been generated, and 56 sectoral solutions have been developed. The Future Skills Prime online capacity-building platform has been launched to skill and reskill professionals in emerging technologies and in new job roles. The National AI Portal has been launched as a one-stop digital platform for collaboration and knowledge-sharing in AI. Soon, the ministry of electronics and IT (MEITY) will launch the National Programme on AI. Learning from public digital platforms such as Aadhaar, Unified Payments Interface, Goods and Services Tax Network and Government e-Markeplace, the government has decided to encourage the setting up of several public digital platforms in health, agriculture, education, logistics and language translations. With the announcement of the National Digital Health Mission, work on a public digital platform for health has begun. MEITY is developing an AI-based Natural Language Translation Mission in collaboration with academic institutions, research institutions, industry and start-ups which will pave the way for a voice-enabled internet in Indian languages. Several ministries in collaboration with industry, academia and start-ups are in different stages of finalising sectoral public digital platforms. These will offer AI-based services while addressing the data security and privacy concerns of users.Developments in technology also raise concerns. When large-scale computerisation was undertaken, there were concerns about mass unemployment. But eventually, computers and IT became one of the biggest job creators. In the same way, AI will replace certain existing job roles but also create several new job profiles. The world needs to manage this transition effectively so that it does not aggravate societal disparities. Through initiatives such as Future Skills Prime, India has already started work on reskilling its workforce for future job roles in IT. India’s approach towards responsible AI for social empowerment seeks to leverage AI for inclusive growth and empowerment while addressing concerns over exclusion and job redundancy. The vision to use AI in health care, agriculture, education, logistics and languages is inspired by our commitment to leverage AI for social empowerment. Data resources are going to play a vital role in AI’s development, but concerns regarding the misuse of data and breach of privacy of users must be addressed by AI systems. The government has already introduced a robust Personal Data Protection Bill in Parliament, which seeks to protect the privacy of users in the digital age while facilitating the development of a strong data economy. Any attempt to create a monopoly in the digital space by misusing the data of citizens will invite a strong response from the government. The action taken against certain mobile apps recently clearly indicates that the Modi government is committed to protect the data privacy of Indian citizens and India’s data sovereignty. AI also generates other ethical and legal concerns that must be addressed. Algorithms that define the set of rules to operate AI systems must be free of any biases and prejudices. For example, face recognition systems must not display any racial or ethnic biases and news and social media systems must not be biased towards any particular political ideology. Conventional laws based on the basic premise of jurisdictions are being challenged by transnational technologies. Rogue elements situated in any part of the world can disrupt peace in other societies. We saw this in the recent Citizenship (Amendment) Act agitations and the Delhi riots. The world needs to collectively address these concerns. India is one of the founding-members of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence — a multilateral collective to develop responsible AI, and is also working with several countries bilaterally to develop AI ecosystems. India’s biggest AI summit RAISE 2020, which begins on Monday, seeks global collaboration for the development of an AI ecosystem that is responsible towards humanity and committed to social empowerment.

04-10-2020||News||Broaden the idea of a smart city in India | Opinion||On September 20, New York City (NYC)’s “iconic” buildings were lit up in green for the launch of the week-long global Climate Week NYC, which coincided with the United Nations General Assembly session. The summit was the first big one (virtual) in this Covid-19 year, and was held in the backdrop of an ongoing global conversation on the need for the world to chart a new green development path.While globally, cities are struggling to tackle the impact of the climate crisis (with heat waves, cold waves, flash floods and cyclones among others issues), many have also become hubs of climate action. They are thinking of innovative ways to reduce temperatures and make their urban environments sustainable and liveable for their residents by designing and constructing buildings that need less energy to run and employ passive means of climate control. For example, Chicago and Toronto are building rooftop gardens; Milan is building vertical forests; and Madsar City in Abu Dhabi is building houses close to each other so that they can provide shading to public walkways, and also prioritising walking and cycling over polluting cars.Unfortunately, the responses of India’s cities to the climate crisis are still at a nascent stage. In fact, they have “little incentive to act”, writes Radhika Khosla and Ankit Bharadwaj in India in a Warming World. Therefore, most cities do not mention, let alone adequately address the climate challenge in their development plans. Recently, however, there has been a policy nudge from the Centre: It unveiled the Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework 2.0 that provides a road map and technical expertise to cities to combat the crisis.It will make eminent sense for India to invest in climate-resilient planning now as the country is still urbanising. How cities are built over the next decade will, as Khosla and Bharadwaj argue, condition how most Indians live until the end of the century: In the choice of building types; in how they expend energy; in the amount of distance travelled; and the way in which distances are covered. These choices will have material consequences for air, water, congestion, energy, and the climate crisis.India’s cities, however, must look for their own solutions, starting with meeting the basic requirement in a warmer world: Make housing climate-friendly so that they don’t need excessive energy for air-conditioning, and also are good enough to protect those who cannot afford artificial cooling from heat waves. To do this, first, buildings must stick to the basic principles: Shade, insulate, use reflective roofing, ventilate. Second, planners, developers and buyers must stop aspiring for glass-and-steel monoliths (such as the “iconic” buildings of NYC). While huge glass facades may work well in colder climates because they lock-in heat, in India, these constructions become “solar cooker” buildings, guzzling huge amounts of energy for air-conditioning, which, in turn, heat up the atmosphere. In addition, taller buildings need more steel, cement, aluminium and glass which have deep carbon footprints. Third, at a policy level, the Centre must push the states to weave the Bureau of Energy Efficiency’s energy conservation code into their building by-laws. Fourth, cities must invest to improve microclimate by investing in green roofs, parks, gardens, green facades and water bodies.India must also look back to plan for the future. The country’s heritage towns and traditional architecture are great examples of how built up areas can be cooler and improve microclimate. For example, the narrow lanes of Jaisalmer were built in a way that the buildings shaded not just the streets, but also the building in front. Historians say the winding streets were meant to confuse enemy armies, but climate experts argue they helped deflect the desert sun and help the free-flow of the southwesterly wind.A city might be smart in its use of technology, but it would not be smart if it does not provide a liveable environment and harms the ecosystem in which it is built, says a World Economic Forum report. The recent climate-related emergencies in India’s cities have given us fair warning of what the future would look like if sustainability is not kept at the core of the planning process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/broaden-the-idea-of-a-smart-city-in-india-opinion/story-BNEvtNMix3poyURtDbE3IJ.html
04-10-2020||City||Sushant Singh Rajput death investigation: Congress, BJP trade barbs||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress traded barbs at each other yet again over the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR). The spat began after the BJP wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, questioning why the Mumbai Police didn’t make any arrest in the drug links in the case and asked if there was any deliberate attempt to hide any political connection. In response, the Congress hit back, terming the BJP’s letter a “face-saving attempt”, after its conspiracy to gain political mileage from the SSR episode boomeranged. In his letter, BJP legislator Ram Kadam asked why the Mumbai Police did not probe the drug angle, despite doing the investigation for the initial 65 days. “The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) made 19 arrests in connection with the drug dealing in Bollywood and on the basis of the chat messages, they recovered from Rhea Chakraborty. Why was similar action not taken by the Mumbai Police? Was there pressure on the police to not take any action in drug dealing? Was it an attempt to save some mighty people? In its attempt, the state government has maligned the image of city police,” stated the letter. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The police department was headed by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for five years, why did he not ask the police to investigate drug dealing in Bollywood? The BJP made big noise in the Rajput case and hatched a conspiracy to malign the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra. Social media was used to generate sentiments against Maharashtra. The probe was handed over to CBI, which could find nothing wrong in the case. An inquiry by the SIT should be initiated against the conspiracy,” he said. Sawant has also questioned why NCB has not been probing involvement of Ssandip Singh, who was the producer of a biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite having faced charges in drug dealing. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Congress has planned protests in all districts on Monday over the Hathras incident. State unit chief Balasaheb Thorat said, “The protest will be staged in all districts on Monday and the agitation will continue until the family gets justice. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has no right to continue in the chair after the incident and the way the case was handled. We are surprised that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who chanted the slogan ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ is silent on the entire episode.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-singh-rajput-death-investigation-congress-bjp-trade-barbs/story-3AYr9Xlpx1eM8P484vxiBJ.html

The minor had gone to stay at her uncle’s home in Bhiwandi two months ago as schools were closed. During her stay, the accused threatened the girl and raped her several times. According to Ganeshpuri police, the accused’s wife filed a complaint with the police after she discovered the crime. She told police that she had brought her eight-year-old niece from her village to her house two months back. The accused, a labourer, was at home since the lockdown. His wife would do odd jobs at shops or as a domestic help. Mahesh Sagade, in-charge, Ganeshpuri police station, said, “The accused had been raping the girl while his wife was out. He had threatened the girl but after suffering from severe pain, she told her aunt about the attacks. We have arrested the accused under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-year-old-girl-raped-by-uncle-in-bhiwandi/story-CWFKyy8IKbnpuqrVyGp6vM.html
04-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai schools participate in Climate Action Project, introduce related curriculum||Several schools in the city will participate in Climate Action Project, an international initiative that aims to create awareness about climate change and environmental threats amongst school children. Through the project, schools will teach a six-week curriculum on climate change in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Jane Goodall Institute and United Nations (UN). A total of 107 countries are a part of the initiative. City-based schools like Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School (CNMS) in Vile Parle, Sanjivani International School in Navi Mumbai and Navy Children’s School, Colaba are participating in the project. “Climate change is real and it’s high time we start talking about it at the school level. Through this initiative, we want students to participate in the crusade against climate change,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal, CNMS and climate action ambassador with the project. Schools will start teaching the curriculum from this month, and will gradually introduce different themes and concepts related to climate change and environmental hazards. As part of the six-week programme, schools will not only include climate change and climate action as part of their everyday teaching but will also encourage students to take up several activities like environmental awareness drives, tree plantation programmes, etc. “We have started the programme at our school and to begin with, geography teachers have been entrusted with the responsibility of teaching the curriculum. Just last week, we had a conversation with students about Greta Thunberg and showed them one of her talks to encourage them to talk about climate action,” said Vandana Saxena, principal, Sanjivani International School. Sanghvi said more schools in the city are likely to join the campaign in the coming days. “We have sent out an appeal to several schools and have also written to the state education department in this regard. We hope that more schools participate for the good cause,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-schools-participate-in-climate-action-project-introduce-related-curriculum/story-SYqOyaIYoxRLDtHqXJz96K.html

However, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari in his order had said that the decision to open schools will be taken by the district administration, on the basis of the local situation with respect to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, as well as in consultation with schools.“We have chalked out different measures which will be put in place when schools reopen. We have proposed that initially they will be opened only for classes 10 and 12 and there will be two shifts of three hours each. In the next phase, we plan to allow students of classes nine and eleven. The names of students will be put on respective seats and not more than 20 students will be allowed in one class. There will be no operation of air conditioners and students shall not share food/water etc., with fellow students,” said Subhash Jain, president of ISFI.The measures have disallowed canteen and playground facilities and barred assemblies. The health protocols of mandatory wearing of masks, social distancing and thermal screening at entry gates will also be taken up.The school premises will also have posters and boards displaying different precautionary measures needed for protection against Covid-19.“We are still brainstorming whether to resume transport facilities, while keeping in mind the number of students who will come for classes. The decision will be taken up at a later stage and we are also waiting for the standard operating procedures (SOPs) which are to be issued by the government,” Jain, added.He said that consent of about 50-65% of parents has already been received by about 40 of the member schools while it is in process for others. The list of measures prepared by the ISFI will also be communicated to the district administration on Monday.The UP government guidelines had said that students will be allowed to attend only with the written consent of parents and that no school will be allowed to make parent consent mandatory.“A lot of time was devoted to chalk out measures for safety of students and staff as well. In our schools, we have parents of 57% of students who have given their consent for allowing their children to attend school. Besides, all of these parents who have consented have requested for provision of transport facility. We will be rolling out measures and expect that teams from the administration/health department inspect the premises and certify compliance before schools open up classes,” said Jyoti Gupta, director of DPS Sahibabad and member of ISFI. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said safety measures are necessary in wake of the pandemic.“Apart from measures listed by ISFI, the administration, along with the health department, will mull over additional measures. A list of final measures will be chalked out before schools open up. We expect all schools to strictly adhere to guidelines and implement all health protocols. Once schools open up, our teams will conduct surprise inspections to ascertain whether all guidelines are being followed,” he added.Members of the district parents’ association, however, said many of them are not willing to send their wards to school due to health risks brought on by the pandemic.“At the ground level, it will be difficult to contain children when they are in school and among their friends. Many parents are still not willing to send their children to school as they feel that the children could contract the virus and no one will come forward to take responsibility. From Monday, we will start sending mails to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the Uttar Pradesh government as well as the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights for intervention and deferring the opening of schools,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of the Ghaziabad Parents’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-schools-gear-up-for-graded-opening-chalk-out-safety-measures/story-bwMp3AMidK4o3GIxBZ5XjI.html
04-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC to plan distribution of Covid-19 vaccine across Mumbai||With the case tally crossing two lakh last week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will in the next two months draw up a strategy for distribution of vaccine for Covid-19, which is expected to be available in the coming months. According to BMC, initially, 30% of the city’s total population of over 1.24 crore, including frontline workers and senior citizens, will need vaccine. The civic body plans to take help of private hospitals, along with government and civic-run hospitals for vaccine distribution. The strategy will be drawn after BMC’s door-to-door survey under ‘My Family-My Responsibility’ initiative concludes in the last week of October. Starting September 15, BMC, with the help of 5,000 teams consisting 15,000 frontline staff, has started to screen citizens for Covid-19 symptoms. Along with it, the civic body is also educating citizens about safety and precautions to be undertaken for living with Covid-19 in the coming months. The civic body said it will have to use the network of civic hospitals, clinics, health centres, maternity homes along with several private hospitals in the city to give vaccines to the vulnerable group. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, said, “The arrival of the vaccine may take some time, but we will start our planning from November, once the ‘My family-My Responsibility’ programme is completed. The programme will give us data on individuals or groups who need to get the vaccine first. The planning for the vulnerable target group can be done in a week. Whenever the vaccine arrives, we can give it to this vulnerable target audience within 15 days using our civic-run health infrastructure and with the help of private health care institutions.”BMC officials said they also have some data on senior citizens, who were screened as part of initiative to bring down the mortality rate. The civic body has screened over 10 lakh senior citizens and recommended several of them opt for oxygen therapy, as their oxygen levels were low. Several Covid-19 cases among senior citizens were also identified owing to this drive, BMC officials said. BMC also said the vaccine distribution strategy will be amended from time-to-time based on the guidelines from the Central and state government. The Central government has already formed an expert committee comprising representatives from all relevant ministries and institutions to oversee all aspects of its Covid-19 vaccine plan, from identification of the vaccine to buying to financing the purchase to distribution and administration.A week ago, BMC kicked off trials of Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Oxford University. The trial is being undertaken at the civic-run KEM Hospital. Kakani said, “We are going to conduct trials on around 100 individuals to start with, and they will be monitored for around six months to check the reaction to the vaccine. We are also conducting trials using anti-tuberculosis vaccination (TB) — Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) – vaccine. In the BCG vaccine, we will monitor the patients for at least three months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-plan-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccine-across-mumbai/story-QH4dsK1RvS34u5Qe1It6xH.html

The bench was hearing an application by Mumbai resident Dileep Nevatia challenging the coastal zone regulation (CRZ) clearance granted to the project.“MMRDA has incurred a total cost of ₹1,356,807,548 towards compliance with the impugned CRZ clearance and environment impact reduction as of August 31,” the read MMRDA’s affidavit recently submitted before the NGT. HT has a copy of the document which further read, “Allegations by the appellant that the MTHL project will negatively impact the environment is misconceived and does not present the entire picture.”According to MMRDA’s submissions, ₹5.05 crore had been allocated for compensatory mangrove afforestation entrusted to the state mangrove cell across 200 hectares. Of the ₹5.05 crore, ₹2.79 crore was paid on December 4, 2019, and was used for plantations across 105 hectares (ha) in Palghar and Mumbai suburbs. The remaining ₹2.76 crore will be spent on plantations over the next six years on 118 ha of land identified in Palghar. For mitigation of marine water pollution caused by nearby industries in the Mahul-Sewri creek area, MMRDA allocated ₹5.8 crore to the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) for undertaking a water quality study and developing an effluent treatment plan for the creek. MMRDA paid ₹86.31 crore to the Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (an autonomous body that assists the mangrove cell in coastal marine conservation) for a host of environmentally benefitting activities.Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell), said, “All payments have been received for various research projects, conservation activities, mangrove mapping, infrastructure development, and corpus funds for the foundation. Some of the funds have already been spent while the rest are slated for proposed aids of coastal and marine ecosystems.” The Mangrove Foundation was also paid ₹31.92 crore for habitat quality assessment and migratory bird monitoring program for MTHL. The foundation, in turn, appointed the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) to prepare periodical reports on monitoring of flamingos and other avifauna.Lastly, MMRDA paid ₹6.59 crore to the Alibag forest department, to identify degraded non-forest land, declaring it as reserved forest and undertaking compensatory tree plantation across 47.4 ha area. “MMRDA has taken all requisite and necessary steps to ensure all requirements as mandated by the Union environment ministry and Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (both CRZ clearance issuing authorities) are satisfied,” the affidavit said.The NGT in 2015, under the same application, had rejected the CRZ clearance issued to MMRDA and the planning agency was forced to get a new clearance by January 2016 post which an environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared and construction began.BG Pawar, joint commissioner, MMRDA said the entire MTHL project cost was around ₹20,000 crore. “Of this, ₹135 crore has been carefully allocated towards environment conservation based on the EMP prepared by an appointed consultant. The key focus has been to ensure there is no harm to the ecology and our mitigation plans have seen this through with a substantial amount of construction completed.”Meanwhile, HT had reported on August 30 about BNHS’ report that identified a marked decline in bird numbers at Sewri near the MTHL construction site. Flamingo numbers were 13,813 in January 2019 and 60,733 in March 2019, which fell to 4,395 in January 2020 and 4,106 in March 2020. The report, however, carried a caveat that MTHL construction impact on birds, whether temporary or permanent, could be inferred only after five years of post-construction monitoring.MMRDA’s affidavit explained that their contractors had been maintaining photographic and video evidence (also submitted to NGT) of flamingos from May 2018 to February 2020. “The submissions clearly show substantial flamingo numbers thereby belying the contentions of the appellant,” the affidavit said. Pawar said construction equipment was fitted with mufflers and exhaust silencers to contain noise levels, and barriers were placed to restrict construction or movement near mudflats. “A special lighting system (warm white coloured light 3,000K temperature) had been provided to ensure birds were not disturbed during night-time construction,” he said. Environmentalists said payments being made to safeguard the environment were less than 1% of the total project cost and after the project is completed, much larger environment destruction was expected. “MTHL will be a gateway for opening up ecologically sensitive areas of Uran and Ulwe for development. It will allow real estate and industrial activities by destroying wetlands and mangrove forests towards the eastern seafront and reclaim remaining bird habitats recommended for protection,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust.GREEN FUNDS FOR MTHL TO PAY FOR GIANTS OF THE SEA MUSEUM IN AIROLIOf the ₹86.31 crore paid to the Mangrove Foundation for environmental impact reduction for the MTHL project, ₹10 crore will be used for the construction of the country’s first solar-powered marine mammal museum - Giants of the Sea – at the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre at Airoli, Navi Mumbai. The museum will house skeletal remains of endangered marine species such as the Bryde’s whale, sperm whale, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins and finless porpoises, which will all be on display. A separate area has been allocated for housing skeletal remains of turtles that washed ashore along with different areas of the Mumbai coastline. The entire five-acre complex will be powered by solar with the museum built across 2-acres. Other features include a kilometre-long boardwalk through mangrove forests in the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary, new interactive displays on marine biodiversity along Maharashtra’s coast, a watchtower for bird enthusiasts and to witness the expanse of mangrove cover at Thane creek, an entrance plaza, a visitors centre, and a parking space for tourists.NOISE BARRIERS POST MTHL CONSTRUCTION TO AVOID DISTURBANCE TO BIRDSMMRDA has decided to install sound barriers (micro-perforated or rockwool barriers that reduce traffic noise on either side of an elevated road by 75-80%) along the entire length of the 21.8 km MTHL bridge post-construction. “Barriers will be placed on both sides of the bridge especially in areas passing through flamingo congregations on mudflats to ensure minimum disturbance to migratory birds.

04-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses relief to Ordnance Factory Board exam aspirants||After a gap of almost seven years, a division bench of the Bombay high court (HC) conducted a hearing on Sunday. The chief justice conducted hearings of two petitions filed by 10 persons who sought urgent relief with regards to the recruitment exams of the Ordnance Factory which start from October 5. The limited relief sought by petitioners was to be permitted to appear for the exams as they were held once every four years. The court, however, refused to intervene as they had not challenged the eligibility criteria for the recruitment exams. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petitions of Mahesh Bhalke and others through video conferencing, was informed that they were working in an ammunition factory and were pursuing diploma courses for chargeman in various institutes affiliated to the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE). The advocate submitted that the final exams of the diploma course were to be held in April/May but were postponed due to the pandemic. He further submitted that they were desirous of appearing for the recruitment exam for the post of chargeman announced by the Ordnance Factory Board in May. However, as the final exams of their diploma course were pending, they were deemed ineligible for the recruitment exams. Hence, they approached Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) seeking relief in the form of waiving of the eligibility criteria, but after CAT refused, they approached the HC. The advocate for the petitioners submitted that as the exam was held once every four years and there was a proposal for privatization in the near future, they did not want to miss out on the opportunity to appear for the recruitment exams. After hearing the submissions, the court said, “We are fully sympathetic to your case as you have said in your petition that this job opportunity comes only once in four years. But a Supreme Court (SC) judgment stares us in the face,” said Datta, adding that the Apex court judgement said that if a candidate was not eligible on the last date of application, an employer could not be held liable to allow the applicant. The last date of applying for the recruitment exams was June 15. The bench then said that as the recruitment notification and the eligibility criteria of having passed diploma course was not challenged in the petition, it could not intervene and dismissed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-relief-to-ordnance-factory-board-exam-aspirants/story-2kxZn5TAr2EnaHp8hvjuYN.html

Hathras DM be suspended and not given a big post. 3. Why our daughter’s body was burnt using petrol without our permission? 4. Why are we being repeatedly misled and threatened? 5. We brought ‘flowers’ from the funeral pyre, but how do we believe that this dead body is that of our daughter?” she tweeted in Hindi.“It is the right of this family to get answers to these questions and the UP government will have to give these answers,” the Congress leader added.Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Congress workers and leaders across the state had taken to the streets to get justice for the victim’s family.They held demonstrations across all districts of the state on Sunday.In Lucknow, the Congress workers protested at the GPO park, demanding action against the Hathras district magistrate.

Manpreet Singh Bunty, president of the Akalgarh Market Shopkeepers Association, said, “It is a huge boost to the city’s economy. Earlier, the trade was being done through middlemen as the buyer could not visit the markets. But today, customers visited the market to purchase products which is a positive sign for us,” said Bunty.On the other hand, Mamta, a sales manager at a clothing store in Chaura Bazar, said that a huge rush was witnessed in the market from morning till evening.“Despite farmer protests and disrupted train services, each shop managed to have made some sales. It is a positive beginning. As the weather is changing, we are expecting more business next week.” said Mamta.However, the customers remain absent from upmarket shopping destinations located at Mall Road and Ghumar Mandi. “Due to prolonged lockdown and government restrictions, a majority of our customers have shifted on the online platform. However, some have begun visiting and, we are expecting to bounce back during the festive season,” said Sunil Mehra, a cloth merchant at Ghumar Mandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lifting-of-sunday-lockdown-brings-back-life-to-ludhiana-markets/story-NHdGTXXwNMJyPuKhhQj7eM.html
04-10-2020||Chandigarh||IT Park project: CHB to build EWS houses elsewhere||Decks have been cleared for the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to build the mandatory housing units for the economically weaker section (EWS) on another location within the city instead of the proposed group housing project at the IT Park.A sub-committee of the UT administrator’s advisory council — standing committee on urban infrastructure and planning for the city — has approved the CHB’s proposal to shift EWS housing scheme from IT Park.“The CHB will be given a one-time exception and be allowed to build the EWS housing units somewhere else than the IT Park group housing project. The exception will, however, neither be applicable for any other project in the IT park nor to any private builder,” said a senior UT official. Notably, in every project, either government or private, a portion of the units or land has to be reserved for EWS. Officials said that UT has followed the Punjab’s policy on government housing projects to allow shifting of the EWS units out of the IT park project.“The committee’s approval will be submitted before the advisory council and views of its members will be taken before the decision is put into action,” the officials added.The project is planned on 17 acres on two sites at the IT Park, and will comprise 784 flats, offering four, three and two bedrooms, besides facilities such as a swimming pool and gym. In 2015, the board got back 123 acres of prime land from Parsvnath Developers and decided to develop residential housing there on 20 sites after it couldn’t get buyers for the land. About seven acre land has also been earmarked for flats for the officers of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. This project comprises EWS flats as well. The administration plans to allow development of 18 sites for housing projects by private developers.The administration’s contention is that shifting EWS flats to another site will increase the number of flats to be offered on sale to the general public and will lower the prices of the units. CHB will now prepare a detailed plan and proposal for the shifting of the EWS housing units.Approved by the administrator last month, the IT Park Housing scheme is likely to be floated by the end of this year or early next year. CHB is awaiting environment clearance for the project, even as the flats’ pricing has also to be finalised.According to CHB officials, the flats will be priced based on the current collector rates, and will likely cost higher than its existing housing projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/it-park-project-chb-to-build-ews-houses-elsewhere/story-tFRvgETPmKPPfTu9ETuyEN.html

04-10-2020||Chandigarh||2,615 adults went missing in 2019 in Chandigarh, only 18.5% traced||These are grim statistics. Only 18.5% adults out of 2,617 persons who went missing in Chandigarh were traced till the end of 2019, making it the lowest recovery rate among the union territories (UT), reveals data released recently by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Women outnumbered men, with 1,373 reported missing as against 1,244 males and 528 children (226 boys and 302 girls). Only 16.1% adult males returned home, which is also the lowest recovery rate in the UTs. On the likely reasons for the disappearances, a police official said many adults left home to “pursue dreams” or because of love affairs.Unfortunately, elderly persons were abandoned by families not willing to take care of them. “Adults make a conscious decision to leave home,” feels Rajesh Gill, who teaches at Panjab University’s department of sociology. “The will of the family to bring back the loved one who has gone missing is the driving force. Many senior citizens who go missing are not traced as they are considered a liability.” Family circumstances play a vital role, says Ranjay Vardhan, who works at the department of sociology, at the Post Graduate Government College for Girls in Sector 42. Many people are reluctant to return to an “unsettled” family. “With the disintegration of the joint family senior citizens are considered a liability and thus no one is even bothered if they do not return,” adds Vardhan. Only 32.6% missing children traced in 2019 Of the 528 children reported missing, 202 (135 girls and 67 boys) disappeared last year and 326 (159 boys and 167 girls) could not be traced over previous years.By the end of 2019, only 172 children, including 113 girls and 59 boys, were recovered or traced.About 356 minors (67 boys and 189 girls) are still missing. Considering the vulnerability of children to being sexually violated or becoming victims of human trafficking, special programmes such as project muskaan were initiated to trace them.  “Children are considered assets so more effort is put in to trace them,” feels Vardhan. “When children leave home the family shows strong will to trace them. Police is also forced to act owing to the pressure of the parents, thus more children are traced,” says Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-615-adults-went-missing-in-2019-in-chandigarh-only-18-5-traced/story-0ROgd9x6HYD5DN7qAH6flK.html

GMADA to e-auction 113 Mohali properties||Finally, after a gap of nearly seven months, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) will e-auction 113 residential and commercial properties from October 10 to October 26 after slashing the reserve price by 10%. To attract more bidders, an additional 10% off will be offered for full payment in 60 days. The last auction for these properties was held in February this year after a 20% cut in reserve prices, when 32 of the 67 units were sold. The next auction planned from July 21 was postponed due to the lockdown following the Covid-19 outbreak. GMADA additional chief administrator Rajesh Dhiman has said the auction will be held from October 10 to 26. The 10% reserve price discount and the additional 10% off on full payment was done to get more buyers and help revive the reality sector, he added.GMADA will also be hoping for improved sales during the festive season when buying property is considered auspicious. The auction is estimated to fetch GMADA Rs 800 crore. These include 16 residential properties on plots ranging from 100 square yards to 500 square yards and others located in Eco-city-1 and sectors 64, 61 and 56. Commercial units include 25 booths in sectors 59, 60, 61, 63, 65; six shop-cum-offices (SCO)/shop-cum-floors (SCF)/single storey shops (SSS) in sectors 61, 53, 56 and 64, with sizes ranging from 125 square yards to 241 square yards. Seven IT industrial plots are located in sectors 83 and 101 and one hotel site in Sector 66-B with a reserve price of Rs 12.70 crore.Then there’s a school site in Eco-city-1 and three group housing sites, including one in sector 66 and two in Medicity. “Due to recession we had been demanding that reserve prices should be slashed and now we hear a cut of 10% will be given. That will get a good response,” said Shailander Anand, former president, Mohali Property Consultants Association (MPCA). The move will encourage healthy competition and help GMADA earn a bigger profit, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-last-gmada-to-e-auction-113-mohali-properties/story-ayPXUaPjIysp6soAA5iTbP.html

04-10-2020||Chandigarh||Career advancement scheme: PU teachers await pending promotion||More than 50 teachers at Panjab University are still waiting for their pending interviews for promotion under career advancement scheme (CAS).The interviews of teachers were fixed in March and April, but due to the Covid-19 outbreak, many of them could neither be held on the scheduled date nor could be rescheduled.After showing discontent over the pending cases of promotions under CAS and the delay in the meetings of selection committees of such cases, the Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) had in February written to PU vice-chancellor Prof Raj Kumar to expedite the process, after which dates for the interviews were fixed. However, not all interviews were held due to the pandemic.Dr Dolly of PU’s directorate of sports, whose interview for CAS promotion is pending, said, “We are eagerly waiting for the interviews.” PUTA had on Friday told the V-C that pending CAS interviews should be held without any further delay.Its letter to V-C reads that interviews, both physical as well as virtual, are being conducted by other universities for the recruitment of faculty as well as CAS promotions. Various state public commissions have recently held physical interviews for faculty recruitment, with experts coming from different parts of the country.”PUTA president Professor Rajesh Gill said, “When the entire country has been opened up under the process of unlock, conducting CAS interviews is also possible. More than 50 teachers are waiting for interviews. The university can even opt for online mode for interviews as well. Experts of the neighbouring varsities can be invited to conduct the pending interviews.”Meanwhile, V-C Raj Kumar said, “The interviews have been delayed due to the pandemic.

04-10-2020||Chandigarh||Corona, not Ravana, to go up in flames this Dussehra||Last year on Dussehra, Tejinder Chauhan bettered his own world record by erecting a 221-foot tall Ravana effigy, 11 feet taller than his previous one and weighing 7,000kg, at Dhanas in Chandigarh. Costing ₹35 lakh, it had drawn nearly one lakh people at the time of burning.But this year, Chauhan has different plans. He will be replacing his towering Ravana effigy by a miniature version that will bear a ‘Covid-19’ face.This for the first time since 1987, when Chauhan made his first 20-foot tall Ravana effigy, that his annual creation is going for a major size cut.“Because of the pandemic, we can’t have a huge gathering, so, I have decided to make a small effigy. It will be less than 10-ft tall,” says the 54-year-old. “The significance of burning the Ravana effigy is to wipe out evil forces. A Covid-faced effigy comes with the hope to see the end of the deadly virus soon,” adds Chauhan, who hails from Ambala’s Barara village.Dealing with pandemicFrom when Chauhan’s 175-ft high Ravana made into the Limca Book of Records in 2009, he has increased the effigy height on seven occasions. He has 15 permanent artists/workers and hired 25 more on contract for six months.“I have retained all the 15 employees even during the lockdown. For the other 25 workers, I have provided them ration or money as per their need,” says Chauhan, who pitches 90% percent of the funds for the effigy every year while the rest come as donations. “I had no formal training in making effigies or sculptures, but over the years, I had learned this art on my own. This year, I got an assignment to make a 51-ft tall Shiva idol for a temple in Mullana, Ambala. The expense of salary of my permanent workers is coming through that project. They (referring to his workforce of 40) have helped me live my passion and taken risks while fixing crackers into the tall effigies by climbing over 200 feet. So, now it’s my duty to take care of their families,” he says.Reflecting upon the pastOver the years, Chauhan has had to sell his ancestral land to fund his projects.“I am spending the money for a cause, not any debauchery. So, my family has never objected to my selling the land when required,” says Chauhan. “My son works as a gym trainer in Yamunanagar. He is 27 years old, so taking care of family is his responsibility now,” he adds.Recalling how he started making effigies, Chauhan said once in his younger days he took to hooliganism as a revolt against his father’s strictness. Later as redemption, he resumed the Ram Lila and Dussehra activities which were stopped for four-five years at his native village due to terrorism in the neighbouring Punjab.“Since I took Dussehra out of Barara in 2018 due to a venue issue, Sri Ram Lila Club Barara, which we had formed in 1987, stopped staging the Ram Lila. Now, I organise Dussehra under the club’s banner only,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/corona-not-ravana-to-go-up-in-flames-this-dussehra/story-GXAuy2MJtc37ttv6UA6CmO.html

04-10-2020||Pune||Agharkar Research Institute scientists claim discovery of two species of pipeworts in Western ghats||Scientists from Agharkar research institute, Pune (ARI) discovered two new species of ‘pipeworts’ in the Western ghats of Maharashtra and Karnataka – one of the 35 hotspots of biological diversity in the world. These new species belong to a plant group known for their varied medicinal properties. It completes its life cycle within a small period during monsoon, and exhibits the great diversity of the Western ghats, with 111 species in India. Scientists from Agharkar Research Institute (ARI), Pune, found these new species while exploring the biodiversity of the ghats. They wanted to trace the evolutionary history of the genus Eriocaulon and made extensive efforts to collect as many species as possible from India, especially from the Western ghats. “While critically examining our collection, we came across two accessions, which showed different floral characters than earlier known species. Hence, we studied morphology and its DNA to confirm the novelty,” said Ritesh Kumar Choudhary, lead author of the study. “Identification of the species belonging to Eriocaulon is very difficult as they all look similar, which is why the genus is often referred to as ‘Taxonomist’s nightmare’. Its tiny flowers and seeds make it difficult to distinguish between different species,” Choudhary pointed out. Their study was published in the journals ‘Phytotaxa’ and ‘Annales Botanici Fennici’. The one reported from Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra was named as Eriocaulon parvicephalum (due to its minute inflorescence size), and the other reported from Kumta, Karnataka was named as Eriocaulon karaavalense (named after Karaavali = coastal Karnataka region). “Future studies will focus on elucidating the evolutionary history of the genus in India. A thorough investigation of the phylogenetic relationship between all Indian species would also help in prioritizing the conservation of threatened species in India. We are also trying to develop DNA barcodes, which will enable us to identify the species with just a portion of the leaf.,” said PhD student Ashwini Darshetkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/agharkar-research-institute-scientists-claim-discovery-of-two-species-of-pipeworts-in-western-ghats/story-BF32Ls4hCnQsI9HX5pKlVJ.html

But I resigned from the post as I felt that my educational qualification was not enough to deserve that position and decided to resume my studies,” the MLA added.Ishwar, who completed most of the higher studies after being elected as MLA, has also done MA in public administration and history. Despite his hectic schedule and routine engagements, he decided to continue his studies as he did his at graduation at the age of 37, LLB at 42, and is doing his third MA now at 72 years old.Recalling his struggle for education in his younger days, he said, “I had to travel more than 15km from my village, Jadhola in Kaithal, to Pehowa to attend school. There was no electricity and we studied under the light of earthen lamps.”“But time has changed now. Education is more accessible these days. I wrote my exams online while sitting in my office,” he said, adding that he utilised the Covid-19 lockdown period for his studies and is expecting a good result.Ishwar also wants to spread awareness about the importance of education among the people. “I never attended college as I was not a regular student, but I never failed in any exam. I proved that we can continue our studies even if we have a busy life,” he said.Having a long political career, he remained associated with the Congress party for almost 40 years and was considered a close aide of former chief minister late Bhajan Lal. But during the last assembly election in 2019, he joined the JJP and got elected from the Guhla (reserved) assembly seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-age-bar-for-learning-says-jjp-mla-pursuing-ma-political-science-at-72/story-vE0XZTApi7fvtPWHMXF1OK.html

I am surprised how they will face people in Baroda. Our party is standing with the farmers and will not allow them to implement these laws in the state. The BJP-JJP leaders will have to bring police force to enter Baroda villages to seek votes,” he said.The INLD leader said the chief minister himself does not know about Baroda and he has failed to give development projects to this constituency in the last six years. “Chief minister Khattar should resign as he failed to address the grievances of people. Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda sought votes from Baroda constituency in the name of bringing power to the area but he did nothing for the residents during his regime,” he said.He claimed that his party will pitch a strong candidate for the November 3 Baroda bypolls and BJP-JJP candidate’s security will be forfeited.On former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally in Haryana, Chautala said he is misleading the farmers over these legislations and his party had tried to bring similar laws during their tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-jjp-leaders-will-face-the-brunt-of-supporting-farm-laws-in-baroda-bypolls-abhay-chautala/story-vMAjhxa7HZuzeXu0LSKqwI.html

According to Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) chief Kumari Selja, Rahul Gandhi will step inside the state territory from Punjab via Devigarh border on October 6 from where he will lead a tractor rally up to Pehowa in Kurukshetra district. At Pehowa, the HPCC has planned a show of strength where the Congress leader will address the farmers. After the Pehowa rally, Rahul Gandhi will travel to Kurukshetra town and stay there overnight. Selja said Rahul Gandhi will kick start the road show from Pipli grain market on the second day. The road show will pass through Nilokhedi before terminating in Karnal. Ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s Haryana visit, the Congress has decided to hold sit-in protests at district headquarters across the state on Monday, demanding justice for the Hathras gang-rape victim. On Sunday, the HPCC held a meeting in Delhi to chalk out a plan for Rahul’s Haryana visit against the “anti-agriculture black laws.” Haryana Congress in-charge Vivek Bansal, HPCC president Kumari Selja, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress MLAs, former minister Captain Ajay Yadav and former state party chief Dharampal Malik were among those present in the meeting. “Haryana Congress will give a rousing reception to Rahul Gandhi,” Selja said, pointing out how the farmers were subjected to a lathicharge at Kurukshetra. “Rahul Gandhi will show to the state government the importance of a dialogue in taking the nation forward,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rahul-gandhi-to-hold-tractor-rallies-road-shows-in-haryana-on-october-6-7/story-dP40nMeJGYcJvmCnFjDuvJ.html
04-10-2020||City||Spread awareness on benefits of agriculture laws: Haryana CM to progressive farmers||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday interacted with a group of progressive farmers and urged them to spread awareness on benefits of the new farm legislations ‘enacted to bring reforms in agriculture marketing’. The CM hailed the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the historic decision by bringing these laws. He claimed that these initiatives will help farmers get remunerative prices of their produce and also give them more freedom to sell their produce. Earlier, Khattar announced three initiatives—Pragatisheel Kisan Samman Yojana, Pragatisheel Kisan Trainer Yojana and Kisan Mitra Yojana— for the progressive farmers and asked them to reap benefits of government schemes and interest free loans for agriculture sector.He said there is a need to make agriculture profitable to ensure that the farmers get at least ₹1 lakh per acre annually. “I agree with farmers, who say that they should leave agriculture if they cannot earn ₹1 lakh per acre in a year. Now, there are several other options and many farmers are earning more than a lakh,” he said.“There is a wrong perception about the word contract and contractor. We should understand it deeply as there are several examples where the farmers were getting assured income with contract farming,” Khattar said.‘Congress will not be allowed to spread lies’Cautioning the Congress that its “tendency to spread lies will not be allowed anymore”, Khattar said no one will be allowed to take law and order in their own hands in the state. The CM’s tough stance was in response to a question regarding Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Haryana to lead the protests against the agriculture laws. Taking a dig at Congress, the chief minister said that before this the party had protested against the ‘Citizen Amendment Bill’, the removal of Article-370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the ‘Ram Janam Bhoomi’. “All of this is going to end very soon because people and farmers have now understood everything,” he added. “ Farmers and Arthiyas are being misled but they will not fall prey to such tactics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spread-awareness-on-benefits-of-agriculture-laws-haryana-cm-to-progressive-farmers/story-R9OC13cFREFxvRABz6ALFJ.html

The harvesting of both parmal and basmati varieties is on peak in the state.Aimed at empowering farmers and extending ease of doing business to traders, the e-kharid system was launched for Haryana in September 2016. Under this system, direct payment is made into the accounts of the farmers for their produce.On Sunday, the ahrtias complained that the farmers were unable to sell their produce due to the technical problem on the e-kharid portal for several hours and therefore the rice millers have been purchasing it without any formalities.“I reached the mandi with the produce at 3.30am on Sunday. I had to wait for about five hours in the queue outside the mandi as there was no space to unload the produce. I have not been able to sell my produce yet and will have to wait till Monday as there was no procurement,” said Ramesh Kumar, a farmer, who was present in Ladwa grain market of Kurukshetra district.A commission agent in Kurukshetra, Naresh Kumar, said, “There were problems with the e-portal and it has affected the procurement for several hours causing inconvenience to the farmers who had brought their produce in the mandi as per the schedule.”A senior officer of the state agriculture marketing board said there was some technical problem with the e-portal but it has been fixed. “The procurement will improve from Monday,” he added. The official said to ease the lifting, the state government is taking help of rice millers as they have enough arrangements for the procurement. Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, who was in Karnal on Sunday, said the government has made all arrangements for the procurement and every single grain of the farmers will be procured on MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/glitch-in-e-kharid-portal-slows-down-paddy-procurement-in-haryana/story-XssW3WSg7AuJudU1S8EroM.html

The East-West metro comprises 5.8 kilometres of elevated section and 7.2 kilometres of underground section, part of which will run beneath the Hooghly river, making it a first of its kind in the nation, said Goyal. The Phoobagan station in the eastern fringes of Kolkata is part of the underground section. The already operational elevated section was inaugurated by Goyal in February this year. “Good news for Kolkata Metro commuters! Services of East-West Corridor are now extended till Phoolbagan, where an underground station with modern amenities has been commissioned. Our Govt is focused on creating quality infrastructure under the leadership of PM @NarendraModi ji,” tweeted Goyal. Also read: After quitting Grand Alliance, VIP chief keeps all options open for Bihar pollsIn a live speech shared on social media, Goyal said, “It is very very commendable that all the engineers, workmen, the railway officials worked amid the Covid pandemic, rather, worked extra (hours) during the pandemic to complete the Phoolbagan station in time for Durga Puja. I think it is a great gift for the people of Kolkata.” Goyal said the metro expansion project got delayed for several years because of problems related to land acquisition, resettlement issues, among other reasons, Prime Minister Narendra Modi intervened after the BJP came to power in 2014. “Because of his focused monitoring of this project and his personal intervention, the project got started again in 2015. He could realise that the people of Kolkata are facing a lot of difficulties due to the delays. He ensured adequate availability of funding. I am told the entire East-West project will be completed by December 2021,” Goyal said. The Union minister said that by 2035, around 10 lakh people will use the metro services every day. Meanwhile, Sudip Bandopadhyay, Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha MP from Kolkata North constituency and two local TMC legislators, Sadhan Pandey and Paresh Pal, boycotted the inauguration programme, saying chief minister Mamata Banerjee was not invited which was an insult to her.

Talking to media persons on Sunday, Sahni, who flashed on Bihar’s electoral horizon in 2015 as ‘Son of Mallah, said that he was talking to RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and JAP chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav to offer another formidable alternative to the people of the state. “Political situation in Bihar is still quite fluid. Our party may also tie-up with Ram Vilas Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which too has dumped the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The VIP may contest all 243 seats in Bihar if things did not materialise its way,” said Sahni, adding that the list of first phase candidates would be announced tomorrow. As many as 71 legislative assembly seats of the state are going to polls in the first phase on October 28, the last date of nomination of which would end on October 8. Also read: Lok Janshakti Party to contest Bihar assembly polls aloneOn Saturday, the VIP dealt a blow to the GA by opting out accusing GA’s chief ministerial candidate and RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of betraying its trust. “Yadav backstabbed me, as he did during the Lok Sabha elections by denying the preferred seat to the VIP, even though we stood firmly behind him in every negotiation,” said Sahni. RJD national spokesman Manoj Jha said Sahni’s acts had stunned him as it was completely unexpected. “We have differences with the BJP and other parties, but there is a decent way to dissent. “We don’t indulge in politics of chhura-khanjar (knives). Other parties might be doing it. Sahni has lost the credibility of trust in politics and it will not be undone,” said the RJD leader. Senior GA leaders said that Sahni’s demand was irrational. “The VIP was asking for 25 seats under the GA and the post of deputy chief minister, which was too big a deal to concede to. We were ready to offer him seven to eight seats for which he initially agreed,” said another RJD leader. A section of GA leaders said that Sahni’s conduct had come under a cloud as he had already declared to opt out of the coalition a few weeks ago. “In 2015, he campaigned for the BJP. His party, the VIP, was formally launched in 2018. Later, he joined the GA in 2019 and contested three seats under the alliance. However, his party failed to win any seat,” said an RJD leader.RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha, whose party had teamed up with Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to fight the state polls, said Sahni had talked to him for a broad coalition. “The final shape of the coalition will emerge tomorrow if he continued the dialogue,” added the RLSP chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/after-quitting-grand-alliance-vip-chief-keeps-all-options-open-for-bihar-polls/story-89MTK0xcyoc8ih2hKs2AAL.html

This is a record for maximum single-day pilgrim booking to Char Dham during the pandemic. Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board said 92,516 e-passes have been issued since July 1 and over 50,000 pilgrims have visited Char Dham shrines in this period. He said Char Dham shrines were opened to the public in the state on July 1 and from July 25, these shrines were opened to people from other states. “On Saturday, 4,844 pilgrims made bookings for e-passes for Char Dham pilgrimage which is a single-day record during the pandemic,” he said. Given the increase in the influx of pilgrims, the Char Dham board has increased the number of pilgrims who can visit the shrines now.Raman said the daily allowed number of pilgrims has been increased to 3,000 for Badrinath, 3,000 for Kedarnath, 900 for Gangotri and 700 for Yamunotri. “This has been necessitated following an increased footfall of pilgrims after Unlock-5 and based on the availability of accommodation, food and other arrangements, including social distancing, as assessed by respective the district magistrates”, he saidThe four Himalayan pilgrimage sites - Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath - collectively called Char Dham, are among the most revered pilgrimage sites in Hindu tradition and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Also read: Bhim Army chief wants ‘Y’ security cover for Hathras gang-rape victim’s familyTraditionally, Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east. Last year, record 29 lakh pilgrims visited Char Dham, compared to over 27 lakh pilgrims the previous year, including 9.2 lakh to Kedarnath, 10.2 lakh to Badrinath, 4.4 lakh to Yamunotri, and 5.03 lakh to Gangotri. On September 29, the state government decided that a negative Covid-19 report will not be needed for pilgrims to visit the shrines. The government released new guidelines for visiting Char Dham shrines, according to which pilgrims are required to register on the official website of the Board and take an e-pass for visiting the shrines. The pilgrims have to undergo thermal scanning at the entrance of the shrines and if their body temperature is found higher than the normal then a Covid-19 test will be conducted. The cost of the test will be borne by the pilgrims. Such pilgrims will be allowed entry into the shrines only after testing negative. In June, the state government had restricted the number of local pilgrims for Char Dham pilgrimage. The authorities had capped the daily influx of local pilgrims, allowing only 1,200 pilgrims per day for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for the Yamunotri shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/over-50-000-pilgrims-visit-char-dham-shrines-so-far-more-than-92-000-e-passes-issued/story-U5ovxxg2wPFj2o77sgOm5L.html
04-10-2020||Pune||MSRDC recommends relief for 13 toll booth operators in state; RTI activist alleges favouritism||The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has proposed relief to thirteen toll booth operators in the state and recommended an aggregate reimbursement of Rs 173.57 crore to them.The information related to the same was obtained by Right To Information (RTI) activist Vivek Velankar who had filed an application dated September 1 before the MSRDC seeking details of names of toll operators and how much relief has been given to each of them. Wen all sections of the society have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, then why are toll booth operators being favoured, questioned Velankar.A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 23 and the entire transportation sector and roads were closed for vehicular traffic for a period of 24 days. The Union Ministry of Surface Transport decided to free collection during the said period with a decision dated April 20. Following the decision, highway traffic across the country had reduced considerably and toll operators had to sustain losses during the said period.Taking into consideration their losses, the Union ministry of surface transport and finance ministry came up with a policy to compensate the toll operators for their losses. The policy entailed that the toll operators will be compensated for the lockdown period and also till the traffic returned to normal levels on the highways and tolling roads.Velankar was furnished with a letter signed by chief engineer SV Sontakke. The letter addressed to the secretary (roads) public works department dated August 21 stated that the relief for the contractors have been sought under Atmanirbhar Bharat programme.“Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the tolling collection operations were stopped all tolling plazas in Maharashtra under MSRDC. The ministry of road transport and highways conveyed that the lockdown period and subsequent low traffic due to the outbreak may be treated as a force majeure of the concession agreement by the ministry of finance. The total period of stoppage of collection works out to be 24 days for the first phase and the reimbursement to all the toll agencies for the second phase i.e., after the resumption of toll collection and attaintment of 90 per cent traffic growth shall be submitted after the closure of lockdown. The traffic at present is well below the 90 per cent of traffic pattern mark,” the letter stated.Velankar said, “My reasoning is all the toll booth operators will be given this concession across the country. All sections of the society starting from hawkers, businessmen, municipal corporations and councils and other local self-government bodies have been affected due to the pandemic. How appropriate is giving compensation to only one sector and leaving other sectors to fend for themselves. Why is this step-motherly treatment and unfair treatment being given to all and only toll booth operators are being favoured.”Vijay Waghmare, joint manager, MSRDC, said, “Our toll monitoring cell will address these issues which have not been addressed and make necessary recommendations. Most of the issues have been answered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/msrdc-recommends-relief-for-13-toll-booth-operators-in-state-rti-activist-alleges-favouritism/story-pZzM1rs31z6OzaM6vjuQuL.html

We initiated it after one of my students lost her father due to Covid-19 and as the ambulance owner was asking them to pay Rs 3,500 for a ferry, they couldn’t afford it,” said Deepa.”Whenever we get a call for ambulance services anywhere in the city we rush to help,” said Deepa.“Two doctors are my friends and they help me take the patients to the hospital. Till now, we have ferried over 50 patients to the hospital of which two were pregnant women and two were senior citizens,” said Deepa.Rafiq Shaikh, a resident of Swargate, said, “My father was unwell during the lockdown period and he suffers from a heart condition. We wanted to take him to the hospital, but the ambulance service was not available. My friend gave me the number of Parab and because of them, we could take my father to the hospital on time.”Ask Deepa – how she manages to serve people when her own business is in a mess due to lockdown restrictions and she says, “A bouncer’s work is to protect people, so what if I not able to train bouncers, I am still protecting the needy by making available an ambulance service for them.”To support themselves financially – the couple sells sanitisers and also offer services to sanitise houses.“Along with the selling of sanitisers, we also provide services of sanitisation of homes. My husband or I visit homes wearing PPE kits and charge only Rs 1,000. Of Rs 1,000 that we get, Rs 500 is for the social cause,” said Deepa.Deepak himself drives the ambulance as it saves money spent on drivers, she says.Contact detailsFor free ambulance service (Covid/non-Covid patients) call 9623018435/9764967776||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/couple-offers-free-ambulance-service-to-needy/story-x74xA41ie4PlONN1hpcK8L.html

Sassoon hospital has seen about 4,271 Covid-19 positive patients of which 1,504 were declared dead. It was also one of the first tertiary care hospitals in the city to admit Covid-19 positive patients.“For those who are not able to stay at home, government residence will be provided soon,” he said.“They have already decided ten places, which are government rest houses and hostels, which will be used as accommodation for the Covid-19 health staff. We have sent a proposal to the state government and since, I have taken charge I have also sent repeated reminders to the hospital to clear dues. They have forwarded it to the DMER. Last week in a meeting, the government decided to clear dues of private hotels,” he said.“Nowhere in Maharashtra does the health staff stay in private hotels. Initially, we had decided to provide accommodation, but now it is not feasible. We too are even living with our families now and everything has opened up, so accommodation at private hotels is a liability,” he said.“However, we have listed some government rest houses and lodges where staff can stay,” he further added.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research, said, “All the private hotels where the health staff is accommodated are booked under the district collector. They are responsible for the bills and dues.”In a letter to senior police inspector Bund Garden police station, Sassoon hospital’s dean wrote that about 60 health workers were asked to leave from a city hotel on October 1 at 8pm which mostly consists of women workers in a very insulting and derogatory manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-more-free-accommodation-for-health-workers-at-private-hotels/story-TUW4HplQIlRWQMIUIYDDJJ.html
04-10-2020||Dehradun||How youngsters in Uttarakhand are helping researchers in ISRO-sponsored project||Amid the pandemic with not much work in hands, the youths living near the Himalayan alpine meadows, locally known as Bugyals, are helping researchers study their condition by surveying them in an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)-sponsored project in Uttarakhand. The youths have been trained by the nodal agency of project in the state - Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) - to click the photographs of the vegetation present in the meadows and send them with latitude and longitude coordinates back to researchers to enable them to study them. There are more than 80 meadows in Uttarakhand and under the project, six of them have been included in the first phase. The meadows included are Kedarnath-Mandani, Madhmaheshwar, Chopra, Valley of Flowers, Bedni and Dyara. Devendra Singh, who lives in a small hamlet near Bedni Bugyal in Chamoli district, is involved in the survey of the meadows. “We joined the project after we were contacted by USAC officials about it. They explained that as we are familiar with the meadows, we could help them in studying the present condition of the vegetation including different medicinal herbs,” Singh said. Also read: Bhim Army chief wants ‘Y’ security cover for Hathras gang-rape victim’s familySingh who works as a guide to the trekkers coming to Bedni Bugyal said due to the lockdown and ongoing pandemic he was not having much work and when the offer came, he accepted as it was about saving the meadows. “We were more than happy to join the project as it was about studying the beautiful meadows and saving them. If they would be saved then it would be good for our future only. Also, they will be paying us for our work which would help us in this pandemic,” said Singh. He informed that the USAC gave them basic training on WhatsApp video call before starting the work. “They provided us with satellite images of the meadows consisting of the spots where we needed to visit and take photographs of the vegetation to send them by uploading on a mobile app installed on our mobile phones,” said Singh, adding that they started their work on September 23 and ended it on September 28 while covering an area of about 15-20 square kilometre. “We then submitted our results to the USAC on September 29. We have agreed to work with them in the future also,” he added. Another local youth Akash Chauhan, who is involved in the project in the Valley of Flowers National Park, said he has been “learning a lot while working on the project”. A second-year B.Sc. student in Dehradun, Chauhan returned to his village amid the pandemic which is located close to the Valley of Flowers. “We have been visiting the Valley of Flowers from our childhood and when we were offered the opportunity to work on the project, we happily agreed,” said Akash who is surveying the vegetation at the UNESCO World Heritage site with his friend Aditya Chauhan. Akash said he started the work on September 25 and will continue for about 10 more days. “We are learning a lot about the existing vegetation and the effect on them due to various factors like climate change,” he said. “We leave home early morning at around 8 and return in the evening at around 5 after completing our day’s work as per the directions given by the USAC. We are coming to know about different sorts of plants and herbs,” said Akash. Describing the work of locals important to the project, MPS Bisht, director, USAC, said, “We decided to involve the locals because they are very much familiar with the meadows, plus working on the project would also generate interest for science in them.” Bisht also said that they also made a point to include them to provide them with some productive work during the pandemic. “We provided them with virtual training and told them what all they are were supposed to do. So far, all of them have been enthusiastically doing that and sending us the photographs of the vegetation in the meadows,” he said. “The information provided by the youths from the field survey will help the researchers to study the condition of existing vegetation on various factors like the impact on their growth due to climatic change and others,” said Bisht.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/how-youngsters-in-uttarakhand-are-helping-researchers-in-isro-sponsored-project/story-Ix9qt9hmV8qXxXRXrFPOTN.html

However, a small portion in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri area has proved a bottleneck for the DMRC authorities for a long time, due to which, the line is disjointed for some distance there.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation authorities have been working on ironing out the land and other issues that has halted the connecting of the two sides on that stretch.“But for the pandemic, we would have opened the missing link by September end. Now, we hope to do it by March 2021,” an official source told PTI.Pink Line was opened in multiple phases in 2018 and all station on the line have been opened.“Work is in progress on this section in Trilokpuri which is still not connected on the corridor. The foundation work has been completed and pier casting work is going on. Preparations are in progress for pier cap casting as well. However, 17 houses have still not been evacuated and the matter is subjudice,” another source said.The total length of the stretch which “remains to be linked is 289 metres”, he said.The first section to be opened on the Pink Line was the over 20 km-long Majlis Park-Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus segment in March 2018, which for the first time connected the north and south campuses of the Delhi University on the metro network.This was followed by inauguration of the stretch from South Campus to Lajpat Nagar; and then of the Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake segment and eventually of the Lajpat Nagar-Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 part of the line.The bottleneck near Trilokpuri station had arisen due to multiple issues, including land acquisition, resulting in a portion of metro segment -- then about a few kilometres remaining incomplete -- rendering the Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake station a terminus.Thus, currently a very small stretch between the Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 stations is left to be joined. No station remain to be opened, so this linking should happen soon, the source said.The stations on Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake-Shiv Vihar stretch are Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake, East Vinod Nagar-Mayur Vihar-II , Mandawali-West Vinod Nagar, IP Extension, Anand Vihar ISBT, Karkardooma, Karkardooma Court, Krishna Nagar, East Azad Nagar, Welcome, Jaffrabad, Maujpur-Babarpur, Gokulpuri, Johri Enclave and Shiv Vihar.  The main highlight of this section of Pink Line is the presence of three interchange stations -- Anand Vihar (with Blue Line), Karkardooma (with Blue Line) and Welcome (with Red Line).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/work-on-delhi-metro-s-pink-line-s-unfinished-stretch-delayed-due-to-covid-19/story-JFqb6SuyXNkepEZ5EzUnrK.html

Lands of farmers in states such as Punjab and Haryana that have contributed significantly to the national food security for decades is now facing the threat of acquisition by the powerful corporate houses,” the former Congress president said in Moga.Also Read: Farm laws violate federalism, will fight them out legally: Punjab CM Capt Amarinder SinghThe venue of the rally at a grain market was well attended by villagers, including women, who registered their opposition to the new farm laws.The Wayanad MP said the Narendra Modi government wants to dismantle the well-established agricultural marketing system with new rules.“Farmers of Punjab and others have expressed rejections of rules by holding demonstrations. If voted to power, the Congress party will trash these rules. These legislations are a direct it on the economy of the farming sector,” he added.The BJP-ruled central government rejects the Congress’s charges that the new farm laws will benefit corporate entities, and argues that the legislations will usher in reforms in the agriculture sector and benefit farmers. The BJP also accuses opposition parties of politicising the issue and misleading farmers.Earlier, the Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh urged Gandhi to bring farmers at the national level under one roof for an organised protest against the Centre.At Sunday’s rally --- held in the shadow of Covid-19 ---Amritsar East Congress legislator Navjot Sidhu said Punjab should call a special assembly session on farmers’ issues.“Farmers need minimum support price (MSP)...if the central government intends to dilute it, then the Punjab government needs to step in to ensure profitability on their crops. Punjab buys pulses from other states for distribution for welfare schemes. It should promote the cultivation of pulses and oilseeds, and cooperative concept should be encouraged...” Sidhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rahul-gandhi-starts-kheti-bachao-yatra-in-punjab/story-lVBSwQX7GKv8YP2qAMZsLL.html

Testing staff for Covid-19 and training them to meet the requirements under the new standard operating procedure (SOP) for resumption of operations, sanitising of the premises, revision of menu, transport arrangement to bring outstation staff and revision of the seating arrangements to ensure social distancing, are some of the things keeping the hoteliers busy.Take the case of the upmarket 1522--Bar and Kitchen at Andheri (East), which has prepared an exhaustive safety manual for its hotel staff.“We are holding workshops for our staff from the last five days so that they can comply with the SOPs released by the government,” said Pratik Shetty, partner, of the facility.The state government, while allowing hotels and restaurants to resume operations from September 5, has capped guest attendance to 50 percent of their existing capacity. In addition, it has stressed that hotels need to ensure the safety of their staff as well as their patrons. Mirah Hospitality, which runs 10 hotels under the brand name Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute in Mumbai, has arranged buses to bring back 100 staff members from Rajasthan. 800 staff members working in their outlets have to produce a Covid-19 negative test before rejoining.“We are concerned with the health of our staff as well as of the consumers and are not ready to take any chances in this matter,” said Aji Nair, COO – food and beverages division, Mirah Hospitality.

04-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Unlockdown tales or emerging from hibernation||This year has seen all the twists and turns of a spine-chilling potboiler, with no one able to predict the story or its end. We were made to hibernate this year, much like the grizzly of the tundra region, the only difference being that we did it in the peak of summer, some of us looking like bears with our self-trimmed coiffures and capacious midriffs. Technically, we were not sleeping, but our minds had definitely gone numb to the happenings of the outside world. The partial opening of the world, heralded the end of our confinement. Hence, we needed another bust of energy to get going. While it was difficult to stay put in our shells, it was equally cumbersome to come out of that sluggish mould. My lazy bones had got accustomed to the comfortable environs of slumber land, and I started finding every excuse to stick to my pad. The online portals sounded more feasible, than my earlier rushed trips to the market for every little pick. My limbs craved cardio exercises and the digestive system growled due to its acidic rise, but I would not budge. It took me sometime to shake off that inertia, and finally, one day, I stepped out of the house. The road outside the gate looked wider and deserted. Many new plants had cropped up along the pathway. As I walked around my block, a sense of freedom engulfed me. Going a step further, I came across many familiar faces, in the park. I may have appeared a little uncivilised staring at their masks and trying to recollect their names. I had forgotten some, but that did not dampen my enthusiasm to wave out to them, like long lost friends. Switching on the ignition of my car gave me a few moments of anxiety when it failed to start. It too was taking its time to wriggle out of its languor. Once it started, I felt as if I had forgotten the finer nuances of driving. I had to furtively look around, hoping that nobody had noticed the shoddy job I had done while reversing the vehicle. Then came the wedding of a dear one and I was among the lucky 50 invited. The tagline at the end of the e-invite left me doubting my luck as all women attendees were requested to wear golden masks. I was wondering whether they were celebrating the wedding or the virus. For someone whose new best friends were track suits and flip flops, the thought of wearing a heavy dress and make-up was already loathsome, and now a new accessory had been added to my wardrobe. The fact that merely six months ago I would be strutting around in high heels attending three weddings a week, seemed a far-fetched story now. However, for slow movers like me, the norm of social distancing is being followed vigorously while my struggle to overcome my inner indolence still has a long way to goalkagaurkashyap@gmail.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based lawyer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-unlockdown-tales-or-emerging-from-hibernation/story-ZJGgzPpEiV6bRdgtmrbpUJ.html
04-10-2020||Pune||Hurt by woman’s admonition, man murders infant in Satara||The 10-month-old baby found dead in a well in Satara district of western Maharashtra had been murdered by a man, who was stalking the infant’s mother, police officials said on Saturday. The Satara police have arrested a 28-year-old man for murdering the infant and harassing his mother, who had reprimanded the accused for his act, according to superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute. Satpute said that the baby had gone missing on Tuesday from his house after which the family from Kalaj village in Phaltan tehsil in Satara, approached the police with a complaint at Lonand police station. After the search, his body was recovered from a well nearby the residence. During the course of investigation, the baby’s mother informed the police about Abhijit Ramdas Lokhande, who was constantly harassing her. The police then detained Lokhande, who during interrogation admitted to his crime. The police booked Lokhande for murder and abduction of the infant, along with stalking the woman. Satpute said the infant was allegedly abducted from a room when other members of the family were working elsewhere in the house. The suspect sneaked into the room and took him away. Later, Lokhande threw him in a well, located a few metres away from their house on Thursday. “When we began the probe, we got to know about Lokhande while collecting information from the family. Initially, he did not answer our questions. However, Lokhande later admitted to his crime and explained the chain of events. He murdered the baby as he was hurt after the woman asked him to stay away from her,” said Satpute. Police officials said Lokhande was trying for a job in the police department and had on two occasions applied during the recruitment drive. However, on both occasions he could not clear the physical test, said police officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/hurt-by-woman-s-admonition-man-murders-infant-in-satara/story-nEYyQkGEFXWR1mStuqke3O.html
04-10-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Paying extra at restaurants for safety measures necessary, say Pune residents||The entire world has been affected by the pandemic and the Indian economy has also been affected severely. However, the decision of reopening restaurants in the city is a bit tricky. It is of course a risk that will be taken by people, however, there should be strict guidelines to ensure that the Covid-19 norms and safety measures are followed at dine-in restaurants. I’m sure citizens going to restaurants would not mind paying a little more to ensure this. Also, the restaurants need to ensure that social distancing is followed thoroughly. It is then the public’s choice whether to go to the restaurant or not. However, at least the money circulated through this business will help the businesses reach the break-even point. And hence I think, the decision should be taken in a positive light. Priya MitraBe particular about your own safetyBeing safe is the mantra to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The lockdown was an unavoidable step to fight this invisible global enemy. Every human being has been affected, so was the economy. One such business that took a major blow was the restaurant and bar sector. The government has now allowed this sector to reopen doors and start business from October 5. Many people may think it should not be allowed as it is leisure activity and not essential, but when I think about the business owners of this sector, I feel that for them it is their source of income. So, even they should have the right to earn, but with complete care and precautions which shall keep their guests safe from this virus. If we wish to visit a restaurant and have some good time, we should be very particular about our own safety too. Kshitij L DeshpandeBetter to start dine-in than allow illegal service I support the decision to reopen restaurants in the city for dine-in. Let’s accept that restaurants are not just a luxury, not at least in a city like Pune where a large section of working people, including both men and women, rely upon restaurants in their routine life. Also, many restaurants in the city have already started serving food discreetly, in an unhygienic way. Customers are eating on the street side. Dining halls are closed, but they have made temporary seating arrangements outside. People are sitting in the side garden or narrow lanes nearby, consuming food items purchased as a ‘parcel’. If allowed, the restaurants can sanitise their dining area and officially serve their customers in a more hygienic and safer way. It can probably save many restaurants from closing down permanently, many hotel employees from losing their jobs, and many owners from going bankrupt. Even after reopening, the small-time restaurants are going to face several challenges on the hygiene part. The increased sanitation expenses might eat up their profits or make them lose customers over increased food prices. I think we as customers should also look at the restaurant business more empathetically and support them in these difficult times. Mandar ShindeRestaurants should be closed for some more timeSince March, we all have learned to cook at home and the personal economy of individuals is also under control. But the life of cooks and employees of restaurants has been hampered. The street food vendors have already started their operations and people are also going there. The restaurants should get the opportunity as well. But, even with 50% operational capacity, I feel it’s risky. This could have been closed for some more time. Once the customer leaves, the table and the related area needs to be cleaned and sanitised. For this to take place, the restaurants have to spend more on safety and they will charge extra. Our economy will be hampered definitely. Harshada BabrekarAdopt strategies to adapt to changing timesCovid-19 is something that is not going to finish easily and we have to learn to live with it. I think it is time to reopen restaurants and resorts to open up the economy. Also, people now want to step out and have food, so reopening is necessary. Safety during such times depends on both the restaurant owners and customers. With all precautionary measures, owners have to start resorts and customers also need to be supportive. Fewer complaints and more coordination are the two things that help every business restart smoothly. All the owners should consider Covid-19 as a challenge and change certain strategies and be more productive. Reshu AggarwaalVulnerable people should avoid dining outPune’s food service industry was extremely vibrant in the pre-Covid days, providing direct or indirect employment to thousands in its organised and unorganised segments. Though risky, reasons like economic compulsions, pressure from the industry struggling to survive after having incurred massive losses in the last few months, repayment of borrowings, loans taken for infrastructure lying idle, job losses and efforts to bring normalcy in the daily life, must have necessitated this decision. As stated by USA’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, even with reduced seating capacity and the distancing of tables, there is nothing like complete Covid-19 protection in on-site dining, whether indoor or outdoor and that there always will be a risk of infection. From the lessons learned so far, it is evident that 60+ years old, those with pre-existing medical conditions and obese are more vulnerable to this infection. It is advisable for elderly people to avoid dining out till such time we have a vaccine. Dhairyashil VandekarNeed to support the restaurant industryThe restaurant industry is struggling across the globe and India is not in a different position. Since the government of India has allowed its operation, then we should welcome this move. We are also well aware that the Covid-19 numbers are still on rise so we should learn to live with this as a part of our life. Furthermore, it is important to let businesses resume with relevant safety measures considering the government reformed rules and guidelines. Several restaurants have already resumed their operations in India and they are witnessing a great response. The first thing is to ensure that the best safety and hygiene standards are maintained. Since the government is yet to share the official does and don’ts so they should start looking for safety and hygiene factors followed by other countries. This is an inevitable reality and we should support the restaurant industry to get it back on track and it is the citizen’s responsibility to follow the proper guideline and ensure no one is violating the laws. Shalini SharmaImperative to follow safety measuresI welcome the decision of reopening of dine-ins at restaurants in a controlled manner. This is not the first pandemic the world has seen and it will not be the last, we have to adapt to changing times. Having said that, it is imperative for restaurants to follow all precautionary measures and safety protocols put down by the civic authorities. It all eventually boils down to every individual to not compromise and become complacent with respect to protecting themselves by following safety procedures. The focus should be consistently on boosting immunity and following safety measures while we are unlocking in a steady manner. Roshan ShettyNeed to revive our economyIn my opinion citizens should take full responsibility while visiting these establishments. It is the responsibility of these establishments to maintain hygiene and safety of their visitors and staff. The socio-economic standard has fallen drastically and the employees are suffering the most. Compared to the country’s population, the number of Covid deaths is low. We have to move on and strive to revive our lives and our economy.

04-10-2020||Pune||Three in police custody; Pune police on lookout for five other assailants of Shiv Sena’s Maratkar||The Pune police are on the lookout for five suspects while three others are in custody in the murder case of Shiv Sena youth wing leader Deepak Maratkar (36), who was stabbed to death in Budhwar peth.The three people in police custody have been identified as Ashwini Kamble, Sunny Kolte, and Mahendra Saraf, according to the police. Kamble and the deceased man had been involved in a feud since 2017 local elections when they were pitted against each other from their respective parties. Both of them lost the election that year. Maratkar and Kamble had been at loggerheads ever since, according to the police. “There have been multiple cross complaints from both the sides, but all were non-cognisable cases. There have also been preventive actions against both of them,” said Swapna Gore, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-1, Pune.Saraf, who is a former Shiv Sena member, has had his own qualms with Maratkar since 1998, according to police. Maratkar is the son of Vijay Maratkar, a two-time former corporator who recently passed away due to Covid-19.“Sunny Kolte is the partner of Kamble. He facilitated the union of mutual rivals of the deceased, Saraf and Kamble. He is also a suspect for arranging the hit. These three were the brains behind the planned attack,” said senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Faraskhana police station. A case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (criminal conspiracy), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Arms Act has been registered at Faraskhana police station against eight people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/three-in-police-custody-pune-police-on-lookout-for-five-other-assailants-of-shiv-sena-s-maratkar/story-rEvsLcDPPXZJ9GxoC2qTeO.html
04-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Humour in innocence||Shaarav, our three-year-old grandson, was upbeat when he arrived after a fruitful visit over the weekend to his other set of grandparents. He laid out the newly acquired mini bowling alley set and lined up for the strike. However, even though his underarm throw was impressive, the end result was two pins down out of six. As we looked at each other in awed disappointment and before I could reassure him that he would do better in the next attempt, his innocent observation came as a surprise that made us laugh: “Dadu, no point. This set is made in China!” Similarly, there is no dearth of wit and innocent humour in the Armed forces. My first commanding officer (CO), when I joined my regiment on commissioning in 1981, had a unique style of conducting his monthly durbar (interaction with the troops of his unit). At the end of his discourse he would highlight the good and not-so-good-actions by the boys during the month. During one of those meetings, Sowar Hawa Singh, stood up in rapt attention on being called out by the Risaldar Major (senior-most junior commissioned officer) and ordered to explain why his Shaktiman vehicle (Army truck) had veered off the road and hit a tree. “Shriman, mein sikhlai ke anusar seedha dekh kar gaari chala raha tha ki achanak sadak par ek ubhaar aaya aur gaari out of control ho gayi (As taught I was looking straight ahead when I encountered a bump on the road and lost control),” was Hawa’s forthright submission. Bumps were speed-breakers, newly introduced on the cantonment roads and a cultural change for the no-holds-barred tank driver. But the CO was not taken in. “Ubhaar se pehle ek board laga tha ki aage speed breaker hai (there was a signboard for a speed breaker)”. Not the one to be indicted for no fault of his, Hawa was at his innocent best: “Shrimaan, maine baad mein check kiya, yeh board sadak ke baain taraf tha aur mein seedha dekh raha tha (The board was to my left and I was looking straight ahead).” A speechless CO smiled and announced the end of his darbar. Just the other day, I went to the CSD (Army canteen) to apply for the purchase of a car. The dealing clerk, an ex-serviceman, after examining my case, confirmed that the purchase was in order. I went about completing intricate formalities, including an online transfer of the sum to the CSD depot (controlling authority) at Jalandhar. A special courier reported at Jalandhar to obtain the release order. Alas! The indent was rejected, citing the reason: Not authorised. The dealing clerk, myself and everyone in the chain had failed to notice the existing instructions. The blame game started with the buck stopping at the dealing clerk, notwithstanding the fact that the canteen management had displayed the instructions on a huge board at the entrance of the canteen which we failed to notice and the clerk forgot to remember. The guy took the onus of the faux pas squarely upon himself and remarked with all humility at his command: “Sir, putting on a mask is cumbersome, it covers the mouth and nose but blurs the vision too.” avnishrms59@gmail.com (The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-humour-in-innocence/story-i6HyUmVLuufDaqgJQk8UxK.html
04-10-2020||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot writes to PM Modi, urges national project status for East Rajasthan Canal Project||Sachin Pilot, the former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi has demanded a national project status to the desert state’s ambitious East Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP). The ERCP proposes to provide drinking water to 13 districts of Rajasthan and irrigation water for 2.8 lakh hectares (ha) of land through 26 large and medium size projects. Pilot stated the ERCP would prove to be a lifeline for Rajasthan’s 13 districts. In these districts, animal husbandry and agriculture is a major occupation of the people but depleting ground water availability is adversely affecting farming, he said. “The NITI Aayog has also included Dholpur and Karauli districts in eastern Rajasthan in the category of aspirational districts as they are semi-developed,” said Pilot. It is a well-known fact that for development of any area, water availability is a must for which the ERCP was conceptualised and submitted to the central government.“Even you (the PM) had assured of considering the project in a meeting held in Jaipur in 2018,” said Pilot, who represents Tonk in the Rajasthan legislative assembly. Rajasthan’s geographical area is 10% of the country’s landmass, but only 1.16% and 1.72% of surface and ground water, respectively, is available in the desert state. Pilot cited that of the 295 blocks in the state, 245 are under dark or critical zones. He said the state government has submitted the ERCP in a bid to bring 2.8 lakh hectares under irrigation, which required the Centre’s approval and financing.“The project will accelerate the development not only in eastern parts of Rajasthan but of the entire state. I have requested the PM to give technical sanction and financial assistance for the project, which is Rs 37,247 crore,” said Pilot, the former chief of Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee (RPCC). Jhalawar, Baran, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Ajmer, Tonk, Jaipur, Dausa, Karauli, Alwar, Bharatpur and Dholpur are the 13 districts that are under the ERCP. The project seeks to ensure availability of sufficient water for drinking and irrigation by 2051 in Jhalawar, Baran, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Ajmer, Tonk, Jaipur, Dausa, Karauli, Bharatpur and Dholpur districts. Earlier, the Rajasthan governments, led by incumbent CM Ashok Gehlot, and his predecessor Vaundhara Raje, who belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had raised the demand of granting a national project status to the ERCP. In February, Gehlot had written to Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who represents the Jodhpur constituency in the Lok Sabha, and had urged him to ensure that the ERCP is granted the status of a national project. Gehlot had also raised the issue before PM Modi during a meeting of NITI Aayog in June, 2019. He had reminded Modi about his promise made during a public meeting in Rajasthan and urged him to give an early approval to the ERCP as a national project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/sachin-pilot-writes-to-pm-modi-urges-national-project-status-for-east-rajasthan-canal-project/story-fuLQweRtk6hxn5eCYtEZBJ.html
04-10-2020||Pune||Lecture series, new certificate courses planned as Deccan College, Pune enters its 200th year on Oct 6||From monthly lecture series on recent researches in the field of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Linguistics, Sanskrit and Lexicography by eminent scholars and publication of monograph series on these subjects to new certificate courses being planned, the Deccan College postgraduate research institute, hailed as the third oldest educational institute in India and the first college to have postgraduate and research institute in the entire Deccan region, has lined-up events to mark its 200th year on Tuesday. The institute (deemed to be university), plans to celebrate its bicentenary year with various programmes amid solid record of undertaking various key research and excavation projects including Inamgaon, a post-Harappan archaeological site. The college has given to the world of archaeology some of the well-known archaeologists like MK Dhavalikar, who received the Padma Shri. Professor Prasad Joshi, acting vice-chancellor of the Deccan College, said, “The institute has immensely contributed to research in the fields of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Linguistics, Sanskrit and Lexicography as well as in the fields of Sociology, Anthropology and Maratha History over the past 199 years.”The University is going to commence a series of workshops on Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Linguistics, Sanskrit and Lexicography to make current researches in these subjects popular and public-oriented, added Joshi. According to him, some ongoing projects at the institute by three departments, include the Sanskrit Dictionary Project, Marathi Dialects Project of the Linguistics Department, Gorewada Archaeological Theme Park project and a joint project with APH Solapur University: Junnar Archaeological Museum Project funded by RUSA. He said that two proposed projects of the University will be financially supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India in collaboration with C-DAC. A special online programme is being organised to mark the 199th Foundation Day and the inauguration of the bicentenary year on October 6 at 4pm. Dr Bhushan Patwardhan, vice-chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) will deliver the key note address. Dr GB Deglurkar, former chancellor of the University will also give an address on this occasion. Dr AP Jamkhedkar, chancellor of the University will preside over the function. According to ex-director K Paddayya, it has been a proud moment to be part of this college where he studied and later worked for 57 years. “I am associated with the Deccan College since 1963. It is often said that we are like raw lumps of clay who are transformed and moulded into scholars after studying at this college,” said Paddayya. Deccan institute’s department of Sanskrit, started in 1948, carried out one of the most ambitious and prestigious projects - Encyclopedia of Sanskrit. “So far, we have published 34 volumes covering around 6,000 pages. The published volumes cover around one lakh fifty thousand words. In size, it is three times bigger than a dictionary of any language all around the world. Though it is a dictionary, it is more of an encyclopedia. A regular dictionary gives just the meanings of the word, but this traces the changes in the meaning of the word in literature spread over more than 3,500 years,” said Bhav Sharma, Editorial Assistant, Department of Sanskrit and Lexicography. HistoryIt was started on October 6, 1821, as the Hindoo College by the Bombay Presidency government at the initiative of its governor Mountstuart Elphinstone using the Dakshina Fund, which was started by Khanderao Dabhade, a Maratha Sardar and continued by the Peshwas for propagating Sanskrit studies. It was renamed as the Poona College on June 7, 1851, and later as the Deccan College in October 1864. The Deccan College was shifted to the new campus covering an area of 115 acres near Yerawada on March 23, 1868. Today, the department has excavated over 100 sites and added various relics, some dating back to the medieval period, to their existing collection. These artefacts are carefully preserved in the museum for visitors. Department of linguistics The linguistics department, the first department in this discipline in India, began in 1939. Prof SM Katre was the founder of the department. Professor Sonal Kulkarni-Joshi, head of the department of linguistics, said, “I have been a masters student at the Deccan College and faculty member for more than 15 years. Both in Indian academics and abroad, my affiliation with the Deccan College is highly regarded within linguistic circles. It is a matter of great pride to be a part of this great academic legacy.” Museums Founded in the year 1939, the Deccan College Archaeology Museum (DCAM) is the brainchild of eminent archaeologist Padma Bhushan HD Sankalia. The museum features Sankalia’s collection of artefacts as well as a collection of vestiges from different research scholars. Following the numerous excavations carried out by the archaeology department, the initial collection of artefacts soon became an assemblage of cultural material dating back to the prehistoric era. Developed for academic purposes, the museum now features a huge collection of artefacts categorised into nine galleries. The galleries are divided into categories: Stone Age or prehistoric period (before 6000 BC); Chalcolithic or Copper Age (4500- 3500 BC); Megalithic culture; early history; sculptures; epigraphy (inscriptions) and numismatics (the study of coins and related objects); sciences in archaeology and ethnoarchaeology (the study of people for archaeological reasons). The second museum is on The Maratha History Museum.

04-10-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: It makes sense to guard yourself against guilt||We are living in a competitive world where people have to work for hours to make both ends meet. In some families, the earning members have to take up two or three jobs side by side to make enough for their sustenance. Along with this we have to look after the emotional needs of our family members too. Doing so can at times lead to increased anxiety levels resulting in outbursts, failure to control our emotions of hurt, pain, anger, which often overpower our natural temperament. Then, certain emotions are transient and give way feelings of guilt for doing what we have done. Guilt is an emotion and it triggers a sense of having done something wrong or having not done something right at the right time. It is an emotion everyone goes through. When I became a mother and had to leave my infant son at home and go to college, I was filled with a sense of guilt. Though he didn’t show signs of anxiety or anger as he played and waved me goodbye smilingly, yet I found it tough to reconcile with the guilt of not spending time with him. Guilt is a natural emotion. In childhood we have all had our naughty moments when we voluntarily indulged in pranks. I used to change nameplates of our neighbours’ homes and plucked raw fruits from their trees. When aunties complained I used to be filled with a sense of guilt for having spoilt the fruits and for hurting people’s feelings. Nobody likes the experience of guilt, but it is a part of being human and has its origins in making unintentional mistakes, causing involuntary hurt, anger, misconstrued trust and so on. However, guilt can make us feel sad, unhappy, powerless and worse. Guilt is part and parcel of our life. During childhood, feelings of guilt arise from innocent mistakes and we tend to forget them quickly. But as we grow and thrive in a family our thoughts are governed by our intense desire to be the perfect partner, parent, sibling, son and daughter. Despite all our efforts, there are times when we realise that we haven’t been able to live our lives the way we should have or failed to raise our children as we wished them to be. Often, we despair over not being professionally competent or over neglecting our hobbies and health. Now, however, I feel the best way to deal with guilt is to accept reality, try to overcome it by finding a way to control those emotions, be comfortable, make peace with them. Most often our sense of guilt originates from some previous experience or memory and doesn’t have much to do with our present situation. Once we realise that everybody makes mistakes, we take the first step towards transformation by forgiving ourselves, take a more rational view of a situation and manage emotional responses better. How truly it is said that though we might not be able to control external circumstances, we can control our emotional response to them. Oscar Wilde rightly said, “I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them” So controlling emotions of guilt and emerging as a better human being with a positive spirit and moving ahead needs to be the mantra for overcoming guilt.

04-10-2020||Lucknow||Hathras gangrape: Woman’s family wants Supreme Court-monitored inquiry||The family members of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who was allegedly gangraped in Hathras last month, said they were against a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe on Sunday, and sought a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry instead. Upper-caste groups, in a mahapanchayat in Hathras on Saturday, had welcomed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s recommendation of the CBI probe.“We do not require a CBI probe, but want the proceedings to take place in a fast-track court under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge,” the brother of the woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, said.Meanwhile, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the state government continued its probe and recorded the statements of the woman’s family members.“We are open to anyone who wants to present himself before SIT and get his or her statement (recorded),” said senior IPS officer Bhagwan Swaroop who heads the three-member SIT.At Saturday’s mahapanchayat --- called by former Hathras MLA Rajveer Pehalwan and attended by about 700 people --- participants welcomed the recommendation of the CBI probe and also questioned the objections raised by the woman’s family to such an investigation as well as the narco-analysis test. The speakers at the mahapanchayat claimed the four men arrested for the gangrape were innocent.The participants decided that the lawyers who attended the mahapanchayat would meet SIT members to apprise them of the “facts”.Also Read:From Hathras gang-rape victim’s death to CBI probe recommendation: What we know so farOn Sunday, the authorities placed barricades around Boolgarhi village so that no more than five people at a time could enter.Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, a five-member delegation of the Samajwadi Party, and Rashtriya Lok Dal vice-president Jayant Chaudhary are expected to visit the village on Sunday.Meanwhile, safai karamcharis (sanitation workers) continued their protest in Agra on Sunday against the gangrape and THE death of the woman. On Saturday, the sanitation workers had pelted the municipal corporation’s garbage removal vehicles with stones.On September 14, the woman had alleged that she was gang-raped by four men. On September 29, the woman succumbed to her injuries at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. She was cremated by authorities at night as her family members alleged police rushed the entire process, a charge that led to nationwide outrage. However, the administration said the cremation was conducted with the family’s consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hathras-gangrape-woman-s-family-wants-supreme-court-monitored-inquiry/story-rQpwqpJEntCIkjgl3aUobP.html

We also have some students complaining about load shedding in some parts of the state, which is why we devised a method to send reminders to students, hours before the exam, asking them to charge their phones/laptops in advance and keep it ready,” added Bagla. Also Read: UPSC Prelims 2020: Candidates reach centres for exams, say ‘mature enough to follow precautions’D G Ruparel College has conducted mock tests to ensure all students get a good understanding of the system before final exams.“Still, we’ve had cases where students could not access the exam link because either they had provided a wrong email id or their mail inboxes were full and therefore, couldn’t appear for the paper. We have considered such cases and assured rescheduling of examination for such students,” said Tushar Desai, principal of the institute. On Saturday, a small batch of students from the institute received a wrong question paper due to a technical error. The college will conduct a re-examination for the subject once all other exams are over.“No one will miss out on appearing for the exams,” said Desai and added that on the first day of the exam, 1,128 students appeared without any complaints. Also Read: CLAT 2020: Modifications in questions and the answer key for UG, PG exams releasedWhile several affiliated colleges to Mumbai University started online exams from October 1 itself, others have decided to conduct exams starting the coming week.Most colleges are using a combination of software and applications in order to ensure invigilation during the exam.“The software continuously tells us if a student is writing the exam or not and when we find a student isn’t appearing for the paper, we contact him/her immediately to find out the reason,” said Anushree Lokur, principal, Ruia College.Most colleges have opted for randomisation of questions and answers in order to avoid any form of cheating during the exam. “We had a case of a student automatically logging out of the exam due to very low internet connectivity.Once he re-started the exam, the remaining questions had been reordered including the options of answers to each question. With technology at hand, we are trying to do our best to conduct exams as fairly as possible,” said a senior professor of a south Mumbai college. Final year (summer 2020) exams for all state universities have to be conducted online this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Close to 2.3 lakh students from the University of Mumbai will be appearing for exams online this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/mumbai-university-final-year-exam-being-held-online-despite-challenges/story-wn2QMaOQDBCzEaGHXFpDSK.html

04-10-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: HAM-S seals deal with JD(U), all eyes on BJP-LJP||Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) has entered a seat-sharing agreement with the ruling Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), in the poll-bound state.The deal was brokered amid an uncertainty over the next move of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which will get its quota of seats to contest the upcoming assembly polls as an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre.The NDA is yet to announce a seat-sharing deal involving all its constituents amid growing differences between the JD(U) and the LJP, which has been questioning chief minister Nitish Kumar’s style of functioning.HAM-S, which aligned with the JD (U) following its exit from the Grand Alliance (GA) --- comprising the main opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress and some Left parties --- will contest 10 constituencies in the 243-seat Bihar assembly.Of the 10 seats, three HAM-S candidates would contest on the JD(U) symbol, said party spokesman Danish Rizwan. He said the party would like eight candidates to contest on its symbol.Also Read: Land mines biggest challenge for security forces in first phase of Bihar pollsHAM-S parliamentary board meeting will be held on Sunday afternoon to decide on the names of the candidates.Earlier, Majhi had maintained that his return to the Nitish Kumar-led JD (U) fold was unconditional because of a “mutual understanding”.Manjhi will contest from the Imamganj assembly seat in Gaya district. Manjhi confirmed that he would contest from Imamganj, but refused to share details about the candidates of the other nine seats.“BJP parliamentary board meeting is slated to be held in Delhi today. Our meeting will also be held this afternoon. I shall speak about who will contest from which seat after the meeting,” he said.Imamganj was the only seat that the HAM-S won in 2015 when Manjhi defeated JD(U)’s Uday Narain Chaudhary. However, he lost from Makhdumpur, from where his son-in-law is tipped to be the candidate in the upcoming assembly polls.Also Read: Bihar assembly election: Key LJP meeting on hold due to Paswan’s healthKumar had made Manjhi the Bihar CM in May 2014, though the latter had to quit the following year after the two leaders came face to face in the assembly polls.Manjhi was a part of the cabinet of seven Bihar CMs, including four from the Congress, in his political career spanning over four decades.His induction into the JD(U) fold was seen as an attempt to neutralise the LJP’s growing political ambitions.In 2015, the HAM-S was part of the NDA and had contested in 21 assembly seats. But, the regional party had managed to win only one seat that of Majhi’s. It had a vote share of 2.2% in 2015 assembly polls.Political analyst Ajay Jha said that the upcoming Bihar assembly polls were taking an interesting turn because of the emergence of new political equations at the last minute ahead of the elections. “Pre-poll arrangements are likely to be guided by post-poll possibilities,” he added.The elections in Bihar will be held in three phases on October 28, November 3 and 7.The results will be declared on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-assembly-election-2020-ham-s-seals-deal-with-jd-u-all-eyes-on-bjp-ljp/story-b8VNygfZUruc7gM1ldDPwO.html

04-10-2020||Lucknow||Only smaller Durga idols in UP this year due to late nod to celebrations||Idols of goddess Durga on display at Durga Puja pandals in Uttar Pradesh this year will not be of more than six feet height, and in many cases it will be even smaller, as idol makers are left with very little time after the state government’s late nod for holding Durga puja celebrations.Celebrations this year will also be without the distribution of khichdi bhog and prasad because of Covid-19 pandemic. There will be no fancy pandals or elaborate lighting arrangements either. Only simple Durga puja rituals will be carried out in the most solemn manner. Neeloy Kumar Mitra, a prominent idol maker at Talkatora said, “We are making smaller-size Durga idols as in this limited time frame, one cannot make the bigger ones. Many of the puja committees placed orders for smaller size idols of around 5-6 feet because they are keeping Durga puja a low key affair.”Mitra, a pass out of Arts College, Lucknow said, “We have received orders from 17-18 puja committees like Sahara State, Anand Nagar, Vikas Nagar. All of them said they don’t want an idol of more than 6 feet in height as it will cause inconvenience during immersion in Covid times.”Also Read: Hathras case: 5 Samajwadi Party members allowed to enter villageSujit Pal, an idol maker at Rabindra Palli said that due to availability of fewer workers in Covid times, they are making smaller idols.“Bengali Club has placed an order for a six feet high idol. Other puja committees expressed a similar desire as there’s very little time left now,” said Pal, who also graduated from Arts College. RDSO Durga Puja will be organized at a new site this year with a much smaller Durga idol. Instead of Rajdhani Hall, this year’s Durga puja will be held at Milani, RDSO, Lucknow campus.Also Read: Dussehra Dreams: Effigy makers in a fix after no-show on Ramlilas“It will remain open for members only as per state government’s Covid guidelines.

Only Puja rituals will be held,” said Tirtho Sengupta, general secretary of the puja committee. Sudip Sanyal of La Touche Road Durga puja committee said they too have ordered for a small size idol as the state government’s nod for Durga puja came quite late. “There will be no Anand mela, cultural programme, etc. We will follow government guidelines and all SOPs, etc,” said Arun Banerjee, the president of Bengali club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/only-smaller-durga-idols-in-up-this-year-due-to-late-nod-to-celebrations/story-AnMPpWqbboXdhjyDiddAZJ.html
04-10-2020||Delhi||Dussehra Dreams: Effigy makers in a fix after no-show on Ramlilas||Come October, and the winds in Delhi ring of festivities. Right from the run up to Durga Puja to the gatherings at the many Ram Leela grounds for Dussehra, every day is magic. But this year, Covid-19 has put a dampener to these festivities as mass gatherings are restricted. This in turn has affected the businesses of effigy makers. The otherwise thriving businesses have taken a big blow as there is hardly any demand for effigies. Mounting expenses, MCD permits and a drastic decrease in demand have them in a fix. “Pehle itna toh kamaa lete the ki poore saal ka kharcha nikal jaaye, lekin iss baar toh bada ya chhota, koi order nahi aa raha,” rues Naresh of New India Ravan Wala in Titarpur. He has been making effigies all his life, planning three months in advance for the festive season. “50 saal ho gaye yeh kaam karte par aisi tangi pehle kabhi nahi hui,” he says.Azam Ali, whose great grandfather started making effigies during the rule of Bahadur Shah Zafar in Delhi, has spent over ₹1 lakh in making these effigies so far. “Ek saal se chalti thi taiyyari Ramlila ki; sab kuch banaa ke taiyyar kar liya tha. Tab tak lag raha tha ki sarkar Ramlila ki permission toh degi hi degi,” he says, adding that he will now rent a place to store these effigies for next year. He has not received any payment from the organisers, who would otherwise give them contracts in bulk. The roads running parallel to the Metro line at Tagore Garden through Najafgarh are a hub for effigy makers. Dismantled effigies in various stages of making could be seen here, but now the effigy makers are unable to afford the rent. They would earlier earn anywhere between ₹2-3 lakh, but the demand has gone down by 50% this year. “Grounds that would have the biggest effigies have not got the permission to organise the festival. We have only got few orders, those too from schools and housing societies,” says Bobby of Shankar Ravan Wale.Even the organisers of these elaborate events are refraining from mass gatherings. Anil Garg, general secretary, Shri Ram Dharmik Leela Committee, says that even though the ground has a capacity to host 5,000-7,000 people and government has allowed 50% gathering, the risk is not worth it. “Apni suraksha mein sab ki suraksha hai. We are not burning effigies this year because it will be impossible to control the crowd. Instead, we will set up a smaller stage and play the last few chapters of Ravan dahan,” he says adding that they will broadcast last year’s recorded Ram Leela on a television channel.With effigies lying in a state of abandon, these effigy makers are looking at alternatives for survival. Mahendra of Mahendra and Subhash Ravan Wale, who has been in the business for 45 years, says he drives a taxi now. “Bahut tagdi maar padhi hai iss baar. Koi poochne bhi nahi aa raha. Gaadi chalaa ke paise kamaa raha hoon ab,” he says. Azam Ali has also taken up an alternative. “Shaadiyo mein phool lagaate hain. Apne kaarigaro ko bhi toh payment karni thi. Gareeb hain isliye gareeb ka dard samajhte hain,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dussehra-dreams-effigy-makers-in-a-fix-after-no-show-on-ramlilas/story-uMrpk4hK5623yEUSsZrlyI.html

This was followed by another round of thunderstorms late at night on Saturday and early Sunday morning,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general (DG), western region, IMD. “The thunderstorms were short-lived, but the Konkan coast and interior Maharashtra can expect similar weather on Sunday as well,” he added.A location-wise break-up of heavy rainfall for over 15 hours – between 5:30 pm on Saturday and 8:30 am on Sunday -- showed that maximum rainfall was recorded at Malad at 106.6 mm, followed by Dahisar (103 mm), Goregaon (94.5 mm), Mira Road (84.5 mm), Borivali (76.8 mm), Andheri (72.8 mm), Bhandup (69 mm) and Powai (64 mm). Thundershowers led to cool weather over the city, which had recorded temperature over a degree Celsius (C) above normal since October 1. The overnight rainfall brought the temperature down by a degree Celsius on Sunday morning. The minimum temperature in south Mumbai and the suburbs was 24 and 22.6 degrees C, respectively, on Sunday morning.

We are known for our Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb,” said Lucknow University law faculty employee Rohit Srivastava, who became the first person to donate money for the construction of a mosque that will come up on the 5-acre land in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya district. As proof of his gesture and acknowledging his donation of Rs 21,000, he has been given a receipt bearing the serial number ‘001’.“I donated Rs 21,000 from my salary. I am sure that it will send a strong message among all, especially in times of intolerance and growing communal discord,” the LU employee said. According to Srivastava, he conceived the idea of making a donation after the Supreme Court November 9, 2019 verdict, in which the apex court directed the Uttar Pradesh government to allocate a 5-acre land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) for the construction of the mosque and cleared the way for the construction of a Ram temple at the 2.77 acre disputed site in Ayodhya.Also Read: ‘Construction of Ram mandir to begin from Navratri’: Temple trust“I am a Lakhnavi.

04-10-2020||Bhopal||High court’s order may impact campaigning for MP bypolls, details here||Madhya Pradesh high court has directed the district magistrates in nine districts to register cases against political, government, state, social functionaries and also against congregations under the provisions of Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC) if they are found violating restrictions imposed under Covid-19 protocol. Underlining the responsibility of public representatives in the society, the court asked the government and political functionaries in the state to strictly adhere to all restrictions imposed by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to contain the spread of Covid-19 and advised the political parties “not to physically conduct election campaigns (for bypolls) and instead adopt electronic means for the purpose”. The high court’s Gwalior bench’s interim order came on Saturday on a petition, filed by an advocate Ashish Pratap Singh, to bring to the notice of the court, the flouting of Covid-19 safety norms and guidelines in congregations held frequently in and around Gwalior by various political parties due to the by-elections to the state legislative assembly. The petitioner raised apprehensions that such violations will lead to further spread of Covid-19 infection. The court’s interim order assumes significance in view of the November 3 bypolls for 28 assembly seats located in 19 districts of the state, 16 of which fall under the Gwalior-Chambal region. The court’s bench comprising justice Sheel Nagu and justice Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava, said in its order: “In case, any of the prohibitions, restrictions and precautions in Covid-19 protocols issued from time to time by the central government, state government, district magistrates are found to be breached by a congregation which is of political or social nature then the district magistrates of the nine districts falling within the territorial jurisdiction of this bench i.e. Gwalior, Guna, Morena, Bhind, Vidisha, Ashok Nagar, Datia, Shivpuri and Sheopur are directed by writ of mandamus to register offences by invoking penal provisions of Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code not only against the defaulting members of the congregation but also against political/governmental/state or social functionaries in whose name or on whose behest and behalf the said congregation takes place.” Also Read: MP proposes steep hike in water charges, fine for spitting, urinating in publicThe court warned that district magistrates of the concerned nine districts ‘shall be liable for contempt of this court and shall also be exposed to the rigors of penal provisions of relevant laws’ if the order is not complied with. Referring to the reports of amicus curiae, placed on record, on breach of Covid-19 protocol because of various congregations, the court observed, “This court, thus, realised that either the functionaries of the state, in particular the law enforcing personnel are unable to prevent blatant and widespread breach of Covid-19 protocol or are turning a Nelson’s eye towards the said breach to avoid offending their political bosses.” In an important observation the bench said that a leader is supposed to lead by example, which can best be demonstrated by following the rule of law and preventing the breach of law.Also Read: Dalit woman dies by suicide in Madhya Pradesh, kin allege police inaction on rape complaint“The voters look up to their representatives in the political field and more often than not these voters attempt to emulate the conduct, behaviour and deeds of their representatives/leaders. This attitude of following the leader is predominant in our society because of rampant ignorance, illiteracy and poverty. The political functionaries and functionaries of the government and the state are duty bound to set such examples of conduct, behaviour and deeds which can enable their followers/voters/citizens to follow the path of rectitude and obedience of law and lawfully passed orders and instructions,” it observed. The court further observed that the conduct, behaviour and attitude of uprightness towards law by political functionaries is all the more necessary and deserves stringent adherence in the given situation of Covid-19 pandemic.“The slightest of breach of the protocol can lead to disastrous results of further spread of infection leading to more deaths. The political functionaries who are either members of any political party or functionaries of the state/government need not be reminded that not only our nation but the world is facing unprecedented crises of Covid-19 pandemic since the last seven months,” said the court. Reminding politicians and others about the gravity of the situation the court said, “It is a time of international crises where existence of human race is at risk and thus the least that is required of the political functionaries and the functionaries in the government and state, is that they should rise to the occasion and render national service to defend the nation from invisible enemy called Covid-19. The members of the political parties, functionaries of the government and the state can at least set an example for their followers and voters and the members of the general public, by adhering to the Covid-19 protocol issued by the central government, state government and the district magistrates from time to time.” The court has set October 15, 2020 as the date for the next hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/high-court-s-order-may-impact-campaigning-for-mp-bypolls-details-here/story-wJxB0nmIZCxBH29PnpHviL.html
04-10-2020||Lucknow||Air quality in UP cities turns poor as winter nears||The air quality in different cities of Uttar Pradesh (UP) have again turned poor mostly due to increased human activities and drop in average temperatures, according to the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). UP enjoyed the longest streak of good air quality days in this millennium during the lockdown restrictions that were enforced from the end of March in a bid to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. CPCB experts said a recent uptick in stubble burning incidents have contributed to the worsening of the air quality index (AQI). On Saturday, the average AQI of Lucknow was 258, which signifies poor. Lucknow’s Talkatora, which reported an AQI of 296, was the most polluted area of the city. Similarly, in several western UP cities, including Ghaziabad, Noida, Meerut and Moradabad, the average AQI oscillated between poor and very poor. Also Read: Delhi AQI moves closer to ‘poor’ as stubble burning begins in Haryana, PunjabPoor air quality can cause breathing discomfort and damage the respiratory health of a person on long term exposure, CPCB official said. Mahesh Madhavan, a Delhi-based ecologist, said: “The flow of particles in the atmosphere slows down in cold weather. Besides, increased vehicular traffic, construction and farm activities cause air quality to deplete.” The AQI in UP started worsening from September 28 onwards. The air quality in UP is expected to further worsen after winter sets in and there is a rise in stubble burning incidents. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has initiated the process to rein in stubble burning. The UPPCB authorities have called meetings of district administrations, where incidents of stubble burning are reported frequently, next week. Shahjahanpur, Bareilly, Badaun, Moradabad, Bulandshahr, Bijnor and Saharanpur districts are the worst-hit because of stubble burning.These district administrations will be asked to lodge police cases against farmers found burning stubble. Last year, over 14,000 farmers in UP were fined or cases lodged against them for burning stubble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/air-quality-in-up-cities-turns-poor-as-winter-nears/story-J1YCiD2nAH7Sw4rtoclvDI.html

The move, which is in keeping with the UP assembly polls slated to be held in 2022, is also intended to counter the Opposition that is attempting to gain political mileage by highlighting controversies such as the alleged gang-rape and murder of a Dalit teenager (19) by four upper caste men in Hathras district last week, party leaders said on condition of anonymity. The BJP will organise divisional-level cadre training workshops between October 11 and 31. UP party functionaries have been asked to attend the training workshops and talk about the changes that the country has seen after the Narendra Modi-led government had swept to power 2014 and since re-elected last year.“We have a tradition of training our cadres. It’s due to this training that the BJP today is the world’s biggest political party. In the training workshops we will guide our cadres on how to logically counter the opposition canards and conspiracies,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev told party functionaries. Also Read: Hathras gangrape: Accused were harassing her for months, says mother of 19-year-oldHowever, Dev didn’t specify how to handle political controversies such as the Hathras incident.

The party feels that this trend is likely to gain momentum as the date for 2022 assembly polls comes closer.The BJP faces a mini electoral test in November when by-polls will be held for the seven of the eight vacant assembly seats.Panchayat, graduate and teachers’ polls are also due to be held, but their schedules are yet to be announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bjp-to-train-cadres-in-uttar-pradesh-districts-to-propagate-state-policies/story-RnlJeqUZkuVR4vQoGI356O.html
04-10-2020||Kolkata||Life sentence for eight in Bengal’s Pincon group ponzi scam case||Eight people were sentenced to life imprisonment on Saturday in the first verdict in a ponzi scheme case in West Bengal in recent years. A court at Tamluk in the state’s East Midnapore district gave the order while hearing the Pincon Group case, which was filed in 2017 at Khejuri police station. The court sentenced Manoranjan Roy, the company’s owner who is now in judicial custody, his wife Moushumi Roy, who is one of the directors and presently released on bail, and six other directors of the Pincon Group. Two of the accused had died during the trial. While 10 other accused in the case were acquitted by the court. Also Read: India moving towards a presidential form of govt, says Bengal CM Mamata at protest meetThe company was charged with cheating thousands of investors and raising over Rs 800 crore from the public across several states. The case was probed by the Bengal government’s directorate of economic offences. The court verdict against Pincon Group raised investors’ hopes of getting back their money.The court slapped a fine of Rs 5 lakh on each of the accused. It also ordered the property owned by Pincon Group be confiscated and auctioned to repay the investors.Roy was absent when the court delivered its verdict because he was reportedly unwell.Roy’s lawyers said they would challenge the order and move a higher court. Although the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are investigating high-profile ponzi scheme cases in Bengal by Saradha Group and Rose Valley, their trials are yet to begin.In a separate development, Calcutta high court’s (HC) Chief Justice T B Radhakrishnan recently constituted a two-judge bench that started hearing exclusively ponzi schemes cases every Friday since September 25. The formation of a separate bench of the Calcutta HC to hear the ponzi scheme cases is being viewed in political circles as a significant development since several prominent leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) figure among the accused in the Saradha case. The CBI is trying to wrap up the probe in the Rs 2,460-crore Saradha case, where 18 lakh unsuspecting depositors from West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh were allegedly duped. Sudipta Sen, who had owned the Saradha group of companies, is in jail since 2013. While TMC’s former Rajya Sabha (RS) member Kunal Ghosh had spent over two years in jail custody in this case. The Rose Valley scam, involving around Rs 17,000 core, is the biggest ponzi scheme case in Bengal.In 2014, the Supreme Court (SC) had asked the CBI to investigate the scams and the role of influential people in money laundering. The ED is also running a parallel probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/life-sentence-for-eight-in-bengal-s-pincon-group-ponzi-scam-case/story-XWTb9u23AZWzVVDxv7uJ2H.html

On other occasions, they would spread out their hands and block her path if she tried to go past them,” she said.Over the past few months, the young woman started refusing to go out alone, she said. “If she needed to buy even a soap, she would take her sister-in-law along with her,” said the mother.On one such occasion, her sister-in-law had allegedly encountered those men harassing the 19-year-old woman.“I took them on and told them I would get them jailed. But it didn’t make much difference,” her sister-in-law said.In her official statement to the magistrate, the victim’s mother has mentioned the past harassment and her daughter’s unwillingness to leave the house.But Rakesh Singh, the grandfather of Sandeep and the uncle to Luv Kush, denied the allegations. “They never protested against any such molestation. They never complained about it.

04-10-2020||Chandigarh||Farm laws violate federalism, will fight them out legally: Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh||A frenzy of protests over a troika of contentious central farm laws and break-up of the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance has dramatically reshaped Punjab’s political landscape. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh lost no time to seize on a potentially game-changing developments to raise his stock, and that of his party, with the Sikh peasantry and arhtiyas, predominantly Hindus, and outwit the opposition - all with an eye firmly on the next assembly elections in early 2022. At 78, the erstwhile Patiala royal’s razor-sharp political instinct is now increasingly on display as he navigates the dual hotspots – of an unrelenting farmers’ fury, and of the coronavirus that has made Punjab one of the seven worst-hit states.  In an hour-long interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak on Friday at his sprawling, lush farm house, Mohinder Bagh, named after his mother, in the Shivalik foothills near Chandigarh, the Captain candidly spoke on a range of issues. Edited excerpts:Punjab is the epicentre of protests against three farm laws. What is the main issue? Is it minimum support price (MSP), or loss of market fees/taxes, or federalism? Of course, it is all three. It is a total assault on federalism. They (the Centre) have taken away our taxation, water and agriculture. What is left with the state? The farmer is concerned. Take the case of paddy. Till 1966 when the Green Revolution came to Punjab, nobody grew this crop. Only when farmers saw money in it, did they start rice cultivation. Every farmer in Punjab grows paddy and wheat besides cotton in the south western districts. Now, a farmer won’t know how much he will get for his crop. How is he going to survive? 75% of our farmers are under five acres; half of them under two acres. These poor fellows don’t even know where their livelihood will come from. WATCH | Farmers protest: Punjab CM meets farm unions; ‘rail roko’ enters 6th dayWhat is the way forward to break the logjam? I don’t know. This (the enactment of farm laws) is based on the Shanta Kumar Committee report that said the Food Corporation of India is a waste of money and so is the MSP. How Mr Shanta Kumar reached this conclusion is his business. But once it comes down to the Government of India, they should look into it. What do they have the NITI Aayog for? It is their business to look into this and see whether it is correct or not. You’ve got Madhya Pradesh and other river basin states growing wheat, the Centre is not dependent so much on Punjab. So you are now turning a back on Punjab that fed this country for 60 years. Also Read: ‘Our priority is farmers’ benefit, for earlier govt it was election’: PM Modi at Solang public rallyHas the framework on federalism come under more strain since the Covid-19 outbreak? That’s evident even in the goods and services tax (GST) which is a constitutional guarantee by Parliament that the state will get its dues every quarter. I’ve not had any money since March. It’s the seventh month. How do I run the government? The reason I vouched for reopening liquor vends despite the pandemic was that there was no other source of revenue than excise duty. The Narendra Modi government doesn’t understand the implications. They didn’t think this reaction to farm laws will come from Punjab. The protests are not happening in other states because they happen to be BJP-ruled. But farmers all over are feeling the same way. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union agriculture minister have repeatedly assured that MSP will stay. The Centre has even declared the MSP for Rabi crops earlier than schedule. Why do you doubt them? If they were serious about it, why didn’t they put it in the Act? They could have said that MSP is going to stay and that FCI or whatever agency it is, is going to do the buying. They did not do it. This is only the Prime Minister and the agriculture minister saying so. Tomorrow, if Mr Modi is not the PM or Mr Narendra Singh Tomar is not holding agriculture, will their commitment hold? Also Read: SAD’s Sukhbir Singh Badal, Harsimrat Kaur briefly detained over farm laws protestHow come the Congress, which when in power in the early ’90s had ushered in the defining reforms, is now opposed to farm sector reforms that the BJP government calls long overdue and transformative? What will they transform? The Modi government says the farm laws will open agriculture to the corporate world. Who says this not already open to corporate sector? In Punjab, we have Pepsi and ITC buying potatoes. All my kinnows from Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur are going to Chennai. The system is already open. So, the Centre’s logic is just a lame excuse. Is the MSP regime not the biggest stumbling block in diversification that Punjab desperately needs? The MSP works only for wheat, paddy and cotton. The Centre declares MSP on many crops but there is no price support agency. The day we discussed the farm bills in the special assembly session last month, the MSP for maize was Rs 1,850 per quintal. But, in Hoshiarpur mandis, it was selling at Rs 600. The ruling BJP says the Congress wants that the MSP be made a legal right which it never did while ruling the country for seven decades? The point is not a legal right. It (MSP) was taken for granted since the 1960s. It has been continuing since and no government, not even the non-Congress ones, ever opposed it. Here, we are not saying that you bring a law. All we are asking for is that make an amendment in the farm laws to ensure that MSP continues the way it has all these years. Also Read: MSP, APMC buzzwords in controversy over billsYou said Pakistan may exploit the unrest among farmers. But, your party is also stoking the farmers’ agitation. Isn’t this contradictory? I don’t have to tell the people to agitate. They are agitating on their own. When somebody doesn’t have food to feed his children, he will be protesting on his own. Look at the drama the Akalis did on Thursday with their protest marches. Because they realised that that’s how people on the ground feel. Before that, they had to make a 180-degree turn in their stance, pull this girl (Harsimrat) out and then withdraw from the National Democratic Alliance. All Punjab parties and farmers are in protest mode. But, the Centre has ruled out any re-think on farm laws. Where will all this lead to? That depends on how long the legal system takes to redress the issue. I don’t see them (the Centre) relenting on this. I can speak for Punjab. Unfortunately, this Centre doesn’t understand agriculture. Something is wrong with the whole system. 65% of India in villages lives on agriculture. The MSP is only in North India. But if prices start crashing in other states, there is going to be a big hue and cry. Some quarters argue why the state can’t stand guarantee for the MSP. After all, agriculture is a state subject? We don’t have the money. They (the Centre) have taken away everything. I’ve got nothing with me. We (the state governments) are really going to be completely just living on central charity. That is what it’s coming to. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has asked chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to find the way out to override the farm laws? Can the state legislature pass a Bill to invalidate the central law? This is subject to Presidential assent. This President is not going to approve it. Take the case of the Act we passed on scrapping the interstate water treaties in 2004. The Punjab governor signed it and then forwarded it to the President, who referred it as Presidential reference to the Supreme Court. But, here (in farm laws) even this governor is not going to sign such a Bill passed by the Punjab assembly. If he doesn’t do that, it will not go to the President. Then, what are the options on your table? As of now, a legal recourse is the only option. We’re going to do this (challenge the farm laws) on grounds of violation of the federal structure. My legal team is on the job. We’re going to fight it out. Once they have changed the law, you have to challenge the law. The Centre can’t tell us what to do and what not to do. Tomorrow, if I opt for crop diversification, am I going to take the Government of India’s approval? It i s my problem. Why should they interfere in our affairs? There is a suggestion that the Punjab assembly can bypass a part of the central laws by declaring the entire state a principal marketing yard. Is that doable? That has to be legally checked. The only issue again is that even if the assembly passes it, the governor won’t pass it. Both the BJP and Akalis insist that the Congress manifestos promised privatisation of mandis on the same lines as the new farm laws. Our 2017 Punjab manifesto said we will increase the mandis by 1,000, which incidentally we had to do in the last paddy season due to Covid-19. We had promised to strengthen the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) without tinkering with the MSP. Our Lok Sabha poll manifesto of 2017 said we will do away with the APMC Act but have farmers’ markets. We never said we will do with the MSP or privatise it. How will the BJP-SAD break-up change Punjab’s political terrain? It will certainly change it. After coming out of the ruling NDA, Akalis are going to lose the ground a great deal. They know that. They felt that they will be totally destroyed if they did not come out of the alliance. But frankly, I don’t trust them. One month before the polls, they may join up again. ‘Ihna da koi itbar tan hain nahin (You can’t trust them).’ The Akalis may escalate their agitation to morcha mode? That is their old tactic. Whenever they are in crisis, they raise an outcry of the Panth in crisis. Today, for them, the Panth means Mr and Mrs Badal. Now that Congress in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat has reached out to your estranged MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and called him an asset to the party, what role do you see for Sidhu in the government and the party? I don’t have any problem with Sidhu or Mr Rawat brokering peace. I have known Sidhu from the age of two. He is a Patiala boy. I have no problem with him. Putting somebody somewhere in a job is always done on the basis of what job that person is good at doing. He didn’t like my changing his ministry from local bodies to power. He is welcome to come as power minister, not as local bodies. His job is open. Power is important to me as well as Punjab. What if he doesn’t accept this offer? Then, there is nothing I can do about it. I can’t change my ministers. They are all doing a good job. Why should I change them to suit somebody else? How open are you to making him Punjab Congress chief? I’m very happy with my PCC chief (Sunil Jakhar), who is doing a great job. Why should he make way for somebody? One, you need a PCC chief who understands everybody in the state. Mr Jakhar has lived his whole life in the Congress. Why should somebody who joined the party three years ago become the president? I don’t think that is a fair request if he (Sidhu) asked for it. He can ask for other things. Our national party can make use of him. I can make use of him in the ministry on power. What are the chances of burying the hatchet with rebel MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo? I don’t have any problem with either. They have their own (problems). Every fourth day, Bajwa puts out a letter he claims to have written to me that I never receive. He claims that I got his job as PCC chief. If the Congress president brought me and removed Bajwa, she must have had considerations to do it. I didn’t like only one thing about Dullo. When I was leading the party into the 2017 elections, his son stood as the Aam Aadmi Party candidate. And, Dullo, himself a former PCC chief, was helping his son. That is not on. Both have been strident critics of your government. Are they going to say that I’m doing a great job? Obviously not. If you want to demolish somebody, you have to find something to demolish him with. Are you all set to lead the party in the 2022 assembly elections? I think so. Politically, Punjab is in a good shape: There are four Akali Dals, and the BJP is on its own. We are very happy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-laws-violate-federalism-will-fight-them-out-legally-punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-singh/story-1vWmZ36Mnu2w90TfWJGmrL.html

He said even if the government stands with a sword incidents of rape still cannot be stopped. #WATCH Incidents like these can be stopped with help of good values, na shashan se na talwar se.

Even if the government stands with the sword, such incidents wouldn’t stop. Such incidents will stop when parents give sanskar to their daughters and inculcate (good) values in them.”Hathras: Rahul & Priyanka meet victim’s family; UP CM orders CBI probe in caseHe further added, “The way it is the duty of the government to give protection, likewise, it is the duty of the family and parents to inculcate sanskar in their children.

There is no other way out.”He also said that Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will not be able to steer the rise of Congress in Uttar Pradesh. Both these Congress leaders had met the family of the Dalit girl on Saturday who was brutally raped and murdered by four men on September 14. Media persons and political leaders were not allowed to meet the victim’s kin late until Saturday as Section 144 was imposed on the village and nearby areas. The Uttar Pradesh government has recommended that the Central Bureau of Investigation should take over the probe after several opposition leaders and activists demanded the resignation of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hathras-gangrape-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-says-instilling-sanskar-in-daughters-could-help-stop-rapes/story-klGvONQkawmolrSuy3hIPM.html

Three days ago, some portions of the residential structure located at Ambedkar Road near Krishan Cinema had collapsed. Taking note of this, we initiated the demolition without further delay,” said Bhagaji Bhangre, ward officer, KDMC.As per the dangerous buildings list prepared by the civic body, there are 187 extremely dangerous buildings and 284 dangerous buildings compared to 191 and 282, respectively, last year.Although the civic body has listed the extremely dangerous buildings in its vicinity, there is no proper record on how many of them have been vacated and how many of them are occupied.“We are preparing a list of how many of these extremely dangerous buildings are occupied. We are again going to inspect those buildings that are very unsafe and start taking measures to avoid any incident. As of now, we have all the necessary equipment, machinery and manpower for taking up the demolition work. The only concern is to deal with the residents who are still occupying such structures,” said Sunil Pawar, assistant commissioner, KDMC.The KDMC initiated demolition work on three extremely dangerous structures in the twin cities this week on the backdrop of the Bhiwandi building collapse. This includes a ground-plus-three storey residential building Sai Leela and Sai Prabhat in Dombivli (W) and a ground-plus-three storey structure at Ambedkar road, Shivaji chowk, Kalyan (W).Followed by the Bhiwandi building collapse that claimed 38 lives and injured 25, the Bombay High Court (HC) had taken suo moto (on its own motion) cognisance of the building collapse at Bhiwandi and initiated a public interest litigation (PIL), where all the seven civic bodies in and around Mumbai have been arraigned as respondents.The state government and the seven civic bodies have been asked to respond regarding the steps taken to check illegal constructions and dilapidated buildings in their respective jurisdictions.Out of the ten wards of KDMC, the C ward comprising major part of Kalyan’s west side has the highest number of extremely dangerous buildings. It includes areas like Joshi Baug, Shivaji Chowk, Ahilya Bai Chowk, Gandhi Chowk, Shankar Rao Chowk, Sahajanand Chowk, Lal Chowki, Tilak Chowk, Ambedkar Road, Valipeer Road and Old Kalyan. This particular ward has total 102 extremely dangerous structures and 54 dangerous structures.In Kalyan-Dombivli, one of the major hurdles civic officials face is conflict between tenants and building owners. Due to lack of alternative space to shift, residents opt to live in unsafe buildings.Unsafe buildings: Total structures: 471 Extremely dangerous: 187 Dangerous: 284||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-to-demolish-extremely-dangerous-buildings/story-N3y7MDXzb7YFxhViL5wVrL.html
04-10-2020||Mumbai||Four ‘extremely dangerous’ buildings vacated in Thane||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has vacated four buildings in the last one week and two amongst them have been demolished within Naupada-Kopri ward. There are no more buildings in the C1 category which is considered to be an extremely dangerous category.“Our main focus was the buildings under the extremely dangerous category that have been demolished. Most of the buildings under C2-A category have been vacated. Our survey to check for such structures in dangerous condition continues. Around 80 families have been shifted from these dangerous structures,” said Ashok Burpulle, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.The civic body found it difficult to vacate some of these buildings due to the pandemic, “While most of our available buildings have been converted to quarantine centres, it was getting difficult to make accommodation available for those in dangerous buildings. But we continue to approach those families who reside in some of these dangerous structures and have given them notice to vacate soon,” said a civic officer from Thane civic body.There are a total of 4,300 dangerous buildings in the city, of which 79 are in extremely dangerous category – C1 and 113 are in C2-A category which means dangerous parts of these buildings need to be demolished. Naupada-Kopri ward has a maximum of 37 dangerous buildings, hence the civic body started with this ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-extremely-dangerous-buildings-vacated-in-thane/story-BRU2TM09k1UkrgAEegbhBO.html

This road will enable smoother access to the Taloja MIDC industrial belt.The work on the ₹13.46 cr project began last year. The road, used by heavy vehicles, was in pathetic state for years. The 1.25-km road connects between Taloja CETP and Foodland factory through Railway Over Bridge.The Taloja Industries Association (TIA) had taken up the issue in October 2018 with local MLA Prashant Thakur, who was then the chairman of CIDCO.Satish Shetty, president of TIA, said, “Following the intervention of Thakur, road asphalting and concretisation work on the road was taken up by Cidco last year. Concretising this road is important for the industries as it is one of the two entry points into Taloja MIDC area, from Roadpali side. We had been constantly following up on the work with CIDCO authorities.”Priya Ratambe, Cidco PRO, said: “Concretisation of the road was taken up by Cidco as mere asphalting of the road wouldn’t help. It cannot stand the constant heavy vehicle traffic. One side of the road will be ready to use in a couple of days. The other side of the road work is expected to be ready by March next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/concrete-road-at-taloja-in-navi-mumbai-ready-for-use-this-week/story-LignmoaTuqkufLQiRNSZUN.html
04-10-2020||Mumbai||Kalyan villagers get lessons to avoid leopards||Following several sighting of leopards in the Malang Gad Hills, a popular shrine near Kalyan, forest officials are now creating awareness among the locals to not venture out at night or climb the hill after sunset unnecessarily.The forest department has also set up banners with Dos and Don’ts across the village. The recent sighting of a leopard was by a villager early this week. Malang Gad, also known as Haji Malang, is a popular shrine of Sufi Saint Haji Baba Abdur Rehman Malang in Kalyan, located 13,000 feet high on the hills.The Hindu community also has an annual Malang Gad procession on these hills. With the shrine closed during the pandemic, there are no devotees and the hills and the villages nearby are frequented by the wild cats.Late at night on September 29, two leopards – a cub and an adult – were sighted by a villager near Haji Bakhtawar Shah Baba Dargah area, which is the first Dargah on the way to the main shrine. The wild cats were caught on the CCTV footage of the area.Nasir Khan, one of the trustees of shrine, said, “On Tuesday night, I received a call from one of the caretakers of the shrine. He also sent me the clip of leopard sightings. I soon informed the forest officials about the same. In the past few months, we have sighted more than two to three leopards here. However, they have not harmed anyone till now. We have adequate lighting on the way, keeping the leopards away from the path to the shrine.”Barking dogs alert villagers of wild catsVinod Patil, a villager from Haji Malang, said the leopard was seen earlier too but it was spotted late in the night or in the wee hours. This time, we saw it late in the evening. He said, “Many villagers go down the hill for work and return late in the evening. So, we informed the forest officials. The footage clearly showed a local passing and within seconds the leopard came walking behind. The barking dogs alerted the locals who noticed the leopard.”The villagers claimed that the forest officials have just put up banners informing how dangerous the animal is. However, no other safety precautions have been taken.“Prior to lockdown, apart from villagers, devotees used to climb up late night during weekends with family and small kids. The authorities should see that people don’t climb up late at night to avoid any incidents of attack,” added Patil.Jamir Shaikh, a Kalyan resident and a frequent visitor to the shrine, claimed three leopards – a female and two kids – were spotted frequently. “The CCTV footage clearly shows a small leopard passing at 9:49pm and then at 9:51pm, the adult followed. The sighting has been frequent after the lockdown. The animals are seen near the bus depot down the hill and in different villages, mostly in search of food. Many of the villagers are scared to go out early morning. Instances of leopards eating hens and stray dogs also have become common,” added Jamir.Repeated sightings of leopards Pramod Thakar, Range Forest Officer, Badlapur confirmed about the repeated sightings of leopards in the forest hills near Malang Gad and had appealed to devotees or revellers to avoid climbing up during night hours.“The complete area is connected with hills, leaving the animals enough space to roam around. Many of the villagers have pets like hens, goats and buffaloes. The leopards have good nose and come in search of such easy preys,” added Thakar.He added that the area being hilly, forest officers cannot use their vehicles to make announcements in the area. A few officials routinely patrol the forest on foot. “We have started awareness programmes and are reaching door-to-door to create awareness and share precautionary measures with villagers and nearby areas where leopards have been sighted in the past few months. We have put up banners and posters. This week we have printed 500 pamphlets to distribute in the tribal villages,” added Thakar.He added, “In many such sightings, the leopards have not harmed anyone but taking precautionary measures is more important. Our officials and local watchmen keep an eye on the area regularly.”Safety Tips by Forest Officials: * While climbing and passing through the forest area, carry a stick.* Don’t allow kids alone near forest area or sighting area.* Don’t go for nature’s call in the forest area.* While climbing on the way or in forest, bend down being alert and looking nearby.* Don’t throw wastes near the house; use proper dustbin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-villagers-get-lessons-to-avoid-leopards/story-9z6s7ZhmtSaTR01THJsiiM.html

04-10-2020||Mumbai||Won’t tolerate undue delays, says Navi Mumbai civic body chief||Disappointed with the slow pace of work in various fronts, Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar has given directives to all the health department officers and staff that no delay will, henceforth, be tolerated with any health-related work.Most delays relate to buying of medicines, medical equipment and other purchases important to fight the pandemic.Mahendra Konde, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) PRO, said, “The commissioner insisted that the health department has to work in sync with engineering department. When a Covid facility is made ready by engineering department, the health department, too, has to be ready with all the supplies required there and for that a proper coordination is needed.”Bangar said that a very close attention is required to be given to all medical facilities, especially the stock of medicines. He insisted that no comprises should be made for making the purchase of required goods. He also added that anyone found providing medical equipment and other medical goods of low grade quality, should be immediately black listed and, if required, a case be registered. Every purchase should be compared with market value.Bangar added that after he noticed a few delays in work, he took a review meeting with the health department to convey the same.“I noticed a few delays. For instance, after the first tendering call, if we don’t get response, a second call needs to be made. The second call can be made within four working days. But in some cases, two weeks have been taken, which delays the work. I noticed a sense of lack of urgency during the Covid times, which was addressed. The main intention was to give the message that they are being watched and no compromise in any facility or material would be tolerated,” he said.A health officer from NMMC said, “The commissioner was upset due to some backlogs. We are also working under high pressure for many months. Hence, sometimes some work gets delayed. We are trying our best to cope up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/won-t-tolerate-undue-delays-says-navi-mumbai-civic-body-chief/story-J7zOmfJdLNpzIO29YjcuUI.html
04-10-2020||City||Commuters enjoy toll-free travel, courtesy farmers||SANGRUR Farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws on Saturday didn’t let the staff managing at least five toll plazas in Sangrur, Barnala and Patiala districts charge money from commuters. The farmers started the campaign on October 1 in Sangrur and Barnala districts. The protesters forced open the toll plaza barricades at Badbar village on Bathinda-Chandigarh national highway and Mehal Kalan village on Barnala-Ludhiana road in Barnala district on October 1. Then they let the commuters cross the Kalajhar toll barrier on Chandigarh-Bathinda national highway and another one Ladda village on Sangrur-Ludhiana highway in Sangrur district for free. On Saturday, protesting farmers opened the Dhareri Jattan toll plaza in Patiala district. At Badbar toll plaza, ₹85 is charged from car/jeep or van, ₹140 from minibus and ₹295 from bus/truck for a single crossing. “Toll charges are an unnecessary burden on the public. Farmers opened toll plazas for all vehicles and it gave us a great relief. There should be no toll charges across the state,” said Subhash Kumar of Ferozepur, who was travelling to Mohali in his car. Nachhatar Singh, a private institute bus driver, said, “I used to take detours through villages to save toll charges. Nowadays, I am taking the national highway as the journey is toll-free.” Roop Singh, state committee member of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), said toll plazas are operated by big companies and farmer unions had been raising voice against them. “People appreciated our step. To make roads is government’s responsibility and you can’t charge from the public,” Singh added. General manager of Badbar toll plaza Rajnikant Sinha said, “We are facing a daily loss of ₹9 lakh. Our company is running two toll plazas on rent in Barnala and Sangrur districts. The government should compensate us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commuters-enjoy-toll-free-travel-courtesy-farmers/story-Yfij9TU3vrImf21rzbR4HI.html
04-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 14,348 fresh Covid-19 infections, tally now 1,430,861||Fresh infections in Maharashtra came further down to 14,348 on Saturday, which took the case count to 1,430,861. Active cases also reduced slightly to 258,108, accounting for 18.03% of the total.The toll climbed up to 37,758 after 278 casualties were reported. Of them, 151 deaths were in the past 48 hours, another 64 were from the past week, while the remaining 63 fatalities were from the period before that, health officials said.Fresh infections have not gone up in almost two weeks. However, officials said that they have to wait for more time to draw any conclusions as there are chances that cases are likely to rise in the backdrop of fresh relaxations in the lockdown.Statistics released by the state health department showed that fresh infections were rising till the second week of September, but later they went on a downward trend. In the first week of September, the Covid-19 cases reported were 130,789, second week — 153,972, third week — 148,365 , fourth week — 126,773 and in the past five days (till October 3), it has reported 79,708 infections.“The trend is relieving as it indicates that the situation is coming under control. It also signifies that we are on the right path. However, we will have to wait for some time to reach any conclusion as fresh relaxations will come into effect from October 5, which may result in a surge in cases,” said a senior official from the state health department.The state has declared to allow hotels, food courts, restaurants and bars to operate at 50% of the total capacity from October 5. It has also allowed all industrial and manufacturing units of non-essential units to operate in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Trains originating and ending their journey within the state have been allowed to restart with immediate effect.Dr Subhash Salukhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said that this is a signal of plateauing of cases, however, if people at large did not co-operate, then we will be pushed back to the previous position“After a protracted period of nearly a couple of months, the overall situation seems to be improving. We see this as a signal of plateauing of cases, however, we need peoples’ cooperation. If they follow all the basic precautions and don’t step out of their homes in large numbers during Dussehra and Diwali, unlike in Ganesh festival, then a downward trend by November is possible. If people don’t co-operate, then we may have to face consequences,” Dr Salunkhe said.Despite comparative decline in cases, casualties from the pandemic are yet to reduce. Other states don’t have even half the casualties compared to Maharashtra. Tamil Nadu has reported second-highest number of deaths — 9,586 in the country.The case fatality rate (CFR) is reducing, but that is due to the high daily infection rate. On Saturday, state’s CFR was recorded at 2.64%, making it second after Punjab. The CFR of Punjab was 3.01% (with 3,501 deaths) till Friday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.Mumbai continued to report the highest number of cases across the state as it recorded 2,402 infections on Saturday, pushing its tally to 212,462. Of them, active cases were 29,314. It has also recorded 46 deaths.Pune city contributed second-highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,077 cases, taking its tally to 158,903, while Pune district became the third-highest contributor with 721 cases, pushing its count to 64,487. The combined tally of Pune goes to 1,798 cases. The state also completed 7 lakh tests with 75,093 tests conducted on Saturday. The tally stood at 7,035,296.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-14-348-fresh-covid-19-infections-tally-now-1-430-861/story-hnabfAuZDgp6KG8HAw0CtJ.html

The state government allowed reopening of bars and restaurants from October 5 onward, via a government order on September 30. The guidelines also directed restaurants to take down detailed information of every visitor, including contact details (with the customer’s consent), in case there is a need to contact-trace any visitors later. Such logs will be maintained for 30 days. No buffets and live entertainment are allowed. The guidelines also mandate that all food and beverages establishments will follow safety and hygiene protocols issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) —Food hygiene and safety guidelines for food businesses during coronavirus disease — for storing, serving and cooking of food and beverages. Moreover, all restaurants, bars, and cafes will have to conduct regular Covid-19 screening and testing of all employees, ensure use of N95 or equivalent masks, disinfection of premises twice a day, and maintaining CCTV records of Covid-19 protocols being followed, wherever necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/plan-to-dine-out-book-a-table-make-e-payments/story-dhe2RddlXUIrECTigfVsGL.html
04-10-2020||Delhi||8 days after woman’s body found in bed box, 1 arrested||Eight days after the decomposed body of a 26-year-old woman was found stuffed in a bed box at a house in Delhi’s Qutub Vihar near Chhawla, police on Saturday said they arrested her friend for allegedly murdering her in a fit of rage. Police said the alleged killer, Satish Kumar, suspected her of cheating on him and killed her in a fit of rage during an altercation over the issue at his rented flat on September 23. Kumar allegedly killed her after two attempts. She fell unconscious after Kumar allegedly throttled her and pressed her mouth. When she regained her consciousness, screamed and tried to escape, Kumar strangled and smothered her again. The murder was discovered two days later, police said. Investigators said Kumar was arrested on Thursday from Dibrugarh in Assam, where he had reached after crossing four states and changing various modes of transport in a week. After allegedly strangling his friend and stuffing her body in the bed box at his rented home in Qutub Vihar, Kumar borrowed his friend’s scooter and rode to Agra and then to Lucknow, covering nearly 600 kilometres, they said. “Kumar parked the scooter at the Alambagh bus stand, boarded a bus and left for Gorakhpur. From Gorakhpur, he went to Muzaffarpur in Bihar and then to Siliguri in West Bengal. He then went to Moran in Assam and from there to Dibrugarh. He was caught in Dibrugarh when he was planning to leave for Shillong in Meghalaya and had booked a taxi for Rs 9,000,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said. The suspect changed his locations frequently to avoid arrest.The couple worked in a multinational company in Gurugram and were in a relationship since 2017, the year Satish Kumar had an arranged marriage with another woman chosen by his family, police said. Originally from Jind in Haryana, Kumar has a daughter but left his family and started living in a rented home in Qutub Vihar for over a year, said a police officer associated with the probe. A few weeks ago, the officer said, Kumar felt that the woman was close to some other person. The couple had arguments whenever Kumar confronted her about it. He was upset and suspected she had been ignoring him. On September 23, the woman, who was living separately at a rented home in Khirki Extension in south Delhi, went to Kumar’s house to collect her laptop. As she was getting frequent calls from someone, Kumar enquired about the caller and asked her to unlock her phone so that he could check the caller’s identity. An altercation ensued between them and during that, Kumar killed her, the DCP said. “He covered the body with a blanket and closed the bed. He picked up his clothes, her cellphone and fled on the scooter. Kumar sold his cellphone for Rs 31,000 at a mobile shop in Dwarka, threw her phone in the bushes near Greater Kailash-1 and fled to Agra on the scooter. He removed the SIM card from his phone to avoid any trail,” the DCP said. Police said the woman, who worked with a multinational company in Gurugram, was from Jharkhand. The murder came to light on September 25 when neighbours noticed a foul smell and reported the matter to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-in-bed-box-man-killed-friend-in-a-fit-of-rage-crossed-4-states-to-avoid-arrest/story-F1Pr9V0kzOF4V14A0z5LSP.html

Police said they have recovered 120 bullets and four sophisticated pistols from the four men, who had travelled to Delhi from Kashmir in a Baleno car bearing Jammu and Kashmir’s registration number. Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said the “radicalised Kashmiri youths” were camping in Delhi for the past few days on the directions of their handler and the current chief of Ansar Ghazwat-ul Hind. “The group was planning a terror strike, including in Delhi after collecting huge cache of arms and ammunition. The timely arrest of the four men has averted a possible terror strike,” DCP Kushwah said. The police, however, did not specify details of the planned strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-arrest-four-terrorists-claim-to-avert-terror-strike-in-delhi/story-acE3CjiZoMDG99CEO6C40O.html
04-10-2020||Delhi||Maps of test centres to be put up outside Metro stations||Ahead of the festive season, the government has drafted plans to ramp up its coronavirus awareness campaign, even as it plans to install maps showing Covid testing centres outside major Metro stations, to encourage more people to get checked for the viral infection.A senior official in the Delhi government’s revenue department said the awareness campaign proposal includes distributing pamphlets in prominent markets, religious places, government offices, and other public spaces, and roping in prominent personalities in Delhi to make short videos on Covid-19 awareness. “By the end of next week, district magistrates have been asked to finalise a shortlist of prominent people who reside in neighbourhoods in their jurisdiction,” the official said. “People go out and gather in large numbers in the festive season. An intensified Covid-19 awareness campaign is much needed to address that. The government will try to make people aware of the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, why it is better to stay home, as well as encourage people to get tested. People’s safety is our priority,” Delhi revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said. On Thursday, the Delhi government had issued a circular asking all departments to formulate their own “action plans” to intensify Covid-19 awareness campaigns ahead of the festive weeks. The Delhi government, on September 28, finalised an electronic map, in which it located 320 government-run Covid-19 test centres in the city – for both rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. “The final map has been shared with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) with a request to put it on display at prominent locations/sites at major metro stations (at entry-exit points and others as found appropriate) for the information of general public,” read the maps-related proposal, which HT has seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maps-of-test-centres-to-be-put-up-outside-metro-stations/story-T2S69ulcYowTjyJ7zShfwI.html

04-10-2020||World||Trump could return to White House on Monday, say doctors||US President Donald Trump could be discharged as early as Monday from a military hospital where he is undergoing treatment after contracting the coronavirus, his physicians said on Sunday, hours after he released a video saying “I’ll be back soon.”But the doctors also revealed on Sunday a previously unreported episode of his blood oxygen levels dropping below normal, adding to the confusing updates from the White House on his health. Trump had the first episode on Friday, with high fever, which had prompted his physician and medical experts to shift him to the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. But the medical team did not mention it at their Saturday briefing and had sought to present a rosy picture of the president doing well and being in high spirits. It came out through a leak to reporters by a senior official.Dr Brian Garibaldi, a Johns Hopkins doctor who is part of the medical team, told reporters on Sunday the president felt good and has been up and around. “If he continues to look and feel as well as he does today, our hope is that we can plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow to the White House where he can continue his treatment course.” The president was given a second dose of the anti-viral drug remdesivir on Saturday and was started off on dexamethasone, a steroid used to prevent drop in blood oxygen levels.But the team insisted the president was doing well overall. In his video message, Trump said that although the “real test” lies ahead, he hoped to resume and finish his re-election campaign.“I have to get all the way back because we still have to make America great again.” The White House later released pictures of the president working at his medical suite at the hospital to continue to reinforce the optimistic projection.Sean Conley, Trump’s physician who is facing criticism over what was seen as inaccurate updates, defended himself saying, “I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president...has had... and didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, you know, came off that we’re trying to hide something, it wasn’t necessarily true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-could-return-to-white-house-on-monday-say-doctors/story-F9UlcdACEdbKU51imEm0KP.html
04-10-2020||World||UK government says it will reform ‘broken’ asylum system||Britain’s interior minister vowed Sunday to stop people entering the country clandestinely and to fix what she called a “broken” asylum system, echoing commitments that have been made and broken by UK governments for years.Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government would bring in new laws so it could “stop those who come here illegally making endless legal claims to remain” and “expedite the removal of those who have no claim for protection.”Patel said in a speech to a virtual Conservative Party conference that the changes would be “the biggest overhaul of our asylum system in decades.”She said Britain would continue to “provide safe haven to those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny.”Patel’s hardline rhetoric was designed to appeal to voters concerned at a surge in the number of people crossing the English Channel from France in small boats. Thousands have made the journey this year, most over the summer.Opposition Labour Party immigration spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Conservatives were “devoid of compassion and competence” on immigration.Migrants have long used northern France as a launching point to reach Britain by stowing away in trucks or on ferries. Many appear to have turned to small boats organized by smugglers during the coronavirus pandemic because virus restrictions have reduced vehicle traffic between France and Britain.Patel’s speech follows reports in recent weeks that the government considered ideas including building a wave machine in the Channel to deter boats and processing asylum-seekers on Ascension Island, a remote volcanic island more than 4,000 miles (6,435 kilometers) from the UK.The government dismissed some of the more far-fetched claims, but Patel said she would “explore all practical measures and options to deter illegal migration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-says-it-will-reform-broken-asylum-system/story-3AOAQkwyxdsD8VPVi6uJZI.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump continues to improve during coronavirus treatment: Doctors||President Donald Trump’s blood oxygen level dropped suddenly on Saturday, but he “has continued to improve,” the White House physician said Sunday, suggesting that Trump could be discharged from the hospital as early as Monday.Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley sought to clarify contradictory statements and confusion about the president’s condition on the steps of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Trump was being treated for Covid-19.Conley said the president had a “high fever” and a blood oxygen level below 94% on Friday and again on Saturday. The level currently stands at 98%, Trump’s medical team said.“The president has continued to improve,” Conley said.Trump offered his own assessment of his status the night before in a video from his hospital suite, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon.” And he was back on social media early Sunday morning, sharing a video of flag-waving supporters, most not wearing masks, gathered outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the president’s health and the nation’s leadership on the line. Moreover, the president’s health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the U.S. government but also to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise.Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, pulled his attack ads off the air during Trump’s hospitalization, and on Sunday, he dispatched senior aides to deliver a largely friendly message.“We are sincerely hoping that the president makes a very quick recovery, and we can see him back out on the campaign trail very soon,” Biden adviser Symone Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”She added: “This is a glaring reminder that the virus is real.”Biden was at home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday with no plans for in-person campaigning or other public appearances. Having already tested negative, he is expected to release the results of a new coronavirus test later in the day, and the campaign has pledged to disclose those results and all other future test results for the 77-year-old candidate.On Saturday, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.” In an update Saturday night, Trump’s chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was “not yet out of the woods.”Meanwhile, Trump’s handling of the pandemic and his own health faced new scrutiny.Trump’s medical care is far superior to the average American’s, with around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments. In the hospital video, he defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events during a pandemic.“I had no choice,” said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. “I had to be out front. ... I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.”Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide and killed more than 209,000 people in the U.S.First lady Melania Trump remained at the White House to recover from her own bout with the virus.Trump’s administration has been less than transparent with the public throughout the pandemic, both about the president’s health and the virus’s spread inside the White House. The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the president’s symptoms, what tests he’s undertaken and the results.Conley declined to say when Trump had last been tested before he was confirmed to have COVID-19 late Thursday. He initially suggested that Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis — which would mean that he was confirmed infected Wednesday. Conley later clarified that Trump was administered an accurate test for the virus on Thursday afternoon.The White House has said Trump was expected to stay at the hospital for “a few days” and would continue to work from its presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties.On Saturday, Conley said Trump’s blood oxygen level was 96%, which is in the normal range. The two experimental drugs he has received, given through an IV, have shown some promise against COVID-19.He noted that in many cases, COVID-19 can become more dangerous as the body responds. “The first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10, are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness,” he said.At the same time, the White House has been working to trace a flurry of new infections of close Trump aides and allies. Attention is focused in particular on the Sept. 26 White House event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.That day, Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands — overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett, her family, senators and others spent time in the close quarters of the White House, photographs show.Among those who attended and have now tested positive: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. The president’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, have also tested positive, though they were not at the event. Another prominent Republican who has tested positive: Sen. Ron Johnson. R-Wis.___Colvin reported from Washington. Peoples reported from New York.

04-10-2020||World||Biden leads Trump in polls; respondents say prez could’ve avoided infection||Most Americans believe President Donald Trump could have avoided Covid-19 infection if he had handled the pandemic better, and there is no indication yet of an outpouring of support for him, according to a new poll by Reuters/Ipsos released on Sunday.The poll also showed that Trump’s Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden had expanded his lead over him by 10 points. Biden widened his lead by 14 points in a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll also. That poll was released on Sunday but conducted in the days between the first presidential debate and Trump’s hospitalisation. While three-fourths of the respondents said in the poll that the debate made no difference, 25% said they were more likely to vote for Biden now.In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Friday and Saturday, 51% of registered voters supported Biden, and 41% backed Trump. The poll showed that 65% respondents, 9 in 10 Democrats and 5 in 10 Republicans, held Trump responsible for getting infected. According to them, “if President Trump had taken coronavirus more seriously, he probably would not have been infected.”In the WSJ and NBC’s poll, Biden leads the president 53% to 39%, which is the highest support the former vice-president has enjoyed in polls conducted by them in months. It also showed the president’s support slip under 40% for the first time, and that negative views of him had increased.The poll found the debate moved the needle on Trump more than any other single significant factor such as his impeachment by the House of Representatives and acquittal by the Senate.Biden leads Trump up by 8.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and by 7.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-leads-trump-in-polls-respondents-say-prez-could-ve-avoided-infection/story-nslymV2afjeoAmnMedmCzL.html

He has completed a second dose of Remdesivir, and his kidney and liver functions were normal, his medical team added.Earlier in the day, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had revealed that the condition of the President was more critical than officials had made public. According to reports on Friday, Trump was experiencing “mild symptoms” and continuing to work.“I can tell you this the biggest thing we see is with no fever now, and with him doing really well with his oxygen saturation levels,” Meadows said during an interview with Fox News broadcast.First Lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive for the coronavirus along with her husband on Thursday evening, was recuperating at the White House where she remained “well with only a mild cough and headache”.A number of US President’s aides and advisors were also tested positive for the virus. Kellyanne Conway, a former adviser to Trump, Bill Stepien, head of the Trump re-election campaign, and Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate against Democratic rival Joe Biden were tested positive one after the other.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-experienced-2-episodes-of-blood-oxygen-drop-has-had-no-fever-since-friday-hospital/story-VLaVrGOq3PWnfIiZZzRkMK.html

04-10-2020||World||France, Italy search for missing victims after deadly floods||French authorities deployed about 1,000 firefighters, four military helicopters and troops to search for at least eight people who were missing after devastating floods hit a mountainous border region with Italy, where at least four people were killed.Emergency workers in Italy recovered two corpses Sunday in northern Liguria that they feared may have been washed away as a result of the storms that killed two other people on Saturday.Floods washed away houses and destroyed roads and bridges surrounding the city of Nice on the French Riviera after almost a year’s average rainfall fell in less than 12 hours. Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged.Rescuers on Sunday were also providing emergency assistance, including food and water, to residents living in isolated villages.The missing include two French firefighters whose vehicle was carried away by a torrent when a road collapsed south of the village of Saint-Martin-Vesubie. Authorities fear more victims as many families couldn’t reach out to relatives due to cellphone service being down.French Prime Minister Jean Castex, who flew over the area in a helicopter, expressed “grave concern” over the toll of the flooding.About 10,500 homes were left without electricity on Sunday, French energy company Enedis said.In Italy, the body of one person reported missing on Saturday — a French citizen of Italian origin — was found in the Roia River, the ANSA and LaPresse news agencies reported. The second one washed up closer to where the Roia empties into the Mediterranean along Italy’s border with France.An Italian firefighter was killed on Saturday during a rescue operation in the mountainous northern region of Val d’Aosta. A search team also found a body in the Piedmont region’s Vercelli province, where a man had been swept away by floodwaters.Italian firefighters also rescued 25 people trapped on the French side of a high mountain pass due to the flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-italy-search-for-missing-victims-after-deadly-floods/story-YjEnPZv0wJnPCiNv61oOMK.html
04-10-2020||World||Azerbaijan’s No. 2 city targeted in fighting with Armenia||The fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces continued on Sunday over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Azerbaijan’s second-largest city coming under attack.Azerbaijani officials said Sunday that Armenian forces attacked Ganja, the country’s second largest city. Hikmet Hajiyev, an aide to the Azerbaijani president, tweeted a video depicting damaged buildings, and called it the result of “Armenia’s massive missile attacks against dense residential areas” in Ganja.It wasn’t immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the video. Hajiyev said in another tweet that attacks on Ganja and other areas in Azerbaijan were launched “from territory of Armenia.”Armenia’s Defense Ministry said that “no fire of any kind is being opened from the territory of Armenia in Azerbaijan’s direction.” But Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, confirmed on Facebook he ordered “rocket attacks to neutralize military objects” in Ganja. His spokesman, Vahram Poghosyan, said the territory’s army destroyed a military airport in Ganja, a claim Azerbaijani officials denied.The attack on the city killed one civilian and left four others wounded, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry tweeted. Harutyunyan said he ordered his forces to stop the attacks on Ganja to avoid civilian casualties. Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader added that “proportionate and crushing” strikes targeting the opponent’s forces would continue, if Azerbaijan fails “to draw appropriate lessons.”The fighting, which broke out on Sept. 27 and has continued for eight straight days, is the biggest escalation in years in the decades-long dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. The region lies within Azerbaijan, but is controlled by local ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia. Both sides said the hostilities have spread beyond the breakaway territory and accused each other of attacking areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh.Ganja, with a population of more than 330,000, is located roughly 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) north of Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital.“Opening fire on the territory of Azerbaijan from the territory of Armenia is clearly provocative and expands the zone of hostilities,” Azerbaijani Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov said in a statement Sunday.As the fighting resumed Sunday morning, Armenian officials accused Azerbaijan of carrying out strikes on Stepanakert and targeting the civilian population there. Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader Harutyunyan said that in response, his forces would target “military facilities permanently located in major cities of Azerbaijan.”In a statement issued later on Sunday, Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry rejected accusations of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.Nagorno-Karabakh officials have said nearly 200 servicemen on their side have died so far. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t given details on their military casualties, but said 22 civilians were killed and 74 others were wounded.Nagorno-Karabakh was a designated autonomous region within Azerbaijan during the Soviet era. It claimed independence from Azerbaijan in 1991, about three months before the Soviet Union’s collapse. A full-scale war that broke out in 1992 killed an estimated 30,000 people.By the time the war ended in 1994, Armenian forces not only held Nagorno-Karabakh itself but substantial areas outside the territory’s formal borders, including Madagiz, the village Azerbaijan claimed to have taken on Saturday along with several others.This week’s fighting has prompted calls for a cease-fire from around the world. On Thursday, leaders of Russia, France and the United States — co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group, which was set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1992 to resolve the conflict — issued a joint statement calling for an immediate cease-fire and “resuming substantive negotiations ... under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs.”Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev said that Armenia’s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh is the sole condition to end the fighting.Armenian officials allege that Turkey is involved in the conflict and is sending fighters from Syria to the region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said earlier this week that “a cease-fire can be established only if Turkey is removed from the South Caucasus.”Ankara has denied sending arms or foreign fighters, while publicly siding with Azerbaijan in the dispute.On Sunday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attack on Ganja, saying it was proof of Armenia’s disregard for the law. Ankara accused Armenia of attacking civilian residential areas, and claimed that Armenia could commit crimes against humanity.“Armenia is the biggest barrier to peace and stability in the region,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-s-no-2-city-targeted-in-fighting-with-armenia/story-KA0SJTmceezLHQUjjhuXyH.html
04-10-2020||World||Azerbaijan says Armenia attacks city, threatens retaliation||Azerbaijan said on Sunday that Armenian forces had fired rockets at its second city of Ganja, killing one civilian and wounding four, and threatened to retaliate by destroying military targets inside Armenia.The developments marked a sharp escalation of the war in the South Caucasus that broke out one week ago.Until now, the main fighting has been between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, but it now threatens to spill over into a direct war with Armenia itself.“Azerbaijan will destroy military targets directly inside Armenia from which shelling of its population centres is taking place,” presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev said.He said there were also civilian casualties in another Azeri region, Beylagan, which borders Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia denied it had directed fire “of any kind” towards Azerbaijan. The leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said his forces had targeted a military airbase in Ganja but later stopped firing in order to avoid civilian casualties.The conflict threatens to drag in other regional powers as Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey, while Armenia has a defence pact with Russia.Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said: “The attacks of Armenia targeting the civilians in Ganja...are a new manifestation of Armenia’s unlawful attitude. We condemn these attacks.”FIGHTING SPREADSAzerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter his forces had captured the town of Jabrail and several villages in what, if confirmed, would be a significant advance on the southern edge of Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyandismissed the claim as “yet another fabrication”. Independent verification was not possible.Nagorno-Karabakh reported deaths and casualties among civilians in Stepanakert and Shushi as a result of Azeri shelling.The fighting that broke out one week ago between Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces has intensified in the past two days and spread far beyond the breakaway Karabakh region.Ganja, with a population of 335,000, is about 100 km (60 miles) north of the Karabakh capital Stepanakert and 80 km from the Armenian city of Vardenis.Azerbaijan has previously accused Armenia of firing into its territory from Vardenis, and Yerevan has denied it. Armenia says two civilians were killed in and near Vardenis last week by cross-border fire from Azerbaijan.Armenia says Azerbaijan has used the airport in Ganja as a base for its warplanes to carry out bombing raids on Nagorno-Karabakh.Nagorno-Karabakh leader Arayik Harutyunyan said his forces would target Azeri cities.“Permanent military units located in the large cities of Azerbaijan from now on become the targets of the defence army,” he said.HEAVY CASUALTIESCasualties from the past week’s fighting have run into the hundreds, although precise figures are impossible to obtain.Armenia said the Karabakh cities of Stepanakert and Martakert were under attack by Azerbaijan’s air force and from long-range missiles. Each side accused the other of targeting civilians.Ignoring appeals from Russia, the United States, France and the EU to call a ceasefire, the opposing sides have stepped up hostilities over the weekend, with an accompanying rise in aggressive rhetoric.Armenia said on Saturday it would use “all necessary means” to protect ethnic Armenians from attack by Azerbaijan, and its prime minster compared the struggle with a 20th century war against Ottoman Turkey.Azerbaijan said on Saturday its forces had captured a string of villages. Armenia acknowledged that ethnic Armenian fighters were under pressure in some places and said the situation on the ground was fluctuating.The clashes are the worst since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed. They have raised international concern about stability in the South Caucasus, where pipelines carry Azeri oil and gas to world markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-says-armenia-attacks-city-threatens-retaliation/story-XOly3a9eh6ep4aIkPgzkUM.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump’s condition had been worse than revealed, confirms White House||White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows revealed that President Donald Trump’s condition on Friday was far worse than officials had made public, saying doctors recommended the president go to the hospital after seeing he had a fever and his blood oxygen level dropped rapidly.Meadows made the comments in an interview with Fox News broadcast Saturday night that capped two days of conflicting and opaque assessments of the 74-year-old president’s health.“I can tell you this the biggest thing we see is with no fever now, and with him doing really well with his oxygen saturation levels,” Meadows told Fox host Jeanine Pirro. “Yesterday morning we were really concerned by that. He had a fever, and his oxygen level had dropped rapidly. Yet in typical style, this president was up and walking around.”White House officials including Meadows said on Friday that Trump was experiencing “mild symptoms” and continuing to work. He told Fox News however, that doctors from Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins recommended that Trump go to the hospital.“He’s made unbelievable improvements from yesterday morning when I know a number of us, the doctor and I, were very concerned,” Meadows said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-condition-had-been-worse-than-revealed-white-house/story-ScWXIWfkVkKKcLFdc6ImTP.html
04-10-2020||World||I was too fat, says UK PM Boris Johnson, as Covid cases surge||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday admitted he was “too fat” when he contracted the coronavirus in March and exhorted Britons to use the restrictions imposed by the pandemic to lose weight, as new cases continued to surge across the UK.The pandemic should be a “teachable moment” for the country, Johnson told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show ahead of the Conservative party’s annual conference, being held virtually this year.The UK recorded the highest daily rise of cases at 12,872 and 49 deaths by Saturday evening, but officials said a technical issue was responsible, having included infections not recorded earlier for the September 24-October 1 period.The opposition Labour kept up pressure on the government’s handling of the pandemic. Party leader Keir Starmer said: “I think they’ve lost control of the virus. And I don’t want to see death rates go up. Nobody does. But this is serial incompetence.”In the BBC interview, Johnson, who recovered from the virus after three days in the intensive care unit, dismissed as “drivel” claims that he was still suffering from the effects of coronavirus, known as “long Covid.”“It is balderdash and nonsense. I can tell you I’m fitter than several butchers’ dogs.”His government, Johnson said, was trying to achieve a balance between saving lives and protecting the economy, but cautioned that daily life would not return to normal until Christmas, perhaps even beyond.He said: “On the one hand we have the imperative to save life, it is a moral imperative to save life if we possibly can. On the other hand we have to keep our economy moving and our society going. That is the balance that we are trying to strike”.“If you ask me ‘do I think things can be significantly different by Christmas?’ Yes I do, and we’re working flat-out to achieve that. But be in no doubt that it is still very possible that there are bumpy, bumpy months ahead. This could be a very tough winter for all of us - we’ve got to face that fact”, he added.Alex Norris, shadow health minister, criticised the interview: “Boris Johnson had the chance to map out a serious strategy to improve public confidence in the government’s handling of this crisis. Instead he waffled and ducked every question. His serial incompetence is holding Britain back”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-too-fat-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson-as-covid-cases-surge/story-P4vbvxjsp4dpLqJ7pxXa2N.html
04-10-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson defends coronavirus strategy as infections soar||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday despite weeks of rising infections, but warned that the country faced a “bumpy” winter ahead.Britain has Europe’s highest coronavirus death toll, at more than 42,400, and Johnson’s Conservative government is facing criticism from all sides. Opponents say tougher social restrictions are needed to suppress a second wave of Covid-19 that is already sweeping the country. But many in Johnson’s right-of-center party argue that restrictions must be eased to save the battered economy.Johnson told the BBC the government had to strike a difficult balance and he couldn’t “take a course that could expose us to tens of thousands more deaths in very short order.”“It is a moral imperative to save lives ... but on the other hand, we have to keep our economy moving. That is the balance that we are trying to strike,” he said.Britain went into a national lockdown in March, with most businesses closed and all but essential travel barred. Restrictions began to be lifted in June as the pandemic tide receded. But like other European countries, daily new coronavirus infections began to rise again when pubs and restaurants reopened, children went back to school and students returned to university.The UK is now under national restrictions on socializing, including a 10 pm curfew for bars and restaurants, and groups limited to six, with areas of high infection facing stricter local measures, which Johnson and other ministers have sometimes struggled to explain clearly. Critics say months of mixed messages and changes of advice on everything from wearing masks to whether or not to work from home has left people confused and exhausted.A national test-and-trace program to find people who have been exposed to the virus has also had persistent problems, and is failing to reach more than a quarter of infected people’s contacts.Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, accused the government of “serial incompetence.”“The prime minister is governing in hindsight,” Starmer told the Observer newspaper. “So he charges forward, not recognizing the problem, has a car crash, looks in the rear mirror and says: ‘What’s all that about?’”Britain recorded 12,872 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, by far the highest daily total since the outbreak began, although the figure includes a backlog of previously unreported cases. The daily number can’t directly be compared to UK’s peak in April because many more tests are being performed now.The number of hospitalizations and deaths in Britain is also rising, but remains far below the U.K.’s springtime peak. Another 49 Covid-19 deaths were reported on Saturday, compared to almost 1,000 a day at the height of the outbreak.Johnson acknowledged that many people feel “fatigue” after months of restrictions and expressed hope that progress on vaccines and testing would “change the scientific equation” in the next few months, allowing a return to normality.But he warned “it’s going to continue to be bumpy through to Christmas. It may even be bumpy beyond.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-defends-coronavirus-strategy-as-infections-soar/story-AxPkG1X1PJQ7k7wMpr4dPN.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump tempted fate long before Rose Garden coronavirus cluster||Ever since March, when much of the country went into lockdown to contain the coronavirus, Donald Trump has tempted fate -- ignoring his own administration’s advice on avoiding the virus, yet managing to avoid it all the same.There was a June rally inside a Tulsa arena, and a convention speech to 2,500 people on the South Lawn of the White House in August. Then came de facto political rallies, which gave way to full outdoor rallies, which gave way to indoor ones. All gathered Trump supporters, largely maskless, tightly packed together, and yet the president -- a habitual germophobe even before the pandemic -- always emerged unscathed.Also read: Trump campaign launches ‘Operation MAGA’ to keep momentum at ‘full speed’But they all paled next to last weekend’s celebratory introduction of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, where roughly 150 guests sat shoulder-to-shoulder in the White House Rose Garden. Senators and other Republican luminaries worked the crowd, shaking hands, hugging and air-kissing, leaning in for conversation. There were indoor gatherings, too. And barely a mask in sight.The triumphant event has turned into a public health nightmare. At least eight people who attended have since tested positive, including Trump himself, his wife, two Republican senators, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the president of Notre Dame University, though it isn’t known where they contracted the virus.In the aftermath, the White House said it is performing contract tracing, but several attendees told Bloomberg News that they haven’t been contacted. Some guests are quarantining while others are not, in apparent contradiction of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.“If you had to invent a way to transmit this virus, that’s the environment you would invent,” said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “The only higher risk environment I can think of is the air in an ICU that is caring for lots of Covid patients.”The response mirrors Trump’s inconsistent approach to the pandemic: only selectively, and rarely, following the advice of his own health professionals. Trump, in a statement from Walter Reed hospital on Saturday, chalked up his diagnosis to fate and his desire to be seen leading the country.“I had no choice because I just didn’t want to stay in the White House,” he said. “I had to be out front, and this is America, this is the United States.”Trump has made downplaying the risk of the virus and getting the country back to work a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Now voters will judge how that approach has paid off for both the country and Trump personally, just a month before Election Day.“We have a situation now where multiple people in the White House have Covid, as precautions were not being taken,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who is a former health commissioner of Baltimore.Also read: Donald Trump faces credibility crisis over Covid-19 health scare. Here’s whyTrump has often cited ubiquitous coronavirus testing within the White House as an excuse to not wear a mask. But testing is about detection, not prevention, Wen said.It’s not known how, when or from whom Trump contracted the coronavirus. He conducted nearly a full week of public events and fundraisers after Saturday’s Rose Garden ceremony, including one on Thursday at his golf course in New Jersey after learning a close aide, Hope Hicks, had contracted the virus.He was flown by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday after testing positive for the virus and exhibiting symptoms. His staff say he’ll spend at least three days there.The Barrett introduction has drawn criticism for what appears to be a flouting of CDC protocols. Images of the event show a relaxed crowd mingling freely -- some with masks, but many without.There was a giddy feel to the occasion, as guests gave fist bumps, posed for group pictures and shared hugs before and after Trump’s announcement. During his remarks, guests sat close together.“I was not happy there were a lot of people not wearing masks,” despite signs asking attendees to do so, said John Malcolm, a legal scholar with the Heritage Foundation who attended the event.Malcolm, who serves as director of the Meese Center for Legal & Judicial Studies, said he took a Covid test on Tuesday, which was negative. Malcolm said he has yet to hear from any White House officials following up on the spread of the virus at the event -- though he added he didn’t think that was necessary.“At this point anybody who attended the event is certainly on notice they ought to consider getting tested,” Malcolm said in a phone interview.Temperature checksWhite House guests were subject to temperature checks on their way in -- though the screening is not foolproof, since some infected individuals may not have symptoms and others do not develop fever. And most attendees only participated in the outdoors event, where the risk of spread through aerosolized droplets is believed to be reduced.No one was “being cavalier about Covid,” said Cleta Mitchell, a political law attorney and partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Foley & Lardner.“Most of the people in the audience, including me, were outdoors the entire time,” Mitchell said by email. “Temperatures were taken as we went through the entry points and masks were required. Once outside, masks were optional -- but we were outside.”But the outdoor event was bookended by gatherings inside the White House, attended by at least some of the participants later found to be infected. Some who attended these indoor events were tested, but it’s not clear how many. Barrett and her family visited with Trump, the first lady and other White House staff in the Oval Office before the Rose Garden celebration.And while the virus is generally spread less easily outside, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people stay six feet apart from people they don’t live with and wear masks in those situations. The CDC also cautions that a mask is “not a substitute for social distancing.” Both recommendations were widely disregarded.New Jersey eventConcerns have also been stoked by Trump’s Thursday afternoon roundtable with supporters and a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He would test positive hours later.Organizers of the event sent a letter notifying attendees of the president and first lady’s positive test results. Health officials in the state have also begun attempting to reach participants. Likewise, organizers of the presidential debate in Cleveland on Tuesday have followed up with attendees.There are no signs the White House itself is mounting its own comprehensive contact-tracing effort, the practice of piecing together chains of potential exposures and identifying individuals who may have come into contact with infected people.Representatives of several people who were at other events with Trump in the past week, including Minnesota House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, said they have not been formally notified of their potential exposure nor contacted by investigators seeking to learn about their actions in recent days.The high-profile nature of these cases makes it likely people at recent events with Trump are already aware of their potential exposure. Contract-tracing efforts are often conducted by local health authorities as a way to help identify second- and third-order contacts that may have been near someone with an initial exposure -- from acquaintances to store clerks.Contract tracingTrump’s physician, Sean Conley, said Saturday the White House Medical Unit was conducting contact tracing in conjunction with the CDC and local and state heath departments. LaToya Foster, a spokeswoman for the mayor of Washington, said the White House would do any contact tracing.After his infection was made public early Friday, the White House scrambled to more closely follow some guidelines -- senior aides suddenly began wearing masks, for one. But others were still dismissed, such as quarantine recommendations for those who’ve come in contact with a confirmed case.On Friday, Trump’s campaign announced it would scrap all planned events involving the president, though some could be virtual. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany -- who wore a mask outside, but also came to work on Friday despite being exposed to both Trump and Hicks -- said officials were looking at ways for Trump to continue to speak to the American people.Trump’s campaign initiated a reset on Saturday, launching “Operation MAGA” in a bid to keep things moving in the absence of both Trump and campaign manager Bill Stepien, who also has the disease.Trump now faces the prospect of scrapping his signature rallies, a staple of both of his campaigns. Meanwhile, voting has already begun across much of the U.S., with polls showing Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden nationally and in key swing states.In different times, voters have rallied around wounded presidents, as they did with Ronald Reagan after he survived an assassination attempt in 1981, or cheered on leaders in times of national crisis, as they did for George W. Bush after the September 11 terror attacks.Trump’s own insistence on ignoring public health measures many Americans observed every day, like masks and social distancing, could diminish that reservoir of sympathy. His presidency has been so polarizing that there’s little clear precedent for how his illness might affect American sentiment. Polls already show Americans strongly disapprove of his handling of the pandemic.“Presidents in trouble always experience a temporary bump in the numbers, said Craig Shirley, a presidential historian and biographer of Ronald Reagan. “It’s just the basic decency of the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tempted-fate-long-before-rose-garden-coronavirus-cluster/story-pF0uJBTAjTvGKV3qIaaEyJ.html
04-10-2020||World||Clashes escalate as Armenian-backed forces say they hit base in Azeri City||Armenian-backed forces in the breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh said they struck a military airport in Azerbaijan’s second-largest city on Sunday in a major escalation of fighting between the former Soviet republics.Azeri President Ilham Aliyev’s office said the missiles that hit Ganca came from neighboring Armenia, an allegation the Armenian Defense Ministry denied. The missile strike killed one civilian and injured four others in a densely populated area of the city and did not hit an air base, the Azeri government in Baku said.Nagorno-Karabakh said it attacked the military airport in Ganca in retaliation for Azerbaijan’s bombing of Stepanakert, the enclave’s biggest city. Arayik Harutyunyan, the disputed territory’s president, warned that its forces are now targeting military sites in large cities of Azerbaijan.Azeri Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov described the attack as an “open provocation” by Armenia that “expands the theater of conflict.”Harutyunyan, the enclave’s leader, was injured in a retaliatory precision strike on his bunker, Aliyev’s foreign policy aide Hikmet Hajiyev said. The Nagorno-Karabakh leader’s spokesman denied he suffered any injuries. It wasn’t possible to confirm the information independently.Azerbaijan’s Aliyev, backed by Turkey, has vowed to continue the military campaign until Armenian forces leave Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts that Azerbaijan lost in a war after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. The violence that began a week ago is more intense and widespread than at any time since Russia brokered a 1994 cease-fire to halt that war, which killed about 30,000 people and displaced more than a million.The latest confrontation adds to tensions between Russia and Turkey over proxy conflicts in Syria and Libya. Russia has an army base in Armenia, and the two nations have a mutual-defense pact, though it doesn’t cover Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia and Azerbaijan on Saturday set seemingly impossible terms for agreeing to cease-fire calls from the U.S., France and Russia.German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday spoke to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and expressed concern about the clashes and increasing number of victims, a German government spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. Merkel stressed that all sides must immediately stop fighting and start negotiations, according to the statement.Pashinyan called on the German government to take a clear stance, in an interview with Bild magazine. Asked if Berlin should publicly declare who started the current hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh, he replied: “Yes. And Germany should evaluate the involvement of terrorists and mercenaries recruited in Syria in this conflict in the region by Turkey.”Azeri forces captured eight villages in the northeast and southeast of Nagorno-Karabkh, after earlier taking control of seven other small localities, the defense ministry in Baku said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-escalate-as-armenian-backed-forces-say-they-hit-base-in-azeri-city/story-xbykzYiwzGCXgZKU4KCZeN.html

04-10-2020||World||Covid-19 positive Donald Trump ‘not yet out of the woods’, says White House||US President Donald Trump posted a video Saturday from the hospital where he is battling Covid-19, saying he was improving and would be “back soon” -- but acknowledged that the crucial coming days would be “the real test.”“I came here, wasn’t feeling so well. I feel much better now,” Trump, 74, said from his business suite at the Walter Reed military medical center near Washington.“We’re working hard to get me all the way back... I think I’ll be back soon and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started.”Appearing relaxed in an open-collar shirt and blue suit jacket, Trump acknowledged there was uncertainty about the course of the disease, which can hit recovering patients hard with no warning.“I’m starting to feel good. You don’t know over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test, so we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days.”Trump’s wife also tested positive but he said her symptoms were not as bad as his own.“Melania is really handling it very nicely. As you’ve probably read, she’s slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit,” he joked about the 50-year-old first lady.Late Saturday, White House doctor Sean Conley said Trump was “not yet out of the woods,” but that the medical team is “cautiously optimistic.”White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump’s condition had them worried on Friday, but that he had since improved.“Yesterday morning, we were real concerned... he had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly,” Meadows told Fox News late Saturday.Meadows said there was never a risk Trump would have to hand over power to Vice President Mike Pence, after a day of conflicting reports and confusion over the leader’s actual fitness.“He’s made unbelievable improvements from yesterday morning, when I know a number of us, the doctor and I, were very concerned,” Meadows said.His comments echoed remarks by Conley, who said Trump had “made substantial progress since diagnosis, and remained “fever-free and off supplemental oxygen.”Trump had completed a second dose of therapeutic drug remdesivir and had spent “most of the afternoon conducting business,” Conley added.Conley was evasive when asked earlier whether the president had received supplementary oxygen at any point since falling ill, only confirming that he hadn’t received any at the hospital or on Thursday -- the day of his positive test.Several US media outlets said Trump was on oxygen at the White House on Friday before being admitted to Walter Reed.- ‘White House cluster -Conley added to the confusion by suggesting that Trump had been diagnosed on Wednesday -- not on Thursday, per the official account -- but he later said he had misspoken. Soon after Trump arrived at the hospital, Conley said in a memo the president was starting a course of remdesivir and had received an eight-gram dose of an experimental antibody cocktail.Neither Trump’s doctors nor the White House explained why the president was taking unproven drugs if his progress was satisfactory.Trump’s optimism over his recovery prospects has been tempered by news that more people close to the president have tested positive for the coronavirus.They included campaign advisor Chris Christie, who was among several aides that helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate who have since announced positive tests.Christie and a number of senators and Trump aides are also among a growing list from the president’s orbit to have tested positive after attending an event in the White House Rose Garden last weekend.The so-called “White House cluster” includes the president’s wife Melania, close confidante Hope Hicks, former White House top aide Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager Bill Stepien and Republican senators Thom Tillis and Mike Lee.Another close aide, Nicholas Luna, one of the “body men” who accompanies the president round the clock, had also tested positive, CNN reported.Heightening the sense of crisis at the heart of power in America, a third Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced on Saturday that he had tested positive.- ‘False sense of comfort’ -Public health experts have expressed alarm at the outbreak linked to the September 26 celebration of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court.“They relied too much on diagnostic testing. We know that these tests have a very high false negative rate,” said Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists.“By simply relying on these diagnostics to determine who gets to come in and out of the White House, and by not requiring other protections, like social distancing and masks, they created a false sense of comfort for the White House.”Democrats have called for Barrett’s Senate confirmation hearings to be postponed after several Republican senators tested positive, but judiciary committee chair Senator Lindsey Graham said they would go ahead.Trump -- who is well behind his 77-year-old Democratic election rival Joe Biden in the polls -- has been forced to freeze or rework much of his campaign ahead of a potentially messy vote on November 3.Biden has made Trump’s frequent downplaying of the Covid-19 crisis and mixed messaging on mask-wearing a central campaign theme.The former vice president, who stood on a stage with Trump for 90 minutes during their ill-tempered first debate Tuesday, announced that he and his wife Jill tested negative Friday.Biden reminded voters during the debate that he has pushed consistently for a serious approach to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 208,000 Americans, unlike his opponent who has mocked the Democrat for his rigorous use of masks.bur-acb/bfm/mtp/tomTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-positive-donald-trump-not-yet-out-of-the-woods-says-white-house/story-1H57CAw8NWknzB1DQVqTrO.html

He said the pandemic, however, had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the pandemic.“Aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident,” Francis wrote. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.”He cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the pandemic as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements, unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies.“The fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom,” he wrote. “It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at ‘promoting an economy that favours productive diversity and business creativity’ and makes it possible for jobs to be created, and not cut.”He denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate, and called for a “culture of encounter” that promotes dialogue, solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good.As an outgrowth of that, Francis repeated his criticism of the “perverse” global economic system, which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few. Francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals, stressing instead the “social purpose” and common good that must come from sharing Earth’s resources.Francis once again rejected “trickle-down” economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy, the 2013 Evangelii Gaudium, (The Joy of the Gospel), saying it simply doesn’t achieve what it claims to.“Neo-liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of ‘spillover’ or ‘trickle’ — without using the name — as the only solution to societal problems,” he wrote. “There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged ‘spillover’ does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society.”The title of the encyclical had sparked controversy in the English-speaking world, with critics noting that a straight translation of the word “fratelli” (brothers) excludes women. The Vatican has insisted that the plural form of the word “fratelli” is gender-inclusive and that the document by its very nature is inclusive of women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-rejects-trickle-down-theory-says-market-capitalism-has-failed-in-pandemic/story-7WXnWw69QdjQfOJY6zKLMO.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump faces credibility crisis over Covid-19 health scare. Here’s why||One month from Election Day, President Donald Trump is facing a credibility crisis as yawning as his health crisis, at a moment when he needs the public’s trust the most.The president’s coronavirus infection, as well as the illnesses of several aides and allies, has imperiled the highest levels of the US government. The White House’s efforts Saturday to project calm backfired in stunning fashion, resulting in a blizzard of confusing and contradictory information about the health and well-being of the commander in chief.It’s a moment months in the making, the collision of Trump’s repeated defiance of his own administration’s guidelines for staying safe during the pandemic and his well-known disregard for facts. The result: deep uncertainty for Americans over who and what to believe about the health of the nation’s leader at a perilous moment in US history.“This is bigger than Donald Trump. It’s about the institution of the presidency,” said Robert Gibbs, who served as President Barack Obama’s first White House press secretary.For any president, credibility in a crisis is paramount — the ability to rally Americans of every political persuasion around a commonly accepted understanding of the situation. For a president on the brink of an election, particularly one held in as tumultuous a year as 2020, it could be the difference between serving one term or two.Yet Trump has squandered widespread credibility from the very start of his presidency, spending his first full day in office disputing official tallies of the crowd size at his inauguration and asking Americans to disregard photographic evidence showing that he drew fewer people to the National Mall in Washington than his predecessor.The episode set the tone for the rest of his administration, with Trump creating alternate realities around issues big and small, amplified by the help of friendly media outlets. He frequently touts records and milestones that don’t exist. He spreads baseless rumors about his political opponents, including declaring without evidence that Joe Biden, his Democratic rival in the 2020 presidential campaign, might be on drugs in their debate.Yet Trump’s credibility has come under even greater scrutiny during the pandemic, the single biggest test of his presidency. He’s repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus in public, despite telling journalist Bob Woodward privately in February that Covid-19 was more deadly than the flu. He’s floated unverified and harmful treatments, including suggesting Americans could inoculate themselves by injecting bleach.In April, just weeks after the pandemic took hold in the US, only 23% of Americans said they had high levels of trust in the information the president was providing the public about the virus, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.As Election Day draws near, Trump has increasingly flouted public health guidelines and many of the scientists advising his administration, eager to make the case to voters that the worst of the pandemic that upended nearly every aspect of American life is behind them.For weeks, Trump has been traveling across the country holding large rallies and hosting events at the White House without social distancing or requiring guests to wear masks. That includes a crowded ceremony in the Rose Garden last weekend to announce the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Several attendees, including two US senators and first lady Melania Trump, have since announced they have tested positive for coronavirus.They, and the president himself, are now among the more than 7 million Americans who have been infected. More than 205,000 Americans have died.It’s not clear how Trump became infected. He announced on Twitter at 1 am Friday that he and Mrs. Trump had tested positive for the virus; the following afternoon, he was transported via the presidential helicopter to a military hospital just outside of Washington. The only details the White House provided were that the hospitalization was precautionary and that Trump’s symptoms were mild.On Saturday, the White House tried to fill in the details with a televised briefing by Trump’s physician, who painted a sunny picture of the president’s situation, emphasizing that he was still working, walking on his own and not laboring to breath. But Dr. Sean Conley notably refused to provide some specific details, including repeatedly sidestepping questions about whether the president had at any point required oxygen.Shortly after, and off camera, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave journalists a more troubling depiction. The president’s situation had been “very concerning,” and though his health was improving, Meadows said the next 48 hours would be critical. A person familiar with the president’s treatment also confirmed that he had required supplemental oxygen Friday morning.The conflicting information sparked an outcry, even among some Trump allies who privately wondered how the president’s team could have been so unprepared for the first major disclosures about his condition. The White House tried to quell the frustrations on Saturday night, releasing a four-minute video of Trump saying his condition was improving and that he was looking forward to resuming campaign activities soon.But to those who have grown weary of Trump’s record on transparency and the truth, there was little hope that the coming days would bring a greater level of clarity.“These are the patterns of this presidency, and for Trump, the patterns of a lifetime,” said Peter Wehner, a Republican who served in President George W. Bush’s administrations and a Trump critic. “There’s no reason to believe he or his inner circle are going to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-credibility-crisis-over-covid-19-health-scare-here-s-why/story-jat4RXScPUiTrvONKrumWL.html
04-10-2020||World||Pilgrims return to Mecca as Saudi eases coronavirus restrictions||A very small, limited number of people donning the white terrycloth garment symbolic of the Muslim pilgrimage circled Islam’s holiest site in Mecca on Sunday after Saudi Arabia lifted coronavirus restrictions that had been in place for months.The kingdom had taken the rare step of suspending the smaller “umrah” pilgrimage that draws millions year-round from across the world in early March as the coronavirus morphed into a global pandemic and prompted countries to impose lockdowns and curfews to slow down transmission.But as nations begin to ease those restrictions, the Saudi government on Sunday started allowing a maximum of 6,000 pilgrims a day to enter the sprawling Grand Mosque in Mecca. Only Saudi citizens and residents will be permitted to enter the mosque during this first phase of reopening, and each person has up to three hours to complete the pilgrimage.The Grand Mosque, which is being sterilized and cleaned multiple times a day, houses the cube-shaped Kaaba that observant Muslims pray toward five times a day.Before visitors can enter the mosque to pray or perform the umrah, they have to apply and reserve a specific time and date through an online application to avoid crowding and maintain social distancing. Visitors can also select via the app their means of transportation and meeting points.State TV showed on Sunday what appeared to be fewer than 50 people circling the Kaaba at the same time and walking several meters (feet) apart. Typically, the mosque would be packed with worshippers from around the world crowded shoulder-to-shoulder at all times of the day and night.The second phase for loosening restrictions at the Grand Mosque comes into effect on Oct. 18, allowing a maximum of 15,000 pilgrims and 40,000 for prayer from among residents and citizens based on allocated times via the app.Muslim travelers from outside Saudi Arabia could be allowed to perform the umrah pilgrimage as early as Nov. 1, the Interior Ministry has said. Saudi Arabia recently began easing some restrictions on international flights for the first time since March.The kingdom held a dramatically downsized, symbolic hajj pilgrimage in July due to concerns that it could easily have become a global super-spreader event for the virus. Pilgrims were selected after applying through an online portal and all were residents or citizens of Saudi Arabia. Rather than the more than 2 million pilgrims the kingdom hosts for the annual event, as little as 1,000 took part after being tested for the virus and quarantined.Despite taking early and sweeping measures to contain the virus, Saudi Arabia has recorded nearly 336,000 cases, including 4,850 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilgrims-return-to-mecca-as-saudi-eases-coronavirus-restrictions/story-7Aim2nkAhUzVs3NN2SGWNM.html
04-10-2020||World||Researchers develop new Covid-19 test that doesn’t use scarce reagents||Scientists have developed a new method of testing for Covid-19 that doesn’t make use of key reagents but still delivers an accurate result, an advance that may lead to an inexpensive diagnosis technique in developing countries where chemical supplies are in short supply. The method, described in the journal PLOS Biology, omits the step in the widely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test where the scarce reagents are needed, but has an accuracy of 92 per cent, missing only the lowest viral loads. The researchers, including those from the University of Washington in the US, tested the new method using 215 Covid-19 samples that RT-PCR tests had shown were positive, with a range of viral loads, and 30 that were negative. They said it correctly identified 92 per cent of the positive samples and 100 per cent of the negatives. While the positive samples the new test failed to catch had very low levels of the virus, the scientists said ultra-sensitive tests that identify individuals with even the smallest viral loads may not be needed to slow the spread of the disease. “It was a very positive result,” said Jason Botten senior author of the study from the University of Vermont in the US. “You can go for the perfect test, or you can use the one that’s going to pick up the great majority of people and stop transmission,” Botten said. While standard PCR tests have three steps, the version developed by the researchers has only two, the study noted. “In step 1 of the RT-PCR test, you take the swab with the nasal sample, clip the end and place it in a vial of liquid, or medium. Any virus on the swab will transfer from the swab into the medium,” Botten said. “In step 2, you take a small sample of the virus-containing medium and use chemical reagents, the ones that are often in short supply, to extract the viral RNA. In step 3, you use other chemicals to greatly amplify any viral genetic material that might be there. If virus was present, you’ll get a positive signal,” he explained. In the new method, Botten said, a sample of the medium that held the nasal swab is taken directly to the third, amplification step, removing the need for scarce RNA extraction reagents as well as significantly reducing the time, labour and costs required to extract viral RNA from the medium in step 2. According to the researchers, the test is ideally suited to screening programs, in both developed and developing countries, since it is “inexpensive, takes much less processing time, and reliably identifies those who are likely to spread the disease.” Its low cost and efficiency could extend testing capacity to groups not currently being tested, including the asymptomatic, nursing home residents, essential workers and school children, Botten added. He said the standard RT-PCR test could be reserved for groups, like health care workers, where close to 100 per cent accuracy is essential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-develop-new-covid-19-test-that-doesn-t-use-scarce-reagents/story-9Rw5iTQ8WLSvBQ7PAgTZ4I.html

04-10-2020||World||Xi pitches for closer ties with Bangladesh, calls for joint promotion of Belt Road Initiative||Chinese President Xi Jinping said he stands ready with Bangladesh leaders to better align the two countries’ strategies and jointly promote the construction of his multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to take the strategic partnership of the two countries to new heights. Xi made the remarks in an exchange of congratulatory messages with his Bangladesh counterpart, Mohammad Abdul Hamid, on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the bilateral diplomatic relationship on Sunday. In his message, Xi hailed the steady and long-term friendship saying he is ready to work with Hamid to better align development strategies with Bangladesh, step up cooperation under the framework of the BRI and push forward the China-Bangladesh strategic, cooperative partnership to a new level, official media reported. With over USD 26 billion Chinese investments and USD 38 billion dollars funding commitments, Bangladesh is one of the largest recipients of China’s massive infrastructure project. China has also offered zero-tariff treatment to 97 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports by adding 5,161 more items to the existing list of 3,095 duty-free products. The BRI seeks to build rail, maritime and road links from Asia to Europe and Africa in a revival of ancient Silk Road trading routes. The issues related to BRI, earlier known as One Belt One Road (OBOR), has been a major bone of contention between India and China as one portion of the corridor passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Besides Pakistan, where China initiated over USD 60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has stepped up its huge infrastructure investments in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives rising concerns of its growing influence in India’s immediate neighbourhood. The BRI is President Xi’s top priority initiative, which aims firm up China’s global influence. The initiative has, however, attracted allegations, especially from the US, of debt-diplomacy after Sri Lanka handed over its Hambantota Port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years’ lease in a debt swap amounting to USD 1.2 billion. Malaysia has also deferred several projects under the BRI, citing cost revaluation. Xi, in his message to Hamid, also said the two countries had worked jointly to fight against Covid-19. Earlier, China had sent medical team to Bangladesh to share its experience of handling coronavirus, which had emerged first in Wuhan in December last year. Bangladesh also is among over a dozen countries where the final phase of clinical trials of Chinese vaccine is being conducted. In his message, Hamid said the Bangladesh-China relationship is developing rapidly and has covered cooperation in key areas, to which Dhaka attached great importance, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. He expressed his deep appreciation for China’s continuous support for Bangladesh in its socio-economic development progress, adding that he believes the close and friendly relationship between the two countries will continue to deepen in the future. Also on Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang exchanged congratulatory messages with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Li said in his message that China is willing to deepen practical cooperation with Bangladesh in various fields and promote the steady and sustainable development of the China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation to better benefit the two countries and their people. For her part, Hasina said the strategic partnership of cooperation between Bangladesh and China has been developed from the two countries’ time-tested friendship and cooperation. The strengthened Bangladesh-China cooperation has unleashed enormous potential in maintaining peace, security and stability in the region and even around the world, Hasina said according to Xinhua News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-pitches-for-closer-ties-with-bangladesh-calls-for-joint-promotion-of-belt-road-initiative/story-dzPUORtMJx0vHcQQLYwYPJ.html

What you need to know||Saudi Arabia has allowed its citizens and other pilgrims to perform the annual umrah pilgrimage from Sunday, after a seven-month break due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).In March, the Saudi government decided to suspend the umrah pilgrimage over the fear of growing coronavirus infections. In July, it only allowed 1,000 pilgrims residing in the country for the pilgrimage due to the pandemic.Saudi Arabia hosts around 2.5 million pilgrims annually across the globe for Haj. So far, Saudi Arabia has recorded around 336,000 Covid-19 cases while 321,000 coronavirus disease patients have been recovered. There have been 4,850 deaths in the country.Here is all about the umrah pilgrimage:* Umrah is a year-round pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It is a voluntary pilgrimage, unlike haj which is compulsory for every Muslim who is physically capable and can afford it.* Umrah is a shorter version of the annual haj pilgrimage which allows Muslims to seek refuge in Allah, ask for mercy and pray for their needs.* The Saudi Arabia government has decided to allow the pilgrimage in four phases considering the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.* Only 6,000 citizens and residents already within the kingdom will be allowed to take part each day, which is only 30% of the total capacity, in the first phase starting Sunday. They will be able to perform the ritual of circling the sacred Kaaba, a cubic structure inside the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray.* The second phase will start from October 18 and will allow 15,000 pilgrims from the country.* In the third phase from November 1, pilgrims from inside and outside the kingdom will be allowed to perform umrah at 100% capacity with necessary precautionary measures. Saudi Arabia will only allow pilgrims from countries which are free from Covid-19 danger by the time.* During the fourth phase, the government will allow 100% of the total capacity of the pilgrimage from inside and outside Saudi Arabia to perform umrah. The decision on this phase will be taken when the competent authority decides that the risks of the pandemic are over.* Saudi Arabia’s ministry of hajj and umrah will launch an application with the aim to regulate the entry of pilgrims and implement health standards and controls approved by the ministry of health and competent authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-resumes-umrah-in-4-phases-what-you-need-to-know/story-BfFZykUdrk3E0T9C9mShXK.html

Unlike India where extremists are in Govt, people of Pak never allowed extremists to lead or mainstream politics,” Chaudhry tweeted.Pakistani Muslim League (N) chief and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal were among the attendees of a virtual meeting of PDM during which Rehman was elevated as head of the alliance aimed to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan.The PDM had announced at its All Parties Conference in September that it plans to launch its protest campaign from Quetta, Balochistan in October. The choice of Quetta may have to do with the popularity that Fazlur Rehman’s party enjoys there. Analysts also say that the party’s street power is immense.In 2019, JUI supporters held a sit-in at Islamabad for several weeks which was called off after army intervention and assurances. The PDM also plans a similar sit-in if its demands are not met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamist-party-chief-s-elevation-as-joint-oppn-movement-s-leader-raises-eyebrows-in-pakistan/story-z2fCkZ9KI9GJyzrV8PDovI.html
04-10-2020||World||Eye on China, Canada formulates new Indo-Pacific policy||Canada is formulating a fresh Indo-Pacific policy that will not only reflect its recent rift with China but may be more in consonance with the objectives of India in the region.The indication of this potential switch came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to his newly-appointed Japanese counterpart Suga Yoshihide. A readout of the conversation used language that has become central to that applied by the Quad nations- India, Japan, Australia and the United States - as it said they wanted the two nations to “promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”That free-and-open formulation, known as FOIP, has been used as shorthand for containment of an increasingly aggressive China in the region. That symbolic phrasing comes as Canada is looking at issuing a new Indo-Pacific policy in the weeks ahead. According to a report in the Toronto Star recently, Global Affairs Canada has been working on the revised policy since November last year. The daily, National Post, stated Canada is “getting set to launch a new tougher approach to dealing with Beijing” and has been in the making since the appointment of François-Philippe Champagne as Foreign Minister in 2019.Indian officials did not comment on this matter but pointed to an increase in official communication between New Delhi and Ottawa in recent times, including discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trudeau.The Trudeau administration may also be acting to reflect public mood in Canada, which has turned largely against China. According to a poll in late June from the Angus Reid Institute (ARI), 81% of respondents “feel that they should boycott goods made in China to send a message”, while 91% considered the state of affairs between the two nations “serious”. Similarly, 93% felt that “China cannot be trusted to uphold human rights.”Significantly, a Canadian warship sailed from the South China Sea into the Taiwan Strait this week in a move that could rile Beijing as China has become more belligerent in the area.Relations between Ottawa and Beijing have nosedived since the arrest of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei in Vancouver in late 2018. Meng Wanzhou continues to face trial that could lead to her extradition to the US. In retaliation, China arrested two Canadians, including a former diplomat, actions the Canadian government described as “hostage diplomacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-china-canada-formulates-new-indo-pacific-policy/story-r84Wr4uqJcBN5QM2StDBxK.html
04-10-2020||World||Egypt reveals 59 ancient coffins found near Saqqara pyramids||Egypt’s tourism and antiquities minster said on Saturday archaeologists have unearthed dozens of ancient coffins in a vast necropolis south of Cairo.Khalid el-Anany said at least 59 sealed sarcophagi, with mummies inside most of them, were found that had been buried in three wells more than 2,600 years ago.“I consider this is the beginning of a big discovery,” el-Anany said, adding that there is an unknown number of coffins that have yet to be unearthed in the same area.He spoke at a news conference at the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara where the coffins were found. The sarcophagi have been displayed and one of them was opened before reporters to show the mummy inside. Several foreign diplomats attended the announcement ceremony.The Saqqara plateau hosts at least 11 pyramids, including the Step Pyramid, along with hundreds of tombs of ancient officials and other sites that range from the 1st Dynasty (2920 B.C.-2770 B.C.) to the Coptic period (395-642).Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said initial studies show that the decorated coffins were made for priests, top officials and elites from the Pharaonic Late Period (664-525 B.C.).He said archaeologists also found a total of 28 statuettes of Ptah-Soker the main god of the Saqqara necropolis, and a beautifully carved 35 cm tall bronze statuette of god Nefertum, inlaid with precious stones. The name of its owner, Priest Badi-Amun, is written on its base, he said.Egyptian antiquities officials had announced the discovery of the first batch coffins last month, when archaeologists found 13 of the containers in a newly discovered 11 meter-deep (36 feet) well.The Saqqara site is part of the necropolis of Egypt’s ancient capital of Memphis that includes the famed Giza Pyramids, as well as smaller pyramids at Abu Sir, Dahshur and Abu Ruwaysh. The ruins of Memphis were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1970s.El-Anany said the Saqqara coffins would join 30 ancient wooden coffins that were discovered in October in the southern city of Luxor, and will be showcased at the new Grand Egyptian Museum, which Egypt is building near the Giza Pyramids.The Saqqara discovery is the latest in a series of archeological finds that Egypt has sought to publicize in an effort to revive its key tourism sector, which was badly hit by the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising. The sector was also dealt a further blow this year by the global coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-reveals-59-ancient-coffins-found-near-saqqara-pyramids/story-D8sBMH656Xq55BUom2AQ2N.html

Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, a development that upended the Republican leader’s election campaign just weeks before the presidential polls on November 3.“Vice President Mike Pence, the First Family, our coalitions and our grassroots supporters will be out in full force to show the real enthusiasm behind the president’s re-election and to show we’re working as hard as he always does,” Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien, who also tested positive for the virus on Friday, said in the press release on Saturday. “Operation MAGA is a full marshalling of top-level surrogates, campaign coalitions and Trump supporters to rally behind the president and carry the campaign forward until he returns to the trail,” he said, announcing the launch of the initiative. Trump’s election rallies in recent weeks had been attracting thousands of his supporters who came to listen to him ignoring the cautions of health care professionals like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “Operation MAGA will fire up the entire MAGA universe to keep President Trump’s campaign at full speed until our Commander-in-Chief returns to the campaign trail,” Stepien said. Pence will make in-person campaign appearances in key states, as will First Family members Donald J Trump Jr, Eric Trump and his wife Lara. The campaign will host virtual events until the vice presidential debate on October 7, when the in-person events will commence, the Trump campaign said. Pence will begin a swing through key states following Wednesday’s vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. He will travel to Arizona, before voting early in Indiana and heading to other events. Members of the First Family will host live events in battleground states beginning after Wednesday as well. The campaign will also deploy its coalitions, including Women for Trump, Black Voices for Trump, Latinos for Trump and others for events in key states. All the previously announced campaign events involving Trump’s participation have either been moved to virtual formats or are being temporarily postponed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-launches-operation-maga-to-keep-momentum-at-full-speed/story-9B4zlsYHqr1C0zVa7yxjKO.html
04-10-2020||World||Mecca to reopen today after 7-month pause for coronavirus||Saudi Arabia will reopen the Muslim holy places for the year-round umrah pilgrimage on Sunday with extensive health precautions, seven months after coronavirus disease (Covid-19) prompted its suspension.The umrah usually attracts millions of Muslims from across the world each year.It will be revived in three stages, with the initial phase seeing just 6,000 citizens and residents already within the kingdom allowed to take part each day.“In the first stage, the umrah will be performed meticulously and within a specified period of time,” Hajj Minister Mohammad Benten told state television last week, according to news agency Agence-France-Presse.Benten said pilgrims will be divided into groups to ensure social distancing within the Grand Mosque in Mecca.Worshippers will on Sunday be able to perform the ritual of circling the sacred Kaaba -- a cubic structure inside the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray -- along socially distanced paths.On October 18, the number of pilgrims will be increased to 15,000 per day, with a maximum of 40,000 people allowed to perform prayers at the mosque.Visitors from abroad will be permitted from November 1 when the capacity will be increased to 20,000 pilgrims, with 60,000 people allowed to enter the mosque.The decision to resume the pilgrimage was in response to the aspirations of Muslims home and abroad to perform the ritual and visit the holy sites, the interior ministry had said last month.The ministry added that the umrah would be allowed to return to full capacity once the threat of the coronavirus pandemic has subsided.Until then, the health ministry will vet countries from which pilgrims are allowed to enter based on the health risks.Those wishing to perform the umrah must apply through two mobile applications-- one to register they are free from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and another from which they can obtain a permit.

04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump presses for stimulus deal, saying ‘get it done’||President Donald Trump pressed for a deal on another round of pandemic aid to jolt the U.S. economic recovery, saying the country “wants and needs” fiscal stimulus.With Trump receiving treatment at Walter Reed military hospital outside Washington after testing positive for the coronavirus, his tweet on Saturday departed from his health to focus on weeks of partisan deadlock over another stimulus bill.US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that negotiations with the White House will press ahead and Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis might change the tenor of the talks by underscoring the seriousness of the pandemic.The two sides remain far apart on how much of a boost to provide and what it should target. Democrats in the House on Thursday passed a $2.2 trillion package -- down from the $3.4 trillion plan they passed in May -- as their latest offer. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has proposed a plan of about $1.6 trillion.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday that the talks have “speeded up in the last few days,” though he didn’t make a prediction about the eventual outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-presses-for-stimulus-deal-saying-get-it-done/story-1RNRRjDj9FtEAHGf60WZzI.html
04-10-2020||World||Of presidents and health, history replete with secrecy, lies||Throughout American history, an uncomfortable truth has been evident: Presidents have lied about their health.In some cases, the issues were minor, in others quite grave. And sometimes it took decades for the public to learn the truth.Now President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with the Covid-19 disease. The White House initially said he had “mild symptoms.” By Friday evening, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre. After a rosy press conference by the president’s medical team, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Saturday that Trump had gone through a “very concerning” period Friday and that the next 48 hours would be critical in terms of his care.Pandemics have cursed the presidencies of both Trump and Woodrow Wilson. Each played down the viruses that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. Both presidents got sick — and each had to decide how much to tell the public.Also Read: Donald Trump ‘not yet out of the woods,’ doctor says, but is ‘cautiously optimistic’Like many administrations before, Wilson’s White House tried to keep his sickness secret.He was at talks in Paris on ending World War I when he fell ill in April 1919. His symptoms were so severe and surfaced so suddenly that his personal physician, Cary Grayson, thought he had been poisoned. After a fitful night caring for Wilson, Grayson wrote a letter back to Washington to inform the White House that the president was very sick.Flash forward 100 years. In a tweet at 12:54 am Friday, Trump told the world that he and first lady Melania Trump had contracted Covid-19.The White House initially shared few details about his condition. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said he was taken to Walter Reed many hours later “out of an abundance of caution.” However sick he was or wasn’t, his Covid-19 was startling since Trump had been declaring almost daily that the nation had turned the corner on the disease, which has killed 208,000 people in the US.Also Read: Next 48 hours ‘critical’ for Donald Trump in fight against Covid-19, says official Trump has said he has played down the pandemic so as not to create panic, but there were political reasons for doing so. Seeking another four years in office, Trump did not want the US economy to tank before the November 3 election.“The Wilson administration, for a very different reason, completely downplayed the pandemic,” said John Barry, an adjunct professor in public health at Tulane University whose book “The Great Influenza” chronicles the 1918-19 pandemic that sickened Wilson and killed 675,000 Americans. William Howell, professor of American politics at the University of Chicago, wonders how transparent the White House will be about Trump’s case of Covid-19.“He has all kinds of incentives to signal strength and to get back into the mix. He’s going to want to,” Howell said, but added: “This is a president who’s been less than straightforward over the course of his presidency about all manner of factual issues. And so, is he to be believed is a good cause of real concern.” History is replete with examples of how presidents have kept the American public in the dark about their ailments and medical conditions.President Grover Cleveland, fearing poor health would be a political weakness, underwent secret oral surgery late at night in a private yacht in Long Island Sound. The cancerous lesion taken from his mouth was displayed in 2000 in an exhibit by the College of Physicians, a Philadelphia-based medical society.President Lyndon B Johnson secretly underwent surgery for removal of a skin lesion on his hand in 1967.After leading the nation through a decade of war and depression, Franklin D Roosevelt was diagnosed early in 1944 as suffering from high blood pressure, hypertensive heart disease, cardiac failure and acute bronchitis.The problems also betrayed an underlying arteriosclerosis - hardening of the arteries. Roosevelt was put on a low-salt diet and ordered to cut down on smoking. But with an election coming on, Roosevelt and the White House staff issued a statement saying the problem was far less serious.“The stories that he’s in bad health are understandable enough around election time, but they are not true,” his doctor told a reporter. Historians now believe his doctors concealed all the facts from their patient and the public.Roosevelt won reelection. Only months later, on April 12, 1945, he died of a stroke.According to historian Robert Dallek, President John F Kennedy suffered more pain and illness than most people knew and took as many as eight medications a day, including painkillers, stimulants, sleeping pills and hormones to keep him alive. As president, Kennedy was known for having a bad back, and since his death, biographers have pieced together details of other illnesses, including persistent digestive problems and Addison’s disease, a life-threatening lack of adrenal function. Kennedy went to great lengths to conceal his ailments, even denying to reporters that he had Addison’s disease.President Dwight D Eisenhower had a serious heart attack in 1955, while vacationing in Colorado. He was hospitalised for six weeks. Instead of advising Eisenhower not to run for a second term, his doctor recommended that more time in office would aid his recovery.In 1841, William Henry Harrison became ill with what doctors thought was pneumonia caused by cold weather during his inauguration, where he rode horseback sans topcoat. The White House did not tell the public that Harrison was sick. Harrison died just nine days after becoming ill and only one month after taking the oath of office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/of-presidents-and-health-history-replete-with-secrecy-lies/story-LCSgILwibz8bxpRJjGQIsJ.html
04-10-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson says he won’t be ‘blown off course’ by Covid-19 pandemic||Boris Johnson pledged to “unleash Britain’s potential” next year as he tries to regain momentum and calm unrest in the Conservative Party over his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The UK prime minister ordered his cabinet to bring forward fresh ideas for a Queen’s Speech marking the beginning of the next session of Parliament, expected in the spring. The agenda will include plans to spend money on schools and hospitals, crack down on serious violence, and bring in tougher sentences for animal cruelty, Johnson’s office said in a statement.“We were elected to get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential,” a spokesman for Johnson said in the statement. “The prime minister has been clear that we will not be blown off course in our plans to build back better and that’s just what our next Queen’s Speech will do.”The government’s announcement Sunday is timed to coincide with the second day of the annual Tory conference, which is taking place online this year because of Covid-19 -- robbing ministers of face-to-face meetings with members and the chance to quell dissent. The premier has faced criticism over lockdown measures and problems in the virus testing system, while some polls show his party trailing to Labour for the first time in several months.Tensions were further inflamed last week when Johnson apologized for getting his own Covid-19 rules wrong. The government has been trying to strike a balance between trying to contain the pandemic and keeping as much of the economy running as possible.Resurgent VirusBut coronavirus cases have surged in recent weeks and Johnson’s chief scientific officer has warned the pandemic is not under control. The UK reported 12,872 new cases in the latest daily data on Saturday -- almost double the number from Friday -- though the Department of Health said due to a technical error, cases not counted in previous days were added to the total.On Saturday at the Tory conference, ministers tried to shift the focus onto the government’s plans for Britain’s economic recovery. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab promised the UK would “bounce back stronger” but an overnight report in the Sunday Times suggested several hurdles remain -- Cineworld is drawing up plans to close all its sites in the UK, a move that would put as many as 5,500 jobs at risk.International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said new trade agreements will give companies suffering from “depressed domestic demand” a “bigger slice of the international pie.”Truss also said the government must prevent “predatory” company takeover bids from abroad “that don’t necessarily have Britain’s best interests at heart,” especially at a time when firms are undervalued during the pandemic -- though she declined to give an example.Airport SwabsChief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay said the government would not return to austerity as the country recovers from the pandemic, and said he expected an announcement in the coming days on Covid-19 testing at airports -- a key demand from the travel industry to try to boost flagging demand.House of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has written to cabinet ministers asking for “bold and ambitious bills.” The government must “make the most of the opportunities which will arise” when Britain leaves the European Union fully at the end of the year, he said in the government’s statement.Johnson’s office also confirmed the next Queen’s Speech will include a bill to repeal the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which would hand the power to choose the date of the next general election back to prime ministers, rather than Parliament. Johnson blames the act for the Brexit paralysis of 2019.On Sunday, Home Secretary Priti Patel will announce an overhaul of what she’ll call the country’s “fundamentally broken” asylum system.Patel will use a speech at the Tory conference to set out a “firm and fair” immigration approach, according to her office, after it emerged last week that ministers are examining whether to process asylum seekers in offshore holding centers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-says-he-won-t-be-blown-off-course-by-covid-19-pandemic/story-zEnTiVZ8OU5PqKGzPmM6PJ.html
04-10-2020||World||J&J CEO Gorsky says Covid shows need for global health security||There are lessons to be learned from the US government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky, who has steered the health-care behemoth as it pursues a vaccine to combat the disease.President Donald Trump contracting Covid-19 “demonstrates that we’re all vulnerable and we still all need to be very vigilant and diligent in the action we’re taking to prevent this virus from spreading any further,” Gorsky said on Friday in an interview on The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations on Bloomberg Television.When asked by Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder Rubenstein if the White House and U.S. health agencies should have approached the pandemic differently, Gorsky said, “almost all of us have underestimated the dramatic impact of this outbreak.”“But there are lessons to be learned,” Gorsky said. “Going forward, we’re going to understand much better that if we don’t have global public health security, we don’t have national security, we don’t have economic security and we will not have security of society.”The U.S. government needs to shift away from “a maniacal focus on efficiency and effectiveness in certain cases to one more of resiliency and sustainability, particularly for these kinds of situations,” Gorsky added.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson joined the short list of vaccine makers that have moved an experimental coronavirus shot into late-stage human studies in the U.S. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company has since begun dosing up to 60,000 volunteers, marking the first big trial of an Covid-19 inoculation that may work after just one shot.Gorsky said the 60,000-person objective was determined in conjunction with U.S. regulators in hopes that it would serve as “robust a clinical development program as possible” that would produce “the confidence we need to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our approach.”Other front-runners such as Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and AstraZeneca Plc in conjunction with the University of Oxford, are further along in late-stage trials targeting tens of thousands of healthy participants. Pfizer has said it could determine whether its shot is safe and effective based on preliminary data before the end of October, while Moderna is aiming for the end of November. Their studies, which launched earlier in the summer, are seeking to enroll fewer patients than J&J’s.Urgent QuestionGorsky, who has been leading the 150,000-person health-care conglomerate remotely by Zoom, joked that he’s asked “almost every 15 minutes” when a vaccine will be available.“We would expect by late this year, early next year, we should be in a position to begin reviews with regulatory authorities to see if our vaccine is in fact safe, effective, and something that could be considered for an emergency use authorization,” Gorsky said, reaffirming J&J’s previously-stated timeline.An emergency use authorization would likely allow a limited supply of shots to go to specific at-risk populations, like health-care and essential workers. More broadly, Americans should expect to have access to a Covid-19 vaccine in late 2020 or early 2021, Gorsky said, noting that depend on the results of the late-stage studies from various vaccine candidates.The pursuit of a vaccine has become a political topic, with some observers concerned that Trump’s eagerness to see a vaccine authorized before the election could run counter to the science.“This is an incredibly important time for the pharmaceutical industry,” Gorsky. “It’s absolutely critical during a time when unfortunately, everything becomes politicized, that we rely on data, we rely on science, we rely on well-established regulatory guidelines to guide all of our decisions on the development and actual utilization of these vaccines.”Gorsky, a graduate of U.S. Military Academy at West Point, has been at the helm of J&J for eight years. When asked by Rubenstein if he would consider taking on a role in the public sector, such as Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Health and Human Services, the 60-year-old Gorsky said: “I would always consider how to can you continue to serve other stakeholders, how can you continue to serve others, but I think I’ve got the best job in the world most days.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/j-j-ceo-gorsky-says-covid-shows-need-for-global-health-security/story-PKuS3MclX0K8BMVwfwtVFL.html

This will now be discussed further.”Earlier on Wednesday, Merkel had criticised China over recent developments in Hong Kong and other “dreadful and often horrible” human rights issues.Merkel had made the remarks on Wednesday while addressing the Bundestag, the German Parliament.“Looking at the development challenges for China, these targets really are ambitious and they should provide an inspiration for us in Europe as well, to live up to our promises,” she had said.Union special summit is where all heads of government have gathered to discuss China as a top item of the agenda, underlining Europe’s deepening sense of unease amid the US-China rivalry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-warns-china-to-open-up-or-risk-losing-access-to-eu-market-report/story-LAbZalvZvXwGKYiwDGKJlO.html

04-10-2020||World||Trump says he was not well, ready for ‘real test’ ahead||US President Donald Trump said in a new video released on Saturday that he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he was admitted to a military hospital after contracting Covid-19, but he felt “much better” and hoped to be back soon to complete this re-election campaign.Trump acknowledged, however, that the “real test” lies ahead, over the coming days. A top Trump administration official said the next 48 hours will be “critical in terms of his care,” adding, “we’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said in a new statement that Trump continued to do well, remained fever-free, needed no supplemental oxygen, worked in the afternoon and moved about the medial suite without difficulty. “While not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic,” he added.The president was put on supplemental oxygen on Friday after his oxygen levels dropped, which in part prompted the decision to airlift him to the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, in the adjoining state of Maryland.Trump sought to portray his hospitalisation as a courageous decision. “I had no choice because I just didn’t want to stay in the White House,” Trump said in the video. “I was given that alternative. Stay in the White House, lock yourself in, don’t ever leave, do’t even go to the Oval Office. Just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don’t see people, don’t talk to people and just be done with it.“I can’t do that, I had to be out front,” he added. “We have to confront problems. As a leader, you have to confront problems, there’s never been a great leader that would have done that.”Trump spoke of his administration’s efforts to help develop therapeutics and vaccines and mentioned he was on one of the therapeutics already. He received a single-dose shot of a cocktail of antibodies before his hospitalisation and has since started off on a five-day course of remdesivir.The president sounded eager to return to the campaign trail and said he hoped to be “back soon” and looked forward to “finishing up the campaign, the way it was started and the way we’ve been doing the kind of numbers that we’ve been doing”.Trump, in fact, was trailing his Democratic rival Joe Biden by a wide margin in national polls ahead of the November 3 presidential elections. He has failed to narrow the gap despite his best efforts to portray Biden as mentally unsuitable for the job, weak on law and order, and a “Trojan Horse” for the Democratic party’s progressives.With the president in hospital for now, his campaign on Saturday launched “Operation MAGA (short for Make American Great Again, the campaign slogan)”, a plan to carrying on without him. Vice-President Mike Pence will take the lead in in-person election events, but only after October 7, when he debates Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival.“Operation MAGA will fire up the entire MAGA universe to keep President Trump’s campaign at full speed until our Commander-in-Chief returns to the campaign trail,” Bill Stepien, Trump 2020 campaign manager, said in a statement. Stepien himself has tested positive and is working remotely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-was-not-well-ready-for-real-test-ahead/story-8VM3LcWZxfGOWs8ohIoDfJ.html

Congratulations to Maulana Fazlur Rehman Sb for being elected president of PDM. We hope the forum will continue with its struggle against the hybrid regime and for the strengthening of democracy with the same clarity as during its inception at All Parties Conference (APC),” Dawar tweeted.The leaders of 11 Pakistani opposition parties, prominent among which were the PPP, PML-N, Awami National Party, and JUI, at the conclusion of the APC on September 20 announced the formation of a joint platform, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).The PDM proposes to launch a mass protest campaign comprising public gatherings, political rallies, no-confidence motions, en masse resignations from assemblies and, finally, a long march in January that will culminate in a sit-in in Islamabad until their demands are met.As opposition parties in Pakistan have formed a new united front with an aim of restoring “genuine and undiluted” democracy in the country, a European think tank said the opposition parties will need to “stick together” if they really intend to “loosen the stranglehold that the military establishment has had over governance and indeed the economy”.“In the backdrop of these positive indications, the opposition will need to stick together if it really intends to loosen the stranglehold that the military establishment has had over governance and indeed the economy, of the country ever since its inception in 1947,” the European Foundation of South Asian Studies (EFSAS), said in a commentary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fazlur-rehman-appointed-chief-for-newly-formed-pdm-alliance/story-cXtV0c0FsoOmwppY3f4cmO.html
04-10-2020||World||Covid-19 spreads on panel handling US Supreme Court nomination||Two Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising questions about the timing of Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett and whether additional senators may have been exposed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the confirmation process was going “full steam ahead.”North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Utah Sen. Mike Lee both said Friday that they had tested positive for the virus. Both had attended a ceremony for Barrett at the White House on Sept. 25 with President Donald Trump, who announced Friday that he had tested positive and was later hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.Lee, who did not wear a mask at the White House event, said he had “symptoms consistent with longtime allergies.” Tillis, who did wear a mask during the public portion of the event, said he had no symptoms. Both said they would quarantine for 10 days — ending just before Barrett’s confirmation hearings begin on Oct. 12.The positive tests come as Senate Republicans are pushing to quickly confirm Barrett in the few weeks they have before the Nov. 3 election. There is little cushion in the schedule set out by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and McConnell, who want to put a third Trump nominee on the court immediately in case they lose any of their power in the election.Democrats, many of whom have been critical of Barrett, seized on the virus announcements to call for a delay in the hearings.“We now have two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who have tested positive for COVID, and there may be more,” tweeted Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “I wish my colleagues well. It is irresponsible and dangerous to move forward with a hearing, and there is absolutely no good reason to do so.”Several other members of the Judiciary panel attended the White House ceremony, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo. Blackburn said she tested negative after the event. Crapo said he “recently” had a negative test and a spokeswoman said he would be getting another one as soon as it could be arranged. A spokeswoman for Hawley said he was being tested Saturday, and the senator tweeted later that his coronavirus test came back negative.Sasse tested negative, but said in a statement that he would work remotely from his home state and undergo further testing due to his “close interaction with multiple infected individuals,” his office said. He said he planned to to return to Washington in time for the confirmation hearing.Graham was not at the White House on Saturday but sees Trump frequently. He said Friday that he had taken a test after interacting with Lee and it was negative. A spokeswoman for another GOP member of the committee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said Saturday that he had also interacted with Lee and had also tested negative. Still, Cruz’s office said he is remaining at home until the hearings out of an abundance of caution.Confirmation hearings for Barrett, who would replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, are scheduled to last for four days. McConnell on Saturday announced that he would seek to delay floor action for the next two weeks but that the hearings would proceed. At an event in Kentucky on Friday, he said he thought remote hearings could work if some senators couldn’t attend.Graham also suggested the possibility of remote hearings, saying on Twitter that “any senator who wants to participate virtually will be allowed to do so.” In a statement Saturday, Graham said there would be “no change” in the hearings even if Senate floor votes were delayed. It is not unusual for committees to meet when there is no action on the floor.Senators cannot vote virtually, however, so Republicans would need a full slate of committee members to approve the nomination shortly after the hearings and all of their senators on the floor for a final confirmation vote, which they hope will happen the last week of October.After interacting with Sen. Lee, in consultation with the attending physician, Sen. Cruz is remaining at home out of an abundance of caution. He feels healthy, hasn’t exhibited any COVID-19 symptoms, and has tested negative. In accordance with medical advice he will return to the Senate for the Supreme Court nomination hearings.”Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., also announced Saturday that he tested positive for the virus and would not return until he was cleared by his doctor. He is not on the Judiciary panel, but his presence would likely be needed for a floor vote.Tillis is in a competitive reelection race against Democrat Cal Cunningham, and the two debated Thursday evening. On Twitter, Cunningham said he wished Tillis a quick recovery and said he would also get tested.Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and met with Lee, Tillis and other members of the Judiciary panel this week, tested negative, the White House said Friday. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered.Trump, who has consistently downplayed the virus and often discouraged the use of masks, was flown to Walter Reed on Friday evening after experiencing symptoms.The president tweeted Saturday that he was “feeling well,” though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the next 48 hours would be critical in terms of his care.___Associated Press writers Matthew Daly in Washington and Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spreads-on-panel-handling-us-supreme-court-nomination/story-aGFrtHhXdZJ9m5BU46GeeL.html
04-10-2020||World||Covid-19: France breaks single-day record with 16,972 new cases||France has broken its national single-day record for new Covid-19 cases on Saturday after the country’s Public Health Agency recorded 16,972 positive tests over the past 24 hours.According to the agency’s daily statistical update, the latest rise is a significant jump from the 12,148 new positive tests reported on Friday. France’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 606,625.Forty-nine more people have died over the past 24 hours due to complications from the infection, raising the country’s Covid-19 death toll to 32,198, the agency said.The previous record of 16,096 new cases on a single day was set on September 24.Tougher social distancing measures have been introduced in several French cities over recent weeks, including Marseille and Lyon, in an attempt to curb the country’s second wave of Covid-19.On Thursday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran warned that additional measures, such as the closure of bars, could also be imposed in Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-france-breaks-single-day-record-with-16-972-new-cases/story-ygsHxeXle0bccN4zF38k8N.html
04-10-2020||World||Next 48 hours ‘critical’ for Donald Trump in fight against Covid-19: Official||President Donald Trump went through a “very concerning” period Friday and faces a “critical” next two days in his fight against Covid-19 at a military hospital, his chief of staff said Saturday — in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission.Trump offered his own assessment Saturday evening in a video from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon.”Also Read: ‘A leader has to confront these challenges’, says Trump in new videoHours earlier, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.”The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the president’s health and the nation’s leadership on the line. With Trump expected to remain hospitalized several more days and the presidential election looming, his condition is being anxiously watched by Americans.Moreover, the president’s health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the US government but to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise.Also Read: Confusion, uncertainty as US President Donald Trump undergoes Covid-19 treatmentSaturday’s briefing by Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley and other doctors raised more questions than it answered. Conley repeatedly refused to say whether the president ever needed supplemental oxygen, despite repeated questioning, and declined to share key details including how high a fever Trump had been running before it came back down to a normal range. Conley also revealed that Trump had begun exhibiting “clinical indications” of Covid-19 on Thursday afternoon, earlier than previously known.Conley spent much of the briefing dodging reporters’ questions, as he was pressed for details.“Thursday no oxygen. None at this moment. And yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” Conley said.Also Read: Covid-19 positive Donald Trump at military hospital; new cases among allies emergeBut according to a person familiar with Trump’s condition, Trump was administered oxygen at the White House on Friday morning, well before he was transported to the military hospital by helicopter that evening. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity,Conley said that Trump’s symptoms, including a mild cough, nasal congestion and fatigue “are now resolving and improving,” and said the president had been fever-free for 24 hours. But Trump also is taking aspirin, which lowers body temperature and could mask or mitigate that symptom.“He’s in exceptionally good spirits,” said another doctor, Sean Dooley, who said Trump’s heart, kidney, and liver functions were normal and that he was not having trouble breathing or walking around.In the hospital video, Trump defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events in the midst of a pandemic.“I had no choice,” said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. “I had to be out front ... I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.”Trump also thanked his medical team and hailed the state-of-the-art treatments he was receiving, comparing them to “miracles coming down from God.” Trump’s medical care is far superior to the average American’s, with around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments.Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide and killed more than 200,000 people in the U.S.Meadows himself had insisted Friday morning that Trump had only “mild symptoms” as the White House tried to project an image of normalcy. It was unclear whether Trump already had received oxygen when Meadows spoke.“President Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms and has been working throughout the day,” press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said late in the day on Friday. She said Trump had only been sent to Walter Reed as a precaution.Trump’s administration has been less than transparent with the public throughout the pandemic, both about the president’s health and the virus’ spread inside the White House. The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the president’s symptoms, what tests he’s undertaken and the results.In a memo released late Friday, Conley did report that Trump had been treated at the hospital with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after sharing that he’d taking another experimental drug at the White House.Conley declined to say when Trump had last been tested before he was confirmed to have COVID-19 late Thursday. He initially suggested that Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis — which would mean that he was confirmed infected Wednesday. Conley later clarified that Trump was administered an accurate test for the virus on Thursday afternoon, after White House aide Hope Hicks was confirmed to be positive and Trump exhibited “clinical indications” of the virus.The White House has said Trump was expected to stay at the hospital for “a few days” and would continue to work from its presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. In addition to accessibility to tests and equipment, the decision to move to the hospital on Friday was made, at least in part, with the understanding that hurrying there later could send a worrying signal if he took a turn for the worse.On Saturday, Conley said Trump’s blood oxygen level was 96%, which is in the normal range. The two experimental drugs he has received, given through an IV, have shown some promise against COVID-19. On Friday, he was given a single dose of a drug Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is testing to supply antibodies to help his immune system fight the virus.Friday night, he began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways — the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus and remdesivir curbs the virus’ ability to multiply.“We’re maximizing all aspects of his care,” attacking the virus in multiple ways, Conley said. “I didn’t want to hold anything back if there was any possibility it would add value to his care.”He noted that in many cases, Covid-19 can become more dangerous as the body responds. “The first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10, are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness,” he said.At the same time, the White House has been working to trace a flurry of new infections of close Trump aides and allies. Attention is focused in particular on last Saturday’s White House event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. That day, Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands — overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, her family, senators and others spent time in the close quarters of the White House, photographs show.Among those who attended and have now tested positive: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. The president’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, have also tested positive, though they were not at the event.Despite its failure to protect the president and senior staff from infection, the White House has given no indication that it intends to make any major protocol changes, such as mandating that everyone wears a mask.Meadows, the chief of staff, accompanied the president to the hospital aboard Marine One, the kind of small, enclosed space where experts say the virus easily spreads. Those aboard did wear masks.While Vice President Mike Pence is currently off the campaign trail preparing for the coming week’s vice presidential debate, he and his staff are operating under a “business as usual” approach. He’s still planning to travel to Arizona on Thursday, Indiana on Friday and Florida on Saturday for events instead of isolating himself after potential exposure and to protect himself from contracting the virus anywhere else.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/next-48-hours-critical-for-donald-trump-in-fight-against-covid-19-official/story-X2d49c5NMvVnGEsRcjLEpO.html

He said he did not want to be locked up in the White House even though he was advised to stay indoors and recover. Trump said, “I had no choice, because I did not stay in the White House. I was given that alternative. ‘Stay in the White House. Lock yourself in. Don’t ever leave and don’t even go to the Oval Office. Just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don’t see people and don’t talk to people and just be done with it.’ I can’t do that.”Trump said he needed to be ‘out in front’. He said, “I have to be out front. This is America. This is the United States. This is the greatest country in the world and this is the most powerful country in the world. I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and says ‘Hey, whatever happens, happens!’ Speaking of the campaign, he said, “I will be back soon. I have to get back because we have to make America great again... I look forward to finishing up the campaign. The way it was started, the way we have been doing and the kind of numbers we have been doing. We are so proud of it.”The Trump campaign on Friday said that all campaign rallies have been put on hold as the President and the first Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday. He also said that the First Lady is doing well and handling the situation ‘very nicely’. Speaking of Melania Trump he said, “The First Lady is doing well. Melania asked me to say something... the respect she has for our country and love that she has for our country. We are both doing well.”‘She is slightly younger than me. Just a little tiny bit... Therefore, we know the disease, we know the situation. Age versus younger people and Melania is handling it, statistically, like it’s supposed to be handled.”Also Read: Covid-19 positive Donald Trump at military hospital; new cases among allies emergeThe team of doctors at the Walter Reed Medical Centre in Bethesda, Maryland are taking round the clock care of the US president and the US First Lady but several unidentified sources claimed that Trump’s health conditions were deteriorating raising concerns.

Thursday, he had a mild cough and some nasal congestion and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving.”Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien, his campaign advisor Hope Hicks, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, along with few others who were involved in the preparation leading up to the first presidential debate with Joe Biden last Wednesday, tested positive for Covid-19.Trump continued to remain hopeful that he will win the battle against Covid-19 and secure his re-election. He said that the outpouring of love from US and people across the world has made him happy. United States will vote for electing its president on November 3. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who was also the former vice-president and senator from Delaware, will go head to head with current president Donald Trump, who is seeking a re-election.

04-10-2020||World||Confusion, uncertainty as US President Donald Trump undergoes Covid-19 treatment in hospital||Donald Trump’s “vitals in the past 24 hours were very concerning”, according to sources familiar with the US President’s condition, even as Trump himself and his doctors sought to give a far more optimistic picture of his health while he underwent treatment for Covid-19 at a military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.In fact, according to multiple news media reports citing unidentified sources, the US president had been administered supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House as his oxygen levels had dropped, which had reportedly prompted the decision to rush him to the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda.The gloomier updates came shortly after Sean Conley, the US president’s physician, and doctors at the military facility told reporters that Trump was “doing very well” and was in “exceptionally good spirits”.Trump himself tweeted that he was “feeling well”.First lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive for the coronavirus, was recuperating at the White House where she remained “well with only a mild cough and headache”.An increasing number of aides and advisers who had been around the US president over the past few days have, in the meantime, continued to test positive one after another. That included Kellyanne Conway, a former adviser to Trump, Bill Stepien, head of the Trump re-election campaign, and Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate against Democratic rival Joe Biden.But conflicting updates on Trump’s health triggered both confusion and concern. “At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made,” Conley said at Walter Reed, accompanied by the team of specialists and nurses looking after the American president. “Thursday, he had a mild cough and some nasal congestion and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving.”Shaw Dooley, a lead specialist on the team, said the US president was “in exceptionally good spirits” and had said: “I feel like I could walk out of here today.”A source familiar with the US president’s condition drew a slightly less optimistic picture of the situation. “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,” the source told a White House pool of reporters in a background update, adding, “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”Trump has been put on a five-day course of remdesivir at the hospital. He has also been administered a single 8-gram dose of a cocktail of antibodies against the coronavirus, which is an experimental drug that hasn’t yet been approved for use. Apart from that, he was given zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. Trump was shifted to Walter Reed on Friday “out of an abundance of caution”, the White House had said earlier in the day.There has been some confusion over the timeline of events. Conley had seemed to be suggesting that Trump had tested positive for Covid-19 72 hours ago, which was Wednesday, the day after the first presidential debate. But then he addressed an election rally in Duluth, Minnesota that day and then attended a fundraiser at his golf resort in New Jersey on Thursday.The US president had announced on Friday morning that he and Melania had the virus. Later, Conley clarified that he had said 72 hours by mistake and the US president had tested positive on Thursday evening.Though Trump is off the campaign trail, his campaign is not, signalling the urgency of the situation with Election Day just a month away. “Do you regret repeatedly attacking President Trump in a Michigan speech on the same day he was diagnosed with Covid-19?” the Trump campaign posted as the “question of the day” for Biden on Saturday.But the campaign left out Biden’s concluding remarks: “I want to say god bless you, may god protect the first family and every family that is dealing with this virus, and may god protect our troops.” The Biden campaign has also pulled down its negative ads on Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confusion-uncertainty-as-us-president-donald-trump-undergoes-covid-19-treatment-in-hospital/story-XcBGsZTsGIw0Gm3CMu9RBI.html
04-10-2020||World||Imran Khan calls on party members to foil opposition alliance’s moves||As the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of major opposition parties, finalises its plans to launch a series of protests this month against the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the political temperature in Islamabad has started to rise with talk of lawmakers switching sides and restrictions being placed on key opposition figures.PM Khan has told his party members to devise a strategy to foil the PDM’s moves, which he claims are aimed at defaming the army and sparking chaos across the country. The main target of Khan’s ire is former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who the current PM claims is “following the agenda of India by maligning the armed forces of the country”.In an all-party conference in September, Sharif had launched a scathing attack on Khan, whom he termed a “selected PM”, and on “the people who placed Imran Khan in power” - a reference to the army high command.Sharif said the army leadership had created a “state above a state” in Pakistan and recounted numerous occasions when as PM his government had been undermined by the military.Khan has said that his government is working out a legal strategy to bring Sharif back from the UK. Notably, Pakistan has no extradition treaty with Britain. These efforts have repeatedly hit a wall. A local news channel reported that the Pakistan High Commission has made five attempts to have non-bailable warrants served on Sharif. But the British government said it doesn’t want to get involved in the tussle.Shahzad Akbar, adviser to the PM on interior and accountability, had said that he had written letters to British authorities seeking Sharif’s repatriation, adding that a formal application had also been sent for his extradition. The adviser was of the view that though there was no extradition treaty between Pakistan and the UK, people who are wanted could be handed over to each other under special arrangements.Also, Khan has launched his own attack, telling the media that Sharif and India wanted to weaken Pakistan. Criticising Sharif’s comments targeting the army, Khan claimed that this was being done to appease India. “Nawaz Sharif is toeing India’s narrative,” said PM Khan.Khan said that those who were enemies of the armed forces were enemies of Pakistan, calling on the whole nation to stay united. He said the government will defend its institutions and asked his party officials to defend the army and other state institutions on television talk shows.In a related development, the country’s broadcast media regulator PEMRA has prohibited TV news channels from broadcasting interviews and public addresses by “proclaimed offenders and absconders”. The controversial order will prevent TV channels from airing interviews and speeches by Sharif.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-calls-on-party-members-to-foil-opposition-alliance-s-moves/story-ZrMQURngFIyLQ7jTuYcKtO.html
04-10-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi kicks-off ‘Kheti Bachao’ yatra in Punjab against farm bills||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sharpened his attack on the Centre over its farm liberalisation plans on Sunday, alleging that corporate houses were setting the agenda for the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP)-ruled government.After launching ‘Kheti Bachao Yatra’, a three-day protest march involving about 3,000 tractors at the rally venue, Gandhi said the Congress party stood firmly with the agrarian community and will fight against the three controversial farm legislations, passed in Parliament’s monsoon session.“A couple of chosen corporate houses are issuing diktats to the central government on policy formation. Lands of farmers in states such as Punjab and Haryana, that have contributed significantly to the national food security for decades, are now facing the threat of acquisition by the powerful corporate houses,” the former Congress president said in Moga.Also read: Tejashwi, Tej Pratap named in FIR in murder of former RJD leader in PurniaWhile expressing solidarity with farmers against three farm laws enacted by the Centre, the Congress also tried to show the united face of the state leadership on Sunday.Sulking Amritsar East MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu, a political bete noire of the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, attended party function after several months. The former cricketer was invited to address the gathering.As all 31 farmers’ associations are protesting against the central rules from a non-political platform for the last days, the Congress leadership tried to convey a message of agrarian support in organising the event starting today. Gandhi also released ‘Kisan Mazdoor Ekta Flag’. The venue of the rally at a grain market was well attended by villagers, including women who registered their opposition to the new farm laws. Though the huge political cutouts were missing at the venue, people waited for over three hours when the first political event since lockdown on March 22 started past 1 pm today.Also read: Rahul Gandhi to hold tractor rallies, road shows in Haryana on October 6, 7At Sunday’s rally held in the shadow of Covid-19, villagers had come to the rally in large numbers of private buses from Moga and adjoining districts of Bathinda, Barnala and Ferozepur. Key Covid-19 guidelines of maintaining physical distancing and covering faces were flouted by the audience at the event organised by the ruling political dispensation. The Wayanad MP tried to connect with the rural audience while stating that the Narendra Modi government wants to dismantle the well-established agricultural marketing system with new rules.“Farmers of Punjab and others have expressed rejections of rules by holding demonstrations. If voted to power, the Congress party will trash these rules. These legislations are a direct hit on the economy of the farming sector,” he added.The BJP-ruled central government rejects the Congress’s charges that the new farm laws will benefit corporate entities, and argues that the legislation will usher in reforms in the agriculture sector and benefit farmers. The BJP also accuses Opposition parties of politicising the issue and misleading farmers.Earlier, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh urged Gandhi to bring farmers at the national level under one roof for an organised protest against the Centre.He lashed out at the Akalis for selling off the interests of the farmers as part of the Union government with Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal being party to the decision as a cabinet minister. He said the Centre might pay the MSP for a couple of crops, but eventually would scrap the system completely.“The Congress will fight back unless the black laws on farm sector are withdrawn,” said the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-kicks-off-kheti-bachao-yatra-in-punjab-against-farm-bills/story-dLsJWJoV3QHlZYa2jBkO3K.html
04-10-2020||India||Mukul Roy, other BJP leaders felicitated in Kolkata, Dilip Ghosh conspicuous by his absence||A programme held in Kolkata on Sunday afternoon to felicitate former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mukul Roy for his elevation in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hierarchy was marked by the absence of state president Dilip Ghosh and a host of other leaders. They were all in the districts, holding rallies in support of the new farm laws. A member of the BJP central executive since joining the party in 2017, Roy was made a national vice-president during a big reshuffle on September 26. BJP national general secretary and election observer for West Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya, and national secretary and co-in-charge of West Bengal Arvind Menon were also felicitated on Sunday. Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta addressed the audience among whom the overwhelming presence of leaders and workers who defected from the TMC was noticeable. They even gave large framed photographs of Roy and Vijayvargiya embracing each other to the two leaders as a gift. “I was born in West Bengal but now I am working for the central unit. If the BJP leadership wants to entrust me with any responsibility I will carry it out sincerely. Ousting the Mamata Banerjee government should be our only goal,” Roy told the audience during a short speech. This immediately stoked speculations that Roy might be made head of the election committee for the assembly polls due in around six months. Dasgupta also stressed on the need to fight the TMC as one. “It does not matter whether we want to approach from the left or from the right. We can have all kinds of opinion. The main objective is to establish a BJP government in West Bengal,” he said. Incidentally, by replacing former Bengal unit president Rahul Sinha with former TMC MP Anupam Hazra as national secretary, the BJP central leadership last week sent a strong message to its Bengal leaders as well as the ruling party in the poll-bound state. The reshuffle was announced by BJP president JP Nadda in Delhi on September 26. Sinha immediately voiced his dissent, saying, after serving the party for 40 years he had to make way for leaders from the TMC. As Sinha’s emphasis on the entry of TMC leaders came under focus, Bengal BJP leaders maintained silence to avoid a controversy. “I served the party as a soldier since its birth and this is how I was rewarded. Nothing can be more unfortunate,” Sinha said in a video message that went viral. A senior BJP leader told HT last week that there was a growing feeling among TMC workers and leaders who joined the BJP that there was no scope for them to go up the hierarchy since they do not have a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) background. The reshuffle might counter this perception and encourage more people from TMC to defect, he said. “One should not read too much into Sunday’s incident. Almost all state BJP leaders were out of town. However, it is a fact that the felicitation was held at the initiative of people who defected from the TMC,” a prominent leader of the Bengal BJP said on condition of anonymity. “After all the central leadership also wants more defections so that it becomes easier to defeat the ruling party in 2021,” he added. When contacted by HT, some prominent state BJP leaders said they did not know who had organised the programme at the auditorium of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations at Ho Chi Minh Sarani in south Kolkata. Ghosh toured East Midnapore and held four back-to-back rallies before returning to Kharagpur town on Sunday night. “I am 300 km away from Kolkata. I do not know who held the programme,” said a leader known to be close to Ghosh. Hazra, who has tested positive for Covid-19, could not attend Sunday’s programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-other-bjp-leaders-felicitated-in-kolkata-dilip-ghosh-conspicuous-by-his-absence/story-SQ4zIwbb6SkTdqGxXgLVBP.html
04-10-2020||India||Hathras family against CBI probe, demands SC inquiry||Family members of the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died in a New Delhi hospital on September 29 after she was allegedly gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras and left partially paralysed said they were against a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe ordered by the Yogi Adityanath government and instead sought a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry.“We do not require a CBI probe... we want an investigation to be held under a retired Supreme Court judge,” said the brother of the woman.A Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the state government, meanwhile, continued its probe and recorded statements by family members of the woman, who was allegedly raped and left partially paralysed by four dominant-caste members on September 14 when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder.“We are open to anyone who wants to present himself before SIT and get his or her statement (recorded),” said senior Indian Police Service officer Bhagwan Swaroop, who heads the three-member team.Scores of people held a meeting Sunday outside the house of a former BJP MLA in Hathras where they defended the accused in the alleged gangrape of a Dalit woman who later died, and demanded registration of an FIR against her family members.Heavy police force was deployed in the vicinity of the residence of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan, located around 8-9 kilometres from the victim’s village.One of the organisers of the meeting and Pehalvan’s son Manveer Singh denied that the gathering comprised members from the upper castes and said they were from “different sections of society”.“We welcome the CBI inquiry ordered by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. We have faith in the investigation,” Singh said, and claimed that the victim’s family members were “changing their stand”.“The entire scenario has been created to blame the government. The accused persons are in favour of any type of inquiry. But the victims are changing their stand every now and then. They do not want a narco test or a CBI probe. Now they want other kinds of inquiries,” he claimed.On September 22, the victim of the gang rape— who died in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she had been shifted after her condition failed to improve in an Aligarh hospital where she was initially treated— recorded had her statement, claiming she had been raped and naming the four accused. Her mother’s statement echoed the claim.On Sunday, Dalit leader and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad visited the family of the Hathras woman and demanded that a high-level security cover be provided to her relatives“I demand ‘Y security’ for the family or I’ll take them to my house, they aren’t safe here. We want an inquiry to be done under the supervision of a retired Supreme Court judge”, he said.Azad’s demand came a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi visited the victim’s family and said the state government should take responsibility for the family’s safety.“If ‘Y Plus’ category security cover can be provided to actor Kangana Ranaut, then why can it not be provided to the family of the victim,” Azad said, adding that if his demand was not met, he will organise a gherao of the state assembly. Amid criticism of the government and the police’s handling of the case, CM Adityanath on Sunday asked officials to handle cases related to women, girls, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) with sensitivity.The CM said this to police and administrative officers during a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) review meeting. “The most complicated of problems could be solved through dialogue,” he said.“Attempts must be made to sort out various problems through dialogue with the affected people. The police should act promptly and deal with sensitivity in cases related to women, girls, SCs and STs,” he said.On Saturday, Adityanath had said his government was committed to ensuring justice to each and every victim. He said that efficient and sensitive policing was needed to strengthen the foundation of good governance, curb crime and maintain law and order in the country’s most populous state.The CM had also sent senior officials including additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi and director general of police HC Awasthy to the village on Saturday to meet the woman’s family. Awasthi said any group with no more than five people was allowed to meet the victim’s family, a remark that came after journalists and politicians were previously turned away from the village.Other accusations of missteps include allegations that the woman’s body was cremated by the police in the early hours of Wednesday without the family’s consent, triggering demonstrations across the country.Chaotic scenes were witnessed on Sunday in Boolgarhi village of Hathras district when a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)delegation was about to enter the village and a Samajwadi Party (SP) team was leaving. Five SP leaders had gone inside the village. Anxious SP workers soon went out of control and jumped the barricades when RLD vice president Jayant Chaudhary and his supporters arrived at the spotWhen some unidentified people started throwing stones, the police charged the crowd with batons while Chaudhary was interacting with a reporter. RLD workers rushed to rescue Chaudhary. The RLD leader downplayed the incident, but criticised the police for the lathi-charge on his delegation. “This lathi-charge on Jayant Chaudhary reflects the jungle raj in Uttar Pradesh. He had gone to condole the death of the Hathras girl and was targeted in a planned manner,” said Kaptan Singh Chahar, a former spokesperson of RLD.“Some RLD workers, including Pradeep Chaudhary, sustained major injuries,” Chahar said.Sub-district magistrate Prem Meena denied a planned lathi-charge, and said that the police had resorted to a baton-charge to bring the situation under control after SP and RLD workers threw stones at the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-family-against-cbi-probe-demands-sc-inquiry/story-0PR8MeXeHbTHIgaVjUexyN.html

She did not have any illegal construction (built by) spending crores of rupees. She was a simple girl whose dead body was illegally burnt in the dead of the night. All this happened in Yogi’s‘Ramrajya’.”The Shiv Sena leader also compared the Hathras incident to “atrocities being committed against Hindu girls in Pakistan” in his weekly column.“We hear that such incidents happen in Pakistan where Hindu girls are kidnapped, raped and murdered. What happened in Hathras was no different. So far no one has called Hathras a Pakistan.”Raut stated that the reaction to the Hathras incident would have been different, had it taken place in Shiv Sena coalition-ruled Maharashtra.“If a Hathras-like incident had taken place in Maharashtra, demands would have been raised for dismissal of the state government and for imposition of President’s rule,” Raut said.Also read: Hathras gang-rape victim’s family against CBI probe; SIT records statementRaut said 12,257 incidents of gang-rape have been reported in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh from 2014 to 2019, “but justice is given considering caste, religion and political affiliations”.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-sanjay-raut-says-those-who-supported-kangana-ranaut-s-comment-are-now-silent/story-JHpmoWE67EsbcEtU3xjzOP.html

04-10-2020||India||Hathras gang-rape accused defended at meeting held at ex-BJP MLA’s residence||Scores of people held a meeting Sunday outside the house of a former BJP MLA in Hathras where they defended the accused in the alleged gangrape of a Dalit woman who later died, and demanded registration of an FIR against her family members.Heavy police force was deployed in the vicinity of the residence of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan, located around 8-9 kilometres from the victim’s village.One of the organisers of the meeting and Pehalvan’s son Manveer Singh denied that the gathering comprised members from the upper castes and said they were from “different sections of society”.“We welcome the CBI inquiry ordered by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. We have faith in the investigation,” Singh told PTI while claiming that the victim’s family members were “changing their stand”.“The entire scenario has been created to blame the government. The accused persons are in favour of any type of inquiry. But the victims are changing their stand every now and then. They do not want a narco test or a CBI probe. Now they want other kinds of inquiries,” he claimed.He said an FIR should be registered by police against the complainants in the case. “Our demand is that a case should be filed against those people who had filed the case in the first instance,” he said. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment.On Sunday, Singh also said various legal options were being explored to defend the accused in the case. He asserted that the arrest of some of the accused persons from their homes was proof of their innocence.“Had they been guilty, they would have run away from their homes. Why would they be present in their homes,” he said.He also alleged that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party were trying to influence the victim’s family as they wanted to the issue to “linger on”.The meeting assumes significance as it was held a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited the victim’s house and met her family members at a village in Hathras district, and the recommendation of a CBI probe by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on Wednesday. Her family alleged that they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gang-rape-accused-defended-at-meeting-held-at-ex-bjp-mla-s-residence/story-zyQgeoozIAkAiBfprWWZHM.html

He came back to Khowai district of Tripura, his hometown, during Unlock 2.0 and started the pandemic kitchen along with nearly 30 people from different professions. The organisation comprises graduate and postgraduate students, teachers, advocates, writers, media persons, movie directors, among others. It was started in October with an aim to provide cooked food, once a week, to children living in orphanages and veterans of old-age homes in and around the capital city.Also read: Donald Trump’s condition had been worse than revealed, confirms White HouseThey provide rice, dal, vegetables, chicken and a citrus fruit in the meal to children who sit by maintaining social distance.“Many people lost their source of livelihood during the Covid-19 lockdown. Food is most necessary in this period. So, we are trying to provide meals to the poor at least once a week now,” said Sourav.The organisation is also looking to open its pandemic kitchen in slums, bordering villages and other areas.The state has reported 26,552 Covid-19 patients so far, of whom 290 have died. Another two patients died by suicide. Total 21,387 patients have recovered from the disease.The state has 5.79 lakh poor families including 4.70 lakh priority group and another 1.09 lakh Antodaya Annapurna Yojana (AAY) families, according to state government record. Nearly 1,969 migrant workers are living in the state and among them, many have returned during different Unlock phases.During the first lockdown in March, the urban development department started community kitchen and provided free meals to the homeless people.The state government had also requested different non-government organisations and self-help groups to provide food to the homeless.Earlier, the state government provided Rs. 1,000 to each 8,666 identified hawkers, vendors and others who are engaged in menial jobs. The state also provided free ration to AAY and Below Poverty Line (BPL) families and subsidised ration for Above Poverty Line (APL) families amid the pandemic.The pandemic kitchen, three days back, provided food to an orphanage located at Aralia in the outskirts of the capital city.“The Mohamarir Heshel came to our orphanage and provided food to the children.

04-10-2020||India||Centre calls meeting on Gorkhaland at short notice; election move, says TMC||The Centre has convened a meeting in Delhi on October 7 to discuss “issues related to Gorkhaland,” a Union home ministry letter issued on Saturday to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government, the autonomous Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) said. The meeting has been convened by G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state for home affairs at the ministry’s North Block office. The state home secretary and district magistrate of Darjeeling have been asked to attend it. The letter was marked “Most Immediate”. The development has irked the TMC government and the Binoy Tamang faction of the GJM, whose leaders have been put in charge of the GTA by the state. Bimal Gurung, who founded the GJM and clamped a 100-day shutdown in the Darjeeling hills in 2017 in demand for a separate state, is on the run ever since he was charged by the state under anti-terror laws. In November 2017, Gurung’s erstwhile lieutenant Binoy Tamang suspended him and his aides in their absence. “Every time we approach an election the BJP government raises the Gorkhaland issue to create disturbance in the hills. This is yet another move,” said Gautam Deb, tourism minister and TMC lawmaker from north Bengal. “The Centre is making a fool of the Gorkhas. It has called a meeting because the assembly polls will be held next year. The same thing was done before elections in the past. The struggle for Gorkhaland went on for years. No government took any step. This is just a political move,” Anit Thapa, a leader of the GJM’s Binoy Tamang faction and chairman of the board of administrators of the GTA, told the local media. Significantly, the home ministry letter was marked to the “President, GJM” and the address mentioned is that of Bimal Gurung’s office at Singamari in North Point, Darjeeling. Reacting to this, Thapa said, “According to a court order both Gurung and Binoy Tamang are presidents of the GJM. How can it be said that Gurung was invited?” The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 by forging an alliance with the GJM. In 2019, the BJP had an alliance with the GJM (Gurung faction), Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and other small political parties in the hills. Since 2009, the BJP has been promising to find a permanent political solution to the long-pending demands of people of Darjeeling, Siliguri, Terai and Dooars region. The promises were made in the BJP’s election manifestos in 2014 and 2019 as well. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “The Centre is aware of the problems and aspirations of the hill people. All these issues will be addressed.” Ajoy Edwards, president of the GNLF Darjeeling branch committee, said, “We welcome the Centre’s move. The GNLF is also an alliance partner of the BJP but we have not been invited. Those who attend the meeting must raise the issue of separate statehood. They cannot hoodwink the hill people anymore.” In November 2017, the decision to dethrone the GJM founder was taken at a meeting of the party’s central committee chaired by Tamang. The meeting was however, attended by only 37 of the 93 members of the committee. Gurung was removed from the post of president and Tamang took over. The fugitive general secretary Roshan Giri, was also stripped of his position and Tamang’s close associate, Anit Thapa, took over. Both Tamang and Thapa now enjoy the support of the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-calls-meeting-on-gorkhaland-at-short-notice-election-move-says-tmc/story-4zctoNIrWOPrwPntUG5FYK.html

There was elaborate security arrangement at the spot where the road bifurcates for the village.Permission was being granted for political delegations to enter the village to meet the gang-rape and murder victim’s family. However, when an RLD delegation was about to enter the village and a Samajwadi Party (SP) team was leaving on Sunday, chaotic scenes were witnessed when the police resorted to lathi-charge.A large number of SP supporters had gathered at the barricading outside the village, waiting for their party delegation. Five SP leaders had gone inside the village. The anxious SP workers soon went out of control and jumped the barricade, and amid the chaos, RLD vice president Jayant Chaudhary and his supporters arrived at the spot.Also read: Bhim Army chief wants ‘Y’ security cover for Hathras gang-rape victim’s familySoon there was stone-pelting from some unidentified people gathered there and police resorted to lathi-charge while Chaudhary was interacting with a reporter.

The state government has also allowed Ramleela, burning of effigies of demon king Ravana, installation of bigger idols of Durga and huge pandals for visitors for Durga Puja and Dussehra while maintaining social distancing, a top official said.“In a meeting held in Bhopal on Saturday chaired by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the decision was taken to permit the stage of Ram Leela and burning of Ravana’s effigy on Dussehra, but it will be mandatory for organisers as well as visitors to follow the protocols of Covid-19 including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing in all the events,” MP public relation department commissioner Sudam Khade said,“The CM said that there will be no restriction on size of Durga idols during Durga Utsav and the pandals could be set up to the size of 1350 sq feet. However, the tableaux, Garba and procession will not be allowed,” he said. The CM also instructed that officials should prepare “advance planning” because Covid 19 infection may spread further during the upcoming festivals and in winter season, said the officer. Earlier, on September 4, the state government had issued an order banning large pandals and the installation of huge idols. In the order, the government had not cleared its stand on the staging of Ramleela and burning of effigies of Ravana. According to an officer, the government scrapped the order after a protest by the different saffron organisations supported by BJP MP from Bhopal Pragya Thakur and Congress MLA PC Sharma. However, civil society members expressed their concern as the state has about 19,807 active Covid-19 cases 19 and numbers are increasing by the day. They say the decision was taken in view of bypolls, which is scheduled to be held on November 3 on 28 assembly seats. Civil society member and political analyst Lajja Shankar Hardeniya said, “I have written a letter to the chief minister requesting a total ban on public celebration as being a leader he should lead the crowd not led by the crowd.” “By allowing this, BJP tried to satisfy its vote bank for the upcoming bye-election. The state government is encouraging mass suicide. When authorities are failing to contain the spread in normal situations, how could we expect that they would keep a vigil on crowds in the Durga Utsav pandals and Dusshera ground?” he added. An environmentalist and civil society member from Gwalior, Sudhir Sapra said, “In Gwalior, Chambal and Malwa region, the number of cases had increased due to political rallies. Now for the political gain and to make their vote bank happy, the state government is ready to put the life of people at stake. We are quite sure that the authorities wouldn’t take action against participants and organisers because of upcoming assembly elections.” The opposition Congress welcomed the decision “It is a matter of faith. It will end the financial constraints of idol makers, tent houses, flower decorators, crackers sellers and others who were facing tough times due to Covid 19,” said PC Sharma, Congress MLA and former public relation minister. Earlier, on Saturday, the Madhya Pradesh high court had directed the district magistrates in nine districts to register offences not only against political, government, state or social functionaries but also members of congregations under provisions of Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC) if they are found violating restrictions imposed under Covid-19 protocol while organizing social and political congregations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-takes-u-turn-allows-large-durga-idols-big-pandals-and-ramleela-amid-covid-pandemic/story-yy1nLlibzIvf8yJ6GiQ2dI.html

Dr Sona Jose (30) was stabbed by the accused in her clinic and she was undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Thrissur.According to the police, the accused, who is also her business partner and friend M Mahesh, has been absconding since the incident. Three people had been running a dental clinic for the last two years and soon they developed serious differences. Later, Dr Sona and Dr Parvathi, her friend, filed a police complaint on Tuesday against Mahesh.The police said Dr Sona Jose was stabbed while the three partners were having a conciliatory discussion in the clinic. Her relatives also filed a complaint against Mahesh saying he harassed her quite often. The police said Sona was separated from her husband two years ago and she stayed for some time with Mahesh. But after financial differences cropped up between them, she had shifted from his flat.“We have launched a hunt for the accused. Preliminary reports suggest financial dealings were behind the murder,” said a senior police officer. Her relatives said despite filing a complaint, the police had failed to take any action. However, the officer said they had made a preliminary inquiry and was planning to summon the accused to the police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-who-was-stabbed-2-days-ago-by-business-partner-succumbs-to-injuries-in-kerala/story-aGr8mgfhN1BsJDHYyuKWQP.html

That’s the reason my body of work is so diverse and creditable. When I was doing daily soaps, our shows were high on TRP charts and gave me huge recognition. Then I switched to reality shows and won both — ‘Comedy Circus’ and Bigg Boss-5. So, I believe in making right choices on the right time.” Talking about keeping her priorities straight, ‘Kumkum-Ek Pyara Sa Bandhan’ and ‘Rishtey’ actor said, “Other than being an actor, I am also a mother of a child and I have to balance my life to its best. I want my daughter to be aware of the fact, she has a working mother who has all the time in the world for her. That’s one of the biggest reasons I am very selective while taking up new projects.” Juhi is happy that finally things are getting back on track and many people in the industry are back to work. “Things were on hold and it was causing a lot of panic amongst all. Many were living on a hand to mouth condition during the crisis. It feels happy that work has restarted and we are restructuring the industry. With new shows coming up along with theatres being reopened and then OTT platforms bringing new content, so presently we all are engaged in generating work,” she said. The versatile actor will be seen next in the TV show ‘Hamari Wali Good News.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-for-my-daughter/story-jcNIHp5Nq9A6ici5YhqGPN.html

Today, the Modi government is bent on snatching the bread from the mouth and feet of the Annadata of the country. But you are not alone. I promise to always support you in the fight for your rights,” Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter. #KhetiBachaoYatra के पहले दिन पंजाब के किसान बहन-भाइयों से मिलकर एक नयी ऊर्जा का एहसास हुआ।आज मोदी सरकार देश के अन्नदाता के मुँह से रोटी और पैरों से ज़मीन छीनने पर तुली है।लेकिन आप अकेले नहीं हैं। मैं आपके हक़ की लड़ाई में हमेशा आपका साथ देने का वादा करता हूँ।The Congress leader earlier today took out a tractor rally and addressed a public meeting in Punjab’s Moga district and heavily criticised the government-led policies and laws for the farmers. Three farm bills passed by the government have triggered protests by farmers across the country. These include the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. Censuring the three recently passed farm legislations during his address, Gandhi said, “The prime minister says the laws are being framed for farmers. If the laws are being made for farmers, then why didn’t you debate in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha?”He also disputed claims made by several leaders in the government, including the prime minister, who have held that the farmers are happy with these laws and welcome the move by ruling dispensation. “And if farmers are happy with these laws, then why are they agitating across the country? Why is every farmer of Punjab agitating?” Gandhi asked. Gandhi also told the farmers that these laws will be revoked if Congress is voted to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-bent-on-snatching-land-bread-from-farmers-rahul-gandhi/story-8DfN1tTjmxpVjYtNUipl4L.html

We want an inquiry to be done under the supervision of a retired Supreme Court judge”, he said.Azad’s demand came a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi visited the victim’s family and said that the state government should take responsibility for the family’s safety.“If ‘Y Plus’ category security cover can be provided to actor Kangana Ranaut, than why can it not be provided to the family of the victim?,” he said, adding that if his demands are not met, he will ‘gherao’ the Vidhan Sabha.The 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and murdered by ‘upper’ caste men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras on September 14.

Sikkim-based international traders said the Covid-19 pandemic and simmering tension between the two counties at several points along the international border, including Naku La in North Sikkim, may make it impossible to resume trade this year even if international flights and movement of people between the two nations are allowed. The trans-border trade takes place on four days a week from May 1 to November 30 every year. Only Sikkim-based traders are allowed to take part. They have to procure trade licence every year before May 1. No change was made in the licensing policy this year. Some traders got them before the pandemic started in March and the borders were sealed. Also Read: Atal Tunnel done, now PM Modi pushes Border Roads chief for all-weather axis to LadakhIn 2018, goods worth around Rs 40 crore were exported while the import from China was worth around Rs 3.5 crore, traders said. Located at 14,150 feet, Nathu La in East Sikkim is around 55 km away from Gangtok, the state capital. The pass was reopened on July 6, 2006. It was closed after the 1962 India-China War. In Sikkim, many of those involved in international trade feel that the mutual trust among people on the two sides of the border is lost following the series of recent incidents of border standoff between forces of the neighbours.“It will be hard to revive that trust in the present scenario,” said Anil Kumar Gupta, an exporter. Naku La in North Sikkim is one of the international border points that witnessed a face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in May this year. Kailash Agarwal, general secretary, Sikkim Chamber of Commerce, said, “Closure of the border trade will not adversely affect India as traders in Sikkim do not import essential commodities. It is China which will be affected as they import food items.” Rice, biscuits, confectionaries, canned food, items made of copper etc. are exported to China while blankets, garments, jackets and hosiery goods are imported by India, said Gupta“The volume of trade has increased consistently over the years. In 2006, the annual volume was to the tune of only Rs 7 lakh. Today, the number of people having trade passes has crossed 600,” said Gupta, who exports food items to China. Pema Wangdi Bhutia, president of Nathu La Border Trade Association, said, “This year, Indian businessmen initially decided not to go for trade through Nathu La because the pandemic started in China. It is not feasible to start trading for such a short time even if bilateral relations become normal.” BS Panth, Sikkim’s tourism, trade and commerce minister, said, “Trade through Nathu La is not possible this year. The future course of action depends on what decision the Indian government takes.” Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Chinese counterpart signed an agreement to reopen the Nathu La trade route during the former’s China tour in June 2003.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uncertainty-looms-large-over-india-china-trade-through-nathu-la-in-sikkim/story-U5q0bvtgosvstrUMiixfXK.html

04-10-2020||India||In Goa, Prakash Javadekar dodges queries on Mollem, Mhadei projects||Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday refused to entertain queries concerning three projects in Goa that he as chairman of the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change’s standing committee had approved back in April and instead said that he would ‘study the matter’ if those affected by it submit a memorandum to him. Javadekar was in Goa as part of the BJP’s strategy to send out ministers across the country to speak of the benefits of the recently passed contentious farm bills.During his press conference in the state capital reporters asked questions on the diversion of forest land for the expansion of a railway, highway and a new power line which he had cleared in a meeting held via video conference during the lockdown in April this year. But he feigned ignorance on the topics as well as his ministry’s advice to the Karnataka government that it would not need an environment clearance for the Mhadei river diversion project that Karnataka is constructing to Goa’s detriment. “If I receive the memorandum, I will definitely study it,” Javadekar said when asked to respond to concerns raised by locals over the diversion of forest land for the projects.The standing committee of the ministry granted its approval to the diversion of forest land from notified wildlife sanctuaries in Mollem along Goa’s eastern frontier with Karnataka for three projects -- the doubling of an existing railway line between Hubli in Karnataka and Vasco da Gama in Goa, the expansion of the national highway 4A between Belgaum in North Karnataka and Goa and a power line. The railway line, by far the biggest of the three will come at a cost of diversion of 113.857 ha. of forest land from the protected area and felling of 18,541 trees. The second project -- the four laning of the existing two lane highway that was constructed by the Portuguese colonial government between Panaji in Goa and Belgavi in Karnataka will cost 31.015 ha of forest land and 12,097 trees proposed to be done partly by widening the existing highway, but largely by creating completely new roads on viaduct structures parallel to the existing highway, wherever it cannot be widened due to the difficult nature of the terrain. Thirdly, a 400KV power line -- 3.5 km of which passes through protected forest to augment power supply between Goa and Karnataka to provide additional feed to Goa is also proposed.These clearances have now been challenged before the High Court as well as the Central Empowered Committee constituted by the Supreme Court on grounds that they have been cleared in haste and threaten the rich biodiversity of the region.Javadekar was also questioned over his ministry’s advice to the Karnataka government ahead of the by-polls in Karnataka last year that their projects would not need an environmental clearance. “The CM will respond to you on this. The matter is in court and nothing at all is happening,” Javadekar said before walking away. The MoEF, in a letter to the Karnataka government noted that the scheme “doesn’t envisage creating new command area or providing water to suffering existing command areas for irrigation. Also the project doesn’t involve hydroelectric power generation [and] is purely a drinking water supply scheme and [hence] does not attract the provisions of the EIA notification 2006 and its subsequent amendments.The Congress was quick to accuse the BJP minister of betraying one state in favour of another. “Avoiding questions betrayer of Mother Mhadei, makes it clear that @BJP4India in connivance with @BJP4Goa and @goacm sold our Lifeline to Karnataka for Political Gains. The defective @DrPramodPSawant once again stands exposed,” State Congress president Girish Chodankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-goa-prakash-javadekar-dodges-queries-on-mollem-mhadei-projects/story-wbkgDeflGQ5J21FuY1kjLO.html

In her message to the people through video, she said that after easing of lockdown and the Covid-19 restrictions, people should adopt mask-wearing as it could be a social medicine to stem the spread of the infection. She said social gatherings were also becoming a major reason for spreading infections. Hence people should be on guard, she said. The Union Territory administration was also doing maximum tests to detect the infection early, she said while asking the citizens to also report early if there were symptoms of the virus. With bars opened, the Excise Department and the police attached to the department should make surprise checks and video-record observance of Covid-19 protocol in the bars and eateries and warned of legal action if there were violations, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-mask-wearing-a-social-medicine-against-covid-19-kiran-bedi/story-LgiAmbbAGbot0PqY2She4I.html
04-10-2020||India||Former IPS officer accused in Assam Police job scam could be hiding in Nepal||The Assam Police has said that a retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer who is one of the prime accused in the police job recruitment scam in Assam, is believed to be hiding in neighbouring Nepal, will be caught in a few days. PK Dutta, who retired as a deputy inspector general (DIG), has been absconding since September 20, when the Assam government cancelled a written exam to recruit 597 sub-inspectors to the police force after the question paper was leaked and was circulated on social media. Dutta and his son Ishan are suspected to have fled to Nepal by road after the scam came to light. The former police officer’s daughter is married to a Nepali citizen based in Kathmandu. “We can assure you Dutta will be nabbed within few days. Our investigation is on and he will be arrested whether he is in Nepal or anywhere else,” GP Singh, additional director general of police (law and order), told journalists on Saturday. Dutta along with ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Diban Deka are suspected to have fleeced many candidates for posts of sub inspectors by assuring them jobs in lieu of cash. Deka is alleged to have procured the question paper ahead of the written test. Police investigation has revealed that a day ahead of the test on September 20, many candidates had taken a mock exam in a Guwahati hotel. Nearly 70 of these candidates were staying at one of the five hotels Dutta owns in Guwahati. Police had issued a look out notice for both Dutta and Deka and alerted income tax department, enforcement directorate and department of revenue intelligence after unearthing many properties belonging to the police officer. On September 30, Deka, who had unsuccessfully contested as a BJP candidate from Barkhetri assembly seat in 2011, was arrested by the police. The 43-year-old was expelled from the party after his arrest. According to reports, an associate helped Dutta and his son reach Siliguri in West Bengal on September 23 where they spent a night in a hotel. It is speculated Dutta’s son-in-law helped the duo enter Nepal the next day. An Assam Police team is reported to be in Nepal at present and trying to bring back Dutta. Senior police officials in Assam, however, remained tightlipped about Dutta’s whereabouts as it could impact investigation and his arrest. Meanwhile, Deka, who was remanded to five days police custody after his arrest, has been kept at a high security lock up of the special branch in Guwahati following apprehension of threat to his life. Prior to his arrest, the BJP leader in a Facebook post had admitted his association with the agency conducting the written exam for sub inspectors and added that he was absconding as there were threats to his life. Till Saturday, crime branch and criminal investigation departments of Assam Police who are investigating the scam had arrested 32 people including those who lured candidates with promise of jobs as well as job applicants who were in touch with Dutta and Deka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-ips-officer-accused-in-assam-police-job-scam-could-be-hiding-in-nepal/story-e01ojqxnPtTMD3Hkgi2WbI.html

Priority population refers to those who are at a higher risk of contracting the virus than others. The government is working round the clock to chart out a mechanism of step-by-step vaccine distribution, once they are ready, the minister said, addressing his weekly programme Sunday Samvaad.“Our government is working round the clock to ensure there is a fair and equitable distribution of the vaccines once they are ready. Just like everywhere else in the world, our government’s utmost priority is to ensure vaccine for each and every person in the country. There is a high-level expert committee looking into all aspects of vaccines,” the minister said.“The ministry is preparing a format in which the state will provide list of priority population to receive vaccines, especially frontline health care workers. We have set a realistic deadline of October end to complete this humongous exercise. States are also being closely guided to submit details of cold-chain facilities and other infrastructure. Our rough estimate and target would be to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses for 20 crore people by July 2021. All this is under various stages of finalisation,” Harsh Vardhan said. The concept of priority population exists across the world. While the older people are at a greater risk of Covid-19, those who are engaged in handling Covid-19 patients also fall under this priority population. China and Russia have started giving vaccine shots to its people. Reports said China is vaccinating government staff, teachers, supermarket employees, border workers apart from doctors and other health care professionals.Russian journalists working for two state-owned media outlets will be offered Sputnik V, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-centre-asks-states-to-submit-lists-of-priority-population-by-october-end/story-tbSqouI5X5I0u7ljShI0eM.html

The statements made are uncalled for. However, I do not believe that they merit action for criminal contempt of the SC of India,” Venugopal stated in his letter.The SSF Act, 2020 empowers the UP government to establish a special security force for the better protection of persons, their residential premises and vital and strategic installations belonging to the state.Also Read: UP Assembly bypolls: Congress names candidates for Suar and Bangarmau seatsThe law had come under spotlight for its provisions, which vests the special security force with sweeping powers.Section 10 of the Act empowers the special security force to arrest any person without an arrest warrant if the person is suspected of having links to any cognisable offence concerning the notified establishments or if the authorities have reasons to believe that he is taking steps to commit such an offence.Section 11 of the Act gives power to the special security force to arrest the person and seize his belongings without a warrant.“Does the Indian Constitution permit such a law? Will the country’s judiciary consider such a law unconstitutional? Or will it decide in favour of the government under pressure? Let us wait and watch,” Singh had tweeted.The tweet has the potential to shake the faith of the common public in the judicial process of the country, Sudan had said in his plea seeking AG’s consent to initiate a criminal contempt of the SC against Singh.As per Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the SC, the consent of AG or the Solicitor General (SG) is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt plea filed by an individual.Earlier, Venugopal had declined to grant consent for an initiation of criminal contempt of the SC against journalist Rajdeep Sardesai and actor Swara Bhaskar.The contempt action was sought against Sardesai for his tweets criticising the SC’s handling of the contempt of court case against lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan.Similar action was sought against Bhasker for her tweets criticising the SC and its judgement in the Ayodhya case on November 9, 2019.Venugopal’s stance before the SC in the contempt of court case against advocate Bhushan was noteworthy, as the Centre’s top law officer had urged the apex court not to impose any punishment on the lawyer.Venugopal had appeared in that case in his personal capacity at the apex court’s request on August 20.He had requested the SC to let Bhushan off with a reprimand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-kk-venugopal-declines-permission-to-prosecute-digvijay-singh-for-contempt-of-court/story-vIYQFDQgBFqKbQtV2HbSmJ.html

At one point, Gen Harpal Singh told PM that road construction in India is a classic example of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” as not even a single foreigner has helped BRO in construction since the March 2020 lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.While the PM wanted to know in details about the Seri nullah ingress that held up the Atal Tunnel project, he heard the full brief on the Darcha-Padam-Nimu axis. Already 100km of this road has been metalled with another 200km to be completed in the next three years along with a 4.5km tunnel under the over 16,000 feet high Shinku Pass. BRO has decided to validate the new axis this winter by keeping it snow-free for the army’s logistics movement. PM Modi inspected the entire 9.2km of Atal tunnel through open jeep twice and got down in between to understand each and every point.It is understood that Singh told the Prime Minister that the Sela Tunnel en-route to strategic Tawang will be completed in the next three years. The tunnel foundation was laid by PM Modi on February 10, 2019. The Rs 687 crore project involves a fresh cut of 12km road as well as a three-kilometre tunnel under the Se La, which saw action with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in 1962 war.While the Prime Minister was briefed about Darcha-Nimu road and Se La tunnel, BRO is making plans to cut across through glaciated Saser La in Siachen sector to link up with Murgo-Daulet Beg Oldi axis so that neither China nor Pakistan can threaten supplies to the last post at the Karakoram Pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atal-tunnel-done-now-pm-modi-pushes-border-roads-chief-for-all-weather-axis-to-ladakh/story-driyZFgTq1qi6HwFz5UCdL.html

Launching the party’s three-day Kheti Bachao Yatra protesting the laws which now have got the President’s assent, the Congress leader said, “If farmers are happy with these laws then why are they protesting across the nation? Why is every farmer in Punjab protesting?” “What was the need to implement these laws amid Covid-19? What was the haste? If you had to implement, you should have discussed in Lok Sabha-Rajya Sabha. PM says laws are being framed for farmers. If it’s the case, why didn’t you discuss openly in the House?” Rahul Gandhi said. Assuring the farmers that the laws will be scrapped the day the Congress comes to power in Centre, Rahul said, “I give you guarantee that the day Congress party come to the power, we will scrap these three black laws and throw them in waste paper basket.”Three farm laws — The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — have been passed by Parliament amid protests from the opposition parties. Farmers have taken to the streets across the nation protesting the laws.Rahul Gandhi was not present in Parliament during the farm law debates, which saw ruckus in the House.Apart from extending support to farmers’ protests, the party has already explored ways of stalling the implementation of the laws in state level. Congress president Sonia Gandhi urged Congress-ruled stated to pass legislations to negate the laws. Following this, the Maharashtra government has withdrawn its August order to implement new farm laws in the state. Talking about the Hathras gang-rape incident, the Congress leader said, “I was in UP where a daughter was killed. No action taken against those who killed her. Family whose daughter was killed is locked up in their house. The district magistrate and the chief minister threatened them. Such is the situation in India.

However, Kashinath’s business plans could not take off due to some reasons. He spent the loan amount on his family’s daily expenses,” said Jali.One of Kashinath’s two sons, who lives separately in the village, alleged that a few days ago an agent of a microfinance company demanded repayment of the loan. When Kashinath expressed his inability to repay the loan, the agent scolded him and mockingly asked him to die if he could not repay his loan.“My father had taken loans from a few groups. They were harassing him as he was unable to clear the debts,” said Balram Roul, Kashinath’s son.The other son lives in a different place. Police said they have lodged a case of unnatural death and awaiting the post-mortem report for further investigation.In June this year, Union minister of state for MSME, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Pratap Sarangi had urged chief minister Naveen Patnaik to put in place firm guidelines to rein in the microfinance companies in Odisha who harass borrowers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Sarangi had alleged that microfinance companies in Odisha had unleashed a great deal of hardship on women borrowers, leading to social unrest, intimidation, violence and even suicides in some places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-couple-dies-by-suicide-after-alleged-harassment-over-repayment-of-loans/story-FPn6OCCLZhdDSniqUbhsNJ.html

While as many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on issues, had till mid-September opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, opposition-led states like West Bengal, Punjab and Kerala have not yet accepted the borrowing option given by the Centre.  Sources said in the 42nd meeting of the Council on October 5, opposition-ruled states would object to the Centre’s borrowing options and demand alternative mechanism for funding GST compensation deficit.   They feel that the constitutional liability of compensating states lies with the union government. In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall. Of this, as per Centre’s calculation, about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is the impact of Covid-19 on states’ revenues. The Centre in August gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing. The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding the shortfall.  Chief Ministers of six non-BJP ruled states — West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu -- have written to the Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet shortfall.  While these states want the Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, the Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own. Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.  Attorney General of India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue.  He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation. The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenues from the imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19. The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation. However, the amount of cess collected during 2019-20 was Rs 95,444 crore. The compensation payout amount was Rs 69,275 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 41,146 crore in 2017-18.   During April-July of the current fiscal, the total compensation due to states stand at over Rs 1.51 lakh crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/stormy-gst-council-meet-likely-on-monday-non-bjp-states-to-oppose-centre-s-borrowing-option/story-ETD0r4vJtlhly2D7wsr1GL.html

The workers also protested the Union environment and forests ministry’s clearances for diversion of forest land along the Western Ghats in Goa for infrastructure projects that are being staunchly opposed in the state.Congress workers who gathered outside the hotel in which Javadekar was staying were rounded up and detained by the police in late night drama after they had gathered in the lobby seeking an audience with the minister. “The environment minister of this country who swore to protect our environment has no authority to come to Goa and stay in a hotel right on the banks of the Mandovi. They have no right to come and breathe in our environment. They have violated our mother which is the River Mhadei (the River Mandovi is called Mhadei closer to its origin in Karnataka). They have sold it to Karnataka for the sake of power and votes. There are more MPs from Karnataka than Goa, so Goa’s interests have been compromised,” Congress leader Amarnath Panjikar said. State Congress president Girish Chodankar termed the arrest of the youth Congress workers as ‘jungle raj in Goa’. Javadekar during the first day of his visit held an official interaction with farmers in two different villages in North Goa, a move that was termed as tokenism. “If Javadekar is really concerned about farmers he should go and meet the villagers of Melaulim who are protesting against their village lands being taken for the setting up of an IIT in Goa and meet the villagers of Mollem who are fearing for their livelihoods,” Panjikar said. Javadekar during his interactions with farmers in the two villages said that the protests against the recently amended farm bills were solely political. “Barring Punjab, there seem to be no agitations elsewhere. In Punjab too, the agitation is due to political reasons. Purchasing of rice has begun in Punjab. Farmers have started selling rice and protesting as well, because of the politics involved. The Congress which is in power, Akali Dal, AAP, all three are opposing for various reasons. The agitation is political,” Javadekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prakash-javadekar-gets-hostile-reception-in-goa-over-mhadei-environmental-clearance/story-FHH4ksv3E33eytjBB8CbbN.html

04-10-2020||India||Ahead of Jaishankar trip, India is game to formalise Quad dialogue that ruffles China||India is not averse to institutionalising the interaction between four major democracies committed to securing Indo-Pacific principles and the shared vision on maritime security, cyber, critical technologies, infrastructure, counter-terrorism and regional cooperation, people familiar with the development said ahead of external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s Tokyo visit on Monday for the crucial Quad security dialogue.“India has no objections to formalising the Quad dialogue with the US, Japan and Australia as the interaction has already been taking place since 2017 with a meeting of foreign ministers taking place on the sidelines of the UNGA in 2019. If the other three members want to institutionalise the dialogue, India is ready to participate,” said a senior official familiar with the government’s thinking on the matter.While China has tried to drive a wedge between the four countries by calling it an exclusive group and even reaching out to Japan for bilateral economic revival, the vision of Quad was best summed up by US Assistant Secretary of East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell last Friday. “QUAD seeks to establish, promote and secure Indo-Pacific principles, especially as People’s Republic of China tactics, aggression, and coercion increase in the region,” he said.Also Read: China on their radar, India, Japan, US, Australia to hold Quad meet on Oct 6Much as China may attempt to put diplomatic pressure on the group, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on the eve of his visit to Tokyo, tweeted that Chinese Communist Party’s reckless economic policies and its ruthless suppression of environmental activists have resulted in China’s environmental disasters. The world cannot afford the CCP model of economic development. In a series of tweets on October 3, Pompeo said that China irresponsibly exploits natural resources around the globe, threatening the world’s economy.Japan’s new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga also made his preference clear as spoke to Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping after talking to US, Australia and Indian leadership in his first calls.All the Quad countries have serious issues with China; India and Japan have territorial differences while Australia and the US are at the receiving end of Beijing’s trade wars.It is understood that under the Quad critical technology rubric, the four ministers will discuss cooperation in 5G and 5G plus technologies as well as increase interoperability during military exercises in the Indo-Pacific.India will also take a call on Australia’s participation in this year’s Malabar naval exercise in Bay of Bengal later this month, an official said.The four foreign ministers will discuss the security environment in the region with India briefing the Quad partners about the stand-off with People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh region. China has deployed nearly 50,000 troops in occupied Aksai China, Tibet and Xinjiang to put pressure on India to accede to its maximalist 1959 LAC line.The Modi government has noted the Chinese statement on Ladakh and Kashmir since Article 370 was abrogated on August 5, 2019. It finds Beijing’s suggestion that New Delhi should stay away from the US and by implication, remain a regional power most patronising, arrogant and coming from a rising power that does not understand the civilizational ethos of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-jaishankar-trip-india-is-game-to-formalise-quad-dialogue-that-ruffles-china/story-KuBv6Nd4DMzdB2RrKVcUUN.html

Due to some sudden developments yesterday evening, an operation of his heart had to be conducted in the late night. If the need arises, then possibly after a few weeks another operation might be conducted. Thanks to all for standing by me and my family in this hour of struggle.” Earlier yesterday, the LJP meeting that was scheduled to decide on whether to accept the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) offer of seats in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, was postponed owing to the ill health of the Union Minister.Earlier in September, Chirag had informed that his visit to Bihar for the final discussions over seat-sharing and other formalities ahead of the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections might be delayed as his father was unwell.He had then met party members and supporters urging them to be prepared for every scenario.The confusion seems to exist in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over seat-sharing.

Doctors, nurses, and non-medical staff participated in a fashion show that was streamed online for a US television channel; the 25 people who walked the ramp practised for 10 days before the event in the hospital auditorium, where the event was recorded without an audience.The participants used masks when they walked the ramp in pairs and threes, but did not wear them when they walked alone. The director of medical services Dr N Subramanian of the hospital also participated in the event , the hospital confirmed. He did not respond to calls seeking comment.Also Read: Healthwise: Study casts more doubt on HCQ’s effectiveness on Covid-19After the event, at least seven participants tested positive for Covid-19 over the week, including the organizer Dr MS Kanwar, who is a senior consultant of pulmonology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. “A private event for the benefit of Covid-19 frontline staff around the world was organized by a group of doctors. It was not a hospital event and was held virtually, keeping all safety precautions in place for lifting the morale of Covid-19 staff the world over, A few of the participants were later found to be positive as part of the hospitals’ rigorous testing protocols for the staff. Following this, necessary protocols, including quarantining, for Covid-19 staff turning positive were followed. Patient care and staff safety were in no way compromised because of this event,” said a statement from Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. Dr Kanwar, who tested positive on September 24, said the infections cannot be attributed to the show: “Most of the people involved in the event were working in Covid-19 areas; I myself was working in the Covid ICU at the time. So many health care workers get the infection and it is not right to say that the event had anything to do with the people who tested positive. The whole point of the event was to show people, to allay their fears, that despite seven months of frontline duty there is another aspect of our lives. It was to give positive message to the people.” On average, it takes about five days for symptoms to show after the virus enters the body. But four people familiar with the matter at the hospital confirmed that the infections were detected within a week of the event. Doctors should have known better, said an expert. “This is not advisable at all. In air-conditioned, ill-ventilated halls there is a high risk of transmission of the infection,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology and microbiology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-staffers-of-private-hospital-test-positive-for-covid-19-after-fashion-event/story-b8FLD12diKDJCKstCPaWMJ.html
04-10-2020||India||Faridabad institute part of global evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine||The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, has partnered with the Faridabad-based Translational Health Sciences and Research Institute (THSTI) as one of the five laboratories that will create a global network for reliably assessing all vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “THSTI Faridabad recognised under the global network of laboratories established by CEPIvaccines to centralise assessment. The laboratory supported under DBTIndia and IndCEPI. Very important to assess multiple vaccines,” said department of biotechnology secretary Dr Renu Swarup in a tweet. The department has encouraged Indian Covid-19 vaccine developers to partner with THSTI.The other four laboratories include Nexelis (Canada) and Public Health England (UK), VisMederi Srl (Italy), Viroclinics-DDL (Netherlands), and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease research (Bangladesh). The network will use the same reagents – from the labs of Nexelis and PHE – and follow common protocols to measure the immune response generated by multiple vaccine candidates, including the ones that are not being funded by CEPI. According to the organisation, the network will ensure uniformity in assessment across candidate helping in identifying the most promising one. Currently, there are over 320 vaccine candidates in development across the world, with about 30 just from India. Two vaccines developed by India biotech companies and government institutes have already entered phase II human trials. For vaccine development, pre-clinical trials are done in animals to see whether a candidate is safe and able to protect against the disease. In humans, a small phase I trial is done to assess the safety of the vaccine candidate, a phase II trial is done to see whether it produces an immune response, and a large phase III study assess whether it protects against the infection in field trial. Usually, the tests to see whether an immune response is produced – measured through antibody levels or T-cell response – after a person is vaccinated is done by individual laboratories selected by the vaccine makers. However, this is likely to produce varied data collection and evaluation methods for all the vaccine candidates, making it difficult to compare them. “Through centralising the analysis of samples obtained from trials of Covid-19 vaccine candidates, the new clinical-sample-testing network will minimise variation in results obtained, which could otherwise arise due to such technical differences when carrying out independent analysis. The samples from participating vaccine developers will instead be tested in the same group of laboratories using the same methods, therefore, removing much of the inter-laboratory variability and allowing for head-to-head comparisons of immune responses induced by multiple vaccine candidates,” according to the CEPI website. The vaccine manufacturers can use the network without per sample charges up to the limit of funding available to the programme. For eligibility, certain commitments would be needed from vaccine manufacturers such as timely publication of sample testing results and sharing the immunogenicity data for future regulatory decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faridabad-institute-part-of-global-evaluation-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-vO2NzzVwrRl0irNSvDVfLO.html

04-10-2020||India||Atal Tunnel: How winter sports athletes saved lives of construction workers during avalanches||At 0800 hours on February 24, 2018, the avalanche rescue team of the Strabag-Afcons Joint Venture (SAJV)—the company that was constructing the Atal Tunnel, one of the world’s longest high-altitude road tunnels—released an alert message. The tunnel runs 9.02km from Solang Valley near Manali to Sissu in Lahaul, cutting across a mountain to the west of the Rohtang Pass. The message said that no one should move out of the under-construction tunnel from the Lahaul NP, or north portal, the term for the tunnel mouth that opens at Sissu. WATCH | ‘Atal tunnel will strengthen India’s border infra’: PM Modi’s full speechA heavy avalanche was expected. The guard stationed at NP was instructed to not let anyone step out. After speaking to the guard, the team moved towards the South Portal (SP) the tunnel mouth near Manali. Also Read: Atal Tunnel is a symbol of Atmanirbhar Bharat, will strengthen border infrastructure: PM ModiUnaware of the alert, three jawans from the engineering wing of 70 Road construction company of Border Road Organisation (BRO), were travelling down towards Sissu from Keylong, 30km to the north. It was the first day of a month-long leave for them. An army vehicle dropped them off near the NP at 1015 hours. They were to cross the tunnel on foot to reach Manali. Two of the jawans entered the tunnel. The third, Naik Satnam Singh, a few steps behind them, was metres away from the mouth when the avalanche struck. The two watched in horror as Satnam vanished under a mountain of white. When the message about the incident reached the rescue team, they were busy clearing an alternate route for near on the Manali-Leh highway near SP, in case the road towards the tunnel got snowed in. They dropped everything and rushed towards the tunnel. Half an hour after Satnam was buried by the avalanche, the rescue operation began. Also Read: Atal Tunnel will connect youth of Lahaul-Spiti youth to many employment opportunities: PM ModiWith the help of avalanche rods—long, collapsible carbon sticks—the seven-member team started probing the area on the left side of the road, where the other jawans last saw Satnam. Thirty minutes passed. No luck. The rescue team began probing the entire area, point to point, sweeping in pre-determined arcs from the left of the snow-drowned highway to the right. They were running out of time. It had been an hour since Satnam disappeared. Unless there was a large air pocked around him, he would be running out of oxygen. At 1130 hours, Lal Chand, a national-level skier and at 36, the youngest of the rescuers, struck something to the far right of the road. “Here!” He shouted out. The other rescuers scrambled and began digging furiously. Five minutes later, Chuni Lal Thakur, an Olympic skier, could see Satnam’s head. “He’s alive, he’s breathing,” he said. Also Read: No other tunnel of this length at this height: Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur on Atal Tunnel“Jai ho maharaj!” said another member of the team. The digging continued with urgency. Fifteen minutes later, having dug more than six feet into the snow, they had the barely-conscious jawan out and into an ambulance. “It was my second birth,” said Satnam, now 35 and posted at Manali since the incident. “When I got trapped under the snow, in the very first minute I was able to move around one or one-and-a-half feet, but then I got buried deep. I was completely stuck and couldn’t move an inch. After five-six minutes of struggling, I lost all hope and thought my game was over. After that I don’t remember anything till I woke up in the ambulance. “Whenever I cross the point at NP where I was rescued, I pay my homage,” he said over the phone. “Had the rescue team didn’t not shown their alertness and quickness, I wouldn’t be talking to you.” The horse-shoe shaped Atal Tunnel, which was inaugurated on October 3, is situated in an extremely avalanche-prone area, 3,000 metres above sea-level. On an average, 200 avalanches hit the stretch every year. For the ten years that it took for the tunnel to be built, the seven members of the rescue team, all of them winter sports athletes, including an Olympian, acted as the lifeline for the construction workers. “These are moments that define your life,” said Chuni Lal, referring to Satnam’s rescue, “a moment of great pride.”Chuni Lal, who headed the team from 2010 till 2019, was one of the first from the villages near Manali to make it big in skiing. He competed in the 1992 Winter Olympics, two Winter Asian Games, and was a coach for the Indian ski team for the 2007 Asian Games. Both his son and his daughter are national skiers. Mountain rescue is a part of life for him. “During my skiing days, and even later as a coach, there were many occasions when we skiers had to rescue stranded tourists near Rohtang,” he said. Three of the seven rescuers, including Chuni Lal, come from Palchan, a stunningly picturesque village with a population of around 2,000, nestled among the snow-covered mountains of the Pir Panjal range. The rescue team comprises Chuni Lal Thakur (49), Kewal Ram (39), Raj Kumar Thakur (43), Duni Chand (38), Joginder Paul (38), Gautam Beas (36) and Lal Chand (36). The members hail from a cluster of nine villages—Palchan, Ruwar, Kothi, Kulang, Solang, Burwa, Majhach, Shanag and Goshal —located on the rugged terrain between Manali and Rohtang. Over the years, the area has developed into the country’s ski nursery, producing over 50 internationals, including five winter Olympians—four in skiing and one, Shiva Keshavan, in luge. Since 1992, when Chuni Lal and Nanak Chand from Palchan competed in the Winter Olympics for the first time, there has been an Olympian from these villages in each edition except the 1994 Games. Despite their expertise on the mountain and their deep knowledge of the terrain, the rescue team was put through a series of workshops soon after the team was formed on November 1, 2010. They learnt everything from how to “read” mountains and predict avalanches, to how to put a person on a stretcher without aggravating the neck or the spine. “During our training, when we used to sit in the car, one of our instructors told us that the driver in the rescue vehicle keeps his eye on the road,” said Gautam, 36, a trained mountaineer. “The rest of us are supposed to watch the slopes throughout, looking at angles, snow, observing wind speed…now when I am in a car, I scan automatically.” With 45 avalanche prone spots along the tunnel’s route, carrying out construction work through the year was a major challenge. January to May are the avalanche months—between November 2018 and March 2019, there were 288 avalanches in the area. In their decade at work, the rescue team was involved in six major operations and responded to at least 500 calls, but their primary, and most critical function, was to try and ensure there were no incidents at all. Every day for 10 years, it was their duty to forecast avalanches and frame safe timings for the work. “Every day, we used to recce the snow clad mountains, trekking to avalanche formation zones and carrying out snow testing for forecast,” said Lal Chand. “The workforce at the construction site had to carry avalanche beacons every time and the rescue team had detectors, so, in case anyone got buried inside the avalanche, that person could be tracked.” Chuni Lal recalls a day in April in 2016 when an Army vehicle got buried in an avalanche and the team had to rescue six army personnel. “There was heavy snowfall, and the main threat while carrying out the rescue operation was the risk of another avalanche,” he said. As the team became better known in the area for their work, they were sometimes called in at other rescue operations as well. In September 2018, when over 300 of tourists were stranded for days due to heavy snowfall near the Kunzum Pass at 4551m, 122km from Manali and Baralacha Pass at 4890m, 191km from Manali. The Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted a five-day rescue, airlifting the tourists—all except five people, who were stuck inside their vehicle in a place where the IAF’s rescue choppers could not reach. Instead, the IAF picked up the avalanche rescue team from Manali and airdropped them at the Baralacha Pass, from where they skied to the location and brought back the stranded group, which included a seven-year-old child.Also Read: Supplied 9,000 tonnes of steel for Atal Tunnel: SAIL “After being part of the rescue team of the tunnel, we were sought after rescuers,” said Joginder Paul, a former mountaineering instructor who was one of the rescuers in that operation. Paul is well known in the area for volunteering for rescue operations. His drive to help was born out of a tragedy. In 2004, when he was an instructor at the Atal Bihari Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports in Manali, the deputy director of the institute asked him to join him on a rescue mission. A car had fallen into a deep gorge; what Paul did not know was that all three occupants in the car—a newlywed couple and their driver—were dead. “When we trekked inside the gorge and reached the body, I realised they were dead,” Paul said. “There were lots of injuries; I had never seen a body in that condition. For a moment, I completely blanked out. Ever since then, I have been volunteering for rescues.” Like Paul, Raj Kumar, 43, also compulsively volunteers for rescue work after experiencing great loss. He was just three days old when he lost his mother, and was in his late teens, making a name as a junior skier, when he lost his father. It necessitated a scramble for survival, and for years, Raj did odd jobs to make ends meet—sometimes he was a shepherd, sometimes a porter, sometimes a tourist photographer at Rohtang. “I have seen the worst in my life,” he said. “I feel easily the pain of losing loved ones. I have never seen my mother, so by helping someone I remember her presence. As part of the rescue team, we remained at the forefront of danger for the entire duration of the construction.” Though the avalanche team enjoyed great success in their work, there is one tragedy that still haunts them—March 22, 2011, was the first and last incident that caused a casualty in the 10 years of the construction of the tunnel. On that day too, forecasting a heavy avalanche, the rescue team had flashed a message to stop work. But two unlucky construction workers—a local from Kullu and one from Odisha—missed the warning and continued moving in their vehicle towards Manali before they were struck by the avalanche. Though the rescue team was on the spot in 15 minutes and both workers were pulled out in another ten minutes, neither survived. “Their death still haunts us. Though it’s been more than nine years, the entire episode is fresh in our memories,” said Chuni Lal. The Olympian fell out with the company last year over a pay dispute and filed a case against them with the Central Government Industrial Tribunal cum Labour Court in Chandigarh. Now, as the tunnel has opened to traffic, the rescue team has been disbanded—only two of the seven continue to work as rescuers for the company. “Though our stint here has ended, the things we have learned about forecasting avalanches and rescue will always be a great use for us to help the people in need,” said Lal Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-chasing-medals-to-saving-lives/story-BnvGJBiQxF6rg9NYurVEXI.html

The Centre has so far declared four stages of graded “unlocking” before announcing “re-opening” of activities on October 1. But while all industries have reopened, many are working below capacity due to lower demand.

This will also reduce the financial pressure on the Centre. “Their usage of vaccines will be under the overall, centralised monitoring of the Union government and data on the vaccinations will be collected and stored by the Centre too,” said an official.The government is putting in place logistics and infrastructure across India for a possible launch of vaccines by early next year. It is in touch with the states, potential vaccine makers and other stakeholders to draw a plan for distribution and administration of Covid vaccines.

Taking to Twitter, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said that the constitution provides every citizen the right to live, which included a right to defend themselves. “Our demand is that the 20 lakh Bahujans of the country be granted gun licenses immediately. The government should provide us a 50 % subsidy to purchase guns and pistols. We will defend ourselves,” he said.Also Read : Thakur mahapanchayat held in Hathrasसँविधान में हर नागरिक को जीने का अधिकार दिया है, जिसमें आत्म रक्षा का अधिकार शामिल है। हमारी माँग है कि देश में 20 लाख बहुजनों को हथियारों के लाइसेंस तत्काल दिया जाए। हमें बंदूक़ और पिस्तौल ख़रीदने के लिए 50% सब्सिडी सरकार दे। हम अपनी रक्षा खुद कर लेंगे। #Gun_Licence_For_BahujanSeeking gun licenses, Dalit activist Suraj Yengde cited the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995, which empowers the state government to provide arms licenses to ensure the safety of person and property.

04-10-2020||India||Hathras gangrape: Community being targeted, say kin of accused||“If my children are guilty, shoot them dead. But if they turn out to be innocent, I want to be compensated for my loss of reputation,” said Rakesh Singh, father of 35-year-old Ram Kumar, one of the four men arrested for allegedly gang raping and killing a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras. The others are Sandeep Singh, Ravi Singh, and Luv Kush. His sentiment is echoed by many residents of the Bul Garhi village who are convinced that the four men are being framed.As it turns out, all four men belong to one large joint family consisting of about 30 members. They have a history of conflict with the family of the victim -- a history that has seen an FIR being registered, two men getting jailed and being acquitted.Also Read| Hathras gangrape: BJP MLA says instilling ‘sanskar’ in daughters could help stop rapesAccording to a senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified, in 2001-02, the two families were involved in a property dispute. “It ended in the victim’s father suffering a head injury. An FIR under IPC sections of attempt to commit culpable homicide, of assault and under the SC/ST Act was registered,” said the police officer.The murdered woman’s mother said that her family forgot all about it. “But the Thakurs did not forget.” Rakesh Singh said that his family was wrongly targeted even in that 18-year-old case.In the latest case too, Singh’s family insisted that the arrested men were innocent. “The dead woman’s family would borrow money from us and cut grass for their buffaloes from our fields, but now they want to frame us in another case,” said another relative who didn’t identify himself.They claimed that one of the suspects, Ram Kumar, wasn’t even in the village at the time of the crime. “He works for a dairy firm and was on duty at that time,” said a third relative.The atmosphere in the village, meanwhile, remained tense on Saturday even as the victim’s brother alleged that he has received threats from the Thakur community.“I don’t know why they feel threatened by us, but if they feel threatened, they’ll continue to feel that all their life. The threat is not from us, it’s in their minds,” said Rakesh Singh.Most villagers HT interacted with spoke out in support of the accused. Some offered alternative theories. But the woman, in her dying declaration, named the four suspects as her rapists and killers -- something that outweighs conspiracy theories. This village with about 450 voters has only half-a-dozen Dalit homes, even as Thakurs and Brahmins constitute about 80% of the population. “Our community has been maligned for no fault of our men,” said a local resident, Ravi Sharma.Awanish K Awasthi, additional chief secretary, said that authorities have met local leaders to ensure there is peace in and around the village. “The village will continue to receive police security. Senior police officers have been given the responsibility to ensure peace.” The few Dalit families of this village stayed indoors. “Once the police leave, it will only get tougher to survive as a minority here,” said a Dalit who didn’t want to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-being-targeted-say-kin-of-accused/story-bCw1uF4sUIqx8SxyydeTJM.html
04-10-2020||India||‘Having to prove that my daughter was raped’: Hathras victim’s mother recounts ordeal||The mother of the 19-year-old woman raped and murdered in Hathras says she can’t get two images out of her head -- one is her desperate attempt to cover her injured daughter’s naked lower body with her saree, and the other of being unable to lift her semi-conscious teenage daughter.“Until then, I didn’t even know the word, rape (in English). Today, I am having to prove that my daughter was raped,” the mother told Hindustan Times at her home after the Uttar Pradesh Police allowed the media to visit Bul Garhi village on Saturday.At around 7.45am on September 14 , the mother, along with her daughter and son, set out, sickles in their hands, to find fodder for their five buffaloes. “In an hour, we cut a lot of grass and I sent back my son with one heap...,” she said.WATCH | UP DGP meets Hathras victim’s family, ‘no comments’ over cremation controversy Also Read | Hathras gangrape: Community being targeted, say kin of accusedIt was around 9am that she suddenly realised that her daughter wasn’t responding to her calls. For a while, she believed that her daughter had returned home, but then she found one of her slippers by the side of the road. “That meant she was around, but something was wrong, I couldn’t spot her other chappal,” she recounted. Moments later, she was wading into the maize fields. “I found the fields trampled and sensed that my daughter was in the fields”.After about 20 metres she spotted her daughter, her chunni around her neck. “She was almost unconscious. Her lower clothes were thrown aside and she was bleeding from her private parts...,” the mother said, adding that her daughter was also bleeding from her chin and tongue, and her eyes were bloodshot.The mother let out a shriek, drawing a young Thakur boy into the fields. “My first instinct was to cover her lower body with my saree, but I couldn’t.” The Thakur boy ran into the village to call her brother for help even as the mother put on the pyjama on the victim and tried to carry her to the village. “I just couldn’t lift her, I cried helplessly.” Soon, her brother arrived at the scene and the mother-son duo sandwiched the victim between them on a motorcycle and took her to the local police station, about two kilometers away.At the police station, the woman was made to lie down on a cement slab as her brother was asked to submit a written complaint. “My mother was with my sister and I wrote whatever I knew. My mother didn’t have the heart to tell me that my sister was raped,” said the victim’s brother. The local police, meanwhile, realised that the victim was in a bad condition and urged the family to rush her to the district hospital. About four hours later, the victim was in an ambulance to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh.By that time, the Hathras police had registered a case of attempt to murder and named Sandeep as the suspect.According to the victim’s family, on September 17, the woman regained consciousness and mentioned the gang rape and the names of the other suspects. “When I was alone, she hesitatingly told me about four men raping her,” the mother claimed.The victim’s two brothers said that the same day, they submitted a written complaint at the office of the Hathras superintendent of police. “But we got no receipt,” her brother said; the family couldn’t produce a copy of that complaint. This claim by the family contradicts the police version that no mention of rape or gang rape was made until September 22.The family alleged that after they filed the rape complaint on September 17, police officers met the victim to seek her statement. In any case, the victim’s allegations of gang rape were officially recorded only on September 22 in front of a magistrate and her medical examination for rape conducted after that -- a delay that could prove crucial. HT couldn’t reach the Superintendent of Police and Uttar Pradesh’s director general of police for their response. When Brahm Singh, the circle officer, was contacted, he said he wasn’t aware of any such complaint. “I was posted here after the crime took place.” The victim succumbed to her injuries in Safdarjung Hospital on September 29, two days after she was moved there from the Aligarh hospital. The body was brought back to her village in Hathras the same night even as her family returned separately after a brief protest in Delhi. “The police agreed that we would get to cremate her at 6am, but suddenly they went ahead and cremated her at 2.30am itself,” said her brother.The family then locked themselves inside their house in the hope that the absence of any relative would dissuade the police from cremating her.But that was not to be.Prem Prakash Meena, the joint magistrate of Hathras, said that the cremation was done in the presence of the victim’s family. “There is video evidence to show that her grandfather and uncle were among half-dozen of her relatives who attended the cremation,” said Meena.The victim’s family contested that claim. “My grandfather passed away in 2006,” said the victim’s brother. The family alleged that the days following the death were traumatic as they were “insulted and threatened” by the authorities even as the police occupied their house and “abused” them for leaking videos to media.Speaking to the media later on Saturday, Awanish K Awasthi, additional chief secretary, said that the SIT will work to ensure strict action against the culprits. “The concerns you are raising were raised by the family as well. The SIT will look into each of those points,” Awasthi told journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/helplessness-grief-hathras-victim-s-kin-recount-ordeal/story-NpdmppPrDoSUi1oQbi2loO.html

04-10-2020||India||India has ‘no first use’ of atomic weapons policy against nuclear armed states: Shringla||India espouses the policy of “no first use” of atomic weapons against nuclear weapon states and non-use against non-nuclear weapon states even as it backs global efforts towards strengthening the non-proliferation order, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla has said. Shringla made the remarks while representing India at a high-level plenary meeting to commemorate the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons on Friday. Reiterating India’s long-standing commitment to universal, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, he said: “We believe that nuclear disarmament can be achieved through a step-by-step process underwritten by a universal commitment and an agreed multilateral framework.” Elaborating on the country’s nuclear doctrine, he said: “India espouses the policy of ‘no first use’ against nuclear weapon states and non-use against non-nuclear weapon states. India is a key partner in global efforts towards disarmament and strengthening the non-proliferation order.” India, he added, remains convinced of the need for meaningful dialogue among all states possessing nuclear weapons to build trust and confidence. The country’s approach to nuclear disarmament is contained in its working paper submitted to the UN General Assembly’s first committee in 2006 and to the Conference on Disarmament in 2007, he said. India’s annual resolution in the General Assembly on the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, tabled since 1982, enjoys wide support and reaffirms that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the UN Charter and a crime against humanity, Shringla said. The country has also tabled an annual resolution in the General Assembly since 1998 on “reducing nuclear danger” that calls for urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear weapons, including “through de-alerting and de-targeting”, he said. India supports the start of negotiations on a “Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention” at the Conference on Disarmament. “Without prejudice to the priority attached to nuclear disarmament, India remains committed to the immediate commencement of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the CD...,” he said. UN Secretary-General António Guterres told delegates gathered to commemorate the event that “the world continues to live in the shadow of nuclear catastrophe”. Progress towards total elimination of nuclear weapons has “stalled and is at risk of backsliding”, he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-no-first-use-of-atomic-weapons-policy-against-nuclear-armed-states-shringla/story-tjPi4gFZvXbcM6Yl7PjlPP.html
04-10-2020||Today's||The impact of Trump’s illness||Covid-19 is, once again, proving to be a key determinant in the United States (US) election, with President Donald Trump testing positive. The virus has also taken down a chunk of his White House staff and even the Republican Party leadership. Presuming the president recovers, there is unlikely to be any major change in present voting patterns. The few polls that have come out since the announcement indicate previous trends remain unchanged, with Mr Trump holding to about 42% of the vote and Democratic candidate Joe Biden trending at 50% but slowly picking up undecided votes. In the case of a temporary presidential incapacitation, there will be three likely consequences. One, with less than a month left before polls, it has eroded Mr Trump’s hopes of using his campaign rallies to move the needle in his direction. Two, it has further enhanced the sense of a seriously dysfunctional if not outright chaotic administration. Finally, and arguably most damaging, it has brought the US voting public’s focus back to the pandemic — the electoral issue on which Mr Trump fares the worst.The rest of the world could have done without a further shot of uncertainty in the international system. The gloating of the state-owned Chinese media at Mr Trump’s illness carries its own subtext. The real known unknown would be if Mr Trump’s health took a serious turn for the worse. If this were to happen just before or just after ballots are cast, the US constitution and its elaborate succession clauses would be severely tested. All of this would add to an already volatile mix of a superpower deeply polarised at home and facing major security challenges abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-impact-of-trump-s-illness/story-BVAHR82QC1UhoMcU3Sz5vM.html
04-10-2020||Editorials||Hathras: Go back to the Verma panel||The Hathras episode has, once again, exposed the vulnerable state of women in India, especially those from marginalised social groups, and the challenges in ensuring their safety and obtaining justice. While the specific circumstances may have differed, the Hathras case has also been equated with the December 16, 2012, gang rape in Delhi. The 2012 case shook the nation’s conscience, leading to setting up of the Justice JS Verma Committee, which recommended amend-ments to the criminal law to provide for quicker trial and enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault against women. On the positive side, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, amended the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences. But cases such as Hathras are a reminder that ensuring social, institutional and structural changes on the ground will be more difficult than making changes on paper. It is often forgotten that, along with recommending sweeping legal changes, the Verma panel underlined the need for police reforms because “the protection of women from harassment and threats of a sexual nature” is “dependent on the quality of policing…”. Hathras only reinforces this, for Uttar Pradesh (UP) police officers appeared to show scant regard for the law, basic evidence-gathering procedures, socio-economic status of the victim, and also seemed unaware (deliberately or otherwise) of certain basic changes that have been introduced in the law by the Verma panel. There also seemed to be a disregard for the woman’s dying declaration, which is given an important status by the law, and the state police were quick to jump to conclusions that are for the courts to judge. In fact, most UP police officers do not even seem aware of the Union health ministry protocols for the medical examination of victims of sexual assault, which says the absence of injuries does not mean the survivor has consented to sexual activity. The other aspect of the Verma panel that most states have chosen to overlook is setting up of one-stop crisis centres to provide integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence — this will facilitate access to a range of services, including medical, legal, psychological and counselling support. The real justice for the victim in Hathras would be implementing the Verma committee recommendations in letter and spirit by both the central and state governments. This requires the utmost political commitment from the top leadership. The outrage against Hathras must be channelled towards structural reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/hathras-go-back-to-the-verma-panel/story-FNpYOcwjTWUwpPCOQ50ueL.html
