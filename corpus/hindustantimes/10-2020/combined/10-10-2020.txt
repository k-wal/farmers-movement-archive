10-10-2020||News||The history of Jewish-Arab harmony||It was perhaps no coincidence that on September 4, an imam at Mecca’s Grand Mosque dwelt on Prophet Mohammed’s kindness to a Jewish neighbour. The reference, days before the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain signed agreements on September 15 to normalise ties with Israel, was seen as part of the groundwork for other Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia to follow suit. The thaw in Arab-Israel relations is a culmination of years of behind-the-scenes work that Arab leaders have been hinting at. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in 2018, backed the Israelis’ “right to have their own land”. Bahrain defended Israeli airstrikes in Syria the same year, saying Israel “has the right to defend itself”. A year later, Bahraini foreign minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa called Israel a part of the region’s heritage.Bin Salman and Khalifa’s sentiments sound extraordinary given how the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for Israel’s creation in 1948 blighted Jewish-Arab relations. But the seven-decade schism is a blip when seen from the perspective of centuries of cordial ties dating back to the rise of Islam. Jews thrived under the Abbasid Empire, the greatest that the Arabs have helmed that ushered in Islam’s Golden Age on the back of acceptance, openness, scholarship, and science. Caliph Al-Mansur laid the ceremonial first brick for Baghdad’s foundation as the Empire’s capital on July 30, 762, only after his astrologers, including a Jew, chose it as the most auspicious for work on the city to begin at the site Nestorian Christian monks suggested to him. Jewish religious scholarship flourished in Abbasid Baghdad. Jews had their own schools where Hebrew was taught. Baghdad once boasted of 10 rabbinical schools and 22 synagogues. Benjamin of Tudela, a 12th-century Spanish rabbi who visited Baghdad as part of an odyssey to the most storied cities globally, called the Caliph “kind unto Israel”, and well-versed in its laws. This is not surprising as Muslims believe Islam is an extension of the Abrahamic traditions represented by Judaism and Christianity. The three religions trace their origins to Abraham. Early Muslims prayed in the direction of Jerusalem, the city Muslims, Christians, and Jews consider to be holy. Jews found refuge in Muslim lands when papal ascendancy in medieval Europe led to religious repression, or inquisitions, from the 13th to the 15th century. Jews were banished from England and France in the 14th century, and from Spain in 1492. The last Caliphate — Ottoman — welcomed Spanish Jews fleeing the Catholic Inquisition. Jews participated in the government under Ottoman rule, thanks to the modernising Tanzimat (re-ordering) administrative, military, educational, legal, and social reforms in the 19th century. The reforms required provincial administrative councils to reflect local religious diversity. Menahim Salih Efendi Daniyal, a Jew, was among the four sent from Baghdad to the first Ottoman parliament in 1877–78. Sasson Efendi Hasqail, another Jew, was elected to the parliament twice from the city. Jewish-Arab relations deteriorated after Britain promised the Zionist movement a national home — Israel — in Palestine through the Balfour Declaration of 1917. The pledge rode roughshod over the native Arabs, who accounted for 90% of the Palestinian population. The British colonialists regulated migration to Palestine over the following decades and increased the Jewish population there from 9% in 1922 to 27% in 1935. They dispossessed Palestinians by carrying out demolitions under the garb of “urban regeneration”. The Nakba (catastrophe) struck when an estimated 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes in 1948 with Israel’s creation that triggered the first of the Arab-Israeli wars. The euphoria over the normalisation of Israel’s ties with its neighbours, however, should not take the focus away from the need for Israel to end its policies of dispossessing Palestinians. This is the only way to ensure a durable peace in the region.

10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra could be completely unlocked by November-end: Tope||Every activity across Maharashtra, including schools, gymnasiums and railway services, could be unlocked from the coronavirus-enforced lockdown by the end of November, health minister Rajesh Tope said on Saturday. He added that rates for the gold standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests would be further slashed to ₹800, from the existing rate of ₹1,200 to ₹2,000, within the next eight days.Tope said that barring a few activities, everything has been opened up by the government under its Mission Begin Again — a staggered plan to unlock activities—and the remaining restrictions will be lifted in phases by November-end. The state went into lockdown from mid-March.“We have allowed bars and eateries to operate. Schools are expected to open after Diwali. Railway services are being allowed this month. Religious places and gymnasiums, too, will be allowed to open in a phased manner. Some activities will be allowed by October-end, and the remaining by November-end. I think by November-end, everything will be open,” he said.Maharashtra government allowed restaurants and bars to open from October 5. Long-distance and intercity train services within state limits have also been allowed earlier this month. There is a rising demand for opening of shrines and gymnasiums. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, earlier this week, clarified that schools will not open till Diwali, falling on November 14, and the decision about their opening will be taken by reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state. The state administration is wary of a second wave of the infection, as witnessed in many other countries, if activities are opened up abruptly. Thackeray reiterated his concern during the virtual inauguration of a test lab in Washim on Saturday.The health minister on Saturday during the inauguration function, said the rates of the RT-PCR kits have fallen drastically in the recent past and in the wake of it, the rates of the tests, too, can come down. “We have brought the test rates to ₹1,200 through two revisions over the past few months. The prices of the kits required for the tests have fallen further and the benefit of it should be passed on to the common people without allowing the private laboratories to profit. We will take a decision in the next eight days to bring the rates down to ₹800 per test. The tests in Maharashra are lowest in the country,” he said.On September 8, the government slashed the rates to ₹1,200 to ₹2,000 from earlier rates ranging between ₹1,900 and ₹2,500. Initially, the test rates were as high as ₹4,500 per test. Those were brought down to ₹2,200 to ₹2,800 in June, ₹1,900 to ₹2,500 in August and ₹1,200 to ₹2,000 in September. The private laboratories are allowed to charge more for the collection of swabs from home. The initial high cost was attributed to shortage of kits owing to reduced manufacturing due to lockdown, restrictions on their transportation and reduced competition among laboratories.State government recently decided to procure 35 lakh RT-PCR kits along with other material and medicines, spending ₹634 crore. The government has fixed the rate at ₹78.4 per kit required for the test. On that basis, the state government has decided to go for a revision of the test rate.Maharashtra has around 400 testing labs, including more than 200 from the private sector. The tests done by private labs are more than government laboratories. The further slashing of rates, however, is expected to face a resistance from the private sector. “It has been witnessed that the private sector has been indulging into profiteering, cashing in on the pandemic, be it prices of masks, tests or PPE kits. The RT-PCR kit costs not more than ₹200 and adding other overheads, per test cost does not exceed ₹600, against which they have been allowed to charge up to ₹2,000,” said an official from the health department.Meanwhile, the Western Railway (WR) is planning to increase its local train services being operated for people working in essential services. Above 100 local train services will be increased in the coming week.“We are inspecting and looking on introducing new local train services for employees working in essential services.” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relation officer, WR.Presently, the WR operates 506 train services everyday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-could-be-completely-unlocked-by-november-end-tope/story-yRBrdu1nOQuFF7VslHNhjK.html

For ₹35 lakh, Pal was assured allotment by Sat Narain, who also said he was close to other politicians.By 2016-mid, however, Pal had not gotten any response. In October 2017, on Pal’s insistence, the accused “agreed to return the money”, but their cheques were dishonoured. A case was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-panchkula-cops-among-six-booked-in-a-36-5-lakh-fraud-case/story-gc1gxKdqFwF5bDqJLS1DUO.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 toll crosses 40K, last 10,000 deaths in 25 days||Maharashtra on Saturday crossed the 40,000 mark for Covid-19 fatalities, seven months since the first case was reported. With 308 new fatalities, the state’s toll went up to 40,040, while 11,416 new infections took the tally to 151,7434. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 2,203 new cases, taking the city’s tally up to 227,276, while its toll stands at 9,391.State clocked the last 10,000 Covid-19 deaths in just 25 days . The first 10,000 were crossed in 125 days (on July 11) after the first case was detected on March 9. Next 10,000 were reported in 30 days. The 30,000-mark was breached in another 30 days. Of the fatalities reported on Saturday, 168 deaths were from the past two days, 60 from past week, while remaining 80 were from the period before it. Mumbai and Pune district retained their first and second positions in term of new infections and fatalities. Pune saw addition of 46 deaths, while Mumbai reported 48 deaths. Ahmednagar and Satara in western Maharashtra reported 24 and 26 fatalities respectively. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.64%.Pune added 1,772 new infections, which included 724 from city, 634 from rural parts and 414 from Pimpri Chinchwad. Nashik, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and Satara continued to clock high number of cases with addition of 741, 813, 595 and 452 cases respectively. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which comprises nine municipal corporations and rural parts of three districts, accounted for 36.82% or 4,103 cases of state’s tally. While the state has been reporting a decline in the daily caseload over the past three weeks, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the state has not reduced in proportion. The CFR in first 10 days of October rose to 2.53% from 2.04% in September. The CFR had fallen to 1.91% in first 15 days of September to rise to 2.18% the next fortnight. The rise in CFR in over the last more than three weeks has resulted in the state’s overall death rate hovering around 2.6%, while the death rate of a few other states and the national rate has steadily declined.The high rate of mortality is attributed to the late referral of infected people to health facilities, lacklustre approach of the machinery in tracing suspected people and low rate of testing. “We are still getting the infected patients to the facilities as late as third or fourth days, against the targeted period of first 48 hours. These patients not only risk their life, but also infect others in large numbers. The tracing of suspected contacts is as low as less than 10 in most of the districts, against the expected ratio of 20 people per infection. We expect the ratio to improve after the launch of “My Family, My Responsibility” last month,” said an official from health department requesting anonymity.State health minister Rajesh Tope, admitted that the state’s test rate per million population needs to improve. “We are at sixth position, even below Andhra Pradesh, Telangana when it comes to per million tests. We are not testing at the fullest of the 400 laboratories opened in the state. The tracing ratio, too, needs to be improved to 1:20 so that we can contain the spread of infection and CFR can be brought below 1%,” Tope said.Tope said that Maharashtra’s CFR is high compared to other states, but it is also because of the transparency authorities have been maintaining in terms of cases and deaths.State conducted 82,064 tests in last 24 hours at a positivity rate of 13.91%. Overall positivity rate of the state stands at 20.05%. State’s recovery rate improved to 82.76% after 26,440 patients were reported recovered on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-toll-crosses-40k-last-10-000-deaths-in-25-days/story-ASahnRru4VHGuRrN0EUr6H.html

10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Elections 2020: Bar Council, Punjab and Haryana HC Bar at loggerheads again||The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH) and Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association (PHHCBA) are at loggerheads again over the conduct of annual elections. The council has objected to the HC Bar announcing elections on October 24. “We are in talks with HC Bar election committee. We are proposing elections for November 6 in all district Bars and the HC,” said BCPH chairman, Karanjit Singh. However, chairman of the election committee, PHHCBA, KS Sidhu, has written to BCPH asking it not to interfere in the affairs of High Court Bar. “There is no provision of the Bar Council framing rules for holding of elections for the high court,” Sidhu’s letter said. Sidhu’s letter comes in the wake of Bar Council seeking suggestions from lawyers over holding elections on November 6 in all Bars in the two states and the HC. This proposal from BCPH had come following PHHCBA announcing polls on October 24. Earlier too, the HC Bar body and Bar Council had locked horns over online elections announced by Bar Council for September 30 and October 1. Subsequently, the matter reached the high court and election notification was quashed. Bar Council is a statutory body which regulates entry into legal profession and has nearly 1-lakh members in the two states and Chandigarh. The HC Bar has nearly 4,000 members practising before high court. Bar Council withdraws proposal to go on strike Meanwhile Bar Council has withdrawn its proposal to go on hunger strike after October 12. “The high court administration has decided to partially allow physical hearing in district courts. In view of this, strike call has been withdrawn,” Singh said. The BCPH had threatened to go on strike on October 2 after the high court notified that only virtual hearings would take place in all courts in October in the two states and Chandigarh. Now, district courts are being allowed to open partially for physical hearing for the first time since March when lockdown was imposed in view of Covid-19 outbreak. However, only virtual hearings will be allowed at HC for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/elections-2020-bar-council-punjab-and-haryana-hc-bar-at-loggerheads-again/story-G1UI078emyru42SDjjvxyH.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||After September surge, Covid deaths on decline in Chandigarh||Deaths due to Covid-19 in Chandigarh are on the decline after a surge in September.Weekly data shows that between September 18 and 25, the highest number of 35 fatalities took place. This happened just after infection surged, with single-day highest of 449 positive cases reported on September 13, and active cases reached their peak at 3,171 on September 16.“Present data suggests that we have achieved the peak in terms of both cases as well as deaths. The huge surge in deaths seen in mid-September has receded significantly,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, adding that there is a direct correlation between the number of cases and deaths, and as new infections have started decreasing, fatalities will come down as well.Dr Ram said during the surge in September, it was also seen that the severity of the disease had increased. “Many patients had comorbidities, which were aggravated due to the infection. “However, in the last couple of days, not many patients are reporting to the facility in such a serious condition,” he said.The reduction in fatalities is also coupled with active cases dipping below 10% (at 9.3%) on Saturday, and recovery rate inching towards 90% (at 89.1%). In fact, the number of recoveries continues to outnumber fresh infections since September 17. Even on Saturday, 157 patients were discharged in comparison to 96 who tested positive. However, fatality rate that increased from 1.2% to 1.4% in the last week of September has since remained constant.“There is a continued effort from the health department to daily monitor patients who are in home isolation and identify those at high risk,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department. “Patients with comorbidities are being paid special attention, and in case of emergency, medical help is promptly available.” Dr Nagpal said since the testing numbers remain above 1,000 on a daily basis now, “we are trying to identify and isolate the persons who have contracted the infection as early as possible”. “This all is expected to bring the fatality rate below 1%,” he said.Dr Jagat Ram said hoping that people don’t resort to major violations of safety norms, it is unlikely that there will be another surge in infection. However, the PGIMER is taking no chances, and is making arrangements for Covid management till the next year, as it is unlikely the pandemic will end abruptly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-september-surge-covid-deaths-on-decline-in-chandigarh/story-2oCWZVS1xoQsDgIOjoM18M.html

Heaps of old furniture have been dumped wherever space is available, particularly in areas senior officers seldom visit. One such location is near the canteen, where old, unused furniture, some of which could be heritage items, has been conveniently dumped. “Despite the Swachhta Abhiyan, the administration’s own secretariat fails the cleanliness test. Corridors and verandahs are being used as storage dumps for old files and worn out furniture. Some corridors are blocked with almirahs that there is hardly any space left for an emergency evacuation in case a fire breaks out,” a UT employee said, requesting anonymity. Women doctors take the charge of Covid-19 management Women administrators have taken charge of two important health institutions in the city amid increased efforts to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The first, Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, has taken over as director, health services of Chandigarh after Dr G Dewan retired last month. Also, at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Dr Jasbinder Kaur, the head of the biochemistry department, has the officiating charge of director-cum-principal of the institute after Dr BS Chavan took leave for personal reasons. Besides, the treatment of Covid-19 patients, their sampling and testing, the health department and GMCH-32 are involved in contacting isolated persons at home on a daily basis. Traffic lights on the blink in Mohali The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) installed traffic signals at six accident-prone spots on the stretch from Sector 76 to 80 but a month on, the lights are not functional as the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is yet to issue the power connections. A senior GMADA officer admitted, “We requested them for the power connection but have not got it yet.” Meanwhile, accidents are witnessed at these points almost daily. Social distancing at Dussehra easier said than done Even as the UT administration is considering giving permission for celebrating Dussehra, organisers say that the administration’s direction of limiting the number of people is easier said than done. “Every year, thousands flock to the main Dusshera celebrations in the city. Rather than telling us to limit people at these gatherings, the administration should reach out to the people and ask them to sit at home. If more than 200 or 300 people show up what can we do to stop them?” an organiser said.

10-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Accused asked to return copies of charge sheet||The sessions court hearing the Delhi riots case asked the lawyers of the 15 accused to return soft copies of the charge sheet made available to them by the police on September 21 after the latter admitted that the identities of some protected witnesses had been inadvertently revealed in these, and also ordered that the identities not be revealed to anyone. The move came after the Delhi Police informed a sessions court presided over by additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat on Friday that people with “vested interests” have approached at least three protected witnesses listed in the charge sheet in the Delhi riots conspiracy case.  The court also ordered that the accused be given another copy after removal of the files containing the details of the witnesses. Judge Rawat said the investigating officer erred by placing the document containing the details of the witnesses as part of the charge sheet and handing it to the accused. “The sole idea is to protect the identity of the witnesses and to ensure their safety and security,” the court said. A two-page document listing the names and addresses of at least 15 protected witnesses, who gave evidence against those arrested for conspiracy in the Delhi riots, was included in the police’s charge sheet filed in a city court last month. The document contained the names and address of protected witness --- otherwise referred to only by their pseudonyms such as Alpha, Beta, Hector, Delta, Echo, and Mike. The statements of the protected witnesses were recorded before different judges between March and August. A statement before a judge is admissible evidence. These witnesses hold the key to police’s narrative that the riots were part of a larger conspiracy and orchestrated by people protesting the new Citizenship Amendment Act. The witnesses were insiders or friends of the accused and claim to have been present in meetings or seen or heard the accused conspiring. On Friday, Delhi police moved an application in court stating that the mistake was inadvertent. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad told the court that it was necessary to protect the identity of the witnesses and requested the court that the document also be extracted from the judicial file and replaced with a truncated version with the original being sealed and kept on record. Prasad also urged the court that a direction be also issued to all the accused and their lawyers to delete and destroy any copy/prints made out of the soft copy. The court ordered immediate steps to the effect and posted the matter for further hearing on October 15. Delhi police officers did not wish to comment on their claims before the court about people approaching the witnesses. At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured in the 2020 Delhi riots. The clashes started when groups of people -- one supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act and another opposing it -- clashed near the Jafrabad metro station on the evening of February 23. It snowballed into large-scale Hindu-Muslims clashes in parts of northeast Delhi between February 23 and 27. Delhi police have arrested at least 21 people for conspiring to start the riots; 15 have been charged so far. The arrested persons include prominent faces of the anti CAA protests such as former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, and student activists Sharjeel Imam, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, and Safoora Zargar. Police have alleged that those arrested raised funds for and planned the riots, mobilised rioters under the garb of the sit-in anti-CAA protests. The latter have denied the allegations and accused the police of launching a witch hunt against anti-government voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-accused-asked-to-return-copies-of-charge-sheet/story-igZrCfLNamJe0RpwDaUPDK.html

The schools have been asked to constitute task teams, emergency care support, and hygiene inspection squads. The board has instructed schools not to involve students in any cleaning activities for health and safety reasons. The schools must ensure that children do not exchange masks or share food with each other. It has also been directed that school campus should be cleaned every day and a daily record of sanitised areas be maintained. The board has also directed the affiliated schools to reopen in phased manner and in different shifts, following the ‘odd-even formula’. To implement these directions, several schools have come up with videos that were sent to parents so that every child is prepared to wear mask, sanitise hands frequently and maintain adequate physical distance.The authorities of BCM School, Dugri, have come up with two videos which have been shared with the parents. In those videos, students have been asked to be responsible and sensible citizens. In the three-minute video, the students have been given instructions how to wear a mask, maintain 6ft distance from each other, clean hands, cover the mouth while coughing and sneezing, and avoid coming to school if experiencing fever, cold and cough.

10-10-2020||Mumbai||Haze, humidity lead to rise in Mumbai’s pollution levels||The city witnessed hazy conditions with high humidity levels and cloud cover on Saturday, leading to further rise in air pollution level. Some parts of the city recorded light rain, with thundershowers reported along the outskirts of the city. The absence of wind speed did not disperse pollutants leading to poor air quality, said researchers. Pollutant-measuring indicator air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 121 (moderate) on Saturday – the worst since March. It was 118 (moderate) on Friday. An AQI of 111 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Saturday’s AQI was an average of nine locations in the city as the station at Bandra-Kurla Complex has been defunct for over a week. While major locations in the city recorded ‘moderate’ air quality, the highest pollution levels were witnessed at Navi Mumbai (193), followed by Andheri (176) and Mazagaon (166). Colaba and Bhandup had the cleanest air with satisfactory air quality at 71 and 70, respectively. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Humidity levels were at 89% in south Mumbai and 81% in the suburbs. “Owing to high moisture in the air, the city recorded higher pollution levels on Saturday, as pollutant carrying capacity increases when there is more humidity. Also, wind speed is very low characteristic to the withdrawal period of monsoon,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. Meanwhile, the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded 0.2mm and 0.3mm rain between 8.30am and 5.30 pm on Saturday. Thane recorded 5.6mm rainfall. The city and suburbs could expect partly cloudy conditions on Sunday with the possibility of light rain. “The presence of low pressure weather system over Bay of Bengal is activating monsoon currents over central India, leading to thundershowers for the coast and interior Maharashtra,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general western region, India Meteorological Department. AQI through the week Monday -50 (Good) Tuesday- 68 (Satisfactory) Wednesday-78 (Satisfactory) Thursday-97 (Satisfactory) Friday-118 (Moderate) Saturday - 121 (Moderate) Important air quality dates this year •Prior to Friday, last time the city recorded high pollution levels was a week before the first phase of lockdown was implemented. On March 17, the AQI was 272 (poor), on March 18 it was 172 (moderate) and on March 19 it was 130 (moderate)•During the lockdown, the highest recorded AQI was on May 17 at 90 (satisfactory)•Mumbai recorded its cleanest air since the monitoring began on June 30 with an AQI of 12 (good)(Source: SAFAR)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/haze-humidity-cause-surge-in-mumbai-s-pollution-levels/story-GupUIqNdjflIVGbBVX4U5H.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra health minister hints at possibility of ‘unlocking everything’ by November end||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday hinted at the possibility of unlocking everything, including schools, gymnasium and railway services, by November end. He also announced to slash the rate for the RT-PCR tests for coronavirus to bring them down further to Rs 800 from the existing rate of Rs 1,200 to Rs 2,000 within the next eight days. It would be the fourth revision done in the wake of a drop in the rate of test kits and other overhead costs.Tope said that barring a few activities, everything has been opened up by the government under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ and the remaining restrictions will be lifted in phases by November end. “We have allowed bars, restaurants and eateries to operate early this month. The schools are expected to be open after Diwali. Railway services are being allowed this month. Religious places, gymnasiums too will be allowed to open in phased manners. Some of the activities will be allowed by October end and the remaining by November end. I think by November end everything will be opened,” he said.Also read: Republic TV’s CFO doesn’t appear in fake TRP case; police summon CEO, 2 othersMaharashtra government allowed restaurants and bars to open from October 5. The long-distance and intercity trains services within state limits have also been allowed early this month. There is a rising demand for the opening up of the shrines and gymnasiums. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, early this week, clarified that the schools will not open till Diwali and the decision about their opening will be taken by reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state.The state administration is wary of the second wave of the Covid-19 infection, as witnessed in many other countries, if the activities are allowed abruptly. CM Thackeray reiterated his concern during the virtual inauguration of a test lab in Washim on Saturday.The health minister on Saturday, during an inauguration function, said that the rates of the RT-PCR kits have fallen drastically in the recent past and in the wake of it, the rates of the tests too can come down.“We have brought the test rates to Rs 1,200 through two revisions over the last few months. The prices of the kits required for the tests have fallen further and the benefit of it should be passed on to the common people without allowing the private laboratories to profiteer. We will decide in the next 8 days to bring the rates down to Rs 800 per test,” he said.On September 8, the government slashed the rates to Rs 1,200 to Rs 2,000 from earlier rates ranging between Rs 1,900 and Rs 2,500. Initially, the test rates were as high as Rs 4,500 per test. Those were brought down to Rs 2,200 to Rs 2,800 in June; Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,500 in August and Rs 1,200 to Rs 2,000 in September. The private laboratories are allowed to charge more for the collection of the swabs from home. The initial high cost was attributed to a shortage of kits due to limited manufacturing amid lockdown, restrictions on their transportation, among other reasons.The state government recently decided to procure 35 lakh RT-PCR kits along with other material and medicines spending Rs 634 crore. The government has fixed the rate at Rs 78.4 per kit required for the test. Based on the experience, the state government has decided to go for the revision in the test rate.Maharashtra has around 400 testing labs including more than 200 private ones. The tests done by private labs are more than the government laboratories. Further slashing of rates, however, is expected to face resistance from the private sector.“It has been witnessed that the private sector has been indulging into profiteering cashing in on the pandemic situation, be it the prices of masks, tests or PPE kits. The RT-PCR kits cost not more than Rs 200 and adding other overheads, per test cost does not exclude Rs 600 against which they have been allowed to charge up to Rs 2000,” said an official from the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-health-minister-hints-at-possibility-of-unlocking-everything-by-november-end/story-WKJBTZUXPwE48Nt5usaU7K.html
10-10-2020||City||Political parties jump in to support SC community ‘bandh’ call; commuters harassed in Ludhiana||Commuters were stuck in serpentine queues on Saturday as national highways were blocked at different points for over an hour amid the Punjab bandh called by members of the Scheduled Caste (SC) community. They were protesting against the Hathras gangrape in Uttar Pradesh and alleged multi-crore postmatric SC scholarship scam. Different political parties also joined the protest in support of the SC community to gain political mileage. Commuters were left a harried lot as gridlocks were witnessed on National Highway-44 and adjoining roads. The movement of vehicles coming from Chandigarh and Delhi were also disturbed at Samrala Chowk. Heavy traffic was also seen at Transport Nagar Road despite police creating diversions. While Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) staged protests at Samrala Chowk and Jalandhar Bypass Chowk against the SC scholarship scam, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) blocked the National Highway-44 near Green Land School. Social distancing norms went for a toss and many protesters were not even wearing masks.Raj Kumar Atwal, Punjab president, BJP SC Morcha, also participated in the protests. Atwal slammed the state government and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for not taking action against minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot who had allegedly embezzled Rs 64 crore meant for SC post matric scholarship. He added that they will continue agitations against the state government and the public will teach Congress a lesson in the 2022 legislative assembly elections. Simarjeet Singh Bains, president of LIP, said that the party will continue to fight against injustices being faced by the SC community. Meanwhile, commuters said that protests by political parties should not result in harassment for the public.One of the commuters, Arshdeep Singh, said that protests should be staged against injustices, but the public should not be inconvenienced in the process. He added that the government should take strict action against the protesters for blocking roads and not following Covid safety guidelines. Hathras case: SAD leaders join protest against UP govt Ludhiana After the party high command snapped ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over farm bills, leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have now joined a Dalit organisation in its protest against the Uttar Pradesh’s government over the ‘gang-rape’ and murder of a young woman in Hathras. Members of Bhartiya Valmiki Dharam Samaj on Saturday morning staged a protest at the Clock Tower, demanding capital punishment for the culprits during the ‘Punjab Bandh’ call proposed by the organisation. Shops in Chaura Bazar remained closed till afternoon, but rest of the city was open.Vijay Danav, Shiromani Akali Dal leader and head of Bhartiya Valmiki Dharam Samaj, while addressing the protesters, alleged that the Uttar Pradesh government had failed in saving girls and women. The agitation was also attended by former cabinet minister and adviser to former chief minister (CM) Parkash Singh Badal, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, besides Kuldeep Singh Khalsa, former Lok Sabha deputy speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal and Youth Akali Dal district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha, along with other Akali leaders. The protest continued till 2pm. The flow of traffic was disrupted near the protest site, which left the commuters a harried lot. Heavy police force was deployed in the market to avoid any untoward situation. Several other organisations, meanwhile, also staged protests in different areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/political-parties-jump-in-to-support-sc-community-bandh-call-commuters-harassed-in-ludhiana/story-6rcNGaCH5pyWbmBBNpe3FI.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||After encouraging response, evening testing camps to continue in Gurugram throughout winter season||The health department on Saturday said it plans to continue holding evening testing camps for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests throughout October and the ensuing winter season. The department said the decision was taken after observing an encouraging response to such camps, which were held across 10 locations in Gurugram, since October 1. An estimated 800 people have already been tested at these camps over the past 10 days. Dr MP Singh, the health department’s nodal officer for testing and containment zone management, said, “Our evening camps are held every evening for two to three hours. We are seeing a better response than what we have anticipated. Every day, approximately 80 people are coming in and getting walk-in tests done, in a relatively short period of time. About 800 people have been tested so far. Seeing this demand, we will be issuing a revised schedule for such camps every 10 days.” Since October 1, a camp had been set up every day at select locations, such as Laxman Vihar, Rajiv Nagar, Patel Nagar, Khandsa, Sukhrali and Nathupur, all of which were designated as containment zones at the time of these camps. The locations themselves, officials explained, had been selected as they are important transit hubs and public places, drawing heavy public footfall. For example, Gurugram bus stand, Galleria market and the Sheetla Mata Mandir were all earmarked for such camps.A schedule prepared by the health department reveals that, by October 20, evening RT PCR camps will be held for a second time at three locations, including Sahara Mall and Galleria market (under the Chanderlok primary healthcare centre), and Ambience Mall (under the Nathupur primary healthcare centre). New locations include the Tigra-Samaspur crossing in Tigra, Sector 10A and Sector 4 markets in Laxman Vihar, Sector 90 in Bhangrola, Miyawali Colony and Ashok Vihar (Phase 3) in Rajiv Nagar, and Sector 14 market in Sukhrali.“For the moment, we are focusing on increasing testing in areas adjacent to containment zones, so if there is any spread outside the sealed area we will come to know. At places where there is more demand for walk-in tests, like in Galleria market and Ambience Mall, repeat camps will be held. These activities are helpful for people who may want to get tested but also have to go to work during the day,” said Dr Singh. While he did not reveal how many new positive cases have been detected through these evening camps, Singh added that higher positivity rates had been observed among people tested at Galleria Market and Ambience Mall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-encouraging-response-evening-testing-camps-to-continue-in-gurugram-throughout-winter-season/story-sOZdQkZ2UZnwhoybKXOYJL.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Blocked drains the main reason for flooding during rainy season: MCG committee||A committee formed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to find solutions to frequent waterlogging in the city has found that drain blockages are often the reason for flooding during the rainy season, a release issued by the civic body on Saturday stated.A committee comprising MCG officials, councillors, and retired government engineers was formed after severe waterlogging in the city in August which left seven underpasses, low-lying houses, and most of the major stretches of the city inundated.A meeting of the committee was held at the MCG’s office in Sector 34 on Saturday. “The main objective of the formation of the committee was to identify flood-prone areas and prepare a plan for a permanent solution. As a part of this exercise, suggestions have been taken from the citizens of Gurugram, RWA officials, individual experts related to the drainage work. Common suggestions included constructing new rainwater harvesting systems and building drainage lines in places that lacked such facilities,” said Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG.RC Taneja, retired chief engineer, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), and a senior MCG official, attributed the waterlogging in the city to blocked drains. Another senior MCG official, who attended the meeting, said,“Experts are of the opinion that a thorough study should be carried out on the ground for preparing a citywide drainage plan. It was also suggested in the meeting that knowledge of groundwater level is very important before installing rainwater harvesting systems and adequate study also needed to be conducted in this regard. Experts also suggested connecting all drains in the city to one other,” said a senior MCG official, who attended the meeting.Further, a decision was also taken for building more ponds in the city to act as a storage area for rainwater. In this regard, MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma, said that the civic body is looking at developing ponds next to sewerage treatment plants (STPs) to ensure maximum storage of water. As per MCG officials, Kaur directed Sharma to discuss key points discussed in the meeting with experts in greater detail and told all executive engineers to start preparing estimates based on the suggestions received in the meeting.The MCG committee also decided to conduct a meeting, with the drainage committee of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to optimise resources and to find lasting solutions for the issue of waterlogging in the city, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/blocked-drains-the-main-reason-for-flooding-during-rainy-season-mcg-committee/story-qdxtOtqzgzY2oG0jzWnGlM.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Cycle tracks, exchange of revenue roads high on the list of agenda for MCG’s House meeting||Constructing cycle tracks along Golf Course Road (GCR) and Golf Course Extension Road (GCER), exchanging revenue roads for land, and setting up digital libraries across the city are some of the key items on the list of 20 issues that will be discussed in the upcoming House meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Monday.Cycle tracksEarlier, on October 2, the city’s first cycle track was opened between Huda City Centre and Subhash Chowk. The proposal for building similar cycle tracks along GCR and GCER has been mooted by Mahesh Dayma, MCG councillor of Ward 34.MCG officials privy to the matter said that since both GCR and GCER are owned the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) it is unlikely that this exact proposal would be approved by the House but instead, a survey for setting up cycle tracks within MCG’s arterial roads is likely to be approved.“We can only execute engineering changes on cycle tracks on stretches falling within our jurisdiction. At the most, we can approve this proposal within the House and then forward it to GMDA for perusal. Either way, GMDA already has plans for setting up cycle tracks along both the concerned stretches,” said a senior engineering wing official of the MCG.GMDA has the onus of maintaining all the master roads in the city, while the responsibility of maintaining arterial roads, stretches that connect a particular sector or a village, lies with the MCG.GMDA is planning on setting up 650 kilometres of cycle tracks in the city. In the first phase, stretches originating from HCC towards Signature Tower, Iffcco Chowk, Kanhai traffic light, and DLF Phase 1/ DLF Phase 4 crossing will be covered. In the second phase, stretches such as GCR, GCER, MG Road, and Sohna Road would be re-engineered to make way for cycle tracks.Digital libraryMahesh Dayma has also proposed the agenda for building digital public libraries.“In this digital age, there is a paramount need for an advanced technology-enabled public library with all the necessary modern facilities and equipment. Currently, there is no decent library facility in the city. It will not only enhance the quality of life of citizens but also provide them with world-class infrastructure. The library can be built keeping in mind sustainable infrastructure and ecological norms with proper parking facilities and dedicated halls and auditoriums for hosting seminars and conferences,” stated Dayma in his agenda proposal to the MCG. As per MCG’s engineering wing officials privy to the matter,the land for such a project is in the process of being identified.Revenue RoadsAnother agenda proposed for the House meeting is regarding the exchange of revenue roads and giving MCG land of the same value.For example, if MCG has a revenue road of one acre in Sector 50 worth ₹3 crore, then a builder looking to claim the revenue road can offer the MCG 10 acres land in Sector 102 worth ₹3 crore in exchange.The issue of revenue roads is a major one in the city especially in condominiums and townships, where such a road, often surrounded on all sides by a condominium or township, serve no purpose.With the revenue road belonging to the government, a builder can also not fence it or use the vacant stretch for any purpose. Before the city started expanding in the 1980s, revenue roads used to provide connectivity to villages. Over time, village lands were sold to builders for developing townships and condominiums, however, revenue roads could not be touched and development work has to be carried out around it.In its proposal, the MCG town planning branch has highlighted that they have received two such proposals from builders for exchanging lands, one in village Sihi and Harsaru, and the other involving a land exchange in Ghata village and Sector 89.“Adhering to the directions of the MCG commissioner to host House meetings at a new venue each time, the meeting this time will take place at the community centre in Sukhrali. This way, more government buildings will be looked after while officials would also get to witness localised civic problems faced by residents in a particular area,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG.Other agenda in the MCG House meeting include a report on MCG’s policy on street vendors and to explore possibilities of regularising more vendors who may have lost income due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the construction of a community centre in South City 2 and compiling a detailed project report for the drainage situation in sectors 27 and 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cycle-tracks-exchange-of-revenue-roads-high-on-the-list-of-agenda-for-mcg-s-house-meeting/story-4qee4lOTo8pkirjK9OQH6I.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Two brothers drown in Chandu Budhera canal||Two brothers drowned in a canal in Chandu Budhera on Saturday morning, said police. A team of fire department officials and divers took about 40 minutes to recover the bodies. The dead were identified by their first names as 18-year-old Sandeep and 16-year-old Mandeep, both from Masina village in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh. Police said they had been working as masons and stayed on rent on Pataudi road with their family. According to the fire department, the incident was reported to them close to 8am, following which a rescue vehicle was dispatched. “Prima facie, probe has found that the brothers had gone near the canal to relieve themselves. Mandeep went to the canal to fetch water and as he lunged, he slipped into an area that was 15 feet deep. His elder brother jumped in to save him, but he was also swept away by the current,” said Ramzan, assistant fire station officer (AFSO), sector 37 fire station. “Their bodies were found 30 feet away from where they were swept away. The entire operation took about 40 minutes.” Police said the victims were accompanied by two friends, who reported the incident to the police around 7.45 am. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The victims’ family have not alleged any foul play. The victims were rushed to the civil hospital, where doctors declared them dead-on-arrival. The bodies have been handed over to the family after the autopsy.” No case had been registered. Incidents of people drowning in the canal are common with police stating that despite repeated warnings, people continued to go to the canal for swimming, relieving themselves or recreation purposes. Authorities had put up a board displaying the depth of the canal as a warning and police patrolling at night was increased. On July 19, a 24-year-old man, who had gone to the canal for a swim with his friends, had drowned. Last year in June, 2019, a 29-year-old man, who worked at a private company in Kapashera near Delhi-Gurugram border, had drowned in Dhankot. A week prior to that incident, on May 31, 2019, a 16-year-old boy had drowned in the same canal. The boy, a student of class 11, had gone to the canal along with six friends for a swim and his body was recovered after ten hours by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-brothers-drown-in-chandu-budhera-canal/story-eb7DvpyIlBfybT4aAdlKLM.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 tally higher than civic body projection||The number of Covid-19 cases in the city is significantly more than what the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had predicted, indicating a more rapid growth than the authorities had anticipated for the outbreak. The civic body’s projections are crucial since facilities like hospital beds, testing kits and ventilators are scaled up on the basis of these estimates. At present, there are 2.25 lakh cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai. Last month, the civic body had said it expected Mumbai’s Covid tally to reach 191,000 by October 4. However, on that date, the number of Covid-positive cases in Mumbai was 2,13,000. Of late, the city has also seen record numbers of new cases daily. On Wednesday, the city recorded 2,838 new cases of Covid-19, which is the highest daily count so far. BMC’s projection for the number of active cases has also been surpassed. The civic body had said it expected the number of active cases in the city to reach 26, 628 by September 15. The total number of active cases on September 15 was 30, 879. A senior civic official said the projections have helped BMC keep pace with the outbreak. “These prediction numbers kept evolving over multiple iterations, and there are various other models that are combined and aggregated and then the estimations are considered. We have not fallen short of beds. These prediction models keep getting aggregated and refined basis evolving protocols and situations, and have in fact guided us well.”Experts said the prediction models may have failed because of irresponsible human behaviour, like ignoring social distancing norms and not wearing masks. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Apart from Covid-19 being unpredictable, the biology of the virus is not a mathematical model. Human behaviour is a key reason for viral transmission. If citizens act recklessly, don’t follow the rules of social distancing or wear masks, the number of cases is going to increase sharply. Any prediction will fail unless all citizens self-regulate. During the festive season, citizens did not wear masks or follow rules of social distancing, which led to the surge in cases.” Joshi added that many make simple mistakes like removing masks in enclosed places. “I want to advise citizens to not remove masks while speaking, or while they are in the toilet. Avoid removing masks as much as possible,” he said.The BMC started testing for Covid-19 on February 3 and the first case was detected in the city on March 11. The number cases peaked in May for Mumbai but gradually reduced after June. By the end of August, after the festive season, the city saw an increase in cases. Since the second week of September, the caseload for Covid-19 has seen another sharp spike, with over 2,000 new cases being reported daily, on an average. September also saw BMC scaling up its testing capacity by 43% . Daily testing figures went up from 4,000-5,000 in June to up to 15, 000 in September. Of the total 11.15 lakh tests conducted in Mumbai as of September 29, more than 52% (5.80 lakh) of the tests were conducted in August and September. From September 1 to September 29, over 3.41 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in Mumbai. The corresponding figure for August and July was 2.38 lakh and 2.04 lakh respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-tally-higher-than-civic-body-projection/story-KkXghAoeH7UJi3Dy2n2YAL.html
10-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad admin directs private hospitals to treat every Covid-19 patient even if not financially sound||The Ghaziabad district magistrate on Saturday directed private hospital to treat every Covid-19 patient even if the patient is not financially sound. He said industrial area associations have offered to help the administration foot such bills.The administration said it would review cases of those who were financially not in a position to pay the bills and pay it in their stead.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also directed the hospitals to provide a copy of the government order and rate list of paid Covid treatment to patients at the time of admission. On Saturday, the district reviewed its Covid-19 preparations and resolved to intensify their efforts ahead of the festival season. “I have directed the private hospitals to treat every patient even if the patient is not financially sound. We have held discussions with industrial area associations and they have agreed that they will help us foot the bills of such patients. So, the hospitals have been asked to provide treatment to every patient and also give them copy of the government order for price capping and also put up the rate list at their premises as well on their websites so that there is no confusion,” district magistrate Pandey said. The Uttar Pradesh government, in an order issued on July 10, had capped the paid Covid-19 treatment charges in private hospitals in accordance with the recommendation of committee headed by Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog member. The prices were capped according to severity of sickness and depending on whether the hospitals were accredited by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) or not. However, the July 10 order did not specify whether other charges -- such as testing, medicines --- were to be included or excluded from the rate and that created confusion, inviting many complaints of hospitals overcharging patients. To sort out the issues, the govt on September 10 issued a revised order which clarified the inclusion and exclusion of different charges. “The directions given by the district magistrate will be complied with and we have spread the message to every member hospital. He has said that every patient, whether Covid or non-Covid, should be provided with treatment. In case the patient is not financially sound, the hospital will send the bill to the administration which will arrange for finances,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “He has also said that the tests should be done only through the private laboratories which are registered with the office of Ghaziabad chief medical officer.”The district magistrate further added that several directions were also issued for better management of containment zones in order to control spread of infection. “Under the procedure, the respective incident commanders (administration’s executive magistrates) will be provided with police station wise list and they will have to click the pictures while creating a containment zone as well as during the time when the zone is de-sealed. During the sealing time (generally 14 days), the health department will also carry out certain procedures and monitor the containment zones,” Pandey added. The health department officials have been asked to monitor that surveillance teams and the rapid response teams (in case of home isolation) reach the containment zones and distribute medicines and carry out 100% testing as per guidelines. The Indian Council for Medical Research in its advisory on September 4 has advised for 100% testing in containment zones. In an order on October 3, the UP chief secretary RK Tiwari redefined the area of containment zones which have now become much smaller as compared to those defined as per previous directions given in July 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-admin-directs-private-hospitals-to-treat-every-covid-19-patient-even-if-not-financially-sound/story-QKGZqfLLSZ6a77B1TzoJQP.html
10-10-2020||City||Greater Noida: Three men who stole rifle from a security guard arrested||The police on Saturday arrested three suspects and recovered a licenced revolver from their possession. The revolver was snatched by the suspects form a security guard last month in Greater Noida (west). The suspects have been identified as Vishal Singh, 20; Yogendra, 21; and Vikas, 19 — all residents of Roja Yaqubpur village in Bisrakh. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police(DCP), Noida Central, said that the three suspects had snatched the licenced rifle from a security guard on September 20. “The security guard, Ashish Dixit, had recently shifted on a rented accommodation in Roja Yaqubpur village. He used to work at a private company in Greater Noida’s Sector 57. On September 20, the security guard had completed his night shift and was walking back home with the rifle,” he said. When the security guard reached near Plot No 85, the three suspects reached the spot on a motorcycle and accosted him. “They held the security guard at gunpoint and snatched his rifle. The security guard put up a resistance but was pushed on the road. The suspects swiftly rode back on the motorcycle and fled the spot,” he said. Bisrakh Police had registered a case against three suspects under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC). Chander said the police pursued the case and identified the suspects. “On Saturday, the police received information about the movement of the suspects in Greater Noida (west). The police stopped their motorcycle and recovered a countrymade gun from their possession. Based on their interrogation details, the police conducted a search and recovered the stolen rifle from Yogendra’s house.”Chander said that the three suspects had no prior criminal history. “The investigation revealed that Yogendra is fond of weapons. The security guard had shifted in his neighbourhood last month. Yogendra conducted a recce and identified the security guard as a vulnerable victim. He made a plan with two other accomplices and snatched his rifle,” Chander said. The police have seized the licenced rifle, a countrymade gun, a live cartridge and a motorcycle from their possession. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-three-men-who-stole-rifle-from-a-security-guard-arrested/story-C6cETbsiLl9OjFFeCfQ6CK.html

10-10-2020||Noida||Two traders, barely 40 mts apart, robbed at gunpoint at wholesale market in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: A group of four armed men performed two robberies back-to-back at the busy Kirana Mandi wholesale market early Saturday. The police said that they have registered FIRs for robbery and are trying to trace the gang. According to the two victims, the first instance took place when trader Ankit Garg was supervising the loading and unloading activities at his godown. The market is one of the busiest markets in the city, located in the heart of old Ghaziabad. “It was about 6.15am when a car stopped nearby and two men approached me, while two others remained in their car, which was a Swift. They were wearing face masks, which we use to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Soon, they pulled out pistols and pointed them towards me. Then, they started pulling out the gold rings and bracelet which I was wearing. I did not resist. After pulling out the gold items, they asked me if I had any money in my bag which was on the table,” Garg said. He added that the two robbers then checked up the bag and left his godown. Barely 40 metres away, the robbers repeated the incident with another trader, Sumit Gupta. He was also supervising the unloading of goods at his godown when two robbers took him on gunpoint. “I did not resist their attempts. There were several labourers at the godown and none of us tried to resist since the suspects were armed. They took my gold bracelet, boarded their Swift car and fled the spot. Later, a group of traders from the association met the police and raised concerns,” he added.The two traders said that they gave their respective complaints to the police at the Kotwali police station.“There is normally a police patrol present at Kirana Mandi as goods are loaded and unloaded early in the morning. However, there must be some laxity on part of local officials, which is why the incident took place. The senior officials will take a call. However, we have registered FIRs under IPC Section 392 (robbery) and teams are trying to trace the suspects,” said Abhay Kumar Mishra, circle officer (city 1).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-traders-barely-40-mts-apart-robbed-at-gunpoint-at-wholesale-market-in-ghaziabad/story-KpjBTp3xHg4XpUy281BAPJ.html

The move comes after residents filed complaints that their water bill-related issues were not being addressed.“We have decided to send a team of officials to each sector so that grievances of residents can be addressed right there. The motive is that the residents do not need to visit the authority to get their water bill issues resolved,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Greater Noida authority.Singh has directed the additional CEO, Deep Chandar, and water department staff to visit one sector every week and set up a ‘water court’ where residents can come, discuss and resolve their issues.The team of officials will select one sector on a weekly basis and be present at the ‘water court’ from 10am to 12pm. The ‘water court’ may also be organised at the ground floor hall of the authority’s administrative office located in Sector Knowledge Park-IV.Residents, meanwhile, said that apart from the issue of exorbitant water bills, the authority issued bills without delivering quality water to households.“The authority is supplying muddy water and the pipelines have leakages. Despite repeated complaints, the authority staff do not address complaints on time. The authority has no right to collect water charges unless they start supplying water,” said Harendra Bhati, founder member of Active Citizen Team (ACT), a citizens’ collective, and a resident of Sector Beta I.As per official estimates, Greater Noida at present needs 210 million litres water daily (MLD) for its population of around 12 lakh.“The water pressure remains erratic in our sector, and residents have been suffering for a long time. We hope the authority will look into this issue,” said Alok Singh, another founder member of ACT and a resident of Sector Alpha I.GNIDA said it will address all issues related with water supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/water-courts-to-address-billing-issues-to-come-up-in-greater-noida/story-gvLiVmavesk7rKMNjVhyiL.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||Man beaten to death in north Delhi: Sisodia visits family, announces ₹10L compensation||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday visited the family of 19-year-old Rahul Rajput, who was beaten to death on Wednesday — allegedly by the family of a woman he was in a relationship with— and announced an ex gratia of ₹10 lakh.“The Delhi government will work towards speedy justice for the family of the victim. We shall talk to the L-G, the police and engage top lawyers in prosecution to ensure that those found guilty be given strictest punishment,” Sisodia said at their house in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar.“The family is in a poor economic condition. Under directions of the chief minister, I will ensure an immediate financial help of Rs 10 lakh for the family at the earliest.” Rajput’s family on Saturday reiterated that they did not see the crime through a communal lens, even as social media posts painted the murder as one with communal overtones.Several other political leaders from the national capital on Saturday visited the bereaved family’s house in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar, including Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party chief Adesh Gupta.“Whoever visited us to offer us their condolences, we assured them that we don’t believe in seeing a crime from the Hindu-Muslim angle. The religion of the killers do not matter to us,” said Rajput’s uncle Dharampal, who was witness to the crime, and rescued his nephew from the attackers. Rajput succumbed to his injuries at Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital in Jahangirpuri on Thursday.The suspects involved in the killing — two men and three minors, were apprehended on Thursday.Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said the situation in the victim’s neighbourhood, as well as in Jahangirpuri, where the woman lives with her family, has been “normal”. “We have deployed police personnel in both areas. We are just keeping a watch,” Arya said. Dharampal said that while he was satisfied with the police action, he believed there were around 10 attackers. “The police have assured us that if they get to know of any other person’s involvement, they won’t be spared,” he said. Rajput, who tutored school students, while pursuing his Bachelor’s degree from Delhi University, was lured out of his home on Wednesday evening and thrashed by a group of men. Dharampal had rescued him, but he succumbed to internal injuries the next day. The woman’s family was against the relationship, Rajput’s family have claimed in the police statement, and had also allegedly threatened him in the past. Delhi BJP chief Gupta, however, demanded that the Delhi government give the family ₹1 crore as compensation. Gupta also hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress for “appeasement politics”. Gupta said, “Just a week back, AAP and the Congress leaders were doing politics in the name of Dalits in other states and even took out candle marches... Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has not even met the deceased’s family. Even Congress leaders, who can travel 600km just to do politics, have not even visited the family.” Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt hit back and said, “BJP has woken up after two days. Our party member Vinod Aggarwal and others have been with the family since the day the incident came to light and were with them since then. It is unfortunate that the BJP is politicising the incident.” Aam Aadmi Party’s Saurabh Bhardwaj, who was among those who met the family, tweeted, saying the party’s local legislator, Pawan Sharma, had been helping the family from the day of the incident and that he had accompanied the family to the police station to get the FIR registered.BJP leader Kapil Mishra compared the murder with past cases in Delhi that had communal overtones. He also demanded that the chief minister give the family a compensation of Rs1 crore and legal aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-beaten-to-death-in-north-delhi-sisodia-visits-family-announces-10l-compensation/story-iGmMmod6opycBgKPMEggEO.html
10-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: 13 construction sites with no CCTVs and self-audit likely to face penalty as UPPCB deadline ends||Ghaziabad: As the deadline to install CCTV cameras at construction sites and make self-audit for dust control measures ended on Saturday, the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that 13 construction sites in the district have failed to comply with the directions. The UPPCB on September 22 had issued a public notice in accordance with the directions of the state-level air quality monitoring committee, and directed the construction sites to make self-audit of dust control measures and also to install cameras at the sites whose control will be given to the board. The officials said that it is for the first time that such directions have been issued to control dust emission at the construction sites in order to curb air pollution. “Out of 47 major construction sites, about 42 are those which have an area of more than 20,000 square metres, and were asked to install CCTV cameras and complete the self-audit. Of these, we have 13 sites which have not taken up the self-audit procedure or the installation of CCTVs. Starting Monday, we will be taking up inspection and start levying the penalties on per day basis based on the level of pollution index at the site,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The officials warned that such sites may face closure depending upon the scale of violation. They further said that the construction sites of the Delhi-Meerut expressway and the Regional Rapid Transit System have completed their respective self-audit process. “Since the two are linear projects and not concentrated at one site, they were not required to install CCTVs. In phase 2 of the inspection, we will conduct physical checks at the sites which have completed self-audit and also installed the CCTVs,” Sharma said. The developers’ body, on the other hand, said that most of their members have complied with the directions. “Most of our members have taken keen interest and complied with the directions given by UPPCB. Some may not have installed the CCTV since it is for the first time such directions have been issued. But such members have already initiated the process of procuring the CCTVs,” said Gaurav Gupta, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) - Ghaziabad. “Further, our members have also initiated additional measures like green paving of areas near the project. We are proactively taking pollution abatement measures,” he added. Under the UPPCB’s direction for self-audit, the firms taking up construction were required to fill up details related to environmental clearance; status of usage of treated water for dust emission; status of consent to operate for ready mix and hot mix plants; status of dust suppression measures; status of PUC certificates for vehicles used for transportation of material; maintaining adequate stack height for diesel generator (DG) sets and ensuring collection, segregation and disposal of construction and debris waste. The Ghaziabad district is on the list of 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh with high levels of pollution. In 2019, the city topped the list of all cities across the country having high levels of air pollution on several occasions. “We have also identified about 70 industrial units in Ghaziabad which are using wood and coal as fuel. They have been given deadline of October 15 to install CCTV cameras facing their chimneys and give control of the cameras to the UPPCB for real-time monitoring. If they fail to meet the deadline, they will also face penalties,” Sharma added. According to UPPCB records, the city in 2019 had 31 days when the air quality index (AQI) spiked to ‘severe’ category. For another 67 days in 2019, the AQI was recorded under the ‘poor’ category. The officials have warned that the construction sites which fail to comply with air pollution norms after the Graded Response Action Plan is implemented on October 15, are likely to face more stringent penalty which ranges from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore, based on different categories of pollution levels. A similar penalty will be recommended against the erring instances in case of industrial emission, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-13-construction-sites-with-no-cctvs-and-self-audit-likely-to-face-penalty-as-uppcb-deadline-ends/story-sEy6nMnk4v8oMJ2JiJY8cN.html
10-10-2020||Noida||Agency hired to remove 150,000 tonnes of legacy waste dumped at Indirapuram landfill||Two years after Indirapuram residents moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in a bid to stop the dumping of solid waste at the landfill site at Shakti Khand, the Ghaziabad municipal corporation has hired an agency to deal with the dumped waste, estimated to be about 150,000 tonnes.The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) will fund the project that is estimated to cost nearly ₹4 crore“The agency which will start with use bio-remediation technique to process the waste at the site. The GDA has agreed to fund the project and the funds it will be deposited in an escrow account. We expect that the work will begin by October end. Under the project, the waste will be turned to manure,” said MS Tanwar, municipal-commissioner. The process is expected to be completed by April, 2021, he added.Bio-remediation is a process to clean a polluted site and makes use of either naturally occurring or deliberately introduced micro-organisms to consume and break down environmental pollutants.The petition with the NGT was filed by Confederation of trans-Hindon RWAs. It claimed that the site was not complying with the Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016. Futher, burning of garbage here was aggravating poor air quality in the region, it said.. The tribunal had issued directions to the municipal corporation and GDA to ensure that the waste dump site at Indirapuram. During the further course of hearings, the latest on September 2, the tribunal took a strong view of the slow pace of action. “Let meaningful steps be now taken by the statutory authorities expeditiously and compliance report filed by e-mail, failing which there will be no other option except to take action personally against the senior officers on further failure,” the tribunal said. The UP pollution control board (UPPCB) had stated that solid waste had reached height between five to 15 feet at different places. The report had also stated that the dump site was not a scientific landfill and continued dumping may percolate the generated leachate to ground water. The GDA says that had managed to control the dumping of waste at the site.“Dumping at the site has stopped. The GDA will transfer funds for the bio-remediation project to an escrow account. Since corporation is a maintenance agency and can deal better with solid waste, we have decided that they take up the bio-remediation project. The corporation has selected an agency and we have decided to provide funds,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of GDA. The regional officials of the UPPCB officials said that they will be monitoring the progress. “We will continue to contest the case till the waste is cleared. It is a source of unhygienic conditions and causes health issues for residents besides aiding air pollution if there is fire,” said Mohan Sangwan, general secretary of the federation which filed the petition.In other case, with regard to 10 drains, the NGT had ordered a similar bioremediation process under the municipal corporation“We have engaged the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to prepare detailed project report for 10 drains which are directly getting discharged, untreated, into river Hindon,” said Tanwar. The 10 drains were identified as Karhera drain, Hindon Vihar drain, Kaila Bhatta drain, Arthala drain, Sarvodaya Nagar drain, Rahul Vihar drain, Indirapuram drain, Dasna drain, Nandgram Petrol Pump drain and drain at main gate of City Forest area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/agency-hired-to-remove-150-000-tonnes-of-legacy-waste-dumped-at-indirapuram-landfill/story-GSxprdjxOmBucvZEugVEtL.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to construct ‘charkha-shaped’ bridge on Mumbai-Nagpur corridor as tribute to Mahatma Gandhi||As a grand tribute to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, the Maharashtra government has decided to construct a bridge designed in the form of a ‘charkha’ on the 701-km Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg (prosperity corridor), the state’s most ambitious project. The charkha (spinning wheel) had become a symbol of self-reliance during the independence movement.According to officials, the detailed designing of the bridge is completed and the construction work will also resume soon. Being built on a river, the 315-metre bridge will be the entry point to Wardha district — well-known for the Sevagram Ashram — from where the Mahatma led the nation for 12 years until Independence. Gandhi had initiated the Swadeshi movement by taking up the charkha and encouraging fellow citizens to weave their own clothes instead of buying foreign goods.The bridge will have three wheels as a part of its design. The two bigger rings will be 40 metres in diameter, while the smaller one will be 16-metres in diameter. The iconic six-lane bridge, with two service lanes, will also be crossing over the Wardha river.Deep Dey, director of DesignFakt India Pvt Ltd, has designed the bridge. “We picked themes that further India’s vision as a growing superpower. The charkha represents the ‘Make in India’ concept and is also a symbolic identity of Wardha,” he said.The entire 701-km expressway is expected to be functional by May 1, 2022. The ₹55,000-crore expressway will connect 10 districts, 26 talukas and 392 villages between the Mumbai and Nagpur.Radheshyam Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) — the project’s executing body — said, “Apart from being one the most challenging projects, the Samruddhi corridor is also one the most aesthetically-designed projects.”Of the 33 major bridges that are being built along the corridor, five each at Wardha, Buldhana, Nashik, Thane and Nagpur will have iconic designs.However, apart from Wardha, the designs for four other bridges are still under consideration.Among the designs under consideration for the bridge in Buldhana will be the one showcasing a bird representing women empowerment. Nashik, which is known for its rich history, will have a bridge with hands showcasing ‘tarpana’, a Hindu practice of making offerings to God, and in Nagpur, the bridge is likely to be in the form of a tiger to promote the ‘Save the Tiger’ movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-construct-charkha-shaped-bridge-on-mumbai-nagpur-corridor-as-tribute-to-mahatma-gandhi/story-k9haDnjvD4iFJegtPGocBO.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||AAP accuses MCDs of running licence-Raj, BJP says allegations baseless||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) of running “license-Raj”, accusing the civic bodies of continue to issue health trade licenses to restaurant owners despite being asked by the central government to stop doing so. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “The BJP-ruled MCDs do not want to abolish the permit raj, so it wants to continue giving health trade licenses to restaurant owners. The Delhi CM had instructed the MCDs that no such licence will be needed any more but the BJP-ruled MCDs are opposing this direction.”Bhardwaj’s statement came in reaction to a letter purportedly sent by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), a statutory body under the Union health ministry, to the commissioner of the three MCDs. The letter said: “It is informed that with the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, … and Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Rules 2011, the sole authority for issuance of license/registration of food business operators in India vests with the registering authorities/ central or state licensing authorities duly appointed under the provisions of the said Act by the respective commissioner of food safety.” “In view of above legal position, it is requested to immediately look into the matter and ensure that no separate/additional food licenses are issued by your offices and any food business operator who is doing business under your jurisdiction or is planning to start new food business may be directed to obtain the same from FSSAI,” said the letter cited by Bhardwaj.  Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The FSSAI order is being examined by MCDs and very soon the mayors will speak about it as giving health licence involves several issues like hygiene in premises, seating limits and washroom facilities. It is not just limited to food quality, which is the prime concern of FSSAI. AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj’s accusations on MCDs not allowing ease of business are politically biased.” South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh, however, countering the AAP’s allegations said that the latter is playing politics over the issue. “Health licence is crucial to ensure hygiene standards of the premises and safety of visitors. Besides, the whole process of granting licences was online and transparent. Also, the public health department ensures if the establishment is structurally safe or not,” she said. The mayor added that by way of giving licences, it is also ensured that the premises has potable water supply, provision for safe disposal of solid waste, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-accuses-mcds-of-running-licence-raj-bjp-says-allegations-baseless/story-CqydqCwCjNa8vWS2Ch38kO.html
10-10-2020||Noida||Covid-19 impact: 100 industrial units withdraw power connections in Noida||NOIDA: As many as 100 industrial units in Gautam Budh Nagar, affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, withdrew their power connections since April this year, while 150 have opted for reduced power loads, the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the power distribution company of the district, confirmed. According to Virendra Nath Singh, the chief engineer of the PVVNL (Noida division), the 100 industrial units who pulled the plug on their connections have voluntarily done so after clearing their outstanding dues.“Besides, 150 other units have reduced their power load after getting approval from us and applications of many others in this regard have come through. Industrial units, which have permanently disconnected their electric lines, have also mentioned in their applications that they will not kick off production again,” he said.Singh added that out of the 11,010 factories falling under the domain of PVVNL until now, a total of 2,810 units have been closed their electric supply permanently so far.“The prognosis is really alarming. While 340 big industrial units, of altogether 2,497 units, have got their permanent disconnection, another 2,470 of 8,513 medium and small units have opted for permanent power disconnection. Usually, on an average, permanent disconnection is opted for by nearly only 350 industrial units every year,” he said. Sunil Tandon, who ran an automobile factory in Sector 6, said he had no other option than to close operations as the cost of raw material has gone much higher and the orders have become limited, due to the Covid-19 outbreak. “Despite Noida having been declared a ‘no power cut zone’ by the state government, the city sees no respite from regular power tripping. And, since the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has ordered for a ban on diesel generator sets in the National Capital Region, we have no option left other than to pull our shutters down,” he said. Surendra Nahata, the president of MSME association (Noida chapter), also said that frequent power cuts have become a routine affair in Noida. “It is impossible to run factories if diesel gensets are banned. The industries in Gautam Budh Nagar district are on the receiving end. Even if we pay the fixed charges for electricity, we have to face at least three hours’ power cut every day during working hours,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-impact-100-industrial-units-withdraw-power-connections-in-noida/story-YHLJQUQgB1jhtFr7TbSWCP.html

According to Anarock’s research, national capital region cities such as Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad saw a sales of nearly 5,200 units in Q3, an increase of 148% compared to the preceding quarter (Q2 - May, June and July). Compared to the pre-Covid-19 quarter of Q1 2020 (January, February, March), housing sales in NCR have rebounded by nearly 65% in the third quarter.Individually, Gurgaon saw a nearly three-fold jump in housing sales -- from 570 units in Q2 2020 to nearly 1,680 units in Q3 2020.“The massive jump in housing sales signals positive trends for the upcoming festive quarter (October-December) where we expect home sales to rise further. Despite the ongoing pandemic, we are seeing genuine homebuyers make the most of the low home loan rates and the innovative schemes offered by developers, including financial benefits, flexible payment plans, etc,” said Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants.Real estate experts and officials of the registry department feel that many homebuyers, who could not buy a property or failed to execute their property registry due to Covid since March this year to transfer property title to their name, are now rushing to do the same. According to Anarock survey’s in April 2020, NCR comes third nationwide with nearly 15,600 unsold ready homes worth R10,720 crore. This accounts for just 9% of the total unsold inventory of 1.73 lakh units in the region. Experts feel that coming festive season will help the sector to see a revival to some extent.“We are already seeing signs of a revival with sales in the mid-market segment picking up across all metro cities. Pent-up demand of the last six months, reduction in interest rates of home loans, availability of completed units and the ‘work-from-home’ imperative are all expected to contribute to a strong recovery in the second half of 2020,” said Gaurav Kumar, Managing Director, Capital markets and residential business, CBRE India.Meanwhile, the Gautam Budh Nagar stamp and registration department, which carries out property registration, transferring property from a seller’s name to buyer’s name, is also flooded with property buyers wanting to make sale or purchase now.In April, when the Covid-19 restrictions came into effect, no property registry took place, and the state government did not get any revenue out of property sales. The UP government then restarted registry with some restrictions from May 4 and in the same month, it earned a revenue of Rs10 crore. In June, it earned Rs 60 crore, Rs100 crore in July and in August, the revenue rose to Rs110 crore.“From September 1 to October 9, the revenue rose to Rs426 crore. We hope it will further increase manifold in the upcoming festive season from October 17 to 25, when property buyers’ sentiment is at all-time high in the year,” said AK Tripathi assistant inspector general (AIG), stamp and registration department, Gautam Budh Nagar.Small property consultants have also started feeling positivity as the market has started to open up.“As people do not have that much fear as it was initially when the Covid-19 pandemic just broke out, those who want to purchase property, be it flat or plot, are coming to us to inquire or visiting the sites. We are witnessing a positivity among customers unlike earlier, when the market was completely shut due to Covid-19. We are now getting 5-6 customers daily who want to explore options for buying,” said RD Singh, head of Geeta properties, a small property consultant.“We are looking for a flat in Noida during this time because we realised that due to Covid-19, we may get a better deal as compared to pre-Covid situation. Many developers, we heard, are offering flats at lower rates,” said Amit Kumar Chauhan, a prospective buyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-flat-sales-begin-to-pick-up-as-covid-19-restrictions-relaxed/story-4fvnLSmIYd4wQttxInA7tI.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Parents in Mumbai participate in Thali Bajao protest against private schools charging exorbitant fees||Parents from various parts of the country protested against private schools for charging unjust fees from them, during the Covid-19 pandemic. The ‘Thali Bajao’ protest was organised by a city-based NGO Forum for Fairness in Education (FFE) and saw the participation of parents from various parts of the country like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Ghaziabad, Delhi and Gujarat. As part of the protest, parents and children of private schools banged plates from their homes between 7am to 7.05am on Saturday. “Through this protest, we hope that the state and the central government wake up and act against private schools which are not just charging hefty fees during these difficult times, but are also threatening to remove students if their parents protest the fee hikes. We demand that such parents get relief soon,” said Jayant Jain, president, FFE.“Our school has not given any concession in fees even as online education continues for the last six months. On top of that, they have increased the overall fees and when we protested, we were not given any answers,” said the parent of a school in south Mumbai. Parents of several schools in Mumbai had written to the state education department complaining against the indiscriminate fee hikes levied by schools. In September, the department also formed two panels and are now in the process of inspecting these schools. “We are in the process of checking the documents of these schools and if inadequacies are found, action will be taken against the said school,” said an official from the education department. A government resolution released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay High Court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-in-mumbai-participate-in-thali-bajao-protest-against-private-schools-charging-exorbitant-fees/story-M3SLw7GuruierCJ653Qz8L.html
10-10-2020||City||Pandemic has put spotlight on need of mental healthcare: Experts||The Covid-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on mental healthcare as the issue took the centre stage in the past seven months. Covid-induced crisis is taking a toll on the health of people, said psychiatrists on the World Mental Health Day observed globally on Saturday. The day is celebrated on October 10 every year to increase involvement in the matters of mental health, encourage global mental health education and advocate against the social stigma that is often associated with it. This year, to shed light on the alarming rise in mental disorders, the international awareness day will be focusing on ‘Mental Health for All’ and an increased investment in mental health.Experts have highlighted how the past seven months have challenged everyone’s mental well-being, especially healthcare workers who are performing in unprecedented circumstances; students, who are trying to adapt to a new routine with a little contact with teachers and friends, and are anxious about their future; and people already suffering from mental illnesses. The levels of anxiety, fear, isolation and emotional distress have also increased, mental health specialists said. Professor and head of psychiatry department at Ludhiana’s Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) Dr Ranjive Mahajan said, “The number of patients with mental health issues has increased by almost 70% during the pandemic due to rising fears and uncertainty.” The government needs to focus on mental health as presently, only 0.05% of the investment in the national health policy is being directed towards this sector, he added. “Mental healthcare is a human right and should be available to all. All people must have access to quality mental health services, whenever and wherever they need, without any financial distress,” says Dr Rupesh Chaudhary, professor, DMCH’s department of psychiatry. “Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness is as important as any other ailment. A considerable portion should be invested in the provision of affordable mental healthcare services in the community,” he added. Dr Pallavi from Christian Medical College and Hospital said the anxiety, apprehensions, unemployment, social distancing, lack of physical contact with other family members, increasing rate of suicide, drug abuse and depression have become widespread as the world struggles to bring the coronavirus under control. “It is expected that the need for mental health and psychological support will substantially increase in the days to come. Investment in mental health programmes on national and international levels is more urgent now than it has ever been,” she added. A national mental health survey in 2018 had placed the lifetime prevalence rate of mental morbidity at 17.94% and current psychiatric morbidity around 14.42% in Punjab. Mental health is the need of the hour, reiterated Dr Pallavi. Week-long activities at DMCHThe department of psychiatry at DMCH observed ‘World Mental Health Week’ which ended on Saturday. Online yoga sessions and awareness sessions were organised for the healthcare workers of DMCH, Hero DMC Heart Institute (HDHI) and DMCH Cancer Care Centre for their mental well-being.Secretary of DMCH Managing Society, Prem Kumar Gupta, lauded the efforts of the departments of yoga and psychiatry for organising these awareness sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pandemic-has-put-spotlight-on-need-of-mental-healthcare-experts/story-wtWeLE3oDFnUBlC5rzCCBI.html
10-10-2020||City||Chandigarh-Kharar highway project: NHAI to open second stretch of flyover by November 15||With 85% work completed on the much-delayed Chandigarh-Kharar road expansion work, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) says the whole stretch will be opened to the public by end of this year. The project, which entails widening of the road between Balongi and Kharar T-point including construction of two flyovers and three minor bridges, has been hanging fire for the past five years. The total length of the flyovers (divided into three parts) is around 10km.After opening 1-km stretch of the flyover starting from Balongi (called the Balongi flyover) for vehicular traffic recently, now the NHAI will be opening the next stretch over the Kharar bus stand towards Ludhiana by November 15.The ₹368-crore project being executed by Larsen & Toubro was initiated in November 2015 and has missed six deadlines, after initially poised to be completed in three years by December 2018. From delay in land acquisition to other administrative hurdles and mostly recently workforce issues amid the pandemic were the main reasons for the delay.The national highway where the flyover is coming up connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This leaves Kharar as a major bottleneck. About 50,000 vehicles were crossing the stretch on an average before the lockdown. Kharar subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain, who is supervising the project, said the work is going on in full swing and around 85% has been completed. “The other stretch over the Kharar bus stand will be opened by November 15,” he said, while adding that the work picked up pace amid as vehicular traffic got reduced under the flyover during the lockdown.Meanwhile, a senior NHAI official, who did not wish to be named, said the work on stretches near Desumajra and Sunny Enclave in Kharar will also be completed as soon as the work on the Khanpur bridge is over.Villagers block road, demand direct accessResidents of Daun and 25 nearby villages on Saturday blocked both sides of the highway, bringing the work on the elevated road from Balongi to Kharar as well as traffic to a halt. They demanded direct access to the road.Daun sarpanch Ajmer Singh said the village has historical importance, and on every Sunday, a lot of people visit it to pay obeisance at the local gurdwara. “We have not been given a direct access to the elevated road and are forced to travel extra and take a U-turn, causing a lot of inconvenience as well as traffic jams,” he said. The protest that started around 11am lasted for about an hour, and was lifted after the intervention of SDM Himanshu Jain, who assured the residents that he would take up the matter with NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-kharar-highway-project-nhai-to-open-second-stretch-of-flyover-by-november-15/story-ENrL9doX7aTzkSEeBpgUrO.html

10-10-2020||City||DPCC fines Ficci Rs 20 lakh for violation of dust-control norms||New Delhi: The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Saturday fined the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Rs 20 lakh for alleged violation of dust-control norms at its construction site at Tansen Marg. The FICCI administration has been asked to deposit the environmental compensation of Rs 20 lakh within 15 days, a notice issued by DPCC said. “Non-complaince of the above directions will attract penal action as per the Air Act, 1981,” the notice dated October 10 said. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had on Friday inspected the site and found that work was on and no dust-control norms were in place despite previous directions (given on August 14) to FICCI not to restart demolition activities without installing an anti-smog gun. Ficci is demolishing its old building that was ravaged in a fire in April, 2016. The building housed the National Museum of Natural History, which was also gutted in the blaze.“Anti-smog gun, which is mandatory at large-scale projects, has not been installed. All demolished material and debris lay uncovered without sheets. Unpaved surfaces and areas with loose soil have not been sprinkled with water to suppress dust. The site is not fitted with a water-spraying nozzle system. Workers have not been provided with masks to prevent inhalation of dust,” the notice stated. HT contacted Anurag Mankhand, deputy director(media), FICCI, for a response to DPCC’s notice but despite many calls and messages he was not available for a comment. Air quality poorMeanwhile, Delhi’s air quality remained in the ‘poor’ zone on Saturday for the fourth consecutive day. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin, the average air quality index (AQI) was 221, as against 202, the previous day. Government agencies said the air quality may improve to moderate on Sunday, with a likely shift in wind direction. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, said PM 2.5 was the lead pollutant. “AQI is set to improve to moderate on October 11-12. The low pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify and influence the circulations in north and central India. A shift in Delhi surface wind direction, from northwesterly to southeasterly by October 12, is predicted. This could influence air quality positively in the coming week. Stubble burning fires have been observed around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions,” the SAFAR bulletin stated. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), wind direction is likely to change from October 11 to southeasterly, which may help improve air quality over the next two days. “During the period when the winds are transitioning, there could be deterioration in air quality. However, once the winds have settled, it may help improve air quality to ‘moderate’ zone,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dpcc-fines-ficci-rs-20-lakh-for-violation-of-dust-control-norms/story-anyBihoHfEXeVP36dxTNsJ.html

10-10-2020||City||Contempt notice to Cidco for failure to hand over mangrove land to Maharashtra forest department||Environmentalists have issued a contempt notice to planning agency City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco) for failure to hand over mangrove land under its jurisdiction to the Maharashtra forest department. A similar notice was also issued to the state urban development and environment departments to look into why Cidco has failed to hand over the mangrove land.The notice issued to six top Cidco officials, including the vice-chairman and managing director, joint directors and the law officer directs the planning agency to assess the extent of mangrove area and hand it over to the state within seven days or non-compliance would entail civil and criminal contempt proceedings against Cidco under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.Petitioners before the Bombay high court (HC) in various matters pertaining to mangrove and wetland conservation, environment group Vanashakti, issued the legal notice on Friday.“Despite the state mangrove cell repeatedly writing to Cidco to handover mangroves to the forest department, the agency has remained silent on many occasions and this conduct is nothing short of holding themselves above the law. Such high-handedness will be brought up before courts if Cidco again chooses to remain tight-lipped,” said Zaman Ali, counsel for Vanashakti and advocate, HC.The notice cited orders passed by the HC on October 6, 2005, that mangrove areas on government-owned lands, including those belonging to state agencies such as Cidco, needed to be handed over to the forest department within a period of 12 weeks from the declaration of the same as protected forests. HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018.“Years of non-compliance of orders of the HC cannot be condoned,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, and member of a HC appointment committee on preservation of mangroves.He added that non-cooperation from bodies like Cidco was primarily responsible for the delay. “We have time and again reminded the forest department to take custody of mangrove areas but they have not been able to do so due to the non-cooperation from urban development bodies like Cidco. Even the HC-appointed committee had directed almost a year ago to comply with the HC orders. Now we have no option but to seek judicial intervention which we will do.”The notice further alleged that Cidco, appointed as the special planning authority for the Navi Mumbai new town project, had omitted land occupied by mangroves near villages of Kunde, Wahal, and Dapoli in Raigad district in its final development plan (DP).“We have asked Cidco to initiate steps to modify and amend the DP precisely demarcating all mangrove forest lands and follow-up with the transfer of said areas to the forest department,” said Stalin.Priya Ratmabe, public relations officer, Cidco said, “The entire matter is under examination by Cidco. It is being studied by different departments, and we can comment on the matter after due consideration.”Another Cidco official requesting anonymity said, “There has been no study so far to examine the exact mangrove area within our jurisdiction, and neither has there been any decision to undertake such a study yet. However, some mangrove areas have been marked in certain DPs as green zones.”Maharashtra has 15,312.6 hectare (ha) mangroves on government land, declared as reserved forests. However, 13,716.7 ha land has been handed over to the forest department by seven Konkan districts, and the majority of the 1,592.8 ha of remaining mangroves land remains with Raigad district (1,195 ha).In addition to this, approximately 2,000-ha land held by planning authorities such as Mumbai metropolitan regional development authority (MMRDA), Cidco, Maharashtra industrial development corporation (MIDC), Maharashtra housing and area development authority (Mhada), and various municipal corporations have neither been measured nor handed over.On September 18, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had directed all Konkan district collectors and state agencies to transfer mangrove areas under their jurisdiction to the forest department for declaration as reserved forest within two months. So far, the Maharashtra tourism development corporation (MTDC) is the only state agency which will be handing over 500-acre of mangrove area across the Manori-Gorai belt within a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/contempt-notice-to-cidco-for-failure-to-hand-over-mangrove-land-to-maharashtra-forest-department/story-UBV7qqs6PLuOEf4e6CyfLP.html

10-10-2020||Mumbai||Not easily spotted: Yellow-footed buttonquail rescued from Sahar area in Mumbai||The elusive yellow-footed buttonquail, a ground-dwelling bird, was rescued from Sahar area in Andheri on Friday by an animal rescue group. The bird is protected under schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Members of Aasha The Hope for Animals Welfare Trust rescued the bird from near Sahar police station after receiving a distress call from resident Chandrakant Shinde. “We were told the bird fell from a tree or some height and dislocated its right wing. We informed the Mumbai forest department about the rescue,” said Naveen Solanki from the animal welfare group. “Since this bird is elusive and is not familiar with a human touch, it will need some time to get adjusted to our presence following which we will take it to the veterinary doctor for a detailed health examination.”Solanki added the bird was approximately 4-5 inches in length. “The forest department has been informed about the rescue,” he said. According to experts, the bird is generally spotted across grasslands and buffer areas of forests. “It is not rare for Mumbai but it is spotted very less due to its ability to camouflage easily as it is ground-dwelling. However, it is very much present in and around Sanjay Gandhi National Park,” said Girish Jathar, assistant director (climate change and Himalaya program), Bombay Natural History Society. “An interesting fact about this bird is females are brightly coloured and can be distinguished from males as the latter have a rufous neck collar on the throat. At the same time, males incubate the egg of the bird and not the female as opposed to other birds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-easily-spotted-yellow-footed-buttonquail-rescued-from-sahar-area-in-mumbai/story-E7uvWGNwX3pVkd3UWQtC1K.html

Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal appealed to the farmer outfits, which have been protesting against the three new contentious agriculture laws, to ease their agitation to allow movement of goods trains. “If (goods) train services do not resume, I fear there can be power cuts and maybe total power shutdown in the state,” Badal told reporters. With no movement of goods trains because of the ‘rail-roko’ agitation for an indefinite period, the coal supply in thermal power plants has reached a critical stage. “We are now left with two days of coal,” Punjab State Power Corporation Limited chairperson and managing director Venuprasad said. According to officials, Lehra Mohabbat, Ropar thermal and GVK thermal power plants are already shut. Two other power plants — Talwandi Sabo and Nabha — are running at half of their total power generation capacity. Some of the areas in the state have already been facing power cuts due to less electricity generation. The state is procuring 6,500MW of power from other sources, including private ones, as against the demand for more than 7,000MW. Different farmers’ bodies have been protesting against the new farm legislations. They had stepped up their agitation by resorting to rail blockades for an indefinite period from October 1. Farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee have been squatting on the rail tracks in Amritsar and Ferozepur since September 24. Meanwhile, several farmer organisations held a meeting in Barnala on Saturday to discuss chief minister Amarinder Singh’s appeal for relaxing their ‘rail-roko’ agitation. However, it concluded without any decision as representatives of some farmers’ bodies could not make it to the meeting. In their October 7 meeting, farmer leaders did not pay heed to Singh’s appeal for allowing goods trains. While appealing to farmers, the chief minister had said that the state government needed to urgently transport foodgrain, coal, fertiliser and petroleum on priority, besides lifting the paddy grain from the wholesale markets. He had also noted that the state’s coal stocks were critical and if not replenished soon, there would be severe power shortages, which would hamper the wheat sowing operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/left-with-2-days-coal-punjab-stares-at-severe-power-outages/story-uo8CbQpZHday5mMJHJGHHM.html

The administration in its budget for 2021-2022 that was presented to the BEST committee on Saturday stated that it plans to increase and maintain the fleet of its buses to 6,337 by March 2022.National common mobility card as a pilot project for BEST buses along with passenger information system at 800 bus stops and terminals will also be introduced.The BEST administration showed a budget deficit of ₹1,887.83 crore of which ₹1624.24 crore is from its transport department and ₹263.59 crore from the electricity department.An outlay of ₹446.07 crore has been proposed as the expenditure for 2021-2022.Presently, the BEST has a fleet of 3,857 buses by October inclusive of 1,099 buses are on wet lease. Under the wet-lease model, BEST does not own the buses but get them from contractors for a fixed per kilometre rate.The administration will also procure 900 buses, of which 300 will be electric and 600 will be single-decker buses.The fleet of 3,337 buses that are owned by BEST will also be maintained by the organisation by procuring replacement of the buses that are scrapped and getting 3,000 buses on wet lease.“The buses that will be added to the fleet will be a mixture of buses procured by the administration and buses on wet lease. Finalisation of air-conditioned (AC), mini or midi buses will be done in the later stage,” said Surendrakumar Bagde, general manager, BEST.The organisation has also proposed implementation of the national common mobility card for its buses. The testing of the card and inspection of requirements is ongoing at Wadala and Colaba BEST bus depots. The testing began in October.“The initial testing and setting up of infrastructure for the implementation of the common mobility card has started. Only after discussions with other organisations including MMRDA, the implementation will begin,” said a senior BEST official.The passenger information system that will display the expected time of arrival of buses and information regarding the bus routes, will be placed at 800 locations in the city.The passenger information system is a part of the organisation’s Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS) and will be installed on bus terminals and bus stops.“BEST has always been a neglected mode of transport for the longest time. It is welcoming to see that improvements are being done and long-term planning in being undertaken. New buses, passenger information system and common mobility card will help the organisation to grow, and the citizens as well. Every public transport in the world is bound to make losses. Just due to losses the improvements should not be stopped, the parent organisation Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) or the state government should compensate,” said transport expert, AV Shenoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/best-to-add-new-buses-plans-common-mobility-card-passenger-information-system-in-mumbai/story-K03cVW1YkSJfRmW4il1krI.html

The dead persons included the owner of the building, Satish Chawla,60, and Devender (single name), a 40-year-old hired to clean the tank. The man who was hospitalised and survived was identified by his first name Manoj. He is a contractor whom Chawla had hired to clean the tank. Devender worked for Manoj, the police said. Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said a case under section 304 A (causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at the Badarpur police station. “The case has been registered against the building owner, who is among the two dead persons,” Meena said. DCP Meena said the police received a call at 4.45 pm, saying three persons had fallen into the septic tank of a building at F-block in Molarband. A team from the Badarpur police station reached there and found that one person, Manoj, has been rescued from the tank and admitted to a nearby hospital. “Rescue teams from the fire department arrived and two more persons – Devender and Satish Chawla – were taken out from the tank and rushed to a private hospital where they were declared brought dead,” the DCP said. During preliminary enquiry, Meena said, it was learnt that Chawla owned the building that has 18 rooms occupied by his tenants. The septic tank is in the basement of the building. Chawla lived in a nearby building and ran a grocery shop. Chawla wanted to get the septic tank cleaned and had given the contract to Manoj. “On Saturday afternoon, Manoj and Devender came to clean the tank. When Devender went inside the tank, he fell unconscious. Manoj went inside and fell unconscious. Chawla went in to save them but he too lost consciousness. Some locals managed to pull Manoj out and rushed him to a hospital,” the DCP said. Initial probe showed the persons entered the tank without any safety gear. “Prime facie, it appears they inhaled toxic fumes and collapsed in the tank,” a police officer associated with the probe said, requesting anonymity. In May last year, two labourers died and three others were hospitalised while cleaning a septic tank without safety gear at a under-construction building in outer Delhi’s Prem Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-die-after-inhaling-toxic-fumes-from-septic-tank-in-delhi-s-badarpur/story-cZZO5WqobWIHlBfkyGDtcJ.html

The injured policemen, however, managed to hold on to the suspect, Rajeev, who too ended up with injuries in the rescue bid, said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north). Rajeev turned out not only to be involved in drug deals, he was also wanted for an armed robbery with a commuter in Karol Bagh in February earlier this year, the officer said. Police said that they were working on a tip-off that Rajeev could be found in his house in Andha Mughal neighbourhood of Gulabi Bagh. “When we reached the neighbourhood, we found him sitting on a cot outside his house. When we tried to catch him, he pulled out a pistol and fired at us,” said Alphonse. The bullet missed its mark and the police were able to overpower him before he could fire the next round, the officer said. “It was then that his relatives and neighbours began pelting bricks, stones and glasses at us. Some of them even threw chilli powder at the policemen, temporarily blinding them,” the DCP said. Two assistant sub-inspectors, a head constable and a constable were injured in the attack and their car was allegedly vandalised. But the injured policemen continued to hold on to Rajeev until reinforcement arrived. Police said they were working to identify the individuals involved in the attack on the policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-of-alleged-peddler-attacks-police-four-cops-injured/story-6KkZW7yJQZUUmsIJJGL1fM.html
10-10-2020||Bhopal||‘Women from Bangladesh trafficked, pushed into sex trade and drug peddling’: MP Police||More than 500 women from Bangladesh were brought to India illegally and forced into sex racket and drug peddling by racketeers in the past few years, the police claimed on Saturday, after the arrest of 20 people in the past fortnight. Most of the girls were taken to Mumbai and Gujarat where they were drugged and pushed into prostitution, the police said. “After the arrest of 20 people, including two agents from Surat, under section 370 (trafficking) of the Indian Penal Code and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, the police found that some agents, who were working at the Indo-Bangladesh border, used to identify young women from underprivileged families in Bangladesh to bring them to India on the pretext of providing jobs. Later, they used to give the women to certain people in Mumbai and Surat who pushed them into prostitution and drug peddling,” said HN Mishra, deputy inspector general of police, Indore. He said these people used to drug the women and also used them to supply MDMA - a drug used for recreational purpose - to different people. Also read: Hathras gang rape case to be probed by CBI, Centre issues notification“In Indore, most women were brought from Mumbai and Surat by traffickers Sagar Jain and Dharmendra Jain who also used to supply drugs. They are absconding and the police are trying to nab them. The police arrested two agents Aruz Sayeed, 32, and Titu Gazi Bengali, 34, from Surat on Thursday. The police are interrogating them to know more about Babu Bhai whose name was taken by many girls. As of now, they informed that they brought more than 500 girls from Bangladesh to India,” said the DIG. As of now, Indore police freed 19 girls including 12 from Bangladesh. A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to investigate the matter. Vijay Nagar police station in-charge Tehzeeb Qazi, who is a member of the SIT, said, “On September 21, two girls from Mumbai lodged a complaint at Vijay Nagar police station that they were brought from Mumbai to Indore for a modelling event a month ago but they were held hostage in a flat and forced into sex racket. They, somehow, managed to flee from the flat but there are six more girls who are still trapped in the flat.” “The police raided the flat and rescued six girls and arrested five people from the flat including two women. During the interrogation, one of the accused informed the police about two other places where women were kept hostage for a long time. The police raided a guest house and a hotel and rescued 13 women and arrested 10 people,” said Qazi. “The women informed the police that a man known as Babu Bhai brought them to Mumbai from Bangladesh in the past few years on the pretext of providing job. He also gave Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh to the family members of every woman. Later, they were forced into prostitution by some other people. The agents in Mumbai beat them up for opposing prostitution. As most of them are uneducated and brought illegally without a passport, they can’t go back to their homes in Bangladesh,” the officer said. “The women and the accused told the police that the women, especially those who used to oppose to work, were drugged many times. These girls were also used to supply MDMA drugs to customers on direction of Sagar Jain,” Qazi said. On Friday, the police arrested Sagar Jain’s driver with drugs. The police also arrested Deepak Vaishnav and Govardhan Purohit, residents of Indore, and have recovered fake Aadhaar cards of these women from them.Mishra said, “It is an organised racket mainly operating in metro cities and some cities of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. A large number of people are still on run. We are trying to identify them with Babu Bhai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/women-from-bangladesh-trafficked-pushed-into-sex-trade-and-drug-peddling-mp-police/story-m6jU5ACkEdhi7BrfnQK7VK.html
10-10-2020||City||Need to check restaurants serving unhygienic food||Hauling up restaurants that serve bad food has become a little easier for consumers.Even though the onus of proving that the restaurant served unsafe food is on the consumer, the apex consumer court has said that an affidavit from the consumer would suffice and there is no need for a laboratory test of the food, in order to claim compensation before the consumer courts.While upholding the award of damages to a consumer, who had suffered food poisoning on account of stale food served at Yum Restaurants, Manipal, Karnataka, Justice V.K.Jain, Presiding Member, in an oral order agreed with the restaurant that the initial onus of proving that the food served was defective, would be on the complainant.. “However, the burden of proof so placed upon the customer cannot be so high that an ordinary customer visiting a restaurant is unable to discharge the same. In my opinion, if a customer files an affidavit in the consumer complaint instituted by him stating therein that the food served to him was rotten/stale/inferior in quality, such an affidavit will be sufficient to discharge the initial onus placed upon the customer, unless it is shown that the complaint is motivated or was actuated by extraneous considerations,” Justice Jain said.Describing the practical difficulties faced by a consumer in taking out a sample of such food and getting it tested in a laboratory, Justice Jain said such a requirement, therefore, would be “impractical, inconvenient and a costly exercise” and would force a consumer to give up the fight for his right.In this case, the complainant had given an affidavit about the stale food served to him on December 23, 2014 and also a letter from a doctor who had certified that he suffered food poisoning and was under his treatment for a few days. That was sufficient evidence, the Commission held, thereby clearly defining the burden of proof or the evidence required to be presented by consumers in such cases (Yum Restaurants(India) Pvt Ltd Vs Kishan Hegde, RP No 156 of 2020)Today, modern technology, particularly the mobile phone and the social media, has empowered consumers enormously. They can take pictures of the food, record conversations with the restaurant owner on the poor quality and present them as evidence. They can also put out the information in the public domain. A video of a dead lizard in the sambar served at Saravana Bhavan in Connaught Place, New Delhi, that went viral in the first week of August, is an example.However, such visual evidence of unsafe or poor quality food is not always possible, particularly where the food is stale or is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. In such cases, the only evidence is the laboratory testing of the food or the proof of ill health suffered by the consumer following consumption of such food. In fact in many cases, the consumer may realize that the food was hazardous, only after suffering its ill effects. So in all such cases, the apex consumer court’s ruling will help.Today, despite a modern food safety law , a large number of restaurants around the country prepare and store food in highly unhygienic conditions, putting at risk, the health and safety of consumers. In June last year, for example, the Food and Drug Administration in Maharashtra checked 10 randomly selected upscale restaurants in Lonavla and found most of them preparing food in extremely unhygienic conditions and using raw materials well post their shelf life, in clear violation of the food safety law. Results of such special drives and consumer complaints only draw attention to the need for more stringent implementation of the Food Safety and Standards Act. Last year, Gujarat had introduced the concept of open kitchens to bring transparency in the cooking process. I do not know the extent of implementation there, but that’s certainly a concept that needs to be incorporated in the food safety law and enforced strictly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-to-check-restaurants-serving-unhygienic-food/story-Mgm5bIA3MTGw4TTBl3vEJM.html
10-10-2020||Election:||‘Win against boss’: Ex-constable in Bihar gets lucky with BJP ticket on seat eyed by former DGP||A former constable of Bihar Police turned luckier in the battle of ballots of Bihar over a former DGP whose bid to test the political waters failed for the second time. Constable Parshuram Chaturvedi took voluntary retirement from service (VRS) like former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey. Both eyed the same Buxar seat. Chaturvedi, perhaps, never thought he would win the race against his ‘boss’ despite his patient wait for years but destiny favoured him this time. In the seat-sharing formula, the seat went to the BJP, ending Pandey’s prospects who had joined the JD-U soon after his resignation. Son of four-term Congress MLA Jagat Lal Chaturvedi, the BJP gave the ticket to Chaturvedi. He is said to be the choice of Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey who happens to be the local MP. Chaturvedi, a native of Mahda village under Muffasil police station area, is member of BJP’s farmer cell. He quit the police job in 2008 from Bihar CID department and joined politics. He said that he was also associated with the JP students’ movement in 1977. Also read: Gandhis, Shatrughan Sinha among Cong’s star campaigners for phase 1 of Bihar pollsIt is not just Chaturvedi. Another retired DG (home guards) Sunil Kumar, who had lost the race to Pandey for the post of DGP, also got lucky to get a JD(U) ticket from Bhore. This was the second time Pandey fumbled in his attempt to enter the electoral politics. He had resigned five years ago to contest the election but he did not succeed. He requested for the withdrawal of his resignation, which was accepted. In the last four months, Pandey made headlines for his pro-active approach in the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case and his sudden resignation had sparked speculations that he could contest the election. It got further strengthened when he joined the JD(U). Pandey later took to social media and posted about his major decision. He posted, “I can feel that my well-wishers are upset. I also understand their concern and problems. After my retirement, everyone expected that I will contest the election but this time I am not contesting the assembly elections.” “It is true that I had taken VRS to contest polls. Lekin samikaran nahi bana (calculations did not work out). I am a loyal soldier of the JD(U). If the JD(U) and the BJP want me to campaign in this election, I will do so,” he said. The former DGP also defended his stand in the Sushant case. “I have no regrets about the stand I took in the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/win-against-boss-ex-constable-in-bihar-gets-lucky-with-bjp-ticket-on-seat-eyed-by-former-dgp/story-gzBIVx3UvNb0ertkJqMOpL.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Portrait of a village in Punjab before the sundown of Partition||Deep in the dry and sandy stretches of the Malwa region, in pre-Partition Punjab, lies the sprawling village of Sahnewal; its skyline a mixture of high havelis and humble mud houses surrounded by acres of green fields and groves of dark, thorny keekar and neem — thus opens the novel Dusk over the Mustard Fields with a finely drawn portrait of a village in Punjab. One can well take this as a period novel as it begins in the 1920s and culminates in the bloodshed and exodus at the time of Partition, but it transcends the periodicity. Its strength lies in traversing the times and evaluating what is lost and what has not changed much in some 100 years. A mosque and a gurdwara flourish in the village where Hindus and Muslims live in a workable arrangement and lamps are lit in every household, with people joining in Diwali as well as Eid festivities. In a village where all the major landholdings are with the Sikh and Muslim Jats, the businesses with Hindus and the majority of the workers and artisans are Muslims, the tallest haveli belongs to Zaildar Kehar Singh. The adjacent ones belong to the village moneylender Lala Beli Shah and the horse breeder Mian Ali Begh. The Zaildar has two daughters and the older one, Nimmo, the protagonist, cannot go to school because it is five miles away from the village. But she grows up happily learning Gurmukhi, numbers and Urdu at the primer level. Her skills are weaving, embroidery and cooking like the other girls of the village. The family prestige and the promise of a good dowry bring her the match of a handsome officer of the British Indian Army. She is 16 and on the eve of the marriage she feels excited, having relegated a shared crush for Akhtar, son of Mian Ali next doors to a childhood fancy. She wonders what her husband, Hukam Singh, will be like: Does he drink too much? Will he beat her if she makes a mistake? She prays that he should not be too foul tempered and is determined to do all that she can to please him. However, all her determination fails when confronted with the fair and handsome Lieutenant; from her dusky skin to her rusticity, her inability to speak English, dress in style and be an asset at the garden parties and lunches organised by the commanding officer’s wife, Mrs Gillespie. Nimmo is no memsahib and, worse, fails to conceive a child in two years. She is rejected in favour of the educated and beautiful Hansa. Left in the village home she falls prey to the sexual assaults of her husband’s stepbrother. Ironically, Hansa nearly loses out to Nimmo when the latter conceives only to give birth to a daughter who is then abandoned by the husband’s family as well as her own. The humane and heartwarming part of the story is the friendship that grows between the two wives. It is Hansa who tells Hukam Singh in the face that infertility is not her problem but his and takes the decision to adopt Nimmo’s abandoned daughter. And what becomes of Nimmo as she wanders in the dark wanting to take a last look at her parental home in Sahnewal – a place famed for being actor Dharmendra’s village, where he grew up as his father was the school headmaster, at a time when the riots preceding Partition and massive exodus from both sides had begun. In the story, Mian Ali’s family is escaping to Lahore in the dark of the night and Akhtar recognises Nimmo’s silhouette and asks her to accompany them. The healing touch comes when she shares everything and he takes her hand in his: Akhtar and Nimmo are married in a simple ceremony and the girl from Sahnewal, daughter of Zaildar Kehar Singh and wife of Major Hukam Singh of Raipur is reborn as Naaima Begum, her past belonging to another era and another country, torn asunder by ruthless destiny. The saga ends on a note of hope. Not only does Ranjit tell the tale well, she also sets the mood for a forgotten era in colonial Punjab. “This I owe to my parents. My father, Lt Col Daljeet Singh, who recreated the ethos of the British Indian Army for me and my mother who belonged to Sahnewal in acquainting me with the rural culture along with its pride and prejudice and the lives of women.” Ranjit’s paternal village is Mithapur and she lives in Chandigarh as she says with her dog Teddy. Travelling is her passion. She also runs a non-profit organisation for education and psychological counselling. Having finished this book in one reading through the night, one awaits Ranjit’s next novel. nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-portrait-of-a-village-in-punjab-before-sundown/story-EnwlOcST1Gl3qCzGqzEVkK.html

While addressing the gathering, she termed the recently passed agrarian bills as “black laws” and demanded that they be rolled back immediately.“We are against these black laws and compel the BJP government to roll them back like we did in the case of land acquisition bill under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. It will happen this time as well because the entire farming community is against these laws,” she said.She also recalled that the Swaminathan committee report had recommended fixing MSP at one-and-a-half times the cost of production.“We felt happy when the Modi government promised to double it, but nothing has happened so far. On the contrary, farmers are in distress,” she added.Patil also took a jibe at the UP government for its alleged inaction over the Hathras gangrape and murder case.Demanding the restoration of J&K statehood, Patil said, “I have never heard of a state being converted into a UT before. However, UTs do get converted into states. I oppose the BJP government’s move of turning J&K into a UT unconstitutionally and unilaterally. It was a Dogra state. We want that statehood to be restored at the earliest,” she said.She also pressed upon the rising unemployment among the youth in J&K and continued suspension of 4G internet services in the UT.However, Congress being a divided house in its backyard, Patil minced no words and said, “If we get united, we will win. Congress gets defeated by Congress itself. If we get united, we will become invincible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modi-govt-must-roll-back-farm-laws-restore-statehood-to-j-k-aicc-in-charge-rajani-patil/story-G0ca70VBJRQCKYdPArx8kJ.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Where angels don’t fear to tread||Angels of the free air made best use of a historic moment. As VIPs, scientists and mediapersons waited patiently for eight critically-endangered vultures to take freedom’s flight from their aviary and sample a fresh goat carcass placed outside the open door near Pinjore on Thursday, a bevy of butterflies descended on the glistening meat. They were accompanied by black, crawling insects. Neither the vultures in the aviary or the wild ones circling overhead came down to the mutton due to the heavy human presence, so Common Mormon butterflies had a field day picking salts and minerals from mutton, some of which will be passed to females to facilitate reproduction.Butterflies indulge in mud-puddling – the generic term for salt/mineral collection – at what may seem to the human eye as the oddest of locales. Some butterflies pick nutrients from dead, rotting snakes. Others alight on sweaty socks of scientists engaged in field work and no doubt find a larder of exited salts to forage upon. Elephant dung is a favoured spot.Besides nuptial chores relating to sodium and salts collection, butterflies nurture a weakness for sweet, sugary liquids and fermenting fruits. This writer has experienced an Anomalous Nawab butterfly merrily sip beer from a glass in the outdoors due to its sugar content. But what takes the cake is “rum pudding”. Pioneering vulture scientist and keen naturalist Dr Vibhu Prakash recounts that one of the best baits for virtually all the butterflies prevalent in the area is to place rotten bananas fermented with rum for 24 hours in the open! Yummy! SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND Gliding squirrels constitute an obscure group of mammals dwelling in the towering canopy and stealing out of tree hollows at night. Most photographs of these endearing creatures, which can achieve Batman-like nocturnal glides of 180 to 200 m between tree tops by opening their skin flaps, are of them still on branches and framed in a flashlight beam. An exceptional photograph of an Indian Giant Gliding squirrel captured in aerial locomotion that bestows them their common names was not by a wildlife scientist but by a software quality control techie from Surat, Gujarat, Keyur Chaudhari, who took departure from popular day safaris and ventured into forests draped in the velvet of the night. The challenge of securing such a photograph was underscored by squirrel scientist and field researcher, assistant professor Murali Krishna Chatakonda, who told this writer: “To get a picture of a squirrel actually gliding, one has to be in a forest with an open canopy. It takes just a few seconds for the squirrel to glide from one tree to another. So, in that limited window, a photographer with quality equipment and patience will have to spend the night for a good picture. Squirrels glide from one tree to another for feeding, when males clash for territory, breeding season, to avoid predators, energy saving etc.”Chaudhari’s picture of a squirrel at the Ratanmahal sanctuary, Gujarat, transiting between Mahua tree tops 50 feet apart drew praise from Chatakonda, who described it as an “amazing capture”. The picture resulted from a familial collaboration between Chaudhari and his father, Arvindbhai, who assisted by beaming a flashlight on squirrels gliding. The glide is a crowning moment of the mysterious night but lost in the din of humanity’s snores and narcissistic dreams. Thanks to an intrepid photographer, it now winks like a star and sparkles like a rare diamond in the expansive museum of natural history, curated online as a treasure trove of digitised wildlife images enjoying an ease of public access. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-where-angels-don-t-fear-to-tread/story-UfsxNlUbIiNi8E1OtTTfuN.html

He tosses it at Lollita with the adroitness of a referee spinning a toss.“It’s the Boss!”He bleats like a little lamb at Lollita, contorting his countenance into imploring histrionics that broadly translate into bestowing upon her a new job profile – Multitasking as Lamba ji’s PA (Pandemic’s Assistant) while juggling her own #WorkFromHome and #WorkOfHome.It’s the same beseeching look a deer is wont to wear, were a wolf to come calling for dinner in the middle of conferencing by the deer with many a peer.“Honey, please cook up some excuse. Say I’m attending an earth-shaking Webinar ...”Lollita goggles glacially at Lamba ji. The only earth he seems to be shaking is the one beneath his armchair every time he joyously jounces with or without slipper while watching Ravi Bishnoi’s chutki flipper.“Er... Can he call back later? He’s attending a global webinar of regional ‘heads’!” Lollita fobs off Lamba ji’s boss, her trite tone tapering off with tad emphasis on the last word.Truth be told, Lamba ji is gainfully employed (alas, for her, painfully employed) in putting “heads” together on a Zoom call with cricketing cronies for foretelling the fate of “regional” teams battling it out on a “global” turf – IPL 2020.

The doctored screenshots were first shared on the night of October 3,” said the complaint.Based on the complaint, a case was registered against the user of the account under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Copyright Act, the police said.According to the police, it was found that the account was being used to circulate fake news aimed at misdirecting and confusing public. “A probe in the matter is underway.

A departmental enquiry would be conducted against them. “The investigation of this case is being done by the circle office, Hindaun. A special team from Jaipur will also come which will work in coordination with the district team to arrest the remaining accused,” Kachawa said.Hundreds of villagers, senior BJP leaders and members of various social outfits reached Bukna village on Saturday morning and launched a protest.Earlier, the family members were demanding compensation, government job for a family member and action against the policemen of Sapotra police station. “We are demanding Rs 50 lakh compensation, security for the family members, government job for one of the family members and the entire Sapotara police station staff to be transferred,” one of the family members said before the government announced the compensation.“Where is the government? The deceased has six daughters and the government is not answering,” he said. “How will the family survive without the help of the government? We will not cremate the body unless our demands are fulfilled and the rest four absconding accused are arrested.”Governor Kalraj Mishra called chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday morning over law and order situation of the state in special reference to the alleged killing of the temple priest in Karauli and rape of a minor girl in Barmer, according to a release from the Raj Bhavan. The governor expressed concern over these incidents. The CM told the governor that the state government had taken cognizance of all these incidents and Rajasthan police were investigating them. “We will not spare any culprit. All incidents will be investigated fairly,” the CM said. Gehlot said he was keeping tabs on the law and order situation in the state and had instructed officials to take necessary action. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena and the Karauli-Dholpur Lok Sabha MP Manoj Rajoriya also reached Bukna village of Sapotara town on Saturday morning where they are protesting along with the deceased’s family members and villagers.Meena had warned the government that if the demands of the family members are not met then they will reach Civil Lines with the body and launch a protest.A three-member fact-finding committee, comprising Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, national secretary Alka Gurjar and former general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha Jitendra Meena, also reached Sapotara town.On Wednesday, accused Kailash Meena and others from his family allegedly set the priest’s hut on fire since he had been trying to prevent encroachment on temple land. The injured priest was taken to the district hospital from where doctors sent him to Jaipur. Vaishnav was admitted to SMS Hospital in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries late on Thursday evening.On Friday, the alleged killing escalated into a political row. State BJP president Satish Poonia said he had formed a 3-member committee for finding facts of the case.Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje said in a tweet that the killing of the temple priest could not be condemned enough. “We cannot express enough grief over it,” she said.After facing political attack, Gehlot wrote on Twitter, “The murder of Babulal Vaishnav in Sapotara, Karauli, is extremely unfortunate and condemnable; civil society has no place for such acts. The state government is with the bereaved family in this sad time. The main accused has been arrested and action continues. The culprits shall not be spared.” Congress party’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi said, “I have spoken to the DGP; the family will be provided security and their demands will be discussed.” He said he would write a letter to the chief minister to demand strict action against land encroachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/burning-of-karauli-priest-family-villagers-end-protest-after-govt-assures-rs-10-lakh-compensation/story-0pXUFoKZPaz8VkiM9Bm35M.html
10-10-2020||Bhopal||MP woman kills herself, family alleges police refused to register her complaint||A woman killed herself after police allegedly refused to register her complaint regarding a stolen tractor in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh, alleged family members.The victim was a resident of village Bara of Sagar district and killed herself on Friday evening by consuming poison. She was rushed to the community health centre and was later referred to Sagar district hospital where she died during treatment on late Friday night, said police.The woman’s family members staged a protest and blocked the road by putting the body of the woman in Banda area of Sagar district on Saturday demanding action against Banda police station in-charge Prashant Singh. Later, Sagar superintendent of police Atul Singh reached the spot and cleared the traffic after assuring the family of conducting an inquiry in the matter. The SP also removed Prashant Singh from Banada police station and shifted him to the police lines. Also read: Gandhis, Shatrughan Sinha among Cong’s star campaigners for phase 1 of Bihar pollsThe deceased’s son alleged that a villager Ramratan Mishra had stolen their tractor a week ago and his mother had gone to Banda police station to lodge a complaint as the male members of the family were busy in harvesting but police didn’t listen to her complaint.“Mishra was harassing my family and demanding money in exchange of the tractor. When my mother went to the police station on Thursday, the police didn’t lodge any complaint but informed Mishra. Later, Mishra threatened her of dire consequences. Upset with Mishra’s threats and police’s action, my mother took her life,” the son said. However, the SP said, “The deceased’s husband and Ramaratan Mishra had purchased the tractor 7-8 years ago in partnership but the tractor was in the name of the deceased’s husband. A few weeks ago, their relationship turned sour and Mishra took the tractor with him. Mishra was demanding the money which he had invested on the tractor.”“After the deceased’s complaint, the police personnel of Banda police station went to Mishra’s house and seized the tractor on Friday. The police asked both of them to prove the ownership but the woman had killed herself. In this matter, we found that Banda police didn’t handle the case properly so the in-charge has been removed,” said the officer.

10-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai witnesses haze-laden muggy Saturday, pollution levels worsen||The city witnessed hazy conditions with high humidity levels and cloud cover allowing air pollution to rise further on Saturday. Some parts of the city recorded light rain on Saturday with thundershowers reported along the outskirts of the city. The absence of wind speed did not disperse pollutants leading to poor air quality, said researchers. The pollutant measuring indicator - air quality index (AQI) - was recorded at 121 (moderate) on Saturday, which was the worst AQI since March. It was 118 (moderate) on Friday. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Saturday’s AQI was an average of nine locations in the city as the station at Bandra Kurla Complex has been defunct for over a week. While major locations across the city recorded ‘moderate’ air quality, the most polluted location was Navi Mumbai (193), followed by Andheri (176) and Mazgaon (166). Colaba and Bhandup had the cleanest air with satisfactory air quality at 71 and 70. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. An AQI of 111 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday.Humidity levels were at 89 percent in south Mumbai and 81 percent in the suburbs. “Owing to high moisture in the air, the city recorded higher pollution levels on Saturday as pollutant carrying capacity increases when there is more humidity. Also, wind speed is very low characteristic to the withdrawal period of monsoon,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. Meanwhile, the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded 0.2 and 0.3 mm rain between 8.30 and 5.30 pm. Thane recorded 5.6 mm rain. The city and suburbs could expect partly cloudy conditions on Sunday with the possibility of light rain. “The presence of low-pressure weather system over the Bay of Bengal is activating monsoon currents over central India leading to thundershowers for the coast and interior Maharashtra,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-witnesses-haze-laden-muggy-saturday-pollution-levels-worsen/story-ymqyDSj2DOOquT3RsSOt9J.html

10-10-2020||Election:||This Maoist-turned-politician of Bihar has more cases against him than party chief Pappu Yadav||Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP) candidate from Gurua assembly constituency in Gaya district has beaten down his party boss Ranjan Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav in terms of number of cases lodged against him, most of which are for heinous crimes. According to an affidavit filed by Pappu Yadav, during his nomination filed in 2019 Lok Sabha elections when he unsuccessfully contested from Madhepura, 31 cases are pending against him, out of which charges have been framed in 10 cases. However, Maoist-turned politician Sudhir Kumar Verma alias Vinod Marandi, who once carried Rs 25,000 prize on his head, has 37 cases against lodged him, which include heinous crimes under 3/4 Explosive Substance Act, Section 302 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder, 307 of IPC (attempt to murder), besides others. Marandi, out of jail on bail, filed his nomination papers for Gurua seat on Thursday. BJP’s sitting MLA Rajiv Nandan is one of the contestants from the constituency, while the RJD has fielded Vinay Kumar. In 2015 assembly polls, Nandan had defeated Ramchandra Prasad Singh of JD(U) by a margin of 6,515 votes. Also read: Gandhis, Shatrughan Sinha among Cong’s star campaigners for phase 1 of Bihar pollsThe JAP has forged an alliance for Bihar elections by tying up with three parties—Azad Samaj Party of Chandrashekhar Azad, the Social Democratic Party of MK Faizi and Bahujan Mukti Party led by BPL Matang. A police official said Marandi had joined the Maoist outfit Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) in 1999 as area commander, however, when he could not establish his supremacy in the organisation, he floated Revolutionary Communist Centre (RCC) in August 2004. The RCC was involved in extortion and other unlawful activities and spread its wing in entire Magadh division and bordering areas of Jharkhand. In 2009, he was arrested, however, the court acquitted him in the absence of any concrete evidence. The police had later arrested him in 2016 from Vishnupad area of Gaya after tracking his mobile phone for quite some time. Marandi, who earlier used to frequently change his phone numbers and used to call people from his hideouts, said now he has said farewell to arms and joined the mainstream politics. “Besides politics, I do broking of land,” he said. “I fear that I may get killed as I had disassociated myself from the MCC and the RCC about two years back. Therefore, I have sought security from the district administration,” he said. Marandi’s wife, Sunita Devi is mukhiya of Diha panchayat under Gurua police station in Gaya district. Marandi, a Dangi by caste, feels he might get the majority of votes of his caste besides Muslims would also vote for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/this-maoist-turned-politician-of-bihar-has-more-cases-against-him-than-party-chief-pappu-yadav/story-o3x0dMdY2fpF4XlpYkUGIK.html

There is a growing demand from various organisations to reopen temples and other shrines in Maharashtra. The principal opposition in Maharashtra, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) along with Maharashtra Nav Nirman Sena and Bahujan Vanchit Aghadi have staged protest demanding temples to reopen. The gymnasiums owners in the state too have urged government for permission to operate considering the financial loss they are facing.

In Nashik, known for its rich history, the bridge will be designed with hands showcasing ‘tarpana’, a Hindu practice of making offerings to the Lord, and in Nagpur, the bridge is likely to be in the form of a tiger to promote the movement ‘save the tiger.’ However, apart from Wardha, the designs for the four other bridges are still under-consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-tribute-to-father-of-nation-mumbai-nagpur-corridor-to-have-charkha-bridge/story-KymgBdwuEc0I8Xwp3aRURN.html

10-10-2020||Lucknow||Opposition parties have ‘division’ in their DNA, alleges Yogi Adityanath||Hitting out at the Opposition, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday alleged that “division is in the DNA” of these parties and they are trying to create a rift in society on caste and community lines. Addressing a virtual meeting of the BJP’s office-bearers as part of preparations for assembly by-election to Deoria Sadar assembly constituency, he alleged that due the development activities undertaken under the BJP rule, the opposition parties were frustrated and were using “every trick” to defame his government. By-elections will be held to seven Assembly seats, including Deoria, in Uttar Pradesh on November 3. Six of the seats were held by the ruling BJP and one by the SP. “The thought process of the rival parties is dirty and their intention is dangerous. “Division is in their DNA. It was due to this thought process that they first divided the country, and are now attempting to divide the society on the basis of caste, community and region. For them, the interest of their clan is of utmost importance, while everything else is secondary,” Adityanath said, targeting the Congress and other rival parties. Raising the issue of development under the BJP, he said that “the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which have ruled the state for 15 years, have only corruption and anarchy to count as their achievement. “From time-to-time, these parties have throttled democracy and the Constitution. Their development was confined only to slogans and speeches.” The BJP leader said that the “actual development” started six years ago with the formation of the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Owing to all-round development, the popularity of BJP is continuously rising, and there is a feeling of positivity in the public. “In this case, the unhappiness of these (opposition) parties has transformed into frustration. As a result, they are trying to resort to every trick to defame the government. However, their intentions will never be fulfilled,” he said. Referring to the problem of encephalitis, the UP chief minister said that from 1977 to 2017, the disease had claimed the lives of more than 50,000 people, most of them children. “No one had ever raised their voice. In a span of only three years, we are on the way towards eradication of encephalitis,” he asserted. Referring to Deoria, Adityanath said, “The sacred land of Devraha Baba was known as the sugar bowl. The economy of the area was based on sugarcane. Ask them why in their tenure one after another sugar mills wee old at throwaway prices.” Devraha Baba, who died on June 19, 1990, was a revered ascetic who lived beside the Yamuna river in Mathura. He was known as “ageless Yogi”. UP BJP chief Swatantradev Singh also addressed party workers, a statement issued by the UP BJP said. The seven Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh where bypolls will be held on November 3 include Naugaon which fell vacant after the death of minister Chetan Chauhan. The by-election was necessitated in Ghatampur (Kanpur) as sitting MLA and minister Kamal Rani Varun died, while in Tundla (Firozabad) the sitting MLA, SP Singh Baghel, got elected to Lok Sabha. The Bangarmau (Unnao) seat fell vacant following the conviction of Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The seats of Bulandshahr, Deoria and Malhani will have by-election due to the demise of sitting MLAs Virendra Singh Sirohi, Janmejay Singh and Parasnath Yadav (SP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/opposition-parties-have-division-in-their-dna-alleges-yogi-adityanath/story-eZmnODLSwEj5DJpPLh2eQK.html

10-10-2020||Pune||Longer monsoon will have no impact on the onset of winter: IMD||The city of Pune and most parts of Maharashtra is experiencing a delayed monsoon, however, the delayed withdrawal of rain won’t have an impact on the onset of the winter season, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The winter season generally commences from the end of November while India Meteorological Department (IMD) usually considers the month of January and February as the winter season. “The delayed post-withdrawal monsoon season will not have an impact on the winter season, as it is after the monsoon. Winter will commence from November end. The IMD will release a forecast about the winter season by the end of October or the start of November,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of IMD Pune. The normal withdrawal monsoon date for the city is October 9. For this season, it is expected to start on October 15. “For the next few days, Pune and Nashik are likely to get light to moderate rain on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday while Mumbai is expected to have very light to light rains in the next three days,” said Kashyapi. On Friday, parts of Pimpri Chinchwad and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) area received moderate showers in the evening, while there was no rain activity, noticed in the city. “It was just a passing shower, such activities are expected to happen for the next few days,” added Kashyapi.

10-10-2020||City||Prevented 75% more infiltration attempts across LoC this year compared to 2019: Indian Army||The Army on Saturday said it has been able to prevent about three-fourth of infiltration attempts across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto India-Pakistan border in Jammu & Kashmir, this year compared to 2019 even as Pakistan continued to push infiltrators and weapons to fuel terrorism.Lt Gen B S Raju, the general officer commanding of the Army’s Chinar Corps responsible for operations in the Kashmir Valley, said the situation along the LoC is under control even as ceasefire violations were happening to some extent. “It [ceasefire violations] help Pakistan in infiltration.”Raju cited intelligence inputs and said around 250-300 terrorists were ready across launch pads on the Pakistan side to infiltrate into Jammu & Kashmir. “We have been able to stop them despite their efforts to infiltrate,” he said. “Last year, around 130 persons infiltrated and this year the figure is below 30. Such is the change. And I hope this will also lead to an improvement in the internal situation,” he said on the sidelines of a function in Srinagar.Also Read: 2 terrorists killed in J-K’s Pulwama hours after another gunbattle in KulgamRaju said they foiled an attempt from the Pakistani side to send weapons, including four AK-74 rifles, using a tube across the Kishanganga River in Keran in Kupwara district on Saturday. “Our jawans were alert and owing to our surveillance equipment, we were able to recover that cache. This broadly shows that there has been no change in the intentions of Pakistan. And in future as well, we will offset their designs,” he said.Raju said there have been other attempts to send weapons into other parts of Jammu & Kashmir and even Punjab. “The motive to push weapons is to keep the people of Kashmir tangled so that terrorism remains here. We always try to stop this so that there is very little damage here. We want the help of the people to stop terrorism.”Raju said they were also continuously neutralising militants. “In the morning [Saturday] in South Kashmir, we were able to neutralise a foreign and a local terrorist. We have witnessed wherever a foreign terrorist is neutralised in a particular area, peace prevails there. In Pulwama and Shopian, owing to different operations in the past two-three months, there has been peace there.”Raju said the militant recruitment has overall decreased in the last six months. “In South Kashmir, the problem is worse than North Kashmir. Overall, the situation is under control. A month ago, the recruitment increased but it has again come down in the past 15 days. I hope the youth will pick the correct path and there will be a further reduction in recruitment.”Raju said many terrorists were also surrendering. “We do not advertise that thing but it is a good indicator.”He said they were awaiting the summary of evidence to the killing of three young men in a staged gunbattle in July. “Initial court of inquiry has concluded and, on that basis, we concluded that some wrong was committed. And on that basis, we have ordered a summary of the evidence which is halfway through. And we hope that it concludes soon so that we can go into the next stage.”Raju said contrary to reports, they have seen no indications that China and Pakistan were helping each other tactically. “We have seen in the news that China is helping Pakistan or Pakistan is helping China. We have no such indications. Owing to CPEC [China–Pakistan Economic Corridor] there is the presence of Chinese in Pakistan. Military cooperation in terms of equipment is there but we did not see any tactical help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prevented-75-more-infiltration-attempts-across-loc-this-year-compared-to-2019-indian-army/story-C78YPVMUtoBDi0SBfU1d2N.html
10-10-2020||City||Pimpri-Chinchwad top cop shares plan on ‘village defence party’||Krishna Prakash, commissioner of police, Pimpri- Chinchwad, has recently introduced the “village defence party” initiative in the jurisdiction controlled by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissionerate. The initiative, described in the Maharashtra Police Act, empowers residents of an area chosen by the police to patrol and assist the police in their security endeavours, ensuring the area they operate in is protected. CP Prakash is using the initiative to supplement the shortage of staff on the Pimpri-Chinchwad police force, that came into existence on August 15, 2018. In an interview with Shalaka Shinde he shares details about the village defence party and how it will operate. How many villages will have your appointees in places under the village defence party initiative? We are planning to appoint persons in 250 village clusters. The provision is very much there (in the Maharashtra Police Act). Will they be armed? Not all of them. In any village, there will be eight-10 people who will be armed. They will be selected on the basis of their discipline, regularity in patrolling, their capacity to purchase a weapon and their background - criminal record or confidential record - or history of biased behaviour. Rifle procuring is not a difficult thing; it is available in government factories. In any case, procuring it will be their responsibility. How will these people be trained? We will talk with SRPF officials. We will get their help to train them. All of this will take six months, three months of which will be training time. We will need time to plan, choose the appointees. We want to increase traffic wardens also with the help of industries in these areas, municipal corporations - PMC, PCMC - and the rural area as well. There is no-one available to sponsor traffic wardens. Village defence parties will be helpful here. How will you handle a place like Hinjewadi – which is rural, but also houses the IT parks? Village defence officers (VDO) will work in the night only, not in the morning. If they are working as traffic wardens, they will be working with traffic police. What is your long term view of this shortage of staff? An advertisement has been placed for 750 police staff. We have already sent a proposal for three DCPs and four ACPs, and, I think it is in process. We have no DCP for traffic or crime. These are important posts. High ranking officials are required. In two phases, 1,150 staff has been sanctioned. The PCMC has a population of 25 lakh, but the Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissionnerate covers a population of 45 lakh, as per 2011 census; currently it must be 60 lakh. Compared to Pune city, it is much bigger. We have to augment this city with important facilities like QRT BDDS, dog units, police hospitals, etc. It is nascent and we cannot blame anyone. We need land. A letter, allegedly written by a constable, has made serious charges against an inspector and a former commissioner. Comment. The letter is to be verified properly; there are minute details. Unfortunately, because of the Covid19 situation, the inquiry has been given to ACP HQ and he is holding many charges. He has not been able to conduct the inquiry properly, but he did get a statement from the constable that he has not written the letter. Now there are two new ACPs. I will transfer the inquiry to one of them, once they join. Though information is quite direct, it needs thorough investigation. If the land exists, then the facts can be trusted. A PSI from Chakan police station was booked for dacoity. Comment He was booked after reasonable suspicion and grounds were found. We have registered a case against him as the kingpin, not as a pawn. Somehow, he got the hint and he escaped; he might have observed that accused were arrested. That must have alerted him. We have conclusive proof against him that needs to be verified by voice forensics. The phone seized from the accused has the recording of that officer showing he was directing each and everything. How have you personally managed to operate in these Covid times? I’m racing against time here. I’m unable to do my workouts; only on Sundays or Saturdays. Last Sunday, I ran 15km; last-to-last Sunday I ran 42km as part of the virtual Berlin marathon. This Sunday, I will be running 42km in the virtual Chicago marathon. I’m running, but am not getting the time for my whole workout to strengthen other parts of the body. I do not have a full-fledged team. Sleep has gone for a toss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prakash-shares-vision-plan-on-village-defence-party/story-Q1wdnggqs7XYVlYKmFksNN.html

10-10-2020||Pune||Pune man booked for kidnapping despite minor’s desire to live with accused||A 25-year-old from Bhosari in Pimpri-Chinchwad, was arrested by the local police on Thursday, in a fourth case of kidnapping registered against him in the past four years. The person he is accused of kidnapping has remained constant in all four cases - a girl who wants to live with him. The man has been identified as Nitin Suryavan Ghorpade, a resident of Khandoba Mala, Bhosari, according to police. This has happened due to an order of the Supreme Court in 2013, that mandates registration of FIR in every complaint of a minor missing in all states in the country. Every complaint of a minor person missing has since been registered as a case of kidnapping. On Thursday, Ghorpade was arrested by officials of Bhosari MIDC police station in a case registered under Section 363 (kidnapping) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) in March 2019, against him. The first case was registered in 2017 when he was 22 and the girl was 15-years-old. Now, the girl is months away from adult status, but the man she claims to be in love with has a criminal record due to their relationship. “The girl is now pursuing some education. Her parents are against their match and she is a minor. Every chance she gets, she goes to him willingly. But, her parents register a fresh complaint against him each time,” said senior police inspector Shankar Awtade. “These two (accused and victim) are distant relatives and are members of the Pardhi community. The two are sure about being with each other, but the parents make these attempts to keep them away,” said police sub-inspector Pooja Kadam of the Bhosari police station. The police officials of Bhosari MIDC, where the 2019 case against him is registered, brought the man to Bhosari police station on Thursday claiming that the alleged kidnapping had happened in their jurisdiction. However, to the determined couple, the jurisdiction barely made any difference; the allegedly “kidnapped” girl walked into the police station next to her handcuffed partner. They have done this thrice earlier - once each in 2017 and 2018 in Bhosari police station, and once in Majalgaon police station in Beed in 2018. “She was visiting her grandparents in Beed when she called him there and they decided to take off. They were found - he was sent to jail and she was sent back to her parents,” said PI Awtade. While it is unclear whether the couple will be back together, the police are looking forward to the day when the girl turns 18 and the series of cases can be stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/man-booked-for-kidnapping-despite-minor-s-desire-to-live-with-accused/story-eoutNQNAXKMmK2MZv8nXTP.html

However, more than double the complainants have lost their money. There are various reasons for the loss of this money, including people tricked into sharing information willingly. However, a major contributor is the lack of response from companies.Of 1,175 requests made to 11 service providers in 2019, 301 were rejected, and 419 were provided; rest remained unanswered.In 2020, so far, 1694 requests have been made to these companies. Of these 1,694 requests, 465 have been declined, 905 have been accepted and the rest remained unanswered.“There are times when we have sent 15-16 reminders for particular information and it still remains unanswered. This needs government intervention to make these companies respond on time,” said Kadam.The police either write to the nodal officers of the concerned or to the Computer Emergency Response Team, India (CERTIn) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. However, their responses are not always met with.“For all such companies, there is a single point of contact called the nodal officer who collects and provides this information sought by the police,” aid Sandip Gadiya, a cyber security expert.“There are multiple reasons why there is no response: the letter is not clear describing crime and sections invoked. In some cases, if the account is accessed from outside the country, the nodal officers cannot provide the information. In yet another type of cases, the nodal officers check if the quoted sections are rightly invoked. There is also the reason of servers of the company being located outside of India,” he said.“The problem is that it is as it is difficult to trace the money. Once it is traced, finding the name on the account and the original owner is another challenge. Also, these crimes are often committed from outside the jurisdiction of the local police. Amid these problems, it should be noted that it is binding for these companies to share this information. I will have to study about the legal recourse to this,” said advocate Vishal Muralikar who works as a public prosecutor in the local court where cyber-crime cases are heard.“There are other legal recourse that can be used by the police or the complainants themselves. However, all the processes culminate into the co-ordination between tech companies and the police,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/9k-10k-cases-pending-at-cyber-crime-cell-lack-of-response-from-service-providers-leading-to-delay-say-police/story-kQ8V4AW5TkOs0JppeYlB6M.html

Kamlakar Shete, a final year student, said, “We are facing several issues while writing the mock tests. Some of the questions in the last phase question no. 58, 59 and 60 are not appearing in the mobile application.”Most of the students have not got the login id and password details from SPPU examination department, claim the students.“The helpline number provided by SPPU is not reachable most of the time and if it gets connected no one answers the calls,” said Shete.As many as 2.5 lakh students will be appearing for the final year exams of SPPU and affiliated colleges. Of these, two lakh students have chosen online option while the 50,000 students have opted for the offline option. For the offline exams, 113 centres have been identified where the physical exams will be conducted.These exams will be of 50 marks with multiple choice questions for one hour. Currently, SPPU faculties are preparing question paper sets for around 3,300 different subjects. Vaibhav Edke, president, Maharashtra Students Welfare Association, said, “Weare receiving complaints from students about the mock tests, there are many issues due to which students are not able to give this mock test.”He claimed that engineering students are asked irrelevant questions in these mock tests. “For example, they are been asked random general knowledge questions which are not related to the given subject. If this is the situation in the mock tests, then during the examination students will be in trouble,” he said. Mahesh Kakade, director of the board of examination and evaluation, SPPU, said, “We are receiving many calls from students about technical issues, login issues and other issues while appearing for the mock test.”“If the students read the instruction manual properly they can appear for the exam easily, and we will resolve all the technical issues of the students before the examination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/final-year-students-of-pune-varsity-affiliated-colleges-face-technical-glitches-during-mock-tests/story-2xyeItCdIXcppSL6ZCtMaJ.html

10-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality in higher end of ‘moderate’ category, likely to improve marginally on Sunday||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the higher end of the ‘moderate’ category on Saturday, but a government forecasting agency said it is likely to improve marginally on October 11. The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 197, which falls in the higher end of the ‘moderate’ category. It was in ‘poor’ category at 204 on Friday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said PM 2.5 is the lead pollutant in Saturday’s AQI and is likely to improve to the ‘moderate’ category by Sunday.“The overall Delhi AQI is in the higher end of ‘moderate’ and at the edge of the ‘poor’ category, with PM2.5 as the lead pollutant,” SAFAR said. It said the AQI is forecasted to marginally improve but remain in the ‘moderate’ category for tomorrow while further AQI is forecasted to improve by October 12, which will also remain in the moderate category.It said the low pressure formed over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify to depression and move west northwestwards and influence the circulations in the north and central India. “A shift in Delhi surface wind direction, northwesterly to southeasterly by October 12 is forecasted. This could influence air quality positively in the coming week,” it said.Due to stubble burning around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions, the fire count was found at 253 on Saturday, SAFAR said. Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017.These measures include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.When the situation turns “severe”, GRAP recommends closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-in-higher-end-of-moderate-category-likely-to-improve-marginally-on-sunday/story-ORwIGw7k3EtyBRQiAL3MQP.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Contempt notice to Cidco for failure to hand over mangrove land to forest department||Environmentalists have issued a contempt notice to state planning agency City industrial development corporation ltd (Cidco) for failure to hand over mangrove land under their jurisdiction to the Maharashtra forest department. A similar notice was also issued to the state urban development and environment department to look into why Cidco has failed to hand over the Mangrove land.The notice issued to six top Cidco officials, including the vice chairman and managing director, joint directors, and the law officer, directs the planning agency to assess the extent of mangrove area and hand it over to the state within seven days or non-compliance would entail civil and criminal contempt proceedings against Cidco under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.Petitioners before the Bombay high court in various matters pertaining to mangrove and wetland conservation, environment group Vanashakti issued the legal notice on Friday. “Despite the state mangrove cell repeatedly writing to Cidco to handover mangroves to the forest department, the agency has remained silent on many occasions and this conduct is nothing short of holding themselves above the law. Such high handedness will be brought up before courts if Cidco again chooses to remain tight lipped,” said Zaman Ali, counsel for Vanashakti and advocate, Bombay high court (HC).Also Read: Republic TV asks Mumbai police to suspend probe in fake TRP case, cites petition in SCThe notice cited orders passed by the HC on October 6, 2005 that mangrove areas on government owned lands, including those belonging to state agencies such as Cidco, needed to be handed over to the forest department within a period of 12 weeks from the declaration of the same as protected forests. The HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018.“Years of non-compliance of orders of the HC cannot be condoned,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti and member of a HC appointment committee on preservation of mangroves.He added that non-cooperation from bodies like Cidco was primarily responsible for the delay. “We have time and again reminded the forest department to take custody of mangrove areas but they have not been able to do so due to the non-cooperation from urban development bodies like Cidco. Even the HC-appointed committee had directed almost a year ago to comply with the HC orders. Now we have no option but to seek judicial intervention which we will do.”Also Read: BMC’s predictions fall short, Covid-19 cases increase faster than anticipatedThe notice further alleged that Cidco, appointed as the special planning authority for the Navi Mumbai new town project, had omitted land occupied by mangroves near villages of Kunde, Wahal, and Dapoli in Raigad district in its final development plan (DP).“We have asked Cidco to initiate steps to modify and amend the DP precisely demarcating all mangrove forest lands and follow-up with the transfer of said areas to the forest department,” said Stalin.Priya Ratmabe, public relations officer, Cidco said, “The entire matter is under examination by Cidco. It is being studied by different departments, and we can comment on the matter after due consideration.”Another Cidco official requesting anonymity said, “There has been no study so far to examine the exact mangrove area within our jurisdiction, and neither has there been any decision to undertake such a study yet. However, some mangrove areas have been marked in certain DPs as green zones.”Maharashtra has 15,312.6 hectare (ha) mangroves on government land, declared as reserved forests. However, 13,716.7 ha land has been handed over to the forest department by seven Konkan districts, and the majority of the 1,592.8 ha of remaining mangroves land remains with Raigad district (1,195 ha).In addition to this, approximately 2,000-ha land held by planning authorities such as Mumbai metropolitan regional development authority (MMRDA), Cidco, Maharashtra industrial development corporation (MIDC), Maharashtra housing and area development authority (Mhada), and various municipal corporations have neither been measured nor handed over.On September 18, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had directed all Konkan district collectors and state agencies to transfer mangrove areas under their jurisdiction to the forest department for declaration as reserved forest within two months. So far, the Maharashtra tourism development corporation (MTDC) is the only state agency which will be handing over 500-acre of mangrove area across the Manori-Gorai belt within a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/contempt-notice-to-cidco-for-failure-to-hand-over-mangrove-land-to-forest-department/story-gvxBDm0NHcsMdxwFcCFKkK.html

10-10-2020||Delhi||Move Covid-19 patients to Delhi government hospitals ahead of Hindu Rao strike: Satyendar Jain||The Delhi government on Saturday ordered shifting of all Covid-19 patients at the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital to Delhi government facilities, days after doctors and nurses went on a symbolic strike to protest against non-payment of salaries for the past three months. The medical staff at the hospital, which is the biggest municipal health facility in the city, have threatened to go on a complete strike from Sunday. “Doctors and staff of Hindu Rao Hospital have called for a strike Sunday onwards. There are Covid-19 patients being treated at the hospital. We have directed that all the patients be shifted to Delhi government hospitals. They can go to any of the hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, whichever is closer,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.Also Read: Resident doctors of Hindu Rao threaten indefinite strike over pending salariesThe hospital was designated as a Covid-19 treatment facility in mid-June after the first surge in the cases of the viral disease in Delhi. The hospital has 343 beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Jain further said that the corporation should hand over hospitals to the Delhi government if they are unable to pay salaries to their staff. “The doctors and staff should be paid and if the corporation cannot do so, they should hand over the hospitals to the Delhi government,” said Jain, referring to multiple strikes the staff has had to go on due to the non-payment of salaries.Describing Jain’s comments as “irresponsible”, Jai Prakash, mayor of the north corporation, said the decision to shift patients was not taken by the Delhi government. “The decision to move the Covid-19 patients was taken by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). The corporation had raised the matter in one of the previous meetings. Hindu Rao hospital was getting few Covid-19 patients -- 15 or 25 at any given time. There are over 900 beds in the hospital. We thought it would be better utilised if we treated non-Covid-19 patients,” he said.The DDMA is headed by the Lieutenant Governor. There were 23 Covid-19 patients at Hindu Rao hospital on Saturday. Of them, 11 were moved to Lok Nayak hospital and two were shifted to Aruna Asaf Ali hospital. Three patients are still admitted at the hospital as they are critical and in ICU; the rest have been discharged.The striking doctors, meanwhile, rejected claims by the civic body that salaries have not been paid due to paucity of funds.“Why should doctors and nurses, who are at the forefront of the Covid-19 fight, have to go on strike to get their basic right of salary? And, it cannot be a matter of the MCD not having any funds. The corporation generates hundred of crores in taxes every month; do you know how much they need to pay the doctors and nurses in all hospitals and dispensaries run by the north corporation? Just Rs 13 crore,” said Dr Abhinav Sardana, the president of the Hindu Rao resident doctors’ association. Currently, there are over 16,000 beds reserved for the treatment of Covid-19 patients across the city in both government and private hospitals.Jain said that the government was taking measures but to prevent a surge in cases people should take precautions such as wearing a mask, maintaining social distance, and hand hygiene.The mayor said, “The statements by the health minister were highly irresponsible. The Delhi government owes us Rs 1,600 crore. Instead of paying us the money so that we can run the corporations efficiently, they have been making allegations that we cannot run the corporation and that we should hand over the hospitals to them. Would they be able to run their services if the Centre did not pay the dues,” he said.“As for the doctors, I have requested them to withdraw the strike. We are disbursing salaries on priority. Last week, we paid the pensioners. Next, we will pay the doctors and sanitation workers. We are trying to arrange funds for their salaries and they should receive it in another 10 to 15 days,” said Jai Prakash.But the doctors said they were yet to receive any assurance by the civic body.“We had been contacted by the mayor on Friday but have received no written assurance on when the salaries will be disbursed. As planned, we will go on a strike from tomorrow morning,” said Dr Sagardeep Bawa, vice president of the resident doctors’ association of Hindu Rao hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/move-covid-19-patients-to-delhi-government-hospitals-ahead-of-hindu-rao-strike-satyendar-jain/story-YcJPIYjS3AYFV9DtW7s94I.html

10-10-2020||Arts||Shobha Deepak Singh on recovering from Covid-19: Jo Dara So Mara||As the festive season approaches, artistes are trying to reclaim the stage and take the pandemic head on. The fight isn’t easy, but the fighters aren’t giving up either. “Woh dialogue hai na: Jo Dara So Mara. So, darna nahi hai,” says Padma Shri Shobha Deepak Singh, director of Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK) in Mandi House, who recently resumed work after getting discharged from hospital where she was recovering from Covid-19.     “On September 20, I realised I was Covid positive, and soon got hospitalised,” says Singh, 77, who had been working out of her office all through the lockdown period. “I used to go every day for two or two and a half hours. So when I got to know that I’m Covid positive, I was so sure that some artiste at the institute would also have got corona. We got 40-45 people tested, but nobody tested positive besides me and my husband (Deepak Singh). The doctor has been thinking, how is it possible,” she quips, adding, “But I wasn’t afraid. Some friends of mine even went abroad or to remote places because they didn’t want to get corona, and still got it. One has to take precautions, but can’t stay afraid.”   A few days back, when Singh resumed work in her office, she was surprised to find that nobody was available at the rehearsal for SBKK’s Ramlila, which has received Government’s permission to be staged. “Then suddenly all the dancers appeared on the stage with flowers, and started clapping. It was such a touching welcome... I have been missing the noise of ghungroos in the institute. During the pandemic, we shifted all classes online since the parents of foreign students were concerned about the health of their children. But, I had decided that the Ramlila would happen this year as well! Its first show was in 1957 and has been happening since; I didn’t want to give it a break. The only reason why it could have been cancelled is if the Government didn’t allow us,” says Singh reiterating how performing artistes have had a tough time due to the pandemic. “During May-June, the Kalbelia dancers who I have worked with in the past contacted me saying they have no money. And without thinking for a second I sent them whatever I could.” One who is known to be averse to the very thought of recording live performances, choreographed by her, and cringe when people miss out giving credits, Singh has for the first time agreed to this year’s Ramlila at SBKK to get recorded. “What to do! In life you always have to go along with how the society moves. Although 100 people can watch it live at the open lawns now, we had earlier thought of an alternative incase we didn’t get the permission. The alternative was to record the whole performance from October 10 to 12, and upload the video on YouTube, from October 17 (when Navratri begins), along with a ticker that says that its copyright lies with SBKK. Even now we’ll go ahead with this plan,” she adds.          Author tweets @HennaRakheja Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/shobha-deepak-singh-on-recovering-from-covid-19-jo-dara-so-mara/story-qYbFreW9lXWOxUB2R6mdrJ.html

The Doaba region of Punjab, comprising Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts, is affected by Dalit protests as it constitutes a major chunk of the state’s Scheduled Caste (SC) population. Of Punjab’s 2.8 crore population, Dalits make up 32%, the highest in the country. Punjab Agro Industries Corporation chairman Joginder Singh Mann led supporters in holding protests in Phagwara. Mann said that the rising number of atrocities against the underprivileged and weaker sections of society in Uttar Pradesh has exposed the “anti-poor face” of the BJP government in the state. He accused the state government of suppressing voices against injustice. Paramjit Singh Kainth, the National Scheduled Castes Alliance president, demanded the suspension of the Punjab minister for social welfare Sadhu Singh Dharamsot for his involvement in the scholarship scam, saying that the additional chief secretary, social justice, empowerment and minorities, had already cited his role in his report to the chief secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bandh-call-by-dalit-outfits-against-hathras-incident-disrupts-life-in-punjab-s-jalandhar-phagwara/story-6PgsV0ICy9F8bTVRDQwcCL.html

She alleged the man also misbehaved with her 14-year-old niece.The man moved the high court for anticipatory bail , saying he was falsely implicated at the behest of a trustee who had been expelled for fraud from a school where he worked as a manager.The court found substance in his claim. The allegations under the POCSO Act in respect to the alleged misbehaviour with the 14-year-old also lack in detail and was reported after two-and-a-half years, said the court.Also Read: Man rapes his 10-year-old daughter, arrested from Mumbai’s Vakola areaExperts say it is not uncommon that victims of sexual assault don’t immediately file complaints with the police; it could be due to trauma or even the social stigma around filing a case that could hold them back from approaching the police. The court further said the accused’s custodial interrogation was not necessary as he is a “responsible person and is working with a public charitable trust as a manager. He has roots in society and his chances of fleeing the course of justice are minimal”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-school-manager-booked-for-rape/story-mpiKwSbgpw8pa1bAsFxApJ.html

10-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC frowns over continued closure of senior citizen tribunals||The Bombay high court has asked the Maharashtra government why senior citizen tribunals set up under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 have not resumed work yet.“Various authorities have resumed functioning physically or through video conferencing long ago, there is no reason for this tribunal to continue to be closed,” said the bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Milind Jadhav.The bench added that the Act of 2007, a beneficial legislation, is enacted for providing succour to senior citizens suffering because of the neglect by their children and there would be many senior citizens in need of immediate redressal.HC has, therefore, asked the state government to specify when the tribunals would resume functioning physically or through video conferencing as may be found fit.The court was hearing a petition filed by a former Uttar Pradesh minister presently residing in Mumbai, seeking a direction to his son to remove himself, his family along with their belongings from the former Bahujan Samaj Party leader’s flat in Mumbai.Also Read: Mumbai: BMC’s predictions fall short, Covid-19 cases increase faster than anticipatedHe had moved HC directly for the relief on the ground that the tribunals established under the 2007 act had stopped functioning since March 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic. He had urged that in the circumstances, HC should pass appropriate orders, as prayed by him.Responding to the merits of the case, the former UP minister’s son argued that his father had been a member of a legislative assembly and also had been a cabinet minister and therefore he was not without support and it was not as if he was unable to maintain himself. He submitted that his father’s application for reliefs under the 2007 Act would not be maintainable.Also Read: Statewide bandh in Maharashtra over Maratha quota row todayHC refused to enter into the family dispute after noticing that both the parties had roped in the wife of the petitioner and were levelling various allegations and counter allegations.“We do not wish to adjudicate the issue whether the petitioner can seek this relief before the tribunal established under the Act of 2007,” said the bench.“Assuming he can, merely because the tribunal is temporarily closed, the writ jurisdiction cannot be exercised to issue directions to the private parties and adjudicate the disputed questions of facts. Neither of the party is living in penury, and what is raised before us is a purely domestic dispute,” it added.HC, however, found it necessary to look into the larger issue - the continued closure of the senior citizen tribunals and called for an explanation from the government. It has posted the petition for further hearing on October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-frowns-over-continued-closure-of-senior-citizen-tribunals/story-8HGzMq3rmp72DQghReuLUO.html
10-10-2020||Dehradun||UP man attempts suicide after rape accusation: Police||A 23-year-old man attempted suicide in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnor district, days after a 21-year-old woman registered a rape case against him, his brother, and father, police said. Police superintendent Swapn Kishor said on Friday they are probing the rape charges and have found the man attempted suicide on Thursday night. He added the accused was rushed to a hospital and his condition is now stable.Kishor said the man was booked for rape along with his brother and father on October 4. He said that the woman has alleged the three abducted her in December 2018, locked her up in their house in Bijnor, and raped her for two years. Also Read: 27-year-old unemployed engineer dies by suicide in DehradunThe woman told the police she later became pregnant and delivered twins, who are currently with the man’s family in UP, before escaping in August and filing the complaint in October. She “managed to escape... [to] Roorkee during the [Covid-19] lockdown, where she narrated her ordeal to her family. Her brother lodged the complaint on her behalf”, Kishor said. Another police officer involved in the probe into the case, however, said that the 23-year-old had earlier posted photographs with the woman on Facebook and described the woman as his wife. The officer added that in some other Facebook posts, the man said they had a court marriage after falling in love and that he was being framed in the case. “The probe will look into all these angles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/up-man-attempts-suicide-after-rape-accusation-police/story-SkvHeiB2xAlceLmkuCYsdP.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC’s predictions fall short, Covid-19 cases increase faster than anticipated||On October 4, there were 22,000 Covid-19 more cases than the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had predicted in September. Prior to this, BMC had predicted the number of active cases would reach 26, 628 by September 15; however, the number of active cases was 30, 879 by then. This indicates more rapid growth of Covid-19 cases than anticipated by city authorities.The BMC had predicted that the number of Covid-19 cases would reach 191,000 by October 4, whereas the number of positive cases in Mumbai was 213,000 by then. The number of daily infections has been hitting a record frequently. On Wednesday, 2,838 Covid-19 cases, the highest so far, were reported in Mumbai, followed by 2,823 cases on Thursday and 2,289 fresh cases on Friday. The total number of cases has reached 225,000 in the city so far.The authorities’ predictions are crucial since they plan the scaling up of the health machinery, which comprises bed management, testing kits, and ventilators, based on them.Also Read: With 73,272 fresh cases, India’s Covid-19 tally reaches 6.97 millionAccording to experts, prediction models fail due to irresponsible human behaviour with regard to following social distancing norms or wearing a mask. Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Apart from Covid-19 being unpredictable, the biology of the virus is not a mathematical model. Human behaviour is a key reason for viral transmission. If citizens act recklessly, don’t follow the rules of social distancing or wear masks, the number of cases is going to increase sharply. Any prediction will fail unless all citizens self-regulate. During the festival season, citizens did not wear masks or follow rules of social distancing, which led to the surge in cases in the following days.”The number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai had peaked in May but gradually reduced after June. However, after the festive season, there was an increase in cases by the end of August. The daily number of Covid-19 cases has been reporting a sharp increase with over 2,000 cases being reported in Mumbai since the second week of September. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded its highest number of Covid-19 cases with 2, 848 fresh cases taking the total number of cases in the city to 219,000.Joshi added that people make simple mistakes like removing masks in enclosed places. “I want to advise citizens to not remove masks while speaking, or while they are in the toilet. Avoid removing masks as much as possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-s-predictions-fall-short-covid-19-cases-increase-faster-than-anticipated/story-StROKjHchBkFAPpiffPYMI.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Statewide bandh in Maharashtra over Maratha quota row today||A statewide bandh is being observed in Maharashtra on Saturday, over the quota row. The bandh call has been given by several Maratha outfits; they are demanding restoration of reservation for their community members in jobs and education.On September 9, the Supreme Court (SC) had stayed the implementation of the law granting reservation to Marathas and referred the matter to a larger constitutional bench. The state government has not shown any “extraordinary situation” which warrants the reservation, the top court had said.Also Read: Maratha outfits turn down Maharashtra government’s decision to extend EWS quota to community, vow to intensify protestsVarious organisations have been pressuring the state government to demand removal of SC’s stay on the law. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had told the protesters earlier that the state government will move the Supreme Court again on the issue of reservation. The government’s decision to bring Marathas under the 10 per cent quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) also did not go down well with the community and community leaders staged protests outside residences of members of Parliament (MPs) and legislators.Also Read: What Uddhav Thackeray says on Maratha quota row“We have decided to turn down the government’s decision to bring us under the EWS quota as it does not serve any purpose. Our immediate demand is that the state government should immediately safeguard the interest of our youths who have secured admissions or government jobs under SEBC reservation stayed by the top court. Secondly, the schemes which are being shown as earmarked for the community are old ones and meant for other communities too. The state government can add 12% more seats in admissions to secure the quota for students from the community,” Maratha Mahasangh leader Rajendra Kondhare said.Amid protest against the state government for failing to present the case in front of the apex court, Ashok Chavan, who heads a state cabinet sub-committee on the Maratha reservation issue, said that it was fighting a legal battle and Maratha outfits should appreciate its efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/statewide-bandh-in-maharashtra-today-despite-ews-quota-extension-for-maratha-community/story-iZfsS9YeISTFg6INeNoRVP.html

10-10-2020||Education||Maharashtra relaxes admission criteria for engineering and professional courses||Admission to Maharashtra’s engineering colleges will now be easier for aspirants as the state’s higher and technical education department has reduced the cut-off by 5% for Class 12 scores.In a notification late Friday, the department announced modifications in the eligibility conditions and requirements for admissions to undergraduate and postgraduate professional courses in Maharashtra’s colleges.For admission to engineering courses, the candidates should have obtained at least 45% (taken together) in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their Class 12 exams and a non-zero score in the state Common Entrance Test (CET). The cut-off for students from backward classes and economically weaker sections is 40%, the same as persons with disability.Also Read: UGC declares 24 universities as fake. Here’s full listEarlier, the cut-off was 50% in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (taken together) in Class 12 exams for general category students and 45% for backward category students.Along with engineering, the cut-offs for admissions to undergraduate courses in Pharmacy, Hotel Management and Catering Technologies, Law, Fine Arts, and Design, have also been reduced by 5% in higher secondary exams. Sources in the government said they have reduced cut-offs to attract more students in these streams.Over the past few years, there have been substantial vacancies in Maharashtra’s engineering colleges. In 2019-20, almost 50% of the engineering seats in the state were vacant and in 2018-19, almost 56% were vacant. The number of vacancies was more pronounced in traditional engineering courses.

10-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality remains poor for the fourth consecutive day||Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘poor’ zone on Saturday morning, with the air quality index (AQI) at 217, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data at 9am.Air quality enters poor zone between 201-300 mark. The average AQI has been in the poor zone since Wednesday, when air quality plunged into the ‘poor’ zone for the first time since June 28. On Friday the 24-hour average AQI was 202. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the central government’s air quality monitoring and forecast wing, said on Friday AQI is expected to remain in the poor category even though it could see a slight improvement on October 11 and 12. Air quality takes a sharp downward turn every year from October onwards, when a drop in temperature, change in wind speeds and direction, and smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring states, apart from local sources of pollution, combine to make Delhi one of the most polluted cities in the world.Also Read: Connaught Place will get smog tower in 10 months, says Kejriwal“Air quality is set to improve on October 11 to moderate category. The low pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify and influence air circulation in north India. A shift in Delhi’s surface wind direction, from north-westerly to southeasterly is likely by October 12. This could influence air quality in the coming week. Stubble burning fires have been observed around Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring border regions,” it said. According to experts, though faster winds play a major role in dispersing pollutants, they are not helping Delhi in the prevailing circumstances since winds are not strong through the day. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department, even though the average wind speed is 15-16 kmph during the day, the north-westerly winds bringing in fumes from stubble burning of crops in Haryana and Punjab is adding pollutants in the atmosphere to the northwestern region including Delhi-NCR. However, the wind speed is low from evening to morning -- thus, not allowing dispersion of pollutants -- and a drop in night temperature permits the pollutants to settle in the atmosphere. Also Read: 80 per cent trees felled for infra work to be transplanted in Delhi“The air quality may improve slightly on October 11-12 because of thunderous developments likely in the region. The wind direction will also change to southeasterly during this time. However, this pattern will again change from October 15, with a return of northwesterlies and a dip in both night and day temperatures,” said an IMD scientist. On Friday, the minimum temperature settled at 19.2 degrees C, two notches below normal while the maximum temperature was at 35.2 degrees C, a notch above normal. As measures to control air pollution, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had visited construction sites to check dust pollution. On Friday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had also announced that the government would install a smog tower in Connaught Place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-remains-poor-for-the-fourth-consecutive-day/story-EBjmVKbg6FYGdGhQm3akaP.html

We want Rs 50 lakhs compensation & a govt job. All accused must be arrested & action should be taken against Patwari & policemen who are supporting the accused. We want protection,” Lalit, one of the family members of priest Babulal Vaishnav, told news agency ANI.Vaishnav’s hut in Bukna village was set on fire on Wednesday after he stopped five men who were seeking to encroach lands which were part of the temple where he worked as a priest. In his dying testimony, Vaishnav named six people, the police said.The priest died during treatment for burns at Jaipur’s SMS Hospital on Thursday.The Congress-led government in Rajasthan has come under severe criticism due to this incident. BJP leaders Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Vasundhara Raje said on Friday that no one is safe under the current administration. Union minister Prakash Javadekar has asked Rahul Gandhi to help solve the rising crime rates in Rajasthan rather than spending time on ‘political tourism’ in BJP-ruled states.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, meanwhile, said that the culprits will not be spared. “The murder of Babulal Vaishnav in Sapotara, Karauli, is extremely unfortunate and condemnable; civil society has no place for such acts.

10-10-2020||Education||Delhi University’s first cut-off list likely to be released today: All you need to know||The first cut-off list for admissions to over 70,000 undergraduate seats in around 65 Delhi University colleges is likely to be released on Saturday, university officials have said.Last year, the first cut-off list was announced on June 28. This year, however, in the wake of the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March and the subsequent delay in board exams and their results, the admission process has been pushed to November. The academic session is slated to begin from November 18.While university officials have asked colleges to send their respective college-wise cut-off by Saturday noon, colleges have also expressed difficulty in doing so since they received the registration data only on Friday. Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai, who had earlier said that the cut-offs would be announced on October 10, said, “The announcement of cut-offs depends on data sent to us by colleges. We have asked them to submit the cut-offs to us by noon Saturday. But we can’t commit on any date,” she said.Also Read: UGC declares 24 universities as fake. Here’s full listHere are five things you need to know about the admission process this year:1) ADMISSION TIMELINESince the admission process is completely online, eligible applicants can seek admissions under the first cut-off list from Monday to Wednesday. The second cut-off list will be announced on October 19. While every year, applicants had to visit colleges to take admission, due to the pandemic this year, the university had made the admission process completely online. Now, students can upload a copy of their mark sheets and certificates on the university website and they can be physically verified once the session reopens.2) HIGH NUMBER OF APPLICANTS Despite the pandemic, admission to Delhi University colleges this year is unlikely to be easier than the previous years with the varsity receiving its highest-ever number of applications so far. University officials said they have received 353,153 applications for around 70,000 undergraduate seats. Colleges attributed this increase to several factors -- including longer registration period, lack of clarity over entrance exams due to Covid-19, inability to apply to foreign universities because of the lockdown and the delay in the admission process that has allowed students from multiple state boards to apply as their results had been declared till August.3) APPLICANTS FROM ACROSS STATESThe feasibility of an online admission process is also likely to attract more students from outside Delhi as they don’t have to consider the financial aspect of coming to Delhi to complete the admission formalities, college principals said. Around 60% of the students who study at DU are from outside Delhi.4) CUT-OFFS MAY REMAIN HIGHSeveral DU colleges on Friday said that the cut-offs are unlikely to come down from the last year and are, instead, likely to see a rise of 0.5 to 1 percentage point across courses. This could be attributed to an exponential increase in high scorers (90-100%) in the Class 12 Central Board of Secondary Examination this year. Some colleges are likely to keep cut-offs at 100% as well. “Cut-offs are set to rise exponentially this time as more number of students have scored high marks this year. We have decided to keep the cut-offs for at least three courses at 100%,” said an official from a South Campus college, requesting anonymity. 5) EXPLAINING HIGH CUT-OFFSSince DU does not have a “first come, first served policy”, colleges have to grant admissions to every student who clears the cut-off. The central university receives applicants from across states, which means that colleges have to consider the marking and result system of all boards before setting the cut-offs. The first cut-off list remains on the higher side, so that colleges can try to control the “overadmission” that happens every year. Last year, despite keeping the highest cut-off across courses and colleges (99%), Hindu College had said that it had admitted more number of students than the available seats for its Political Science (Hons) course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/delhi-university-s-first-cut-off-list-to-be-released-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-2SrGkTBoVPH7ssgS8Vfr8K.html

The state education department has convened three-day meetings in 16,000 schools of all 12 districts of Himachal Pradesh next week to seek suggestions from parents and teachers on the resumption of classes.“A circular has been issued to all schools, government, private and aided ones, to hold parent-teacher meetings on October 15, 16 and 17. We have asked both parents and teachers to give their candid views to find out ways to strengthen education at this critical juncture,” said state education minister Govind Singh Thakur.The school management will share the standard operating procedure with parents and teachers. The department has already issued a circular for 100% attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff in educational institutions that opened with 50% attendance on September 12.ONLINE AND DISTANCE LEARNING TO CONTINUE The suggestions from schools will be sent to the education department that will forward it to the government for its consideration. The Union home ministry had on September 30 issued guidelines for re-opening schools and coaching institutions after October 15 in a graded manner, asking state and Union territories to decide in consultation with schools. The ministry emphasised on online and distance learning.The latest guidelines say that online teaching should be encouraged as it’s the preferred mode of teaching during the pandemic. The latest safety protocols set by the government say that apart from online classes; students preferring to attend classes physically may be permitted to do so. “But attendance must not be enforced. It should be entirely on parental consent,” the guidelines said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/16-000-schools-in-himachal-pradesh-to-hold-ptms-next-week-to-discuss-resumption-of-classes-9-to-12/story-SHqmbR0Cg5gZ9zCCwSG8FP.html

He could be released from the police custody in the evening only after completing all the formalities.When he realised that his mobile phone was deposited in the police station he went back to the police station accompanied by his father Govind Prajapat and friend Rahul Thakur. Subhash Prajapat said, “I was asked by the police personnel at Neelganga police station to sign a register to get back my phone. I was in the process of doing it when a man lodged in the police lock-up wanted the water bottle I was carrying to quench his thirst. I was about to give my water bottle but a policeman abused me and asked me not to dare to do so. It was when Rahul in a spur of moment gave his water bottle to him.” Subhash alleged, “The police personnel in the police station dragged and lodged Rahul in the lock-up while showering abuses on him and started beating him in front of me. They shooed me away. Since I knew that the police personnel were not going to leave Rahul even if I get back to the police station, I contacted one of my acquaintances and sought his help to get Rahul released from the police station.” Also Read: MP government report: 90% schools without water tap, 40% without powerSubhash said, “On way back home, Rahul told me the policemen had beaten him mercilessly and made him sign some papers too, while threatening to send him to jail. Near Gondia Fanta village Rahul complained about feeling uneasy. I gave him water but he vomited and collapsed. His death was caused due to police personnel’s beating.” The deceased’s cousin Amit Thakur said the cops were not willing to lodge a complaint.“When we approached the police station the police personnel didn’t lodge the complaint. They said an inquiry would be conducted by Chintaman police station under which my village falls after the post-mortem report. This is a clear case of custodial death caused by police brutality. The police personnel should be immediately suspended, tried for murder and sent to jail.” Also Read: Madhya Pradesh: ‘Quarantined’ cop arrested with two others for illegal transportation of liquor He further claimed that the cops had destroyed crucial CCTV footage of the incident. “When we asked the police personnel at Neelganga police station to show us the CCTv footage they said the CCTv was not working since September 24. This is a case of manipulation and destruction of evidence by police itself.” The deceased’s friend Vishal Rawal demanded that an FIR for murder be lodged against guilty police personnel.Neelganga police station in charge Ravindra Yadav admitted that police personnel at the police station had scolded Rahul as he had allegedly given a cigarette and a bidi to the person lodged in the lockup which was against the rules but claimed that nobody beat him up. However, Chintaman police station was looking into the matter. City superintendent of police Rajnish Kashyap said, “Subash Prajapat, the farmer arrested, and those who came to take him home after bail from the court had a drink at a liquor shop. While they were returning home, the deceased had cardiac arrest and died. However, we have asked members of the deceased’s family to lodge a formal complaint and we will conduct an inquiry into it. On their demand we got the post-mortem videographed and they were satisfied that there was no injury mark on the body of the deceased.” According to family members of the deceased, Rahul was the main bread earner in his family. -Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/compassion-costs-youth-his-life-as-beaten-by-police-mercilessly-alleges-family/story-uwIIUgBsaLAROHu2M7S1zK.html
10-10-2020||Lucknow||Opposition parties nurtured criminals for 15 years:Yogi||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday alleged that the Opposition parties nurtured the mafia for 15 years but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took strict action against gangsters and criminals active in the state.He was addressing a virtual meeting of BJP leaders and workers of Malhani (Jaunpur) assembly constituency where a bypoll is scheduled on November 3 along with six other assembly seats in the state. Yogi also alleged that earlier the mafia and criminal elements used to decide the policies of political parties.The criminals had grabbed the land of the poor to establish their empires in the past but they no longer had a free run, he added.In the new Uttar Pradesh, the BJP government was committed to eliminating criminals and demolishing their empires, he said, hinting at an ongoing drive against gangsters across the state.The chief minister said there was no alternative to development, adding the state government was working on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.During the Covid pandemic, the state government distributed pension among 87 lakh beneficiaries, gave electricity connections to four crore households and cooking gas connections to 41 lakh people, he said.Medical colleges were being set up in each division of the state to provide better healthcare facilities to the people, he said.Also Read: Ram temple construction: Carved stones being moved from Nyas workshop to Janmabhoomi He also said the construction of Purvanchal expressway, Bundelkhand expressway, Gorakhpur Link expressway and Ganga expressway was in full swing to provide better connectivity to people. Construction of airports in Kushinagar and Ayodhya had been expedited, he added.Hitting out at the Opposition parties, Yogi Adityanath said those who had no faith in development were bent upon vitiating the atmosphere with the politics of caste, religion and region.Anarchy and corruption ruled the roost when the current Opposition parties were in power earlier, he said, further alleging that development funds were siphoned off at that time.Also Read: BSP chief Mayawati asks Dalits to unite, win power“These parties had spread canards about the BJP government but their tricks would not work as people were well aware of the working of the state government,” Adityanath said.State BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh said mass contact and communication were the most important factors for campaigning during the Covid pandemic. Party leaders and workers should motivate the people to vote and a high polling percentage will definitely pave the way for BJP’s victory, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/opposition-parties-nurtured-criminals-for-15-years-yogi/story-w5kgakCOracBnTQ6o3pF4J.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Nagpur cops booked for parading semi-nude minors as bystanders made videos||A Nagpur police team has landed in trouble for parading a group of semi-naked minors with criminal record in the city recently. Senior police inspector Khushal Tijare, sub-inspector Vijay Dhumal and five constables of detection branch wing of Jaripatka police station in north Nagpur were booked under relevant sections of Juvenile Justice Act on Friday for exposing the identity of minors, parading them in semi-nude state on a busy road and assaulting them. Five minors armed with swords and other weapons had gone berserk inside a bar, where they were consuming alcohol at Jaripatka on September 23 after an argument with the owner of the bar, Sanjay Patil and waiters. The teenagers also robbed some cash from Patil before leaving. The entire incident was captured on CCTV. A team of police officials under Tijare acted swiftly on the police complaint lodged by Patil and nabbed the accused from an eatery at Patanswangi in Nagpur district the next day. Shockingly, all the five boys were paraded in a semi-nude state through a busy road while being brought to the police station. A crowd gathered at the location and cheered and captured videos of the police personnel’s move. Videos of the incident have gone viral on social media, with police personnel getting lauded and slammed in equal measure for their move. In the videos, the minors can be seen being paraded in their undergarments with their hands tied with ropes. Some constables even caned the minors as they marched through the busy street, with people filming them on their mobile phones. The cops also did not allow the minors to wear masks despite a spate of corona cases in Nagpur city.

Following the intervention of the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), a second medical examination of the minors was conducted at the Government Medical College and Hospital which revealed injuries from caning. When the entire episode was brought before the notice of Nagpur commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar, he immediately ordered an inquiry through the assistant commissioner Parshuram Karyakarta and sought an early report. The additional commissioner of police (Addl CP), Navin Reddy said the police personnel were booked after completion of his inquiry. The department is conducting further investigation into the incident and appropriate action would be taken against the police personnel, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nagpur-cops-booked-for-parading-semi-nude-minors-as-bystanders-made-videos/story-CGqERnW9C134W7R9YftDRM.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Of 822 tainted cops in Punjab, 17% being probed for corruption||A report submitted in the Punjab and Haryana high court shows that 17% (140) of the 822 policemen booked in the state are facing allegations of corruption, followed by 8% (68) being probed in drug cases.Department of home affairs deputy secretary Vijay Singh Chauhan has submitted the report after a high court order in September in which the state was told to submit details of FIRs against all serving state police officers along with the nature of criminal cases.Of the 822 cops, 18 are inspectors, 24 sub-inspectors, 170 assistant sub-inspectors and the remaining are constables and head constables. The report does not capture data of cops booked and working under Patiala and Rupnagar ranges and the commissionerate of police in Ludhiana. The report is silent on FIRs against senior officers of the rank of PPS and IPS. Punjab has 80,000 cops. The report shows that 27 (3%) of tainted cops are being investigated for allegation of rapes, gangrapes and sexual offences against minors. 18 cops (2.1%) are such booked and being probed for their role in murder cases and 29 (3%) are being probed for domestic violence cases. In other categories of offences, 538 cops are being probed. The data was sought on the plea of Moga resident Surjit Singh, who had approached the court challenging his dismissal order that Moga SSP had passed. Surjit had told the court that a criminal case against him was pending adjudication, and the dismissal order was discriminatory, as a large number of police officers, who are facing criminal cases are still in service.The data also reveals that out of these 822 cops there are 75 FIRs against cops working in battalions, 140 cops are being probed in the commissionerate of Jalandhar and 70 cops in the commissionerate of Amritsar. There are 82 cops booked for offences under the Faridkot range, 117 under the Border range, 55 under the Ludhiana range, 100 under the Bathinda range and 146 under the Jalandhar range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/of-822-tainted-cops-in-punjab-17-being-probed-for-corruption/story-WpCC1e7JXIwdqz7059TEZJ.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab past Covid-19 peak as daily case count comes down amid high testing||Punjab appears to have passed its Covid-19 peak as it has been witnessing a decline in daily addition of fresh cases in October even as the state health department maintained maximum testing capacity. Friday’s tally of 743 fresh cases is the lowest single-day addition in the state in the past 50 days even as the total number of samples collected the same day was 30,679. Since October 1, the state has added 8,573 fresh cases at a daily average of 952 cases against an average of 2,000 cases a day in September. In August, 37,873 cases were recorded at a daily average of 1,221. The state so far has reported 1,22,459 cases of infection. The health department officials involved in the pandemic management say it can be inferred that the coronavirus spiral is weakening in the state since there was a sharp decline in fresh cases despite high testing. “The trend across the world shows that cases have fallen after reaching their peak. Generally, the virus weakens after hitting the peak. The same appears to have happened in Punjab. Our calculations suggest that by November, the daily addition of cases will go down further,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. With a total of 367 deaths so far, the state has also witnessed a decline in daily addition of fatalities. However, Punjab’s case fatality rate (CFR) continues to be the highest in the county at 3.07%. Can the state witness second peak? The state nodal officer said a second peak of the coronavirus cannot be ruled out in Punjab as of states like Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala witnessed surge in cases even after seeing decline for a while. “Scientists across the world have concluded that coronavirus will not be over until it is over. In many countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, cases jumped in the second wave. If such a scenario arises, we may see the second peak by November-end,” Dr Bhaskar said. Another senior official said the health department has started making arrangements to check such possibility. Plans are afoot to convert rural dispensaries into Covid clinics besides giving charge of testing to sarpanches amid a special campaign for wearing masks, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-past-covid-19-peak-as-daily-case-count-comes-down/story-O6JeGqqJaMRPTrLdcCuUjO.html
10-10-2020||City||Punjab sees six-fold rise in incidents of stubble burning in first 20 days of harvesting||The incidents of stubble burning in Punjab have witnessed a six-fold increase in the first 20 days of the harvesting season when compared with the previous two years. The satellite data shows that the state recorded 1,926 farm fires from September 21 to October 9, against 412 in 2019 and 399 in 2018 during the corresponding period. As per data, Amritsar (920), Tarn Taran (405), Patiala (153) and Gurdaspur (102) have recorded the highest farm fire incidents among Punjab districts. Farmers in these districts sow vegetables after paddy harvesting. “Amritsar had recorded 1,510 fires during entire kharif season last year. Therefore, this year’s number is alarming,” said an official. Satnam Singh Pannu, a farmer leader, said, “Farmers are also burning straw as a mark of protest as the government failed to compensate them for handling of straw last year.” The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) is sending daily inputs to the deputy commissioners and the field staff about the incidents of stubble burning in their areas. So far, 460 farmers have been challaned Rs 12.25 lakh for violations. PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg said, “It is not fair to draw a comparison between the data of just 20 days. The maximum fire incidents took place after third week of October and we have roped in all departments concerned to check such incidents.” “Of the 1,926 cases, nearly half are non-farm incidents,” he claimed. The Punjab government has deputed 8,000 nodal officers in paddy growing villages to check burning of crop residue this year. Stubble burning rampantin Pak border areas too Incidents of widespread stubble burning have been detected in the border areas of Pakistan and the neighbouring state of Haryana, showed the satellite images shared by the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC). In satellite images captured on October 8 and 9, the PRSC spotted farm fires near the border areas of Lahore, Basirpur, Pakpattan, Burewala, Chenab Nagar and Bahawal Nagar in Pakistan. In Haryana, most of straw burning incidents are detected in the areas of Karnal, Pehowa and Ambala. Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head of department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, said, “The main problem occurs between October 15 and November 15 when calm conditions prevail in the northern region and the smoke settles as it is not disbursed properly, resulting in long spells of haze. Moreover, burning of crackers during the festival season compounds the problem.” She said burning of stubble leads to an alarming rise in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and it is a matter of concern for cities like Amritsar, Ludhiana and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-sees-six-fold-rise-in-farm-fires-in-first-20-days-of-harvesting/story-S8nVKCW0N7X3UpoDcG5ccP.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Now, industries in Chandigarh can apply for environmental consent online||For fast disposal of industries’ applications for consent to establish and operate, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Friday launched the “e-consent service”.With this, industrial units can now apply for no-objection certificate online at https://chocmms.nic.in/ instead of visiting the office of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC).Following the approval, the Consent Order can be downloaded from the web portal. The service is available for industries as well as diesel generator owners.Badnore said this was a huge stride towards transparency in governance and fast delivery of services to citizens. E-consent will not only substantially reduce the application’s processing time, but also allow officials to divert their energy to other productive works, he added.Before an industry is established and begins operations, it requires the consent of the CPCC to discharge any effluent (sewage or trade effluent) into a stream or well or sewer or on land, and/or emit air pollutants into the atmosphere.The consent issued by the CPCC under Section 25/26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is known as ‘water consent’ and under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is known as ‘air consent’.Debendra Dalai, member secretary, CPCC, said normally physical copy of the consent was issued after approval of the competent authority, which consumed substantial time of employees, leaving several important areas unattended. “Now, the e-consent will be generated and issued to the units automatically on the approval of the competent authority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-industries-in-chandigarh-can-apply-for-environmental-consent-online/story-eOLU49mE0nnXqm9iTwf7FP.html

These include chairs, armchairs and tables designed for the high court and administrative buildings.“The government needs to urgently intervene in the matter. The recent ASI order regarding banning the export of heritage items through sea and air ports evidences that our nation is committed to stop cultural trafficking,” said Ajay Jagga, a city-based advocate and member of the Heritage Protection Cell, Chandigarh.Trafficking of Chandigarh’s cultural property is going on since 2007, with over 50 auctions having been held in various countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.“The auction of Indian heritage is causing huge loss to nation’s prestige, apart from violating the ASI ban. It is appealed that all Indian embassies be alerted and UN may also be approached reminding its international commitment to UNESCO to combat trafficking of cultural objects,” Jagga wrote in a letter to Union minister of external affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-heritage-items-to-go-under-the-hammer-in-london/story-spVMOOxysl0YxoHZWKw5PP.html

10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Covid cases in Chandigarh hit plateau, but there’s no room for complacency||The Covid-19 pandemic in the city has seemingly reached a plateau, with the growth rate of new infections falling from being the country’s highest at 5% in early September to 1% on Friday.From 12,212 cases on October 2, the tally rose to 12,985 on October 9, a weekly growth rate of 1%. This is in sharp contrast to the cases reported last month, when the infections were swelling at an average of 1,870 per week.It is also coupled with the downward trend shown in the number of active cases in the past three weeks, even as the recovery rate also stands at a sizeable 88%.“It is difficult to say how the situation will evolve from here on out, but the trajectory of cases shows that the curve is flattening. While the number of tests has decreased, the ratio of positive results has not shown a major jump. This is a positive sign and our fingers remain crossed,” UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said. Dr Amandeep Kang, UT’s director, health and family welfare, said the strategy of declaring affected areas as micro-containment zones had returned good results.“On Friday, 1,020 samples were collected and only 63 people tested positive. This is the second time in the last few days that the daily cases have remained below 100. But, with the festival season ahead, people should continue to exercise caution by maintaining distance, wearing masks and ensuring hand hygiene,” she said. ‘DON’T LOWER YOUR GUARD’However, experts have cautioned that with more curbs being lifted on commercial activities and schools reopening, chances of the infection growing again remained.“The pandemic is not over. Lowering out guard can prove risky. The festival season ahead will lead to crowding of public as well as indoor spaces, increasing chances of spread of infection. With the health services playing their role, residents also need to exercise precautions,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the community medicine department, Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. On health department’s plans to deal with more restrictions being removed, Dr Kang said, “We will focus on information and education activities. There are apprehensions that crowding at public places will increase, but people should not be complacent until we reach a level where negligible cases are detected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-cases-in-chandigarh-hit-plateau-but-there-s-no-room-for-complacency/story-Ko9sak4YE7GaUwjjCqTvuK.html

10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Graft case: Special CBI court grants anticipatory bail to Bathinda bizman||A special court of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday granted anticipatory bail to a Bathinda businessman in a graft case involving former deputy chief labour commissioner Mahesh Chand Sharma. Accused Lakhwinder Singh had moved court after he was named as an accused in the chargesheet filed by CBI. The CBI court of special judge Sushil Kumar Garg allowed his bail plea saying, “In an event of his surrendering before the court within 10 days, he shall be released on regular bail on furnishing the bail bond in the sum of ₹1 lakh with one surety in the like amount subject to the conditions that he will not leave the country without prior permission of the court, will not try to hamper with the investigation of the case, will not influence the prosecution witnesses and will appear on each and every date of hearing.” It may be mentioned here that CBI had in July filed a chargesheet against eight persons in a ₹1.3-lakh graft case, involving the then deputy chief labour commissioner Mahesh Chand Sharma. On May 30, 2019, CBI had arrested five people, including Sharma, the then labour enforcement officer Vivek Naik, Gurmeet Sidhu and Munish Garg of Advantage HR Solutions, along with Akhand Raj Singh of Nagarjuna Construction Company Limited, Bathinda. Sharma and Naik were caught red-handed receiving a bribe of ₹1.3 lakh from the two partners of the HR firm and employee of the construction firm. The bribe was allegedly meant for favourable labour report to the Bathinda firm, while the HR personnel were reportedly acting as middlemen in the garb of their Bathinda-based consultancy. According to the FIR, Naik had on May 8 conducted an inspection at the construction company and detected irregularities. Following this, firm employee Akhand Raj contacted Sidhu and complained that despite the quarterly payoffs, the inspection was carried out and the management had been asked to meet the officials personally. On May 15, Sidhu contacted Naik and allegedly discussed the bribe amount. On May 29, Sidhu allegedly collected ₹1.5 lakh from the deputy general manager of the company and told Akhand Raj to arrange ₹35,000 for two quarters of the year, and ₹35,000 for inspection. He was also directed to visit Chandigarh on May 30. The same day, the CBI laid a trap at a Panchkula hotel where the five accused were slated to meet and arrested them on the spot. Later, three more persons — Inderjeet Singh Baath, Lakhwinder Singh and Venkata Ramiah — were also made accused. CBI had said that their files were also pending with the deputy chief labour commissioner. They had agreed to give money for getting their work done. The eight accused have been chargesheeted under sections 7 (offence relating to public servant being bribed), 7A (taking undue advantage to influence public servant by corrupt or illegal means or by exercise of personal influence) and 8 (taking gratification, in order, by corrupt or illegal means, to influence public servant) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/graft-case-special-cbi-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-bathinda-bizman/story-cSHbRafp4KpW2A9F1eH2KL.html
10-10-2020||City||Ludhiana’s local population more prone to contracting Covid: Study||The local population is more prone to contracting Covid-19, suggested a study conducted by the community medicine department of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) in Ludhiana. The study that covered Ludhiana’s population has also pointed out that while migrants are getting themselves tested, the native Punjabis have expressed reluctance in undergoing examination. Dr Anurag Chaudhary, professor and head of community medicine department, said, “It was found that as compared to migrants, the Punjabi population is at more risk. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was relatively less among the migrant labourers as compared to the locals. So, they are more vulnerable,” said Dr Chaudhary.The department had started screening from August 26 and carried out more than 8,000 rapid antigen tests. Among those who underwent tests, only 237 migrants were found positive. Dr Chaudhary said it was found that during initial days, in the first and second weeks of September, daily count of Covid positives detected was high, while the number started declining gradually by third and fourth weeks.“We had carried out testing drives in factories and labour quarters across the city to find out the prevalence of virus among the migrant and marginalised population. During these drives, migrants were more forthcoming in getting themselves tested, while the Punjabi workers were reluctant. Other health tests conducted on migrants showed that they had high immunity levels as compared to the locals,” said the doctor. Locals’ reliance on self-medicationIt was also found that rather than getting themselves tested, the native workers were relying on self-medication.“That is one of the reasons behind the high mortality rate in the district. There is prevalence of hypertension and diabetes among the local population due to its eating habits. Then there are issues of avoidance of tests and self-medication. These are the reasons why many patients are rushed to hospitals in critical condition,” said Dr Chaudhary.DMCH’s department of community medicine was enrolled by the state government under its ‘Mission Fateh’ campaign to carry out Covid testing on a wide scale and coordinate with the government and other agencies to arrest the growth of the virus further, he added.

10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC taps into ₹10 crore fixed deposit to pay salaries, bills||Struggling to pay salaries, wages and its outstanding bills, Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) on Friday was forced to tap into its fixed deposit (FD) savings before its maturity.The fund-starved corporation withdrew one of its FD of ₹10 crore for the purpose. The remainder, about ₹6 crore, will again be deposited as a fixed deposit, said a senior MC official requesting anonymity. Against the committed liabilities of ₹597 crore, MC expects to get less than ₹580 crore. However, during the Covid-19 crisis, MC has lowered its revenue collection projections and even the grant-in-aid has been cut by 20% on a quarterly basis. The corporation has to pay ₹420 crore as salaries, ₹50 crore as pensions, ₹120 crore as electricity bills, and ₹100 crore as fuel expenses.“In such a situation, the MC had to take money out of an FD to clear its committed liabilities. When the fund could not be raised from MC’s revenue, the accounting department decided to withdraw savings before maturity,” said the official. MC has sought ₹1, 232 crore under the revised budget estimates from the administration. Of this amount, ₹1,072 crore is under revenue head. Only ₹115 crore is to be utilised for development works. NO FUNDS FOR VILLAGE DEVELOPMENTNotably, the UT administration has refused to provide funds for development works in 13 villages and Manimajra, which were recently included in the MC. The civic body had sought ₹125 crore for the development work in villages and ₹13 crore for Manimajra. The administration has stated that provision of these funds would be considered after UT’s revised estimates are approved by the Centre, which is expected by January 2021.The MC’s request to waive the 20% cut in expenditure, mandated by the central government in UT’s expenditure, has so far elicited no positive response from the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-taps-into-10-cr-fixed-deposit-to-pay-salaries-bills/story-GlcO3DPqOglZnIRAhh1CUN.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Four Mohali fertiliser dealers lose licence over malpractice||The Mohali agriculture department has suspended licences of four dealers after irregularities were detected in distribution of urea in the district, deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan said on Friday. For violation of Section 5 of the Fertilizer Control Order, 1985, the chief agriculture officer-cum-licensing authority has suspended licences of Thandi Fertilizers, Kharar; New Zimidara Khaad Store, Handsera; Chattar Sen Ramesh Kumar, Dera Bassi; and Aggarwal Khaad Bhandaar, Banur. Under the Centre’s direct benefit transfer (DBT) on fertilisers’ scheme, sale of fertilisers has been mandated with the use of biometric identification of farmer on PoS machines. Due to Covid-19 crisis, the biometric authentication of farmers on PoS was suspended by the government. Taking undue advantage of the situation, some of the firms were reported to have diverted the subsidised fertilisers, the DC said. Taking immediate cognisance of the matter, the officials of Mohali agriculture department were directed to conduct random checks and monitor sale of urea. The department examined the records of top-21 urea buyers and found out that eight dealers had made bulk purchases. A detailed inquiry revealed that four out of the eight dealers had logged fake sales entries of the urea sold. Verification from farmers brought to the fore the fact that they had made no such purchase and the fertiliser sellers had wrongly shown them as buyers. Subsequently, the firms concerned were issued show-cause notices and on not receiving a satisfactory reply, their licences were suspended, Dayalan said. “The administration will increase the frequency of raids to ensure proper and legitimate sale of fertilisers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/four-mohali-fertiliser-dealers-lose-licence-over-malpractice/story-WLp1l8hUg96koY6UZwf0RP.html

10-10-2020||Mumbai||Thane cops set aside Saturday to redress women’s grievances||With more than 500 woman-related grievances registered since May this year, the Thane police department has now allotted every Saturday to address these issues in the commissionerate.As per the police records, they have registered 502 official complaints since May, out of which 387 have being resolved. Most of the complaints were related to domestic violence, harassment, triple talaq and stalking.The police helpline has received hundreds of distress calls during the lockdown from women seeking advice or wanting to register a complaint. As women could not reach the woman redressal cell during the lockdown, most calls were made on police helpline numbers. With the mounting complaints, the commissionerate started the Saturday initiative since the last two weeks, wherein a panel of woman constables and police inspector addresses the grievances in each police station across the commissionerate.Assistant Police Commissioner, Sunil Bajare, said, “Every day, we receive two to three calls on our police helpline relating to woman issues. We don’t have the exact data on number of calls. However, most complaints were of domestic violence, dowry harassment, divorce or stalking. As per the guidelines of police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar, our teams used to counsel them or in case the matter was serious, we used to ask the local police station to go and resolve it. Registering a complaint is the last option. We prefer the matter be resolved amicably.”He informed that since May, though the calls received were many, 502 formal complaints were registered across five zones in the commissionerate in merely four months. Of these, 172 were of domestic violence. Last year, these complaints were recorded by the women redressal cell, which recorded more than 1,000 complaints in 12 months.Bajare added, “So far, we have resolved 387 complaints while the remaining are in the process. With the mounting figures, though, the commissioner suggested to dedicate one day of the week to these complaints. We have also joined hands with the NGOs and over the last two Saturdays, resolved the problems either amicably or by filing a complaint, if necessary. In the last two Saturdays, we have been approached by over 500 women across the police stations in the five zones.”Another factor leading to the decision was four cases of suicide by women below 30 after harassment by in-laws and triple talaq cases registered in Bhiwandi, Mumbra and Rabodi during lockdown. Police have reached out to several women who have complained on the helpline number and called them for counselling along with their family members to the nearest police station.An official added, “In the Saturday session, most cases were related to domestic violence, husband forcing divorce on the wife. A few girls also complained of being stalked, being sent lewd messages or forced to get married. We have called the complainants, the family members and also family members of the person against whom the complaint is made. We tried to settle some of them on the spot. Those that weren’t resolved amicably were sent to the concerned police station for legal action.”Earlier, these issues were resolved by the women redressal cell. However, during lockdown, it was difficult for the women to reach the cell.Police sub-inspector, B Chikne, of the cell said, “Most women could not reach us physically due to the lockdown and so most complaints were made to the local police station. We tried to counsel those who reached us and in case the matter was critical, especially in cases of extreme domestic violence, we have suggested to them to leave their homes and go to their parents’ place for safety. Since the Unlock began, women have started returning to the cell.”ACTIVIST SPEAK*** One of the social workers in Thane, Parikshit Dhume, who has started helpline to solve people’s problems during the lockdown, claimed that he has received 15,000 calls. About 45 per cent of them were women domestic issues and suicidal tendencies because of domestic problems. He said, “ Our helpline counsellors were really shocked when, in every 10 calls, two were of women facing domestic issues, torture and wanted to go out of the house and were asking for help. Some of them displayed suicidal tendencies. We forwarded such calls to police stations to handle the situation.”*** Another social worker from Zone 4 area of Thane commissionerate, Jyoti Ambekar, who works with police for solving these cases, said, “Although home may be considered a safe place for some, it is not the safest place for all. In fact, with Covid-19 lockdown in place, there has been an increase in domestic violence cases. Husbands were frustrated due to loss of job or do not have the habit to stay back home for a long day would harass the wife by shouting at her for small things, beating her, or intimidating her. These cases not only found in economically-weaker sections but also in the middle and upper-middle class. In other cases, women who are living alone get into trouble themselves by creating friendship with someone unknown and face trouble.”VICTIM SPEAK *** An Ambernath-based woman Kirti Jagtap (name changed), 28, said, “I got married three years ago and since then I have been suffering from domestic violence issues. I am a graduate and trying to pursue my education further to help my husband. But, he physically assaults me whenever he gets frustrated due to his job problems. In May, I approached the Ambernath Police station, I did not want to break my marriage, but also could not take the abuse. The police counselled us and convinced my husband to take up counselling from NGOs. The counselling helped and my husband no longer abuses me. Once lockdown is over, I will pursue my career. A female police officer regularly calls to keep a check on us.” CASE STUDY *** Ambernath police station senior police inspector S Dhumal said, “In one of the cases, in July, a 35-year-old woman complained about her husband beating her up for not making good food. The woman didn’t want to register a complaint. We called both of them and their parents, and did one-to-one conversation. Our team has given all knowledge of law and discussed the man’s real problem. We counselled them for two Sundays and later keep in touch with the woman to check whether he was behaving well or not. Fortunately, he understood and now everything is fine. Our woman constables are in touch with them over social media messengers.”*** In Dombivli, a Class 10 girl reported her mother’s ordeal over phone. Mahatma Phule Police immediately reached the girl’s house. A police officer said, “The husband would torture the woman over small issues by not allowing her to have lunch and would beat her too. The daughter, who could not bear the trouble, gave us a call. We went to their house, had a meeting with the person. He said that he has been facing anger issues as he lost his job. We tried to counsel him, called him to the police station thrice and now he is behaving fine with his wife, at least not troubling her.”HELPLINE: 100 and 103||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-cops-set-aside-saturday-to-redress-women-s-grievances/story-6xnfrVMaJvsnVOK1xzyJFP.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Chhota Shakeel’s aide arrested by Mumbai crime branch in ₹9 crore cheating case||A close associate of gangster Chhota Shakeel has been arrested by anti-extortion cell officers of Mumbai crime branch.Kulvinder Singh Bains alias Jimmy Bains alias Ajay alias Pappu was wanted in a 2019 case of cheating a western suburbs builder Vijay Thakkar of over ₹9 crore in connection with a Juhu bungalow. The case was earlier probed by Mumbai economic offenses wing (EOW) but later it got transferred to crime branch given the underworld background of people involved in it.In this case of cheating and forgery, Bains and another suspect Sohail Bhamla were wanted and the EOW had opened a look out circular (LOC) against the two. Bhamla was detained last year at the Mumbai international airport, but EOW officials had let him go after an enquiry after finding no need of his arrest. However, this didn’t go well with the then commissioner of police Sanjay Barve who had suspended two EOW officers and ordered an inquiry. Few months later, the two officers were reinstated. “Bains, who is believed to be in contact with Bhamla, had been working for Shakeel since years. Few years ago, he had holed up in Australia for quite some time and on Shakeel’s instructions had gone to Kenya for a ‘operation’. However, an attack was carried out on him by a rival gang. After that he had escaped from Kenya and has been hiding in India. He remained mostly in the northern India states like Punjab and Delhi,” said a crime branch officer requesting anonymity.Based on specific information AEC officers learnt that Bains had been staying in Mumbai for quite some time. Hence, his location was tracked and on Monday night he was arrested from Andaaz Cafe in Andheri Lokhandwala. “His interrogation has revealed that he had taken Rs 5 crore from the complainant under the pretext of resolving his matter and cheated him,” said a crime branch official part of the investigation. He was produced before the court and was remanded in police custody up to October 13.In the past, Bains has been named in many underworld-related murder and extortion cases. He had even escaped from the police custody in 2000. In 2004 he was arrested by Delhi Police special cell from Pahadganj area of Central Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chhota-shakeel-s-aide-arrested-by-mumbai-crime-branch-in-9-crore-cheating-case/story-uq9SJNYjseRDkYHrNYCdrJ.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s blood banks run dry, stock to last only for a week||Even though the state government has begun to relax the lockdown, citizens are still hesitating to donate blood. Officials at the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) said the city’s blood banks have stock only for a week. The city’s daily requirement of blood is approximately 900 units. During the lockdown, the requirement was lower since public movement was restricted and hospitals received fewer non-Covid cases that required blood transfusion (like accident patients). With restrictions being relaxed, the demand for blood is now increasing. However, the city is not even receiving 50% of the required amount. Blood banks at major civic-run hospitals like King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Parel didn’t have any whole blood units as of October 8. KEM Hospital usually receives the highest number of patients in the city and it had only components of blood. “We got a message in the WhatsApp group of our medical college that the blood bank has dried up completely. So, around 20 resident doctors donated their blood,” said a resident doctor at KEM Hospital, who is also from Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD). To address the shortage of blood, SBTC issued a circular on September 29, asking organisers of Navratri events to set up blood donation camps. “Organizers of Navratri should create awareness regarding Covid-19, dengue, malaria instead of conducting garba and dandiya. They should organise blood donation camps,” read SBTC’s circular. “Since the outbreak [of Covid-19], blood donation camps are recording only 50% response from the public. Even though people are going out with the gradual relaxation of the lockdown, they refuse to donate blood. We have blood stock only for a week,” said Dr Arun Thorat, director, SBTC. Due to restrictions imposed by the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC), private blood banks are not able to set up donation camps, which has impacted their collections and stock. Unlike blood banks attached to hospitals, private blood banks rely completely on voluntary donors. “Many of these charitable organisations are busy with Covid-19 duties. There is a fear among the public about contracting the virus through blood transfusions. ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] needs to raise awareness among people,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association ofMedical Consultants (AMC). Blood transfusion is the main treatment for patients suffering from thalassemia and haemophilia. Transfusion is frequently required for accident survivors, aside from those with other health complications. Often, patients require only freshly-drawn blood, which means the blood units cannot be more than a week from their collection date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-blood-banks-run-dry-stock-to-last-only-for-a-week/story-S4pz0sJBfSSwdjyp6dkcqN.html

He approached a building construction material supplier and demanded he get all the work contracts in the area.“The accused brandished a country-made pistol in front of the complainant and threatened to kill him. After the complainant registered a case, we went to arrest Kaikade. We are probing if he has threatened other developers and contractors as well” said Shatrughan Mali, inspector at Panvel city police station.When the police reached his house on Wednesday around 5 am, Kaikade tried to resist arrest. He did not open the door, after which police resorted to breaking it. Realising that there was no way to escape, he let the police officials in. When he was being detained, he allegedly hit his head on the window grill to hurt himself, police claimed.Kaikade suffered minor head injuries.His criminal history dates back to almost a decade and he has been arrested in heinous crimes including gang-rape and attempted murder as well.In 2012, Kaikade was arrested along with his two brothers and another person for killing former sarpanch, Sada Sable, who was then the vice-president of Karnala Sports Club in Karanjade.In 2009, Kaikade was also arrested in a gang-rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman. Kaikade and the trio, which included two minors, attacked the woman and raped her before strangulating her.Officials said Kaikade was also booked under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) but has been acquitted in that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/history-sheeter-held-in-navi-mumbai-cartridges-pistol-recovered/story-8IMaWXNtoq4niEhwGMjgpI.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maratha reservation: Maharashtra government postpones MPSC exams||Under pressure from the Maratha community outfits that are unhappy over the stay on quota by the Supreme Court, the state government on Friday postponed Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) examinations scheduled to be held on Sunday.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, however, said the decision was taken in the wake of the requests received from the students from across the communities seeking more time for the preparations in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.CM Thackeray said on Friday that the exams for the 200 posts are being postponed for one last time.“We have been talking to various organisations over the last few days. The students appearing for the exam had requested us to postpone as they could not get the time and a suitable atmosphere in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic as many schools, colleges, classes, study centres were defunct. Some of the students are infected by the virus. Keeping their interest in mind, we have decided to postpone the exams. The decision about the new date of exam will be declared after discussion with MPSC and departments concerned,” he said.Thackeray said that all those who are eligible for the exam on the age criterion this time will be allowed to appear for the exam once it is announced. This has been for the second time that the exam is postponed. Thackeray said that not only Maratha, but students from other communities too had demanded the postponement of the exam.CM Thackeray, his senior cabinet colleagues held rounds of meetings with various Maratha outfits and their leader over the last two days after they announced to boycott the exams and ransack the exam centres. Thackeray along with his cabinet colleagues, public works department minister and head of the sub-committee appointed for the reservation Ashok Chavan, water resources minister Jayant Patil, transport minister Anil Parab, interacted digitally with more about 65 leaders from various organisations on Friday, before the announcement. However, the Maratha leaders were divided over the postponement of the exam.The government, on Thursday, had met three delegations led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament (MP) Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje, BJP legislator Vinayak Mete and Maratha Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti chief Suresh Patil.The delegations had demanded the cancellation of exam in the wake of the stay given to the reservation by the Supreme Court last month. The leaders had demanded that the exam should be held only after the decision over the reservation was done in the Apex court.Reacting on the decision, BJP MP and Maratha leader Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje said that now they expect the state government to take steps to ensure the vacation of the stay on the reservation. “We had warned the government, but it was not a threat. You may call it a pressure tactic and there is nothing wrong in doing so in the interest of the community. The decision is a welcome step and it will prove in the interest of students from all communities,” he saidAshok Chavan said that the government was positive about the other demands by the Maratha community and decisions will be taken into them after due deliberation. Around 2.61 lakh students were expected to appear for the exam for 200 officers’ posts in various government departments.Meanwhile, CM Thackeray and his cabinet colleagues also met leaders from Other Backward Classes and Dhangar (Shepherd) community who have been protesting over reservation issues. OBCs are wary over the possibility of Marathas being included in the category if the SEBC reservation did not stand the legal scrutiny. Dhangars have been demanding their inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes category.JD Tandel, vice president, OBC Sangharsh Samanway Samiti said, after the meeting, “We were expecting a firm decision on our demands, but CM assured us to appoint a cabinet sub-committee to discuss our issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-reservation-maharashtra-government-postpones-mpsc-exams/story-shJCTgzQi3XK0SuVU6FMWI.html

When the woman returned with the bill only to find the man missing, she approached the police and registered a cheating case.“Similarly, in September, he cheated an elderly woman of 17 gm gold. The woman claimed the accused pretended to be an officer and asked her the gold to check whether it’s real or fake,” said a police officer.Pramod Sanap, assistant police inspector of Bazarpeth police station, said: “We started the investigation and with the help of local sources, found about Nair being released on bail.

10-10-2020||Mumbai||NMSEZ damaged Uran mangroves, wetlands, reveals RTI||The Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ), a proposed integrated industrial township across 4,000 acres in Uran, has undertaken illegal reclamation across three locations in the taluka, according to details revealed through a right to information (RTI) response from the state.Official records of the revenue department’s investigations over the past year submitted by the state mangrove cell in response to the RTI query by NGO Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (SEAP) show that NMSEZ undertook landfilling without permissions at Panje, Bhendkhal, and Pagote, and were also responsible for chopping mangroves over three acres at Pagote. These areas are located towards the eastern seafront of the Mumbai harbour in Raigad district.“NMSEZ has always been in denial that it has not done any environmental harm, but the RTI response amply proves the severity of environmental violations,” said Nandkumar Pawar, head, SEAP.Environment groups NatConnect Foundation and SEAP wrote to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday ahead of World Migratory Birds Day (October 10), requesting the state to declare Panje a bird sanctuary and provide permanent protection to other affected areas.The RTI response further stated that inspection reports, as submitted by the Raigad collector, confirmed damage to ecologically sensitive zones, and NMSEZ had been booked for cases at Pagote and Bhendkhal. The truck driver of a dumper (dumping debris), which belonged to the contractor appointed by NMSEZ was booked for the violation at Panje.Panje and Bhendkhal have been proposed by the mangrove cell as conservation reserves and also demarcated as satellite wetlands of the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary. However, no areas in Uran have been notified by the state environment department as wetlands under the 2017 wetland rules.Nidhi Choudhari, district collector and magistrate, Raigad, said, “On all complaints received on mangroves destruction, the administration has taken necessary action and filed a first information report (FIR) with the police department. In the NMSEZ case, an FIR was filed and the work was immediately stopped.”Ravi Kulkarni, general manager, NMSEZ said, “I am not aware of any environmental violations in Uran by NMSEZ. However, whenever there have been any complaints, we have forwarded the grievances to the revenue department or the forest department. In some cases, we have assisted both state bodies during their investigation.” The RTI response by the Uran regional forest officer also said as many as 5,333 mangrove saplings needed to be planted to compensate for the damage at Pagote. “Since the land is privately owned by NMSEZ, the government agency could not do the plantation,” the RTI response said.Neenu Somraj, member secretary of the Bombay high court (HC) appointed mangrove and wetland redressal committee and deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell), said, “Entire submissions from the revenue department are with us. Now, we have directed the local police to complete their investigation and the charge sheet for FIRs filed against NMSEZ. The committee has asked the police to submit their status report by the next hearing.”NMSEZ is owned 26% by state body City Industrial Development Corporation Limited (Cidco) and 74% by private investors. According to Cidco, 5,250 acres in Uran are proposed to be developed for industries and residential zones, of which 4,125 acres has already been handed over to NMSEZ, the special planning authority for the notified areas in of Dronagiri, Kalamboli, Ulwe (waterfront) and Ulwe (airport) nodes of Navi Mumbai, under the provisions of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.An NMSEZ official requesting anonymity said, “No dumping of debris or site development work has been undertaken on NMSEZ land in Panje or any of the other Uran areas in the last few years. Also, there is no question of wetland destruction as these sites agricultural land acquired by the Maharashtra government and handed over to Cidco for development of industrial and residential areas.”Uran’s local fishing community has been opposing NMSEZ’s project citing loss of livelihood as their fishing areas are allegedly being reclaimed while environmentalists have opposed proposed activities since they impede migratory bird roosting. “The RTI clarifies that all our previous complaints stand vindicated, and it is now up to the state to take appropriate action,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nmsez-damaged-uran-mangroves-wetlands-reveals-rti/story-gyUqLpQU6rdBJUrJKTe0gI.html

They then asked her to leave after Deshpande insisted on seeing the registration certificate of the shop, the writer has alleged. Upset over the incident, Deshpande sat outside the shop in protest for at least 20 hours.“When I went to buy jewellery, he [Jain] started talking to me in Hindi. I told him to speak in Marathi. He said he will not speak in Marathi and that he was not even interested in selling his jewellery to me. I then asked him for his registration certificate, which he refused to show. Following this, I called the police, but they took his side, due to which I was forced to agitate,” said Deshpande.After the incident was brought to light, MNS workers reached the spot in large numbers and slapped Jain.“We will break his arrogance using our MNS style and will not allow this shop to open till they start talking to customers in Marathi,” said party leader Sandeep Deshpande.Sandeep said the writer suffers from multiple health issues and the owner did not consider her age or condition before misbehaving with her.Jain was later taken to Colaba police station. He later apologised for the incident. “I was born in Mumbai and respect the Marathi language. I am sorry for the mistake and will not repeat it,” said Jain.Thackeray during his conversation with Deshpande asked her to take care of her health.“You have done the right thing and we will support your cause,” said the CM.Deshpande then withdraw her agitation. “I am appalled by this attitude of openly insulting Marathi, which is state language. They [businessmen] conduct their business for decades in Mumbai and refuse to learn Marathi,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/veteran-writer-protests-for-20-hours-after-mumbai-jeweller-refuses-to-speak-to-her-in-marathi-maharashtra-cm-assures-her-support/story-qMzqO2Ex1lLeBlZy9MvodM.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||More Covid deaths among men compared to women, shows research by Mumbai civic body||A total of 5,110 of the 92,827 men – 5.5% – suffering from Covid-19 in the city died, while 2,655 deaths (4.6%) were reported among the city’s 57,436 women patients in this period, according to an analytical research conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) of the data from the start of the outbreak till September 6. Civic officials said higher mobility for work was one of the reasons behind the higher rate of Covid deaths among men. The research also revealed that proportion of women patients with co-morbidities is higher than compared to men. Shashank Joshi, member of state’s Covid task force, said, “It is absolutely true that there is a gender bias. Firstly, women are a biologically superior sex. Also, estrogen, which is a female hormone, is protective against Covid compared to testosterone (male hormone) which is detrimental to Covid and mortality too. The host immune response of men is weaker. So the cause for a higher mortality rate in men is purely hormonal.” The research also revealed that deaths up to the age of 60 are decreasing gradually for both men and women. BMC said the reason is improvement in availability of hospital beds and line of treatment “We have invested significantly in data analytics to get a fair idea of the Covid situation in Mumbai and accordingly frame our health policies. For instance, we have used something called as ‘predictive analytics’ to forecast case counts to appropriately plan for management of healthcare machinery. We have conducted artificial intelligence-based screenings, which included chest X-ray and retina scan to detect Covid and identify possible co-morbidities among high risk contacts,” said a senior civic official. A team of analysts were roped in to work on Covid data analytics in BMC’s Covid war room that was headed by additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-covid-deaths-among-men-compared-to-women-shows-research-by-mumbai-civic-body/story-0kajXD0F2RZnndNlg3J4gP.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Shiv Sena MP seeks probe into misuse of social media platforms||Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah and Union minister for information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad to investigate the misuse of social media platforms to “spread lies, and hate, and to destabilise governments as well as undermine constitutional institutions”. In her letter, the Rajya Sabha MP also called for formulation of guidelines urgently to hold social media companies accountable.Chaturvedi, in her two-page letter, referred to the 1 lakh “fake and illegitimate” social media accounts that were created to the intent to malign the Maharashtra government and Mumbai Police. The Mumbai Police recently found that over 1 lakh fake social media accounts were created a day after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.“In context of the suicide of an actor in Mumbai, numerous social media accounts were used to spread conspiracy theories and cast aspersions on the efficiency of the Mumbai Police,” Chaturvedi wrote in the letter, adding that freedom of expression was used to throw up unsubstantiated and unwarranted allegations on the fair investigation through fake bots.Calling for guidelines to hold social media companies accountable, she said these companies operate on two pillars — calling themselves intermediaries, and second, they self-regulate through community guidelines. “The decade-old argument that as intermediaries they have no responsibility cannot be accepted anymore… Keeping in mind all of the above points, I urge the government to take urgent action on these matters and initiate a free, fair, and bipartisan investigation on the roles of these platforms to destroy basic tenets of democratic framework,” she wrote.She also said that if the heads of Facebook and Twitter can be called upon by the Unites States Congress to answer questions and are being investigated in an open forum, “Then why is it that the Indian government is even hesitating to ask them to explain their role in our nation?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-shiv-sena-mp-seeks-probe-into-misuse-of-social-media-platforms/story-4mWrSIr3WJI87WzntifuNM.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||CBI could be pressured to reject AIIMS report in Sushant Singh Rajput case, says Congress||Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is likely to face pressure from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which faced embarrassment in view of the AIIMS report in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.Sawant said BJP leaders supported the news channel facing probe for TRP scam just because it has been running their agenda. “By using social media and news channels in favour of them, the BJP has been trying to defame the state government ruled by opposition parties. The modus operandi was used in SSR case to create suspicious atmosphere against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra. The fake accounts on social media were used to create a narrative against the state government, and the news channel was party to it. The BJP fell flat on its face in SSR case after AIIMS report stated that there was no possibility of poisoning in the actor’s death. We are afraid that BJP could pressure CBI to rubbish the AIIMS report to save its [BJP’s] face and avoid further embarrassment in Bihar Assembly elections,” he said.BJP has rubbished Congress claims calling it ‘hallucinations’. “The AIIMS report has not yet been submitted in the court. Let the court hear the case and the report go through scrutiny after CBI presents its probe report in the court. The Congress is jumping guns and has reached the conclusion out of its hallucinations. The truth will soon come out,” said BJP vice-president Madhav Bhadari.Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14, following which the Mumbai Police started a probe. Later, CBI and NCB started investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbi-could-be-pressured-to-reject-aiims-report-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case-says-congress/story-OZEAaQmL9aotK7cyRtuy7L.html
10-10-2020||Kolkata||Vijayvargiya, Menon among 24 BJP leaders booked in Bengal for agitation amid Covid-19 pandemic||As many as 24 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national secretary Arvind Menon, have been booked by the Kolkata Police for violating Central guidelines on gatherings and political rallies during Thursday’s mega agitation amid Covid-19 pandemic.Organised by the party’s youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the agitation witnessed pitched battles between the police and the party workers in parts of Kolkata and Howrah. The BJP leaders were also charged with destroying public property and violating prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC, said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.“This is nothing new for us. Police in this state has brought around 30,000 false charges against hundreds of our workers and leaders in recent past. We will fight it out in court. We condemn the manner in which the police attacked us yesterday. Neither democracy nor this government can be saved with such tactics,” said Ghosh.He claimed that the BJP workers were attacked without any provocation. “The police are behaving like Trinamool Congress cadres,” he said. Ghosh led a silent march in the heart of Kolkata on Friday evening in protest against the police action. More than 200 BJP workers took part in it. Around the same time, a candlelight march was organised at Titagarh in the North 24 Parganas district by Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh in demand for a CBI probe into the murder of BJP leader Manish Shukla on Sunday.The Centre has banned gatherings and political rallies having more than 100 people under the National Disaster Management Act in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The BJP and the BJYM claimed that more than one lakh people from Kolkata and adjoining districts took part.Also read: Video of Sikh man’s turban being pulled at BJP’s Kolkata march sparks outrageThe BJYM organised the ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (march to Nabanna) programme to raise its voice on issues ranging from alleged lack of employment opportunities in Bengal to law and order problems. BJP and BJYM leaders claimed that around 1,500 workers were injured during baton charge by the police who stopped them from moving towards Nabanna, the state secretariat in Howrah, violating prohibitory orders.Ghosh alleged that the police hurled crude bombs at BJP workers from a house in Howrah. The state police tweeted that the policemen seen in a video circulated by the BJP were throwing tear gas grenades. “This is a lie. Two BJP workers suffered bomb injuries at that spot,” said Ghosh.Interestingly, the BJP’s allegation - that a strong chemical was used by the police in the purple water that was sprayed on the agitators on Thursday - found support from its rivals.BJYM national president and Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore South, Tejasvi Surya said on Thursday he will urge the Centre to probe the matter.On Friday, the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), the state’s most prominent human rights group that has targeted the BJP on various issues in the past, moved the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on this issue.“This use of coloured dye to mark the protesters is a crude violation of human rights by the government of West Bengal. International human rights movement since long opposed this type of coloured identification and division of masses by colour marking and use of colour dye in water cannons for identification or for any reasons cited,” Ranjit Sur, vice-president of the APDR wrote to the chairman of the NHRC.“Moreover the colours used in the cannons are not at all good for human use and contain lead particles which are poisonous. This type of colour dye develops health issues when in contact with human bodies. So in all respects, it is a violation of human rights of citizens,” wrote Sur.The Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), a partner in the Left Front, also condemned the use of the purple dye. “The BJP workers might have been unruly but all this might not justify the heinous use of brutality in spraying methyl violet on the demonstrators. The West Bengal Police indulged in a similar manner of criminal offence as so frequently used by the fascist tactics of the J&K Police. The RSP strongly condemns such high handed and brutal acts of the state police,” RSP state secretary Manoj Bhattacharya said in a public statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/vijayvargiya-menon-among-24-bjp-leaders-booked-in-bengal-for-agitation-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-el4TnKTTeBtGf9m9oAxe4I.html

10-10-2020||Delhi||Experts sound caution over Delhi’s new tree policy||Experts and green activists have sounded a note of concern over the Delhi government’s new tree transplantation policy, saying most native and old trees cannot survive translocation. The survival rate of transplanted trees is very low while the process itself incurs a high cost and so the 80% target set under the policy is not achievable, the experts cautioned. The new policy aims to preserve trees that are hundreds of years old, and which are affected by development projects. Under the policy, 80% of trees uprooted for any construction or development project must be mandatorily transplanted. In addition, it must be ensured at least 80% of the transplanted trees survive after a year, it says. Pradip Krishen, an environmentalist and author, said the policy is not reliable as there is neither as much experience or enough expertise on transplantation. “Older trees are susceptible to dying on being translocated, as they are not able to survive the shock of being uprooted. Trees with deep tap-root system do not have a chance of survival at all. This includes all native trees such as jamun and babool, among others. Only some ficus varieties such as peepal, bargad and pilkhan can survive transplantation,” Krishen said. Krishen said the policy should have been about how to integrate trees within development projects. “During the 1982 Asian Games, a stretch on Lodhi Road with a thick tree line was widened while keeping the trees intact. Solutions such as these could be found with political will, as trees are our heritage just like buildings and other structures.” The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.The new transplantation policy will be in addition to the existing one that mandates plantation of 10 trees for every tree that is cut. Warning that the policy would pave the way for the removal of thousands of trees for construction projects, experts said the government should implement provisions of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, and make the Tree Authority more effective. They said the cost incurred in the scheme could be used for planting native species across the city’s degraded forests. “Transplantation is an extremely expensive and high-maintenance procedure and is not a viable option where large-scale tree felling of thousands of trees are involved. Therefore, it important to revive Delhi’s Tree Authority and strengthen policies that encourage tree protection rather than tree felling,” Kanchi Kohli, senior researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said. Citing from his experience, Vijay Dhasmana, curator, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram, said they had transplanted 10 jamun trees that were being felled on the roadside, inside the park at least a decade ago. “Since the trees were being felled for a road project, we tried to save them by translocating them within the park. However, since native trees are too sensitive, 10 years later, now only three of those are left and are struggling to survive. So, if the policy is aiming at 80% survival of transplanted trees, it’s neither achievable nor feasible,” he said. Dhasmana said even though transplantation is better than just felling a tree, the survival rate and the kind of species that are known to survive post-operation is quite low.Others pointed out that a successful transplantation would depend on the species, age, size and health of trees besides other factors such as soil condition and expertise. C R Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem in Delhi University, said transplantation is the last option in any effort to conserve or secure greens in urban centres. “It is not an alternative option. Only young and shallow-rooted species are known to survive after being transplanted. The extent of mortality of a transplanted tree in case of old and full-grown trees is 99%,” Babu said. Babu said only some ficus species such as peepal, bargad and gular can survive on translocation. “However, transplanted trees take years to regrow and still don’t get a full shape or a canopy. At the same time, a young sapling can grow into a much healthier tree over time. Without a canopy, a tree cannot provide ecological services, which is the main function of it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/experts-sound-caution-over-delhi-s-new-tree-policy/story-sh5csmfZFkBItIgbxhoHhM.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Air Quality Index witnesses sharp spike in Mumbai, is highest since before lockdown began in March||The city recorded its worst air quality on Friday since before the Covid-19 lockdown was enforced in March. Reduction in rain activity and increase in emission sources owing to lifting of restrictions pushed up the pollutant-measuring indicator — air quality index (AQI) — to 118 (moderate) for PM2.5 (small pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments), as a thin layer of smog engulfed Mumbai’s skyline.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), it is the first time since March 19 that Mumbai’s AQI entered the ‘moderate’ category (101-200). It was 130 on March 19, after which till Friday, it had stayed below 101. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as ‘good’; 51-100 as ‘satisfactory’; 101-200 as ‘moderate’; 201-300 as ‘poor’; 301-400 as ‘very poor’ and above 400 as ‘severe’. The AQI on Monday was 50, which rose to 68 on Tuesday, 78 on Wednesday and 97 on Thursday before entering the moderate category on Friday.“This was expected as when conditions become favourable for monsoon withdrawal, there is a sharp drop in wind speed and rise in temperature, especially for a coastal city like Mumbai. This allows pollutant particles to get suspended close to the surface and form a layer of haze,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. “Pollution levels are likely to be in the moderate category for at least two to three days. But with a low pressure weather system over Bay of Bengal, the possibility of rain even around the Mumbai region could allow a marginal rise in wind speed.”An AQI of 104 (moderate) has been predicted for Saturday. Friday’s AQI, however, was an average from nine locations and not 10 as the AQ monitoring station at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) is under maintenance, said Beig. The highest pollution level was recorded at Navi Mumbai –186 (moderate), followed by Andheri 156 (moderate); Malad 152 (moderate); Chembur 149 (moderate); Worli 128 (moderate), while remaining areas recorded ‘satisfactory’ AQI levels.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature on Friday in Mumbai was 35 degrees Celsius at the Santacruz weather observatory and 34.6 degrees Celsius at Colaba, both 2.3 degrees Celsius above normal. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a yellow alert for the next five days for Thane and other districts in south Konkan. However, only light rain has been predicted for the city and suburbs over the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-quality-index-witnesses-sharp-spike-in-mumbai-is-highest-since-before-lockdown-began-in-march/story-Seq0J45SyZqb0S38kubYyO.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||Connaught Place will get smog tower in 10 months, says Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the state cabinet has approved setting up a smog tower in Connaught Place, and that the Delhi government has approved a budget of ₹20 crore for the project, he said which should be complete in 10 months. “The central government is already working on a smog tower in Anand Vihar. The one by the Delhi government will be set up in Connaught Place,” Kejriwal said in a video press briefing on Friday, adding that the move is in line with the government’s seven-point action plan for combating air pollution that was announced by Kejriwal earlier this week. The action plan also includes a separate strategy for dust control, management of 13 pollution hot spots, a war room to monitor pollution levels in real-time, a mobile app for registering complaints and a tree transplantation policy. Smog towers are structures designed to work as large-scale air purifiers. They are usually fitted with multiple layers of air filters, which clean the air of pollutants as it passes through them. Kejriwal however said the CP smog tower would work differently from the ones in China.“The smog tower in China sucks air through a panel in the bottom and releases clean air through a vent above, while the one in Connaught Place will suck unclean air through a vent located above and release clean air at a lower height,” the chief minister said. D Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) air laboratory, said smog towers are not suitable to Delhi’s meteorological conditions. “There is a constant intrusion of dust in Delhi because of various geographical and local factors. How much can a filter suck? A model such as this cannot be successful for a city like Delhi,” said Saha. A smog tower, hailed as Delhi’s first, was set up in the Lajpat Nagar central market in January this year by the traders’ association in Lajpat Nagar with the help of east Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir. Residents and traders of the south Delhi area said the smog tower is useful and helps clean air in its immediate surroundings.General secretary of the Lajpat Nagar traders association , Ashwani Marwah said such initiatives were the need of the hour keeping in the pollution levels in the Capital. “It is just like a large-scale air purifier. When we keep air purifiers at home during the winter, then why not have such large-scale devices to clean up air in markets and such places where the daily footfall is high. I believe it’s worth the cost,” he said.The Supreme Court had on January 13 ordered the Delhi government to build a smog tower at Connaught Place in three months. On the same day, the court also ordered a smog tower to be installed in Anand Vihar by the Central Pollution Control Board within the same deadline. On July 21, the Supreme Court had noted that the authorities did not comply with the January 13 order. The apex court had warned it would initiate contempt proceedings against IIT-Bombay for threatening to back out of the proposal to construct smog towers in Delhi. Both projects are yet to materialise. A senior official in the environment department said the Connaught Place smog tower plan mentions a 20 metre-high device. “It is expected to reduce 50% of the particulate matter load in an area of 1 km in the direction of the wind, as well as 200m each along its sides and against the direction of the wind,” said the official, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/connaught-place-will-get-smog-tower-in-10-months-says-kejriwal/story-OAMi0IIyZg2UmZT80iLb4K.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Transfers in police ranks: Jai Jeet Singh appointed ATS chief of Maharashtra||The state government on Friday appointed senior Indian police Service (IPS) officer Jai Jeet Singh as the new chief of anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of the state. Singh, a 1990-batch IPS officer, was earlier posted as additional director general of anti-corruption bureau (ACB) during the previous shuffling of senior IPS officers. He is not new to ATS as he has served as additional commissioner of police in ATS in the past. Singh has served in Maharashtra in various capacities, including long stints in Naxal-affected districts.In his long service, tech-enthusiast Singh had also taken important assignments on central deputation and has served in Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and as centre director in National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), the apex technical intelligence agency under the Prime Minister’s Office.Singh will be replacing additional director general (ADG) Deven Bharti, who has been now made in-charge of Maharashtra State Security Board, which is considered to be a side posting. Under Bharti’s supervision, ATS on Thursday had arrested employees of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) for passing secret information about Indian fighter aircrafts and Ozhar aircraft manufacturing unit to Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI.Meanwhile, ADG Prabhat Kumar has been sent to replace Singh in ACB. Mumbai’s former joint commissioner of police (administration) Naval Bajaj, who had done impressive work in Covid management in the Mumbai Police, has been promoted to ADG rank and has been posted as ADG of the economic offences wing (EOW) of the state police. Like Bharti, he was waiting for the new posting.Konkan range special inspector general of police Niket Kaushik has been made the new chief of Mumbai Police EOW. He will be replacing Rajvardhan Sinha, who has been sent to the office of special inspector general of police, Prevention of Atrocities against Women.Dozens of other senior police officers of superintendent of police (SP) and deputy SP ranks were also transferred on Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/transfers-in-police-ranks-jai-jeet-singh-appointed-ats-chief-of-maharashtra/story-KfIGbrGBGfPapOUg4FSOyK.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra police go paperless, digital is their new normal during Covid-19 pandemic||Statements recorded on WhatsApp, paperless administration, station houses outside the police station — these are just a few of the changes that Covid-19 is bringing to policing in Maharashtra. The state has one of the largest police forces in the country and has reported the most Covid-positive cases since the outbreak reached India. While Mumbai Police has already begun implementing some of these changes, all administrative processes at all police stations in the state are expected to go online by the end of October. “Covid-19 changed the demands and expectations of the police force,” said director general of police (Maharashtra) Subodh Jaiswal. Going forward, all administrative processes, including human resource management (like leave applications, budgets) will become paperless. “By the end of the month, we have planned to make all administrative process of policing across all police stations in the state go online. Not only will it cut down on the voluminous files, but it will also significantly reduce the manpower that was being used till now,” he said. Jaiswal said the shift to online is expected to increase efficiency and communication between different levels of police officers. “For example, if a senior officer wants a progress report of a situation on ground, he would be able to directly connect with his subordinate and call for the ground report on the spot. This not only would drastically change the response time, it will also help in better coordination in the force,” said Jaiswal. After the lockdown was imposed in March, the police was given additional roles like ensuring no crowds gathered; enforcing guidelines like wearing masks and maintaining social distance in public spaces; making regular announcements through the public addressing system; curbing Covid-related rumours; and assisting the civic body. With police officers working alongside frontline workers, the number of police personnel who contracted Covid-19 started rising. Dyaneshwar Chavan, additional commissioner of police (central region), Mumbai Police, said, “Seven hundred and fifty policemen contracted Covid-19 in the first three months of the lockdown, which induced a fear among others.” Till date, 24,581 police personnel have contracted Covid-19 and of them, 21,862 have recovered, while 257 (25 officers and 232 constables) lost their lives to the infection. Chavan said, “The recovery rate has helped to boost the confidence of officials to come back and carry out their duty without any fear.” Those above 55 are being assigned desk jobs to ensure their chances of being exposed to Covid-19 remain low. As a safety measure, those police personnel who are above 55 or have comorbidities were asked to remain at home since they would be more vulnerable to Covid-19. This meant there were fewer police on duty. “To deal with this situation, we had to change our working format and adopt an approach to multitask,” said Diwakar Shelke, senior police inspector at Dadar police station. Efforts were made to remove possibilities of contracting Covid-19 through contact or surface transmission. Shriram Koregaonkar, senior police inspector from Santacruz police station, said, “Earlier, we used to arrest any accused without hesitation. But now we are cautious and ensure that we are wearing gloves, face shield and regularly use hand sanitizers before and after arresting an accused.” Some stations have even changed their layout. Raju Kasbe, senior inspector from Samta Nagar police station, said, “Station house is where complainants come to lodge complaints, so we shifted it outside the police station and made a mark about eight feet from the bench where the officer sits to receive complaints.” Mumbai Police said that it has seen a change in the way the public interacts with police during the lockdown. “Our behaviour towards local residents underwent a change. We helped numerous citizens by distributing food, groceries, emergency passes or by helping them get medical aid. These acts have seen our bond with citizens strengthen. People are now more willing to help us with crucial information,” said Manjunath Singe, deputy commissioner of police (zone 8), Mumbai Police. The pandemic has also pushed the police to move from paperwork to electronic files. Rajvardhan Sinha, joint commissioner of police (economic offences wing), Mumbai Police, said, “We have started recording statements of people through Zoom or WhatsApp. In some cases, we send a questionnaire through email and record their answers as their statement.” Charge sheets will also be filed electronically in the near future. “Since courts have started video conferencing facilities and adequate infrastructure is being allotted for electronic filing, we are in the process of submitting charge sheets through e-filing. We also plan to record statements of witnesses in criminal matters electronically, modalities of which are being worked out,” said Jaiswal. During the lockdown, maintaining law and order has been relatively easy as citizens were restricted to their homes. As the lockdown is lifted, police will have to carry out Covid-related duties in addition to their regular roles. Chavan said a spike in crimes committed was likely, especially with growing unemployment, and Mumbai Police was prepared to tackle such an eventuality. “We’ve begun training officers to prevent robberies, property and body crimes. Squads like anti-chain snatching and anti-property theft have been mobilised to ensure citizens, who are now venturing out of their homes, are safe,” said Chavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-police-go-paperless-digital-is-their-new-normal-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-AN2MJqdQXKenTdQGXjY0OP.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||80 per cent trees felled for infra work to be transplanted in Delhi||The Delhi cabinet approved on Friday rules making it mandatory for at least 80% of trees affected by any development project to be transplanted, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced, in a move meant to address concerns regarding the city’s green cover.The rule is a part of a new tree transplantation policy that is one of seven initiatives announced by Kejriwal earlier this week to combat air pollution. The action plan includes a separate strategy for dust control, management of 13 pollution hotspots, a war room for real-time monitoring of pollution levels and efficacy of measures to fight pollution, and a mobile app for registering complaints.“This is the first-of-its-kind tree transplantation policy in Delhi. We will be the first state in the country to implement this policy,” said Kejriwal during a press briefing online on Friday evening.  Tree transplantation is known to be difficult. Experts say only a few species survive the process, which involves special machines to carefully remove trees along with some soil and the roots before they are moved to their alternate destination.The government, he added, will come out with a list of empanelled technical agencies that will carry out the transplantation and ensure the moved trees survive. “Services of the empanelled agencies can be availed for all projects that would affect trees. Payment to the agency will have to be done after one year of transplant, only after ensuring that 80% of the transplanted trees have survived,” he said.If a project affects 100 trees, 80 of these need to be transplanted, according to the new rule. Of the 80, 64 will need to survive.Any project by an individual or private entity that requires less than 10 trees to be cut will be exempted from the policy, which will now need to be notified to come into force. The policy will be in addition to an existing rule that requires a developer to plant ten saplings for every tree that needs to be felled for a project.Kejriwal also said that a dedicated tree transplantation cell will be formed by the Delhi government and local committees, which will include government officials, citizens and resident welfare associations to monitor transplanted trees and certify that the task has been done with due diligence. For each project, the listed agencies will have to conduct a study to ascertain suitable locations and any other factor involved, said a senior government official, asking not to be named. “The government has a plan of adding trees along several arterial roads also there is a list of spaces reserved for forestation drives. The list will keep evolving with time,” this person added.The policy was last tabled in a Cabinet meeting in May but it was held for further deliberations, said a second senior government official who did not wish to be identified. Between February 28 and March 15 last year, the draft of the policy was shared in public domain for suggestions and comments.C R Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem in Delhi University, said transplantation is the last option in any effort to conserve or secure greens in urban centres. “It is not an alternative option. Only young and shallow-rooted species are known to survive after being transplanted. Trees with a deep taproot system cannot survive translocation. The extent of mortality of a transplanted tree in case of old and full-grown trees is 99%. Only some ficus species such as peepal, bargad and gular can survive,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/80-trees-felled-for-infra-work-to-be-transplanted-in-delhi/story-4x45kEmkYjDgRtBOjq8y4N.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Those who need DG sets must approach Epca directly for exemption: Haryana PCB||The Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) on Friday said that those who did not have regular power connections should approach the Supreme Court appointed environmental pollution control board authority (Epca) for exemption from its ban on diesel generator (DG) sets from October 15.A day earlier, the Epca had directed the Haryana government to strictly impose the ban on use of diesel generators in Gurugram and Faridabad in view of the rising levels of air pollution.On Friday, chief secretary Vijay Vardhan held a review meeting on the matter with the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, said, “The power department has assured that they are working on the necessary grid infrastructure for the uninterrupted power supply, which will help in reducing the usage of generator sets. In case, issues related to electricity connection between DHBVN and the condominium/industry remains disputed and unresolved then they will have to approach Epca to get exemptions.” Developers, residents welfare association (RWA) and DHBVN have a week’s time to resolve their issues before the graded response action plan (Grap) to tackle air pollution is implemented on October 15.“There are around 60 condominiums in developing sector and 15 in old Gurugram (sectors 1-57) where regular connections are pending because developers have not met the compliances,” said Vineta Singh, chief engineer, smart grid, who has additional charge superintending engineer, Delhi circle. According to her, the department will be sending the status report to the EPCA, while the developers and RWAs will also have to approach SC appointed pollution control authority. Talking to HT, Bhure Lal, chairman, EPCA, however, clarified that except the essential services like hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare facilities, railway and metro services, airports, elevators, and escalators there will be complete ban on diesel gensets. “Only the essential services or emergency services are exempted from the use of diesel generators. EPCA has already cleared its stance to power distributors. They have been given almost a year to improve the supply. On the issues of regular connections, state should answer as to why completion certificates were given to the condominium developers if they lacked basic infrastructure facilities like electricity supply. The pollution control has to ensure that gensets are banned from being operational.”A helpline will also be set up for Gurugram and Faridabad residents for queries on air pollution and control measures.HSPCB tried to wean off DG setsOn June 23, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) had issued an order to five districts adjoining the national capital – Gurugram, Faridabad, Bhadurgarh, Sonepat and Panipat – on the usage of the DG sets that are already operational. The order stated that all DG sets in operation with capacity 500 KVA and above are required either to retrofit the emission control equipment having a minimum specified PM capturing efficiency of at least 70% (approved by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)) or shifting to gas-based generators within three months in the five districts.However, the order was withheld. Jai Bhagwan, senior scientist, HSPCB, said, “There were no specific guidelines by the CPCB to implement these directives, therefore it was put on hold.” Hemant Kaushal, project coordinator, centre of excellence on clean air, Indian Institute of Technology – Delhi, said, “Air pollution being a perennial problem is compounded this year with the Covid-19, which directly affects the lungs. Strict ban on DGs in Delhi-NCR is just one aspect of the multiple challenges faced in tackling air pollution. The onus is on the states this time to make sure the grid system is efficient, ensuring uninterrupted power supply.”According to Kaushal, ban on diesel gensets is a temporary solution. “A blanket ban on diesel gensets is not possible unless states like Haryana figure out a way to supply uninterrupted power so that the genset use is limited throughout the year not just during the GRAP implementation phase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/those-who-need-dg-sets-must-approach-epca-directly-for-exemption-haryana-pcb/story-O8QHBCgQi6ndWrJZkS2iiJ.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Work on elevated section of Sohna Road likely to start in next 10 days||The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI) on Friday said that work on the elevated section of the Sohna Road is likely to start in the next 10 days. Officials said that changes in construction sequence and standard operating measures are being incorporated by the contractor as suggested by a technical committee appointed by the NHAI. The work on surface level has already commenced, officials said. “Work on the surface level has already commenced after measures pertaining to safety and security of commuters on the road and workers were taken by the contractor. The technical committee has also asked to streamline the process. This is being done gradually and most likely the work will start in the next 10 days,” said a senior NHAI official, not authorised to speak to media. The officials also said that given the high volume of traffic and constrained work environment, the possibility of mishaps at large construction sites is always high. “We are trying to minimise this issue,” he said. Shashi Bhushan, project director, NHAI, when asked about the resumption of work said matter was under consideration. The four-member technical committee had earlier said that quality of construction material, displaced stressing cables, and presence of cavity could have contributed to the collapse of span of the elevated road on August 22, which led to stoppage of work on the project. A senior official of Oriental Engineering, the contractor, said that all recommendations made by the committee are being implemented. The work on 6km Sohna road elevated road project was suspended after the collapse of the span between pier 10 and pier 11 on August 22. It was only last week that partial resumption of work on the surface level was allowed after the NHAI officials conducted an inspection of the project site. The total length of the project is around 21 kilometres||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/work-on-elevated-section-of-sohna-road-likely-to-start-in-next-10-days/story-SGmyu400WCNqHT37jqaL8O.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||DG set ban: Residents, industries worry over power outages||The environment pollution (prevention and control) authority’s directive to ban diesel generator (DG) sets in the national capital region (NCR) from October 15 has Gurugram residents and industrials concerned -- how are they to deal with the daily power outages?A large number of condominiums in developing sectors in the city also don’t have regular power connections and rely on rural feeders for supply, which witness outages of four to five hours a day.The ban is part of Epca’s graded response acton plan (Grap) to prevent pollution in the region from reaching severe levels. However, use of generators for essential services such as hospitals, railways, metro stations, water treatment plants and sewage treatment plans are allowed. As per the pollution department, there are around 10,000 generators operational in the city, both in residential and industrial sectors. Around 6000 generators of more than 100 KWA capacity are used to augment power supply as backup for outages. At least 68 group housing societies don’t have regular power conenction, as per discom Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) data.Pravin Malik, president, Sare Homes residents welfare association (RWA), said that a majority of condominiums had rural area connections. “How will we run lifts, water supply, sewage treatment plant. Hundreds of residents are working from home and lack of electricity will make life even more difficult,” he said. RWAs demanded that authorities should encash the bank guarantees submitted by developers and lay the power infrastructure and build substations. Sourabh Kumar, another resident who lives near Dwarka Expressway, said voltage fluctuations have made work from home difficult and the ban would make it impossible. “A solution should be found to this,” he said. Industry associations based in Udyog Vihar and Manesar said the ban would impact production, which had just normalised after the Covid-19-lockdown restrictions were eased. “The factories, which work continuously and need uninterrupted supply, would face lot of problems. Covid-19 has already hit us bad and this will further lead to losses,” said Manmohan Gaind, general secretary, Manesar Industries Welfare Association. Ashok Kohli, president of Chamber of Industries Udyog Vihar, said that the government must promise 24-hour power supply. “What is the status of smart grid and why are there so many outages? Why would we use gensets if power supply is adequate,” he asked, adding that they already have received 20 to 25 complaints from members in this regard. The DHBVN, when asked about residents’ lack of power connections and dependence on gensets, said that they have given conenctions to every applicant who has complied with norms. “We will submitting these details with Epca in this regard. There were eight pending connections last year but none at present. All those who depend on gensets will have to approach the EPCA in this matter,” said Vinita Singh, chief engineer, Smart Grid, who has additional charge of superintending engineer, Delhi circle. Singh also said that work on smart grid project is progressing and they have set up 94 feeders out of which 63 have been activated. Bhure Lal, who heads the Epca monitoring committee said, “We have made our stand clear with electrity utilities clear in this regard. Our question is why completion certificate were issued to developers without even ensuring basic infrastructure.” He added that none of the stakeholder had approached them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dg-set-ban-residents-industries-worry-over-power-outages/story-8HUWWMgChRQU4abF8lm4LL.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 1.5 million Covid-19 cases, death toll nears 40,000||Maharashtra on Friday went past 1.5 million Covid-19 cases with an addition of 12,134 fresh infections, which took the state’s tally to 1,506,018. The state also reported 302 fatalities, pushing the toll closer to 40,000-mark at 39,732. Maharashtra has 236,491 active Covid-19 cases.Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to record the highest number of cases among cities and districts in the state as it recorded 2,289 fresh infections on Friday. The city’s tally rose to 225,073, while fatalities in Mumbai rose to 9,343 with 47 deaths reported on Friday. Active cases in Mumbai stand at 26,072, which is 11.58% of the city’s total cases.Friday also witnessed 17,232 patients being discharged, taking the total of recovered patients in the state to 1,229,339. The state’s recovery rate has improved to 81.63%. The number of daily cases reported across the state reduced in the first week of October compared to the first week of September. The state recorded 135,155 cases between September 2 and September 8, with an average of 19,307 cases a day, while 94,116 cases were reported between October 2 and October 8 at an average of 13,445 cases a day. However, the number of samples tested between September 2 and September 8 was 571,930 against 528,780 tests conducted between October 2 and October 8, according to data from the state health department. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, meanwhile, hinted about the possibility of a second wave. Speaking at the commissioning of a dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Satara, Thackeray said there have been examples where with opening up of schools, restaurants, and other places, the infections have increased. Maharashtra has allowed restaurants and bars to start operations from October 5, but with 50% capacity.“We can become lax after hearing that cases are going down; jumbo facilities have been set-up; oxygen supply beds and ventilators are available, but our real test begins now. Wherever schools have reopened, cases have increased; children have got infected. Wherever restaurants and other such facilities have opened, Covid cases have gone up,” he said.Thackeray said till a vaccine is available, the only way to keep “the claws of Covid-19 away is to use masks, maintain physical distance, and wash hands”. Thackeray assured the people that the state government’s ‘My Family My Responsibility’ will help safeguard them.“We do not know when the vaccine will be available. Some tests have started in our state too. But we do not know by when it will clear the testing stage… There is also the question of when the entire 12.5 crore population of Maharashtra will be vaccinated. The solution, which the world has experienced, is use masks, keep physical distance and wash hands regularly,” said the chief minister, adding that “Covid-19 may not be the last of such viruses to attack humans” and therefore getting habituated to a healthy lifestyle and sanitisation measures will help people safeguard against any such virus in the future. “Nobody can guarantee that an even deadlier virus won’t attack us. If some deadlier virus comes, we will have to again wait for a vaccine. If we have adopted a healthy lifestyle, and take care of our family through simple measures, we will be able to battle it. If we get into the habit of wearing masks, no virus will attack us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-1-5-million-covid-19-cases-death-toll-nears-40-000/story-GcKvT6tBK6HAsIxKCkk2GI.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s maiden cycle track faces a host of challenges||A week after the city’s first cycle track opened along Netaji Subhash Marg, cyclists were found to be facing a host of issues, such as encroachments by street vendors, cars driving on the cycle track, and the presence of illegal auto rickshaw stands. Acknowledging the issues, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials said that the project is still “a work in progress” and that changes are being made accordingly to address the issues.The 10km stretch between Huda City Centre (HCC) and Subhash Chowk was thrown open by the GMDA to the public on October 2.Cyclists said that in certain parts of the stretch they prefer to drive on top of the footpaths instead of the cycle track as they fear that they may come in the path of speeding vehicles.“In certain parts, the cycle track has proper bollards preventing cars from entering the track, while in some other parts, such as near Greenwood City, bollards are missing. At these points, cars can often be found parked on the cycle track or speeding through the track. In these patches, I prefer to cycle on the footpath rather than the track to avoid getting hit,” said Satish Yadav, a resident of Jharsa village.A few other cyclists said that apart from vehicles, they have to be wary of street vendors and illegal auto-rickshaw stands.“Near the Subhash Chowk flyover, auto-rickshaws can be often found parked on the cycle track, while near Unitech Cyber Park, street vendors are covering half the track. Despite being on a cycle track, I have to constantly remain on a high alert. Auto-rickshaw drivers may suddenly start their vehicle or, if I am not focusing properly, I may end up crashing against a street cart. Therefore, the safety aspect attached with a conventional cycle track is completely lost,” said Rintu Sengupta, a resident of sector 50.Cyclists also said that apart from cars, the bollards also allow enough space for two-wheelers to make their way through, and these vehicles remain a constant presence on the stretch.“We did not want to reduce the space between bollards or else a cyclist would have to get off the cycle to make their way inside the cycle lanes. This would have been a major inconvenience and defeat the entire purpose of a cycle track. To address the issue of two-wheelers, we are working on installing more signage on the stretch, both in Hindi and English, informing them that only the entry of cyclists is allowed on the track. We will also be launching a few awareness campaigns to inform people,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA.Regarding the issue of street vendors and four-wheelers occupying cycle tracks, Kundu said that GMDA is installing more bollards along the stretch that will prevent them from entering the lane altogether.“At a few points, due to shortage of workers, bollards couldn’t be installed around the time when the service was launched. These are in the process of being installed properly and would prevent four-wheelers and street vendors from entering the cycle lanes. We wanted to open the cycle lanes as early as possible to identify more and more issues face by cyclists on the stretch and keep these in mind when we are planning on building future cycle tracks across the city,” said Kundu, adding that there are 37 points along the stretch that are entry and exit points for residential and commercial buildings. The authority is working on a long-term project of building a service lane behind these buildings, wherever absent, for vehicles as well as re-engineering four intersections along the stretch to make them both pedestrian- and cycle-friendly.As per GMDA officials, around 650 kilometres of cycle tracks would be built in the city. In the first phase, cycle tracks would be planned around the Huda City Centre towards Golf Course Road, Paras Hospital, Signature Towers and MG Road.“About 12-14% of commuters use cycle as a mode of transport in the city by choice. Hence, making cycle tracks in the city was desperately needed as currently all roads have been designed keeping only vehicles in mind. The right of way (ROW) of cyclists and pedestrians also needs to be given importance along with vehicles,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, associate director, Nagarro, which is assisting GMDA with the cycle track project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-maiden-cycle-track-faces-a-host-of-challenges/story-QdCyk3mW0hdScENbcbseSK.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram health department identifies 4 urban and 12 rural areas for sero survey||The district health department has identified four urban and 12 rural areas in Gurugram to conduct the third round of serological survey to assess the prevalence of the Covid-19 infection in the community. At least 750 people are going to be covered in the survey for which their blood samples will be taken to check the presence of antibodies developed against Covid-19. Through the blood samples, IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies are detected against Covid-19, which people might have developed without showing any symptoms of the virus, such as cough, cold and fever. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus develops in the human body two weeks after the onset of the infection and remain in the body for a long time, indicating that the episode of the infection has happened in the past. A serological survey helps in gauging the extent of spread of and the actual burden of Covid-19 infection in the society.This time, the selected clusters are different from the ones in the previous surveys. These include Fazilpur, Khandsa, Naharpur and Rajendra Park in the urban areas and Gurugram village, Dundahera, Chauma, Garhi Harsaru , Chandu, Budhera, Bhondsi, Rithoj, Dhani Rithoj, Kasan, Manesar and Nainwal in the rural areas of the district.The district has gone through two rounds of serological survey earlier. The first survey was conducted on 450 people, while the second one was done on 850 people. The latest survey showed a sero-positivity rate of 10.8% in the district. The same of the state was 8%. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that the preparations for the sero-survey are already underway as they are awaiting confirmation on the final dates to start the survey. “The department has already received the testing kits and staff members who will be conducting the survey have been trained,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-health-department-identifies-4-urban-and-12-rural-areas-for-sero-survey/story-E5Fprbe614y99lesCcyxkI.html
10-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Man, accused of two dozen crimes, arrested||The police on Thursday arrested a man from Delhi, who is accused of at least two dozen crimes, including theft, loot, snatching, attempt to murder and illegal possession of weapons, in Gurugram, Delhi and Bahadurgarh. The police said the accused man had a reward of ₹10,000 for information leading to his arrest. Since 2014, he was among the list of the most-wanted criminals of the city police. According to the police, the crime branch of Sector 40 arrested the accused, identified as Prabhat Kumar alias Sonu alias Shakaal alias Bengali, a resident of Rohini, from Holambi Kalan area in Delhi after a tip-off. The police said he was declared a bad character – a person with a history of crime – at Maurya Enclave police station in Pitampura, Delhi. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “The accused has at least 24 first information reports registered against him in Bahadurgarh, Delhi and Gurugram. He had been active for over a decade and was on the run since 2014 after committing a series of crimes in the city.” The police said among other cases, he was first booked in a case on October 8, 2013 at Sushant Lok police station after allegedly stealing cash and jewellery from a locked house in Sushant Lok Phase 1. He was produced in a district court on Friday and sent to the police custody for two days. In another case of arrest, the crime branch of Farrukhnagar on Wednesday arrested a gang of two men, who were allegedly involved in snatching vehicles in Bilaspur, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar areas. The police said the accused men confessed to have stolen at least two motorcycles and a car in the past few months. The accused men have been identified by their first names as Satdev alias Maniya and Monu alias Keru, both from Tirpari village in Farrukhnagar. Inspector Indiwar, crime branch, Farrukhnagar said, “The accused men had assaulted a man near Jataula underpass in Pataudi on September 30 night and decamped with his car. Earlier, they had stolen a motorcycle each in Farrukhnagar and Bilaspur areas. Three FIRs have been registered against them at the respective police stations.” The police said in the last week’s incident, the victim had said in the police complaint that he was returning to his house in Pataudi in his car and had reached near the Jataula underpass when two men had signalled him to stop. When he stopped his car, the accused men pulled him out of the car and started assaulting him. After kicking him, they decamped with his car. The victim had gone to a nearby hospital and filed a complaint the following day. The police said the accused men were produced in a district court on Thursday and sent to police custody for two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-man-accused-of-two-dozen-crimes-arrested/story-MLgBmdsRc5ssXkP8dpdjYP.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||Translate worksheets before sending them to students, DoE tells Urdu medium schools||The Directorate of Education (DoE) Thursday directed all Urdu medium government schools in the national capital to translate online study material or worksheets provided by the education department into the language before sending them to students, in order to ensure uninterrupted learning amid Covid-enforced restrictions. A senior official at the directorate, requesting anonymity, confirmed that they issued the order after taking cognisance of a Hindustan Times report, dated September 29, that said students and teachers of least 20 Urdu medium government schools in Delhi were struggling without online study material or worksheets in the language. Officials at these schools, however, expressed reservations over DoE’s directions and said they do not have sufficient number of teachers, who are well acquainted with the language, to translate the material. In an order issued to all Urdu medium schools on Thursday, the DoE said, “The heads of schools (HoS) of all Urdu medium schools are directed to instruct teachers of their schools to translate the worksheets/activity sheets provided centrally and ensure that the same is sent to the students to facilitate the learning of students. It is reiterated that the teachers should be directed to send worksheets day-wise to students on WhatsApp groups.” With schools shut since March and classes being held online, government schools -- where most students do not have access to smart devices and the internet -- are dependent on worksheets or study material provided by DoE for virtual learning. These worksheets contain both notes and questions. Students can either access them on their class WhatsApp groups, or parents can pick up hard copies from schools. DoE has been providing worksheets every day on all subjects -- in both Hindi and English -- to all schools. However, there are no worksheets in Urdu. A teacher at an Urdu medium school in Old Delhi said of the 46 teachers in their school, only 20 can read and write the language. “Many of our subject teachers can’t read or write Urdu. They are verbally acquainted with the language. Translation work can only be done by teachers well versed in the language. Now DoE sends two worksheets for each class daily. How will it be possible to translate everything and send it to students the same day?” he said. Teachers of his school have already been translating parts of the worksheets and sending them to students. However, they are unable to send them the same day. An official at another Urdu medium school in the Walled City said they have only three teachers well-versed in the language at present. “We are short of hands. It would have been better if the DoE could send us worksheets in Urdu itself, as they doing for Hindi and English medium schools,” he said. An official from the education department, requesting anonymity, said, “The schools can assign the duty of translation to some teachers. Schools that have only a few teachers who know the language well may seek the help of other schools. The translated worksheets may also be shared among schools.” The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/translate-worksheets-before-sending-them-to-students-doe-tells-urdu-medium-schools/story-wznT2WfbqXw7Qp1f4nkJhP.html

10-10-2020||Chandigarh||2 months on, Ludhiana MC fails to implement solid waste bylaws||Even after two months since the Punjab local bodies department notified solid waste bylaws in the state, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has failed to implement them in the city. This has resulted in flouting of solid waste management norms, littering and open dumping of garbage.As per the bylaws that were notified on August 11, the MC can issue challans for violations of solid waste management norms. Also, user charges were to be collected from residents for services including door-to-door collection of waste. The MC is adopting a lackadaisical approach despite the monitoring committee of National Green Tribunal (NGT) having imposed bank guarantees of Rs 22 lakh on the civic body for its failure to implement solid waste management and upgrade sewer treatment plants (STP). The MC was directed to implement door-to-door collection and waste segregation in all wards by November 30, failing which bank guarantee of Rs 5 lakh would be encashed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB).The MC committee, which had recently visited Indore to study the solid waste management system in the cleanest city in the country, said that the MC will have to deal with violators strictly. Earlier, MC officials had claimed that an extensive challan drive will be started from September 15 onwards, but nothing has been done at ground level till now. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that initially the MC could not take any action as the bylaws were not notified. He added that the MC received a copy of notified bylaws in the last week of August. But now, the officials are not commencing the challan drive citing the ongoing awareness campaign, he said. Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The civic body has started a 15-day awareness campaign, “My waste, May responsibility”. So far, we have received good response from the residents. Residents are also opting for waste segregation and nothing can be done without public participation at large. Soon, the MC will start the drive to issue challans to residents if they fail to follow norms.”Challans for violations The challan amount can range from Rs 250 to Rs 5,000 depending on the category of property and violation of the owner. Challans upto Rs 20,000 can be issued for sale of plastic carry bags and for burning garbage, challans upto Rs 25,000 can be imposed. The MC has also been directed to depute nuisance detectors in the city, who will keep a check and issue challans to violators. The local bodies department has also fixed monthly charges for door-to-door collection of waste and the charges vary from Rs 50 (for households up to 200 square metre area) to Rs 25,000 for a university. There will be atleast 5% annual increment in the charges. A resident organising an event at a public place will have to inform the civic body three days prior to the event and pay user charges for collection of waste which may vary from Rs 5,000 (for upto 100 participants) to 40,000 (for above 10,000 participants). If the person fails to clear the waste from the site or inform the authorities, action will be taken against by MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-months-on-ludhiana-mc-fails-to-implement-solid-waste-bylaws/story-gfXYd9gCmdRGfDarMemIVP.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||Section of Mathura Road near Ashram to be shut for two days||One section of the Delhi-Mathura Road — the section from Bhogal to Ashram Chowk — will be shut for vehicular traffic from 10am on Saturday to 6am on Monday to allow water pipelines to be repaired, the Delhi traffic police said on Friday. The movement on the opposite carriageway — from Ashram Chowk to Bhogal — will continue normally as similar repair works on that stretch are likely to be completed by Saturday.The traffic police had earlier closed the two carriageways, alternatively, between 10pm on 6am from Wednesday to Saturday for the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to carry out the repair works. The closure notice comes days after Delhi minister Satyendar Jain had said both carriageways be shut for 10 days to carry out repairs on the crossing, which has become a severe choke-point, with construction work, waterlogging and damaged roads slowing traffic down to a crawl. While the Delhi traffic police — the final authority on road closures — had said this would not be possible because of the traffic volume on the arterial road, experts concurred with the Delhi government’s view, saying that completely shutting the road was only the way out.The traffic police said it decided to disallow movement on the stretch for nearly two full days after receiving a request from the DJB on Friday during a joint meeting with stakeholders, including the Public Works Department and the MTNL. Data released by the traffic department shows that since the Covid-19 lockdown was eased and construction work on the stretch resumed with preliminary diversions, the intersection has been recording 11,600 vehicles an hour. SD Mishra, additional commissioner of police (traffic), on Friday said the decision to close one carriageway was taken because of the lighter traffic on weekends. Mishra said adequate arrangement, in terms of deploying traffic police personnel and putting up signboards, have been made to ensure the commuters are aware of the diversions. “All vehicles from Bhogal side to Ashram Chowk will be diverted on to Lodhi Road from Neela Gumbad (Subj Burj Circle). Those vehicles can then proceed onwards via Barapullah Flyover or Lala Lajpat Rai Marg,” Mishra said. All traffic from Bhogal T-point would be diverted from Mathura Road towards Neela Gumbad. Residents of neighbourhoods like Jangpura, Jangpura Extension, Bhogal, East and West Nizamuddin, who wish to travel towards Ashram Chowk, will have to proceed towards Neela Gumbad and then take Lodhi Road.Mishra said the problem with pipelines arose while widening both carriageways of the road between Ashram and Bhogal during the construction of the underpass. “The two carriageways were widened by removing the footpaths. In that process, the DJB pipelines laid under the footpaths came directly under the extended carriageways. Traffic load on Mathura Road caused the pipelines to begin leaking at a number of places,” said Mishra. That in turn, caused waterlogging and slush to build up at several points of both carriageways. “The resultant potholes and the shifting mud made traffic movement difficult, and increased the travel and wait time near Ashram Chowk,” Mishra said. “But, only the Ashram to Bhogal carriageway is going to be ready by Saturday morning. Work hasn’t begun on the opposite carriageway,” he added. Another problem that had cropped up was the damage to the MTNL cables, affecting 8,000 connections, and even they are likely to be fixed in the next two days, said the officer. Jain had visited the intersection on Wednesday after HT reported how the project to decongest one of the busiest junctions of the national capital had instead turned it into a traffic and pollution hot spot. “Closing the Ashram-Nizamuddin section of the Mathura Road for 10 days is the only way to address the chaos at the intersection with Ring Road,” Jain had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/section-of-mathura-road-near-ashram-to-be-shut-for-two-days/story-YjrERA1yMV9jSlxE0BquXN.html
10-10-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata Durga Puja organisers issue fresh guidelines amid spike in Covid-19 cases||With Kolkata witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases ahead of Durga Puja, organisers have decided to cancel all cultural programs that used to be held in every locality on puja days to avoid crowding. This comes at a time when doctors have warned the Mamata Banerjee administration that laxity during puja days could result in a three to four-fold rise in Covid-19 cases. They have cited the example of Kerala where cases had shot up after Onam festivities and the government had to invoke section 144 to avoid gatherings. “This year, we have requested all puja committees not to organise any kind of cultural programs which are usually organised every evening on the sidelines of the puja. This would result in crowding as people would sit in front of the dais to enjoy the programs. The chief minister has asked us to avoid crowding at all cost,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab. This year, more than 37,000 pujas would be organised across the state, including more than 2,500 in Kolkata and around 1,700 pujas which are organised by women. The list doesn’t include those organised inside housing societies and houses. The forum has more than 370 of the city’s most prominent and biggest pujas under its banner, including the ones that are patronised by some senior ministers in Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet.Also read: Flipkart tells Nagaland customer no service outside India. Then apologisesWith the festive season going on and people crowding at markets for puja shopping, the number of new Covid-19 cases reported every day has already shot up alarmingly in the city. While on September 8 Kolkata registered 380 new cases of Covid-19, on October 8 the city registered 765 new cases. Durga puja starts on October 23. In mid-July, when Kolkata was registering less than 400 new cases every day, the forum had come up with a list of dos and don’ts for the puja organisers. Hence, a fresh list of dos and don’ts was issued on Friday, amid a drastic spike in Covid-cases. “Situations have changed now and cases are rising. We need to be more cautious. It has been decided that none would be allowed to enter the pandal without wearing a mask. The puja committees would deploy more volunteers to check this and whether safe distance is being maintained in queues. Hand sanitisers would be provided. Visitors won’t be allowed to stay inside the pandal for more than a few minutes,” said Basu. The West Bengal government has already cancelled the post-immersion carnival which had become a major crowd puller. Puja organisers have been asked to keep the pandals as airy and open as possible. CM Banerjee has already announced Rs 50,000 for each puja committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-durga-puja-organisers-issue-fresh-guidelines-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-wEjNsmOSThoq6wjRn8rvEN.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||DU likely to announce its first cutoff list on Saturday, some colleges may keep cutoffs at 100%||The long-awaited, first cutoffs for admissions to undergraduate courses in Delhi University (DU) colleges, expected to be released on Saturday, may remain high, with some likely to even touch 100%, according to colleges and university officials. The admission process under the first merit list, likely to be released by colleges by Saturday evening, will be conducted between Monday and Wednesday. The second cutoff will be announced on October 19. Officials at almost all colleges said the cutoffs for popular courses are unlikely to go down this time, and may, in fact, increase by 0.5 to 1 percentage points. Last year, the highest cutoff across all courses was 99%, for BA (Hons) Political Science, at Hindu College. Some colleges are likely to keep cut-offs at 100% as well. “Cut-offs are set to rise exponentially this time as more number of students have scored high marks this year. We have decided to keep the cutoffs for at least three courses at 100%,” said an official from a south campus college, requesting anonymity.DU dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said colleges have been asked to submit their first cutoffs by Saturday noon. “The announcement of cutoffs depends on data sent to us by colleges. We have asked them to submit the cutoffs to us by noon Saturday. But we can’t commit on any date,” she said. Last week, Bagai had said the admissions committee was making all efforts to announce the cutoffs on October 10. The university has received the highest number of applications this year as the registration process had continued for over three months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As many as 353, 918 candidates have applied for the approximately 70,000 undergraduate seats. That is a jump of around 100,000 from last year when the university had received 258,388 applications. Principals of several DU colleges said cutoffs are unlikely to come down and it might even increase by .5 to 1 percentage points in the first list. St Stephen’s College had released its first cut-off list on Tuesday, with the highest being 99.25% for BA (Hons) Economics. The cutoffs announced by the college for most courses were higher than the year before. Rama Sharma, principal of Hansraj College, said, “We are still analysing the data from the applications provided by the university. We are not expecting any decrease in the cutoffs this year. For some subjects, it might go up by 0.5 to 1 percentage points and for others, it may remain the same as last year,” she said. The highest cutoff announced by the college last year was 98.5%, for BA (Hons) Economics. Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, said the cutoffs might increase by around two percentage points in the first list. Expanding on the reasons, he said cutoffs are primarily decided on the basis of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)’s Class 12 results as a majority of applicants is from the CBSE stream. According to data shared by DU, of the 353, 918 applications received, at least 285,128 are from CBSE schools. “The number of students scoring 90% and 95% (in the CBSE stream) has also increased this year. That will reflect in the cutoffs as well,” he said. Compared to last year, the number of students scoring 95% and above has increased by 118.6 percentage points, and those scoring 90% and above by 67.48 percentage points. Vipin Aggarwal, principal of Aurobindo College, said, “Cutoffs are expected to be on the higher side than last year as more applicants will seek admission and the number of students scoring high marks has increased this year.” The highest cutoff for BA (Hons) English last year was 97.75%, as announced by Lady Shri Ram (LSR) and Hindu College. Shri Ram College for Commerce (SRCC) had the highest cutoff for BA (Hons) in Economics at 98.75%.For BCom (Hons), the highest cutoff was announced by SRCC and Kirori Mal College at 98.5%. The highest cutoff for BA (Hons) Psychology was 98.75%, announced by LSR. According to Delhi University rules, colleges are supposed to give admission to all applicants who meet the announced cutoff criteria and there is no ‘first come, first served’ policy. Many a time, colleges have to increase seats to accommodate the eligible students. “That is one of the main reasons why colleges fix such high cutoffs,” said a member of the DU admissions committee, who wished not to be named. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had also introduced changes in the admission process -- it had allowed candidates to apply for all courses this year. This was done to make the process easier for students as results of many state boards and the CBSE were pending at the time the registration process began,” said Suman Kumar, a member of the admissions branch, on condition of anonymity. Several teachers and principals said that too would contribute to colleges setting higher cutoffs. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “This year, the colleges will have to go by approximation since there is no data available on the number of applications for each course. That might lead to an increase in the cutoffs for all courses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-likely-to-announce-its-first-cutoff-list-on-saturday-some-colleges-may-keep-cutoffs-at-100/story-sXQo5P2hCOyfYT5ZvcUDcP.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashta government declares plan to form ministerial panel for OBC demands||Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Friday declared plans to form a cabinet sub-committee to fulfil demands of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community. He also assured that the reservation quota of OBCs will not be reduced. The decision was taken in a meeting with OBC community leaders.“I can assure that reservation of the community is not going to be reduced. I am also very much aware of the demands of the OBC community. A cabinet sub-committee will be formed to resolve pending issues and fulfil the demands. Immediate decisions on demands, that can be resolved without any hassle, will be taken. Priority will be also given for releasing funds for welfare schemes,” said Thackeray.As the state government is unable to implement the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act that provides reservation to Maratha community, following a stay by the Supreme Court, the OBC community is worried that if Marathas are made part of their community, it will ultimately reduce their quota.The OBC community is currently getting 27% reservation in government jobs and education. Marathas were given reservations of 12% and 13% in employment and education, respectively, in 2018, under the SEBC Act.JD Tandel, vice-president, OBC Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, said, “We have strongly opposed any thought process of inducting Marathas into the OBC community. We also want a caste-based census to be conducted so that the actual population of the communities will come before everyone, and accordingly, we can demand our rights proportionate to our population.” In another meeting with Dhangar community leaders, the CM assured the government would hold discussions with legal experts within eight days on their demand for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category.“The chief minister has assured that he will discuss our demand for reservation benefits in the ST category with legal experts. We have informed the CM that we were included in the ST category back in 1956 but are still considered as a nomadic tribe,” said Navnath Padalkar, state coordinator, Maharashtra Dhangar Aarakshan Kruti Samiti (MDAKS).Traditionally a shepherd community, Dhangars want to be included in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category which will make them eligible for up to 7% reservations. Currently, Dhangars are part of the Nomadic Tribe (NT) community and get 3.5% reservation in government jobs and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashta-government-declares-plan-to-form-ministerial-panel-for-obc-demands/story-uFiOvxkpIKzEGGZLn3X1MP.html
10-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration exploring taller house options for stilt parking||In a city struggling with acute parking problems, the UT administration is exploring plans to allow taller residential buildings to create space for stilt parking – which is not permitted as of now.People in neighbouring states like Haryana too can build stilt parking – a partially covered space on the ground floor, usually in apartment blocks – with an additional floor to resolve the parking problem. UT adviser Manoj Parida has asked the urban planing department to consider relaxing height restrictions in residential units. “I have directed the UT chief architect to re-examine the issue of allowing increased height in houses,” he said on Friday.The development comes in the wake of the deadlock over the administration’s draft parking policy which recommends building stilts as a solution to resolve the parking mess. It also proposes relaxation in norms to allow for more space for vehicles in residential and commercial units.Why does height matter?The draft policy allows stilt parking but within the height permitted. It states, “Stilt parking at ground floor shall be allowed within the permissible ground coverage, FAR (floor area ratio) and height of the building.”FAR means the ratio of a building’s gross floor area to the total area of the land upon which it is constructedHowever, the thinking in some circles within the administration is that given the current height restrictions, allowing stilt parking will not make sense, and people will not opt for it. “Will people sacrifice their residential space for more parking space? This is not reasonable,” said a senior UT official on condition of anonymity.Notably, the planning department had earlier expressed reservations over allowing stilt parking or relaxations in height, with some officials saying there’s no such provision in the master plan and that it could go against the architectural vision of the city.The unresolved height issue has led to hurdles in implementation of the parking policy. Parking messParking remains a major problem in Chandigarh as it has the highest per capita car ownership in the country: Four per household according to the draft policy.For a population of around 11.35 lakh, there are more than 12 lakh motor vehicles registered in the city, states the 2019 report of the Chandigarh traffic police on Road safety in Chandigarh. Between 2010 and 2019, around four lakh new vehicles were added in the city.“The parking problem is severe in the city. People park their cars in front of their houses,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener of the City Forum of Residents’ Welfare Organisations. “Till we impose restrictions on car ownership, stilt parking is one of the solutions we have to explore.”The situation is worse in the Central and southern sectors “With cars parked on the streets, no space is left even for movement of emergency vehicles. This problem requires urgent resolution,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation.Sumit Kaur, former chief architect, UT administration, however, disagreed, adding: “We have already allowed increased in height in marla houses. The installation of solar panels, etc also added to the height. Any further increase will impact the streets.”Stating that instead of stilt parking and height relaxations, a change in city’s mobility culture is required, Kaur added, “Adoptions of a cycle culture is one of the options. Other solutions are also mentioned in the city’s master plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-exploring-taller-house-options-for-stilt-parking/story-kpRLvuq9GVM0UP1zc5mVIL.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||AAP accuses BJP-run civic agencies of corruption, BJP says accusations frivolous||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) of corruption and alleged that civic body officials took bribes for issuing/renewing health trade licences of restaurants in the city. The BJP hit back and said the charges were “frivolous”. Earlier this week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had issued directions to the civic agencies asking them to do away with health trade licences for restaurants, citing requests from stakeholders in the industry who pointed out that the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) already had protocols in place. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said Friday, “The BJP-ruled MCDs do not want to abolish licence raj; they want to continue to issue health trade licences to restaurant owners. CM Kejriwal told the commissioners of all three MCDs that the restaurant operators will not need to get health trade licences from the MCDs anymore. Under the law made in 2011, all restaurants are registered under the FSSAI and they are given a five-year licence, and yet the MCD is harassing restaurant owners.” “Every restaurant owner in Delhi has to pay a bribe of ₹1-5 lakh to an MCD official for renewal of health trade licences. The central government has already written to the MCDs asking them to stop this practice but the BJP-ruled MCDs continue with it,” said Bhardwaj, who is also the MLA from the Greater Kailash assembly segment. He further said, “It is shameful that the BJP is not paying the salaries of doctors ( in a reference to the strike by Hindu Rao Hospital doctors); the BJP-ruled MCDs are corrupt and incompetent. In the past five years, the AAP government’s revenue has doubled but in MCDs, only the incomes of councillors have increased.” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Statements by MLA Bhardwaj are frivolous. It is strange that the AAP leaders don’t know the difference between trade licence given to shops and health licence given to restaurants, which involve public health.” “Obtaining a trade licence does not require traders to go to any inspector; it is issued online. Restaurants are given health licences as their businesses involve public health. Hence, periodic checks by municipal doctors and health inspectors are mandatory and licences are issued manually thereafter. AAP leaders should know that the world over, restaurants and hotels are issued licences in a similar manner,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-accuses-bjp-run-civic-agencies-of-corruption-bjp-says-accusations-frivolous/story-EnoFAAOyshqRRd77Nyjh3L.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||DDA allots land in South Delhi’s city forest for rebuilding Ravidas temple||A year after the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the Guru Ravidas temple in the Jahapanah city forest in South Delhi’s Tughlaqabad, in pursuance of a Supreme Court order, the land-owning agency has initiated the process to hand over the site to devotees. A proposal to change the land use and allot 400 square metres (sqm) of land in the city forest for the construction of a temple was approved by a DDA meeting, chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Friday. The L-G later tweeted, “Chaired Delhi Development Authority meeting. The Authority approved key proposals for allotment of land for construction of Guru Ravidas temple at Jahapanah city forest & reduction in Minimum Reserve Price for auction of land for Educational & Health facilities (sic).”While DDA has approved the land-use change, a nod from the forest department and other necessary permissions from other departments concerned are awaited. Last month, the DDA’s technical committee had approved a proposal to change the land use of a 400sqm plot, the site where the temple had stood, from “recreational” to “public/semi-public”. “The proposal to change the land use and allot it to the committee has been approved. Further processes such as obtaining approval from the forest department and the formation of the devotees’ committee, etc., will follow. We have written to the forest department. We will send the proposal to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for a final notification,” a senior DDA official said, on condition of anonymity. A second DDA official said, “As an exception in this particular case, the authority has dispensed with ”auction” as the only mode of land allotment.” Forest department officials did not comment on the issue. Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and MLA Somnath Bharti, who is a member of the DDA, said, “In the last meeting, I had observed that the DDA should consider giving the land back to the Guru Ravidas Samiti without any further delay. Today the DDA has passed the matter. We are happy that this historic work has taken place. The AAP raised the issue and the court also had a hearing on the issue. But today I am happy that due to the persuasion of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the DDA has passed these two decisions (land allotment and land-use change). Now there will be no problem in rebuilding the Ravidas temple.”In August last year, the DDA had demolished the temple in pursuance of a Supreme Court order. This had led to large-scale protests by devotees of Guru Ravidas in Delhi and several other parts of north India. In November 2019, the Supreme Court had allowed the reconstruction of a temple at the same location. But devotees of Guru Ravidas want the process to be expedited and items confiscated by the DDA at the time of demolition returned. “It has been over a year, but the DDA is yet to allot a site for the construction of the temple. Devotees want the area to be handed over at the earliest. We want the adjourning area, measuring 12,350 square yards, where the sarovar is located, to be developed and given to the committee,” said MR Balli, general secretary of the 11-member committee that was constituted following the apex court order. A senior DDA official clarified, “The land allotment is as per the Supreme Court order and as per the land allotment norms.” The DDA said the land parcel can be allotted to a registered religious committee only. “But currently, there is no such committee,” the official said. Balli said, “We were told about this issue. We have recently applied under the Societies Act to register our committee.”BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, who is a member of DDA, said, “It is an important decision. Our government at the Centre had assured the devotees that all necessary measures would be taken. The land-use change has been approved and the authority has decided to give the land to the devotees of Guru Ravidas.”OTHER APPROVALS The DDA meeting Friday also approved a proposal to allow stockists and dealers of medicines to operate from residential areas. It gave a go-ahead for the development of a sports complex in east Delhi. “To provide modern sports facilities to residents of east Delhi, the land use of 19,800 sqm in Shastri Park will be changed from recreational to “public/semi-public”,” a third official, on condition of anonymity, said. The official added, “All land-use changes approved by the authority will be put in the public domain for suggestions/ objections. These will be sent to the ministry for a final approval and due notifications.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-allots-land-in-south-delhi-s-city-forest-for-rebuilding-ravidas-temple/story-oxOSurBgI4SPNgCuPIyO3I.html
10-10-2020||Delhi||19-year-old man beaten to death in north Delhi by family of woman he was in a relationship with||A 19-year-old college student was beaten to death in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar earlier this week by family and friends of a woman he was in a relationship with, the police said on Friday. According to investigating officers, the woman’s family did not approve of their relationship. Though the teenager, Rahul Kumar, was rescued from the assault, which took place on Wednesday, he succumbed to his injuries at a hospital the next morning. The police have registered a case of murder and have arrested two adults and apprehended three minors. The five include the woman’s younger brother, relatives and friends. “They have all been booked for murder,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west). Kumar lived with his parents and a younger sister in Adarsh Nagar and was pursuing a BA course from Delhi University’s School of Open Learning (SOL). He would also give tuitions to supplement his family’s income, which was largely reliant on his father’s earnings as a taxi driver. Kumar’s uncle, Dharampal, said that about two months ago, his family got to know about his relationship with an 18-year-old woman who lives in nearby Jahangirpuri. “My nephew would give her English tuitions at a coaching centre,” said Dharampal, who is also a taxi driver. While Dharampal said his family did not have objections to the relationship, Arya said the woman’s family was against the couple speaking to each other. “The woman’s family wanted Kumar to stop speaking to the woman. We were worried about his safety,” Dharampal told the police in his statement. Dharampal said he received a phone call from a friend around 7pm on Wednesday that a group of men were thrashing Kumar, not far from their house. Kumar was allegedly lured out of his house on the pretext of offering him a tuition opportunity. “I rushed to the place to see four or five people kicking and punching my nephew. I intervened, and the woman’s younger brother said they were beating him up because he had refused to stop seeing the woman. I managed to rescue my nephew after pleading with them to let him go. They left after threatening us,” Dharampal alleged. Kumar was taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where he was discharged after first aid. “At night, his condition deteriorated. We took him back to the hospital on Thursday morning, but he died during treatment,” said Dharampal. The local police, meanwhile, were tipped off about the assault by the hospital authorities on Wednesday night itself. “While there were no visible injuries, doctors opined that he died of internal injuries. So, we registered a murder case and caught five suspects involved in the assault,” Arya said. Since the victim and the woman he was in a relationship with belong to different communities, the police have deployed police personnel in both neighbourhoods. “There is no communal tension, and this is just a precautionary measure,” another senior police officer said. Dharampal said he too didn’t see the murder as a communal issue. “We are an educated family and don’t see issues that way. We just want justice for our boy, irrespective of which community the attackers belong to,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/19-year-old-man-beaten-to-death-in-north-delhi-by-family-of-woman-he-was-in-a-relationship-with/story-Uzc0tb3q4Vu5XazhENBM0N.html
10-10-2020||Mumbai||TRP fraud: Republic TV’s chief financial officer, 2 others summoned by Mumbai Police||A day after the television rating points (TRP) fraud was unearthed, the Mumbai Police on Friday summoned Shiva Sundaram, chief financial officer (CFO) of Republic TV, Sam Balsara, founder, chairman and managing director of Madison World, and Shashi Sinha, CEO of IPG Mediabrands, to record their statements at the crime branch office in south Mumbai at 11am on Saturday. The Mumbai Police on Thursday said TRPs were being manipulated by at least three channels and arrested four men, contending that the manipulated audience numbers were crucial because they directly translated into advertising revenue. The Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) has contracted Hansa Research Private Limited to monitor various channels and programmes through 30,000 barometers installed across India, based on which the council awards ratings to channels. Of the 30,000, 2,000 barometers are installed in Mumbai, which are handled by 20 relationship managers. “While investigating a complaint filed by Hansa group on October 6, we found some channels were paying former Hansa employees. They, in turn, were paying certain households to keep certain channels like Republic switched on to show higher TRPs,” Mumbai’s police commissioner Param Bir Singh said on Thursday, adding that apart from Republic, Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema were also found to be gaming the system. According to the latest TRP ratings, Republic is the most watched English language news channel. Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, put out a video message on the channel’s website denying the allegations and stating the “channel’s name was not mentioned in the FIR”. He claimed the channel was being targeted for its coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput case, and added that the channel would sue the police. Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police (crime), said, “The trio has been called to record their statements under section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code.” Calls and text messages to Sundaram went unanswered. Sinha said, “Mumbai Police have called me to be present at their office. I have no idea what they have called me for what they will ask me, so I can’t say anything as of now. I will go and meet them.” Balsara said, “I am a client of BARC. Mumbai Police has requested my help to aid the investigation, which I am happy to do.” Meanwhile, Mumbai Police produced the four arrested accused – Vishal Bhandari, 20, Bompalli Rao Mistry alias Sanjiv Rao, 44, and owners of Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema, Shirish Shetty and Narayan Sharma, respectively – before Esplanade court which remanded them in police custody till October 13. Nitin Deokar, deputy general manager of Hansa Research Private Limited, who filed the complaint at Kandivli police station, had alleged in his compliant that Bhandari was working as a relationship manager in his organisation from November 2019 to May 2020. Deokar in his complaint stated that during an internal inquiry, they found that Bhandari used to take money from one Vinay Tripathi, a wanted accused, and used to pay households where barometer was installed and asked them to allegedly watch India Today. Param Bir Singh on Friday clarified that there was no evidence against India Today. “Hansa Research Private Limited received a complaint against Bhandari, stating he was paying several households to tune into certain channels. India Today’s name came during their internal inquiry based on which an FIR was filed. We took Bhandari’s custody and have recorded the statements of witnesses. We have not found any evidence to substantiate the claim that India Today was involved in manipulating TRPs,” said Singh. “During further inquiry, Bhandari took the name of Rao and said he was currently working for him. Rao is in direct contact with several owners of channels and is involved in manipulating TRPs,” said a crime branch officer. “When Mumbai Police visited the residence of one of the viewers mentioned in the FIR, Kandivli resident Tejal Solanki, in whose house a barometer was installed, we found that India Today was not subscribed. During the inquiry, Solanki and a senior citizen in her residence told us they were asked to watch Republic TV,” said a crime branch officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trp-fraud-republic-tv-s-chief-financial-officer-2-others-summoned-by-mumbai-police/story-6cVHLBOa9ClftR0tAOHcpO.html

Born two weeks ago, Azalea Belle Gray is the sixth child for Aaron Gray and Erin Fernald Gray on Islesford, which is also known as Little Cranberry Island. The Grays had contingency plans to go to Mount Desert Island — the largest island off the coast of Maine — for the birth if they needed to. But everything went smoothly September 26, the Bangor Daily News reported. Ellen Fernald Gray said she didn’t set out to be the first woman to have a home birth in Islesford since Calvin Coolidge was president. She said she didn’t realise how long it’d been since the last island birth: her own grandfather, Warren Fernald, in 1927. It was only after Azalea’s birth that she learned that the lifelong lobsterman who died in 2005 had previously been the most recent birth on Islesford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-born-on-maine-island-for-1st-time-in-more-than-90-years/story-yasShinYxHWn77M3DNDYcO.html

A judge immediately sentenced him under a state law that makes a life sentence mandatory for first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer.Johnson entered his plea via video conference from the maximum-security prison at Oak Park Heights. He said he had checked out a hammer on July 18, 2018, from the metal shop at the Stillwater prison, where he was incarcerated, and hit Gomm in the head, “twice, I believe.”Johnson said he meant to kill Gomm, who was supervising inmates in the metal shop. Gomm, 45, had been a corrections officer for 16 years.Gomm’s death led to a monthlong lockdown of the Stillwater prison and the resignation of three officers. At least 10 others took leaves. His death also prompted guards to demand more security cameras and staffing in vocational workshops.Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell called the plea and sentencing “bittersweet.”“Though it brings a fitting end to the judicial process, it does not relieve the very real pain and loss experienced by Joe’s immediate family, friends, and co-workers,” Schnell said in a statement. “Officer Gomm was an honorable public servant not because of how he died, but because of the way he lived – his memory and sacrifice should be forever honored.”Johnson was serving a 29-year sentence for the 2002 stabbing of his then-roommate, and his life sentence will run consecutive to that, Washington County District Judge Ellen Maas said.Gomm’s sister, Audrey Cone, and her husband, Chris Cone, told the Star Tribune they were relieved that Johnson decided to plead guilty.“At least we can close this part of the book and try to move forward,” Audrey Cone said. “We’re never going to get Joe back. That’s really the only thing that would ever fix this.”The Cones said they plan to sue the Department of Corrections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-in-prison-for-murder-admits-to-killing-minnesota-guard/story-Y9WZAWcZWj5BcLBZ8AIaeI.html
10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, still facing health questions, holds first public event since Covid-19 diagnosis||U.S. President Donald Trump will on Saturday hold his first public event since being diagnosed with Covid-19 more than a week ago, aiming to show he has beaten the virus and is ready to resume campaigning, although questions remain about his health.Trump is expected to make remarks from a White House balcony to a crowd of hundreds on the lawn below. The White House called the event “a peaceful protest for law & order.”The president revealed his positive coronavirus test on Oct. 2 and spent three nights in hospital before returning to the White House on Monday. He has not said whether he is still contagious, only that he is no longer showing symptoms of the virus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans.A White House spokeswoman said on Friday that Trump will be tested for COVID-19 and will not go out in public if it is determined he can still spread the virus.The White House did not preview the remarks that Trump will deliver on Saturday, but he campaigned on a law-and-order theme throughout a summer of protests for racial justice.Trump’s efforts to portray himself as tough on crime have had little impact on his standing in national opinion polls, which show him trailing his Democratic challenger Joe Biden by double digits. But the gap between the two candidates is narrower in the battleground states that may determine who wins the White House.Trump has said a Biden presidency would lead to lawlessness, while seeking to tie the former vice president to unrest sparked by the deaths of Black Americans while in police custody.Biden has accused Trump of stoking violence with his rhetoric. The Democratic candidate has embraced calls from protesters for policing reforms but has denounced the rioting and looting that have disturbed some of the mostly peaceful protests across the country in recent months.On Monday, Trump plans a campaign rally in central Florida, a must-win state for his hopes of a second term. His campaign also announced events in Pennsylvania and Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday.In an appearance on Fox News on Friday evening, Trump said he had been tested again for the virus but did not disclose the result. He also said he had stopped taking medications to combat COVID-19. “I feel really strong,” Trump said.The White House has not released the results of Trump’s latest test, and has declined to say when he last tested negative.Trump and his administration have faced criticism for their handling of the pandemic, as well as for a lax approach to mask-wearing and social distancing in the White House and - in recent days - confusing messages about how ill the president has been.BIDEN IN PENNSYLVANIABiden sharply criticized Trump’s decision to resume campaigning. “Good luck. I wouldn’t show up unless you have a mask and can distance,” he told reporters in Paradise, Nevada.A source familiar with the planning for Saturday’s White House event said attendees will all be expected to wear masks. People at the Florida rally will be given a temperature check, masks that they will be encouraged to wear, and access to hand sanitizer, the campaign said.Biden will travel on Saturday to the city of Erie in northwestern Pennsylvania, a state that Trump narrowly took over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Former Democratic President Barack Obama won Erie county in the two elections beforehand and Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, has made the region a top priority.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released earlier this week showed Biden with a five-point edge over Trump in Pennsylvania. The poll also had Biden with a 10-point lead nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-still-facing-health-questions-holds-first-public-event-since-covid-19-diagnosis/story-coowGar6FhosQT6GvFko4J.html
10-10-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi calls Donald Trump plan ‘one step forward, two steps back’||President Donald Trump scrapped fiscal stimulus talks this week after failing to swing Senate Republicans behind a package Democrats could support. With negotiations back on, the obstacles are just as daunting, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi termed Trump’s latest offer “insufficient.”Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin head into weekend negotiations with the top-line number for relief fast approaching the $2 trillion level that many Senate Republicans say they cannot accept.Before those talks, though, Pelosi on Saturday called the Trump administration’s latest offer “one step forward, two steps back.”“We still have disagreement on many priorities,” Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues. “His proposal appears to mean that he wants more money at his discretion to grant or withhold.”Funding for state and local government “remains sadly inadequate,” she added.Senate Republicans, meanwhile, expressed concerns about both the proposed size and certain elements of Trump’s proposal on a call Saturday with Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the Washington Post reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.Mnuchin has already alienated some in his party by moving toward policies in the House Democrats’ $2.2 trillion proposal that they oppose. His counteroffer contains language allowing taxpayer-funded abortions through Obamacare and stimulus checks to undocumented immigrants, according to a person familiar with the matter -- measures anathema to many GOP lawmakers.After a months-long deadlock, the stimulus talks took on a desperate appearance this week. Trump on Tuesday tried to blame Pelosi for refusing to compromise, and pulled out his negotiators. Hours later, he demanded separate bills for aid including stimulus checks for individuals and aid to airlines. By Thursday, comprehensive talks were back on.Then came Friday. With his poll deficit to Joe Biden widening and the need to divert attention from his handling of the coronavirus escalating, Trump endorsed an even bigger stimulus proposal. Just how big a number he wants hasn’t been entirely clear.Negotiators UndercutMnuchin made a $1.8 trillion offer to Pelosi Friday -- an increase from the $1.6 trillion the White House had previously endorsed. Yet Trump undercut that by saying he wants an even bigger stimulus than what the Democrats advocate.“I would like to see a bigger stimulus package, frankly, than either the Democrats or the Republicans are offering,” Trump said on Rush Limbaugh’s radio program, adding that he’s going in the “exact opposite” direction from his earlier stances.Shortly after, the White House communications director, Alyssa Farah, told reporters the administration wants a package below $2 trillion, sowing further confusion.Democrats’ $2.2 trillion plan, passed by the House earlier this month, is down from the $3.4 trillion package they approved in the chamber in May.Senate VoteSenate Republicans backed a bill offering about $650 billion last month, showcasing the gulf with the House. But if Mnuchin and Trump can get Pelosi to sign off on an agreement for less than $2 trillion, it would be hard for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not to put it up for a vote, according to a Senate GOP aide.Trouble is, the president’s suggestion he wants something bigger than the Democratic proposal could also harden Pelosi’s demands for larger-scale spending.Then there’s the timeline. For Trump -- and vulnerable moderates from both parties -- unveiling a deal after Election Day would garner no campaign benefit. It took 19 days after enacting the last stimulus, in March, to send out stimulus payments to individuals, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts pointed out. There are now 24 days left until the election.Crafting a pre-election bill may prove a hurdle too high. McConnell said on Friday that there’s probably not enough time.Barrett Is the Priority“I believe that we do need another rescue package, but the proximity to the elections and the differences of opinion about what is needed are pretty vast,” McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky.The majority leader later told reporters that “even if an agreement” on stimulus is reached, his first priority is securing Senate confirmation of Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. Hearings for her nomination are scheduled to begin Monday with a final Senate vote as soon as the week of Oct. 26.If Pelosi and Mnuchin did reach an agreement, Congress would likely need two weeks or more to draft legislative text and approve it in the House and Senate. The Senate is on recess until Oct. 19 and the House until mid-November, but lawmakers have been told they can be called back with 24 hours notice to vote on any stimulus deal.If it came to a vote, Republican lawmakers may be the key obstacle.Further DisputesMcConnell has said there are members of his majority who think the government has already provided enough stimulus. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California has also said his caucus members are skeptical of a large package. “We’d have to see what’s in it, but I think it’s difficult,” he said last month.The two sides are are divided on issues including how much money to provide state and local governments, language restricting Trump’s ability to divert anti-virus health care spending and the level and length of supplemental unemployment benefits. Dozens of smaller arguments, such as on funding for election security and the U.S. Postal Service, also remain.Many of the policy issues are “at least as controversial as the top-line number,” Goldman analysts including Alec Phillips wrote in a note Friday.“An appearance of additional progress seems likely over the next several days,” with Trump pushing for a deal, they wrote. But “we haven’t changed our view that substantial fiscal stimulus is unlikely to pass before the election,” the Goldman team concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-calls-donald-trump-plan-one-step-forward-two-steps-back/story-kzMqdWBhhzMpNESGjgPfuK.html

10-10-2020||World||Taiwan urges China to ‘never seek hegemony’ and ease tensions||Taiwan’s leader on Saturday appealed to her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to deescalate military tensions and live up to his promise to “never seek hegemony” after months of Beijing ramping up fighter jet incursions.In a speech on Taiwan’s national day, President Tsai Ing-wen said the international community was becoming concerned about the “expanding hegemony” of China. Beijing views democratic, self-ruling Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it back into fold.But Tsai referenced a recent speech by Xi to the United Nations that she said gave the Taiwanese some hope.“I am also aware that the leader across the Strait (Xi) has publicly stated in a video message to the United Nations General Assembly that China will never seek hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence ... we hope this is the beginning of genuine change.” “We are committed to upholding cross-strait stability, but this is not something Taiwan can shoulder alone -- it is the joint responsibility of both sides,” she added,Beijing’s bellicose stance towards Taiwan has increased dramatically under Xi, who has described the island’s unification with the mainland as “inevitable”.It is also a response to the election of Tsai in 2016 and again earlier this year. Tsai, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), views Taiwan as a sovereign country and rejects the idea that the island is part of “one China”. Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) accused Tsai of “extending confrontational thinking and antagonism to promote independence” in her speech, according to the official Xinhua news agency.“We urge the DPP authority to stop any provocative word and action promoting independence and not to go further down the wrong road,” Xinhua quoted TAO spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian as saying.The DPP would “only swallow its own evil fruits to collude with Western countries,” Zhu warned.Washington’s increased outreach to Taipei under President Donald Trump has become yet another flashpoint with Beijing as US-China relations plunge to historic lows.China’s military has piled on pressure even more than usual this year, sending its warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence zone at unprecedented frequency and sometimes also crossing the so-called “median line” of the Taiwan Strait.It conducted exercises near the Taiwan Strait when a senior American diplomat was visiting the island last month, shortly after health chief Alex Azar made the highest-level US visit to Taipei since 1979 when Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.A Chinese foreign ministry official has even said there was no such thing as the median line as “Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory”, sparking condemnations from Taipei. On Saturday, Chinese jets entered Taiwan’s air defence zone for the eighth time this month and the fifth straight day this week, according to Taipei’s defence ministry.Tsai pledged that Taiwan “will not act rashly” and will work to lower the risk of military conflict.“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations... we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-urges-china-to-never-seek-hegemony-and-ease-tensions/story-iEpiSXzRvYpAqmQxZ5EnmO.html

Following his meetings this week with India’s top leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Abdullah said in an interview that he hadn’t discussed any “military role” for India in Afghanistan during his talks in New Delhi. Watch: Abdullah Abdullah on Afghan peace talks, India engaging with Taliban | Worldview “Whether India would like to engage with the Taliban or not, we have no view one way or another. I have not asked for that engagement, but should India opt to engage them, we will not have concerns about it. So that’s very clear,” he said. Abdullah said he had not raised or discussed a military role for India in Afghanistan during his meetings with the Indian leadership. “Analytically, it might have been in the public domain here, but personally, during my visit, we have not discussed it,” he said. Also read: India test-fires 10 missiles in 35 days. It is not a coincidenceZalmay Khalilzad, US special envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, had suggested earlier this year that India should directly engage the Taliban to discuss its concerns related to terror, reinvigorating the debate on whether New Delhi should talk to the group. However, diplomatic circles remain sceptical about the Taliban’s intentions in view of the group’s deep ties with the Pakistani security establishment. India’s decision to send an official delegation to the inauguration of talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha and the external affairs minister’s address to the event via video conference signalled towards a possible shift in New Delhi’s position. Abdullah said he had come to New Delhi to brief the leadership here on the Doha negotiations since India has contributed to the well-being of the Afghan people and is a “country which has a lot at stake in a peaceful settlement of the situation”. He added, “We were happy that external affairs minister S Jaishankar also addressed the conference [in Doha].” Acknowledging that the pace of the talks in Doha “is perhaps a bit slow” and that there needs to be a “significant reduction in violence” by the Taliban, Abdullah said the Afghan government delegation has been advised to be “patient, flexible, innovative and try to find a solution”. “Are both sides equally determined to achieve peace and utilise this opportunity for the best interest of our own people? That would be put to test. I have no doubt in my mind about the determination of the delegation from... Afghanistan,” he added. In the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s stated intention of pulling out all US troops from Afghanistan by late December, Abdullah reiterated such a move would have consequences. “If it is a premature withdrawal, it will... have consequences but eventually we need to stand on our own feet. But it will not be the end of US commitment in support of Afghanistan and we believe their commitment is long-term,” he said. “What brought them to Afghanistan was terrorist threats emanating from Afghanistan, which hurt them back in the US and I do not think that they want that situation to prevail in Afghanistan because we still have those challenges, including Al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups.” Responding to a question on the possible impact of India’s current tensions with both Pakistan and China, Abdullah acknowledged that such issues “certainly will have some repercussions for us”, but insisted that a “peaceful [and] stable Afghanistan is in the interest of everybody”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-leadership-won-t-have-concerns-if-india-engages-with-taliban-abdullah-abdullah/story-8h7tJ7rLvh1XjCFycq5FAN.html

But, I mean…you know…damn! Just get organized and get everyone to vote #Biden,” she wrote.Thunberg, who sparked a global climate protest movement after striking outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, could encourage participation among younger voters who are typically less likely to vote than older Americans.After Thunberg was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year in 2019, U.S President Donald Trump mocked the teen activist, tweeting she needed to “work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend”.Trump also sarcastically commented on Thunberg’s speech to a United Nations climate summit last year, in which she angrily denounced world leaders for failing to tackle climate change by demanding: “How dare you?”.Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement was nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, which on Friday was awarded to The United Nations’ World Food Programme.Trump, a Republican, has focused on dismantling former President Barack Obama’s climate agenda to free the energy and auto industries from the costs of regulations meant to protect health and the environment, while Biden has a focus on a new massive green infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-shows-support-for-joe-biden-in-rare-political-tweet/story-qlXUPWDO9uKTdeOHGGxVKM.html

10-10-2020||World||North Korea unveils new intercontinental ballistic missile at military parade||North Korea showcased previously unseen intercontinental ballistic missiles at an unprecedented predawn military parade on Saturday that showcased the country’s long-range missiles for the first time in two years.Analysts said the missile, which was shown on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, would be one of the largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the world if it becomes operational.Also displayed were the Hwasong-15, which is the longest-range missile ever tested by North Korea, and what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).Ahead of the parade, which was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, officials in South Korea and the United States said Kim Jong Un could use the event to unveil a new “strategic weapon” as promised earlier this year.The parade featured North Korea’s ballistic missiles for the first time since Kim began meeting with international leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, in 2018.“We will continue to build our national defence power and self-defensive war deterrence,” Kim said, but vowed that the country’s military power would not be used preemptively. He made no direct mention of the United States or the now-stalled denuclearisation talks.State news agency KCNA said the authority and security of North Korea hinged on “the huge nuclear strategic forces” shown in the parade.Kim blamed international sanctions, typhoons, and the coronavirus for preventing him from delivering on promises of economic progress.“I am ashamed that I have never been able to repay you properly for your enormous trust,” he said. “My efforts and devotion were not sufficient to bring our people out of difficult livelihoods.”The video showed Kim make an appearance as a clock struck midnight. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and accepted flowers from children while surrounded by military officials in Pyongyang’s recently renovated Kim Il Sung Square.The parade was highly choreographed, with thousands of troops marching in formation, displays of new conventional military equipment including tanks, and fighter jets launching flares and fireworks.Chad O’Carroll, CEO of the Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea, said more new military hardware had been displayed at this event than at nearly any other previous parade.CORONAVIRUS MEASURESSometimes appearing emotional, Kim thanked the military for working hard to respond to a series of damaging summer typhoons, and for preventing a coronavirus outbreak in the isolated country.Kim said he hoped that North and South Korea would join hands again when the global coronavirus crisis is over.He said he was grateful that not a single North Korean had tested positive for the disease, an assertion that South Korea and the United States have previously questioned.While attendees at other celebratory events were shown wearing masks, no one at the parade appeared to be wearing them.“It is an impressively large gathering during a global pandemic, suggesting North Korean authorities are concerned more with political history and national morale than with preventing a COVID-19 superspreader event,” said Leif-Eric Easley, who teaches at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Earlier in the day, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said South Korea and U.S. intelligence authorities were closely monitoring developments.South Korean officials said this week that Kim could use the event as a “low intensity” show of power ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, as denuclearisation talks with Washington have stalled.Foreign diplomats in Pyongyang have often been invited to observe past celebrations. But the Russian Embassy said on social media that all diplomatic missions have been advised this year to “refrain as much as possible” from travelling in the city, approaching the event venue and taking photos and videos.In a congratulatory message to Kim for the anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he intended to “defend, consolidate and develop” ties with North Korea, its state media said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-displays-ballistic-missiles-kim-apologises-for-economic-woes/story-ijS5bwqjY9NN1gfzy73IrM.html
10-10-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim attends military parade, thanks troops for stopping coronavirus||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addressed an unusual predawn military parade early on Saturday, praising the troops for working hard to respond to natural disasters and to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, state television reported.The country marked the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party with a raft of concerts and festivals, and the ceremony was seen around the region as an event where Kim could deliver messages to domestic and foreign audiences. State television began broadcasting edited video of the event later on Saturday after a day of silence about the parade, which was held in Pyongyang’s recently renovated Kim Il Sung Square. Officials in Seoul and Washington had said the North might unveil new strategic weapons. Initial footage of the parade showed conventional troops marching in formation and what appeared to be ballistic missiles on vehicles.The video showed Kim make an appearance as a clock struck midnight. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and accepted flowers from children while surrounded by military officials wearing rows of medals.Sometimes appearing emotional, Kim thanked the military for working hard to respond to natural disasters and to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. North Korea has not reported any domestic infections, an assertion that South Korea and the United States have questioned. Kim said he hopes that North and South Korea will join hands again after the coronavirus crisis is over.While attendees at other holiday events were shown wearing masks, no one at the parade appeared to be wearing any masks.CORONAVIRUS MEASURES The event comes as the isolated country carries out strict measures against the coronavirus. State media said the curbs have caused delays in some of Kim’s key economic and construction projects, already dogged by international sanctions. “It is an impressively large gathering during a global pandemic, suggesting North Korean authorities are concerned more with political history and national morale than with preventing a COVID-19 superspreader event,” said Leif-Eric Easley, who teaches at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. Earlier in the day, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it spotted signs that a parade involving large-scale military equipment and personnel took place in Pyongyang but gave no further details. “South Korea and U.S. intelligence authorities are closely monitoring developments,” it said.It was the first time that the parade has been held before dawn.South Korean officials said this week that Kim could use the event as a “low intensity” show of power ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, as denuclearisation talks with Washington have stalled.For weeks commercial satellite imagery has shown thousands of North Korean soldiers practicing marching, and South Korean officials have said the North could use the parade to unveil a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), or a new submarine-launched ballistic missile.Foreign diplomats in Pyongyang have often been invited to observe past celebrations. But the Russian Embassy said on social media that all diplomatic missions have been advised this year to “refrain as much as possible” from travelling in the city, approaching the event venue and taking photos and videos. The last time North Korea broadcast a military parade live on television was in 2017, when it showed off many large ICBMs amid heightened tension with the United States.ICBMs were once again paraded in February 2018, but no international media were allowed to observe. Shortly after, Kim began meeting international leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump, and no large missiles have been displayed since.In a congratulatory message to Kim for the anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he intended to “defend, consolidate and develop” ties with North Korea, its state media said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-attends-military-parade-thanks-troops-for-stopping-coronavirus/story-S1ps6EWUpw8LL0J8Yz1YrK.html
10-10-2020||World||UK plans new 3-tier system of Covid-19 lockdown measures||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to unveil a new three-tier system of measures alongside local regions across the country being handed greater decision-making powers as part of efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus.The new so-called “traffic light” system, to be laid out in the House of Commons on Monday, will see the most severe measures imposed for areas of England fall within the third tier and people being ordered not to have any social contact with anyone outside their household together with the expected closures of pubs, bars and restaurants where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring.Tier one is likely to see people expected to follow the “rule of six” on gatherings and maintain social distancing. Tier two could ban households from mixing in homes, gardens, pubs, bars or restaurants.According to a letter seen by the BBC, the details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend.Johnson’s Chief Strategic Adviser Edward Lister has written to the members of Parliament to highlight engagement with local authority leaders as part of the process. It comes amid mounting criticism of the government using a top-down approach by shutting down parts of northern England without a full engagement process with the local authorities.“The government is operating under the misguided, arrogant and counterproductive view that ‘Whitehall knows best’, that decisions can be made behind closed doors, without any real consultation or even picking up the phone to those on the frontline,” Opposition Labour Party Leader Kier Starmer wrote in ‘The Daily Telegraph’ earlier in the week.Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) also criticised the government’s approach to reduce the spread of the virus and called for compulsory face coverings across all settings.“COVID-19 is just as infectious in offices as in supermarkets. We need clear consistent policy now requiring masks in all settings where people mix outside their household and not 2 metres apart,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA Council Chair.A number of areas in the northern and Midlands of England are already subject to stricter restrictions, with the new tiered system being designed to try and better organise the differing set of rules for different parts of the UK.Public Health England’s national infection service warned that the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool – where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people – to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions.Other cities, such as Leeds and Sheffield, could fall in the top tier. There is also a debate about whether the tiers should be tightly drawn around larger cities, or include the suburbs where infections are less.Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan repeated his warnings that tougher restrictions in the UK capital are “inevitable”.“You’ve got three buckets: level one the least restrictions, level three the most – similar to lockdown-type measures.

10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to resume public events starting Saturday at White House||President Donald Trump will make his first public appearance since returning from a three-day hospitalization for Covid-19, setting the stage for a return to the campaign trail even as questions remain about whether he’s still contagious.In a Saturday address from a White House balcony before hundreds of invited guests, Trump will seek to show that he has made a strong recovery from coronavirus and is ready to resume work and re-enter the re-election race against Democratic nominee and front-runner Joe Biden.The event kicks off what could be a full week of campaign travel for the president, starting Monday with a stop in central Florida for a rally at the Orlando Sanford International Airport to make up for one canceled when Trump fell ill.Trump has been itching to return to public events following his battle with the coronavirus, aides say -- an impatience only heightened by the president falling further behind Biden in polls.The White House event comes at the earliest moment doctors said the president would be able to return to public life. The gathering risks deepening concern among voters about Trump’s handling of a pandemic that has left more than two dozen of his close associates infected and more than 210,000 Americans dead.After the president’s last outdoor event -- a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony to announce his pick of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court -- at least 11 attendees tested positive for coronavirus. While the White House had a testing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and attendees mingled and sat in close proximity to one another both indoors and outdoors.Trump’s physician said Wednesday that the president had been free of symptoms for the previous 24 hours. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump “will be clear to go” on Saturday, when “he wants to talk to the American people.” There are medical tests underway to ensure he doesn’t transmit the virus when he returns to the campaign trail, she said on Fox News, adding that she’d conferred with White House doctor Sean Conley. McEnany, who herself has tested positive for Covid-19, is working remotely.Virus ScreeningOn Saturday, White House guests must bring masks with them and wear them on the grounds, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that they also have to undergo a Covid-19 screening on Saturday morning that will include a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. But those rules were put in place not by the White House but by the organizer of the event, the Blexit group, led by Candace Owens, a Trump ally, the person said.On Tuesday, Trump is planning an event in western Pennsylvania, according to WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh. His campaign is negotiating a town hall on network television on Thursday, according to CNN.Trump’s challenge to win over voters has only intensified in recent days. His vacillations on a stimulus bill and second presidential debate have fed a developing narrative that he’s flailing as a second term slips from his grasp.Earlier in the week, Trump -– to the dismay of fellow Republicans -- said he was cutting off talks on an additional coronavirus stimulus bill, only to rapidly reverse course after the announcement rocked markets.But subsequent days saw a flurry of different and often contradictory statements from the White House. First, officials said they would resume talks -- but only on standalone bills to bolster the airline industry and small businesses.Reversing CourseThen Trump said not only did he want a sweeping bill, but was open to levels beyond even what Democrats had proposed. By Friday afternoon, the administration was preparing a proposal for a $1.8 trillion deal that fell below what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described as her floor, but exceeded levels Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said would be acceptable.Trump and his campaign team -- which, like the White House staff, has suffered coronavirus infections at the highest levels -- are searching for ways to reverse the president’s slide in polls.Trump pulled out of the second debate because the bipartisan commission organizing the event said it would be held virtually following his diagnosis. Trump’s efforts to force the debate commission to reverse course or reschedule the remaining debates fell flat. As a result, Trump will either be deprived of one of the final marquee opportunities to reach voters before Election Day or forced to publicly reverse himself.That’s left the president eager to return to the campaign trail, with hopes that his signature rallies can offer him a chance to reconnect with voters and rekindle enthusiasm for his candidacy.The president told Fox News host Sean Hannity that his team was looking to organize a rally Saturday night in Florida -- the earliest possible date his medical team said he might be able to resume public appearances -- and a second event Sunday in Pennsylvania.Virus SymptomsWhite House aides said logistical challenges prevented organizing such events on short notice. But the president also acknowledged Friday he’s still experiencing some symptoms from his brush with coronavirus. Trump was seen struggling to catch his breath after walking a flight of stairs during his return from the hospital on Monday, and occasionally lost his voice during his interview with Hannity on Thursday.Trump sought to underscore his health Friday through a marathon of interviews with conservative media figures.That included a two-hour uninterrupted conversation on Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio show. On that program, Trump ranked Fox News hosts by how favorable they were to him personally, expressed alarm that Attorney General Bill Barr might not release the findings of a politically charged investigation into the origins of its Russia probe and delivered an expletive-charged warning to Iran.Trump followed that up with several more interviews, including an appearance on Mark Levin’s talk show. The president is expected to be interviewed again Sunday morning by Fox Business Network.“I feel really good, I feel very strong, I know a lot of people who have had the Covid—or the China virus as I call it because it came from China,” the president said in an interview on Fox News Friday. “But I feel really, really strong and a lot of people don’t feel that way sometimes for a while afterwards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-resume-public-events-starting-saturday-at-white-house/story-CtZcucc2e8yFih9L6SZo9M.html
10-10-2020||World||New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern casts her vote a week before polls close||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has voted in the nation’s general election, a week before polls officially close.Ardern cast her vote in her Auckland district Saturday after visiting a market in the heavily Polynesian south Auckland suburb of Otara, where she was thronged by supporters.Ardern’s Labour Party has governed since the 2017 general election, when it was able to forge a narrow majority in New Zealand’s 120-seat Parliament in a coalition with the left-wing Greens and right-wing New Zealand First parties.Recent polls show a more comfortable result this year, with the Labour Party leading the National Party, led by 61-year-old conservative Judith Collins, by as many as 13 points.More than 700,000 people had voted by Saturday, a week before the official election day of Oct. 17, according to the New Zealand Electoral Commission. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to vote during the coming week.Ardern’s visit to Otara was an effort to get out the vote in an electorate in which Labour out-polls National by around four votes to one.“We’re seeing really high turnout at the moment for advance voting,” Ardern said. “We want to make sure everyone uses their voice until election day.”Voters have four choices to make this year. They are picking a candidate to represent their electorate and choosing which party to give their “party vote.” Seats in Parliament are allocated on the basis of seats won and the percentage of the vote won by each party.Voters also face two referendums. They will vote on the decriminalization of cannabis and on the legalization of “assisted dying” in limited cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-casts-her-vote-a-week-before-polls-close/story-ESlFWl12nBMkKPe5kCxlyK.html

There were reports from both sides of continued fighting in the run-up, and the two countries also alleged serious breaches after it got underway. The Moscow ceasefire talks were the first diplomatic contact between the two sides since fighting over the mountainous enclave erupted on Sept. 27, killing hundreds of people. The enclave is internationally-recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who helped mediate between the two sides, said in a statement in the early hours of Saturday after more than 10 hours of negotiations that the ceasefire had been agreed on humanitarian grounds.The International Committee of the Red Cross would help make the truce work, he said.“The specific terms of the ceasefire still need to be agreed,” said Lavrov, who said Armenia and Azerbaijan had also agreed to enter into what he called substantive peace talks. Those talks would be held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Minsk Group, he said. Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azeri counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov did not speak to reporters in Moscow after striking the ceasefire deal.But Mnatsakanyan later paid tribute on Armenian state TV to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he said had played a key role in making sure the talks happened and had personally intervened to help get an agreement.Turkey, which has strongly backed Baku, welcomed the deal but said much more was needed.“The humanitarian ceasefire is a significant first step but will not stand for a lasting solution,” the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. “Turkey emphasized that it will support any solution approved by Azerbaijan. Turkey will continue to stand by Azerbaijan in the field and at the table”. Rival allegationsThe Azeri defence ministry in a statement accused ethnic Armenian forces of shelling populated areas on Saturday morning ahead of the ceasefire, an allegation Yerevan denied. Armenia’s defence ministry, which said forces in the enclave had been ordered to halt fighting from midday, in turn accused the Azeris of using attack drones on a populated settlement inside Armenia and said it looked like Baku was trying to change the facts on the ground before the truce took hold. Ethnic Armenian officials in Nagorno-Karabakh also accused the Azeris of firing missiles at Stepanakert, the biggest town in the region, but said there was no data on casualties yet. Baku denied shelling or using drones against civilian areas.Nagorno-Karabakh officials said that 28 members of their defence forces had been killed in fighting since Friday. Renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.The clashes have also increased concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nagorno-karabakh-row-kremlin-backed-ceasefire-enters-into-force-despite-shelling-from-both-sides/story-SH2cn7Uy4iaKLKWKTVLRMM.html

While earlier studies had shown that the cocktail of two antibodies targeting the coronavirus spike protein could be used to neutralise the pathogen, scientists from the American biotechnology company Regeneron noted that further research in multiple animal models is needed to test the effectiveness of the formulation. In the current study, published in the journal Science, the researchers tested REGN-COV2 in rhesus macaques, which manifest mild Covid-19 symptoms, and in golden hamsters, which show symptoms that are much more severe, including rapid weight loss.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  They found that when the cocktail was administered three days before challenging the macaques with the virus, the treatment almost completely blocked establishment of infection. According to the scientists, this ability of REGN-COV2 “matches or exceeds the effects recently shown in vaccine efficacy studies using the same animal models.” “These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of (this approach) to both protect from and treat SARS-CoV-2 disease,” the researchers noted in the study. When the macaques were treated with the drug one day after infection, they said there was faster viral clearance than in controls who had not been treated with the cocktail. In the hamster model, the study noted that the animals treated with the drug two days before infection exhibited a “dramatic protection from weight loss,” and decreased viral load in the lungs.

10-10-2020||World||With whipping winds, Delta drenches Louisiana, Mississippi||Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. By early Saturday, it dwindled to a tropical storm with 60 mph (95 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas. Mississippi also got its fair share of rain overnight.Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.” In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack’s bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.” In the town of Lake Arthur, Delta’s winds peeled shingles off the roof of L’Banca Albergo Hotel, an eight-room boutique hotel in what used to be a bank.“I probably don’t have a shingle left on the top of this hotel,” owner Roberta Palermo said as the winds gusted outside.Palermo said the electricity was out and she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.“There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there’s ... really deep water in certain spots,” said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and the friend’s car was stranded in the water.Delta’s reach stretched as far west as Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the storm struck Louisiana. Two homes under construction were toppled by winds, as were some trees and signs in the area. Beach dunes flattened by earlier storms allowed storm surge to reach beneath some of Galveston’s raised beach houses.Delta also downed trees across Mississippi, including one that landed on top of a Jackson-based WLBT-TV vehicle with a news crew inside. No one was injured.Power outages in Louisiana and neighboring Texas neared 600,000 homes and businesses early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us. Almost 40,000 outages were reported in Mississippi.Tropical storm force winds extended 160 miles (260 kilometers) outward from the storm’s center, forecasters said Saturday. A 68 mph (110 kph) gust was reported at LSU’s Tiger Stadium overnight, and a 55 mph (68 kph) gust was reported Adams County airport in Natchez, Mississippi.Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.The storm was projected to move then into the Tennessee Valley later Saturday and into Sunday as a tropical depression.Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.Some who rode out Laura chose to hunker down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting the front door of her apartment Friday night and her patio gate banging open and shut.“The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,” Gove said in a message on Twitter.The roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and being tossed down the sidewalk.“The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward,” Gove added. “It’s pretty scary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-whipping-winds-delta-drenches-louisiana-mississippi/story-sedLm9Cw6JfUhesCeVQNHN.html
10-10-2020||World||Chinese app provides legal way to get over the Great Firewall||A developer backed by Chinese cybersecurity giant 360 Security Technology Inc. has introduced a browser that allows mainland Chinese users to access previously blocked sites like Google and Facebook, partially bypassing Beijing’s Great Firewall.The browser, named Tuber, requires mobile number registration before use. That makes users’ browsing activities traceable and can identify people because smartphone numbers are linked to unique Chinese identification numbers. Blocked websites that can be accessed via Tuber include YouTube, Instagram and The New York Times.The app appears to be providing a government-approved platform for the nation’s 904 million netizens to legally visit overseas websites. Mainland Chinese use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to bypass the Great Firewall -- the name given to the entity which has blocked an array of foreign Internet services, from Gmail to Twitter, for over a decade. China regularly cracks down on illegal VPN services, eliminating VPN apps from the stores of both Alphabet Inc.’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS.The app has attracted five million downloads on Huawei Technologies Co.’s app store as of Saturday morning. It has been available for download since at least late September, according to online posts. There are numerous WeChat posts about it, and a reporter from state media outlet Global Times promoted the app in a Twitter post. Tuber is currently only available for Android phones, according to its website.Tuber appears to be providing censored search results for YouTube. A search of President Xi Jinping’s name in Chinese yielded only seven video clips uploaded by three accounts claiming to be television stations in Shanghai, Tianjin and Macau. Searching for Xi’s name in English yielded no results at all.The parent company of Tuber’s developer is controlled by Chinese billionaire and tech mogul Zhou Hongyi, who delisted his security company Qihoo 360 from New York in mid-2016 and aligned himself with China’s national interest. The U.S. Department of Commerce in May sanctioned two of Zhou’s companies among 24 entities it said posed national-security concerns.A public relations employee at 360 Security declined to provide immediate comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet industry, didn’t respond to calls and emails from Bloomberg News on Saturday, which is a work day in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-app-provides-legal-way-to-get-over-the-great-firewall/story-w8PDpjfwwWgbft0KbbvS4O.html
10-10-2020||World||Time to accept that talks won’t make China change aggressive stance: US NSA||China has attempted to “seize” control of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India by force as part of its territorial aggression, US’ national security advisor has said, underlining that time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade Beijing to change.India and China are locked in a five-month-long tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their relations. Both sides have held a series of high-level diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.Also Read: ‘China deployed 60K soldiers on India’s northern border’: Pompeo hits out at Beijing’s ‘bad behaviour’“CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party) territorial aggression is also apparent on its Indian border where China has attempted to seize control of the Line of Actual Control by force,” US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in a remark on China early this week in Utah.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it. The Chinese territorial aggression is also true in the Taiwan Strait where the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) Navy and Air Force continue to conduct threatening military drills, O’Brien said.“Beijing’s signature international development programme, One Belt One Road (OBOR), involves impoverished companies taking on opaque and unsustainable Chinese loans to pay Chinese firms employing Chinese labourers to build their infrastructure,” he said.Many of these projects are unnecessary, shoddily built and are “white elephants”, the national security advisor said. “And now these countries’ dependence on the Chinese debt leaves their sovereignty eroded and with no choice but to hue to the party’s line on UN votes or any other issue that the Chinese Communist Party considers a red line,” he said. O’Brien also noted that China’s other international aid efforts include selling surveillance systems and similar tools of repression to “pariah regimes” around the world, including Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. “The time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade or compel the People’s Republic of China to change. There’s nothing to be gained from looking the other way or turning the other cheek. We’ve been doing that for too long,” he said.Also Read: ‘Tide’s begun to turn’: Pompeo says US, India partners in fight against ChinaO’Brien said the US must stand up to the Chinese and protect the American people.“We must promote American prosperity, practice peace through strength and advance American influence in the world,” he said, adding that under President Donald Trump’s leadership that is exactly what the US has done.O’Brien said the Trump administration has adopted a competitive approach to China. That approach, he said, has two primary objectives. First, improve the resiliency of US institutions, alliances and partnerships to prevail against the challenges that China presents; and the second is to impose tangible cost in order to compel Beijing to cease or reduce actions harmful to America’s vital national interest and those of its allied and partner nations.“President Trump has taken decisive action to meet these objectives. He is working to prevent companies that answer to the CCP’s intelligence and security apparatus,” O’Brien said.Citing examples, he said Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE have been prevented from accessing Americans’ personal and private data and national secrets. The Trump administration, he said, has also imposed import and export restrictions on US semiconductor technology and other exports going to Huawei and similar Chinese telecommunications corporations.“Our democratic partners are starting to follow. Just last month, the UK joined democracies such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Sweden in committing to using trusted suppliers to build their future 5G networks,” O’Brien said.“Carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and others have prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks. The Trump administration is investigating and prosecuting the economic espionage aggressively,” he said.O’Brien said the Trump administration has strengthened its military relationships in the Indo Pacific.“One important partnership which will be one of the most key partnerships for the United States in the 21st century, India, is thriving,” he said. He also noted that the US has signed extended US military access to Singapore’s air and naval bases. The country is also working closely with Japan, Australia and New Zealand to strengthen relationships with the Pacific Islands, especially Timor. It is also working closely with Mongolia.However, O’Brien said even as the US competes with China, it does welcome cooperation where America’s interests align. “The US has a deep and abiding respect for the Chinese people and enjoys longstanding ties to that country, including our alliance in World War II,” O’Brien said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-has-come-to-accept-that-talks-won-t-make-china-change-its-aggressive-stance-us-nsa/story-CpJpIuZ0HbpZgOfIaFI0yL.html
10-10-2020||World||Pak’s law ministry seeks discontinuation of two-finger test on rape victims||The Pakistan government has disapproved of the two-finger test (TFT) performed on rape victims and recommended that it should not be part of any medico-legal examination report in sexual assault cases. The Ministry of Law and Justice has intimated the Additional Attorney General at Lahore, Chaudhry Ishtiaq Ahmed Khan, about the recommendation. He will now inform the Lahore High Court about the federal government’s stance, the Dawn News reported. The court sought the law ministry’s response after going through a statement by the World Health Organisation, which has declared virginity testing as “unscientific, medically unnecessary and unreliable”. The court is seized with two public interest litigation petitions which have challenged the TFT, the report said. One petition was filed by a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) member of the National Assembly and the other by a group of women’s rights activists, academics, journalists and advocates. The petitioners contended that the TFT was “disrespectful, inhumane and violated women’s fundamental rights”. At a previous hearing last month, the Punjab Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department and the Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department had observed in their submissions to the court that the TFT had limited evidentiary value vis-à-vis determination of virginity and, therefore, should be struck off the protocol of medico-legal certificate (MLC). The Lahore High Court is expected to resume the hearing in the first week of next month, but in the meantime, the law ministry has come out with its response on the issue. It will be placed before the court during the next hearing. In a statement, the law ministry observed that the TFT was an “inconclusive test”. In addition, the manner in which the test was conducted violated Article 14 of the Constitution which lays down that human dignity and the privacy of home must be respected under all circumstances and that the right to privacy would take precedence over any other inconsistent provisions of the law, the daily said. The petitioners had sought a declaration that these practices constituted a violation of women’s fundamental rights, including the rights to life, privacy, dignity, bodily integrity, access to justice, protection from cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, and freedom from discrimination. The petitioners further contended that this test nurtures myths and inaccuracies about female anatomy by ignoring the prevalence of different forms of sexual violence against women and children. They regretted that the test was still rife in the country despite calls for its revocation by healthcare professionals and human rights organisations the world over. “The continued use of TFT and hymen tests does not lead to any evidence that should be considered relevant to a trial and is aimed solely at drawing conclusions about the character, morality, chastity, social standing, past sexual activity and credibility of women who have been victims of these crimes,” the petition said. The petition pointed out that the Human Rights Watch, UN Human Rights Organisation and the WHO have called for the elimination of the TFT. The petitioners called upon governments to take measures to ensure physical and mental health of all women undergoing medico-legal examination and to adopt scientific methods of investigating claims of rape and sexual assault.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-law-ministry-seeks-discontinuation-of-two-finger-test-on-rape-victims/story-0mbNuQkvrczYBzDLkAJECI.html
10-10-2020||World||Specter of election chaos raises questions on military role||It’s a question Americans are unaccustomed to considering in a presidential election campaign: Could voting, vote-counting or the post-vote reaction become so chaotic that the U.S. military would intervene?The answer is yes, but only in an extreme case. There is normally no need for the military to play any role in an election. The Constitution keeps the military in a narrow lane — defending the United States from external enemies. Civil order is left largely to civilian police. But there is an obscure law, the Insurrection Act, that theoretically could thrust the active-duty military into a police-like role. And governors have the ability to use the National Guard in state emergencies if needed.The potential use of troops, either active duty or National Guard, at the polls or in post-election unrest has been discussed by governors and military leaders. The possibilities arise as President Donald Trump asserts without evidence that mail-in balloting will create election fraud and suggests that he might not accept an election loss. Stationing troops at polling places on Election Day — even if just to protect citizens as they vote — raises worries about voter intimidation.Here are some questions and answers about possible military involvement in the election:WHY WOULDN’T THE MILITARY GET INVOLVED?Civilian control of the military is a bedrock principle of American democracy. It means that men and women in uniform answer to civilian leaders like the secretary of defense, and they stay apart from politics. They pledge their loyalty to the Constitution and the nation’s laws, not to a political party or a president.Gen. Mark Milley, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the nation’s top military officer, has told Congress the military is committed to staying apolitical and steering clear of any election role.“In the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law U.S. courts and the U.S. Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the U.S. military,” he said in written answers to questions from two Democratic members of the House Armed Service Committee. “I foresee no role for the U.S. armed forces in this process.”Milley said service members must not get involved in the transfer of power after an election. In other words, don’t expect to see troops intervening if there is a dispute over who won.WHAT COULD THE NATIONAL GUARD DO?The military is made up of active duty, National Guard and Reserves. In all but extreme cases, active-duty troops are used for war to protect the nation, not against American citizens on domestic soil. National Guard units are in every state and are controlled by the governor, not the federal government.Governors routinely mobilize their Guard members for emergencies, such as natural disasters, and they can use them to help enforce the law during events such as riots. But usually law enforcement takes the lead, and Guard forces support it. During civil unrest this year, governors used Guard troops to tamp down violence and provide security. They could do so again.To bolster that effort, the National Guard Bureau has designated military police units in two states to serve as rapid reaction forces to respond quickly if a governor seeks help from other states to control civil unrest.In a national emergency, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a president can deploy the Guard in a federal status to support the active-duty military. The president has the authority to federalize the Guard for use in a domestic emergency, but there are questions about whether a state’s governor can try to block such a move.WHAT ABOUT THE INSURRECTION ACT?The president has the authority under the Insurrection Act of 1807 to dispatch active-duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law. Under the law, the president can activate troops without a governor’s approval as long as specific conditions are met, such as if the violence is interfering with the execution of laws there.Would potential post-election violence amount to an insurrection? That might be open to debate. It’s not clear if states could legally block any presidential use of the Insurrection Act.In the last half-century, presidents have sent the military to Southern states to enforce school desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s, at times without gubernatorial consent. And troops were sent to Los Angeles when the California governor sought federal help during the 1992 riots. But it has not happened in connection with a presidential election in modern times.In June, Trump considered invoking the Insurrection Act to use active-duty forces to quell unrest following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed using military troops for law enforcement. He argued publicly that the Insurrection Act should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” and added, “We are not in one of those situations now.”Still, it would be unprecedented for military leaders to refuse to follow a presidential order invoking the act.WHAT ABOUT SECURITY AT THE POLLS?Democrats fear that Trump supporters will try to intimidate Democratic voters at polling places to scare them from voting. Trump added to those worries in the Sept. 29 debate, urging his supporters “to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that’s what has to happen.”Several state leaders, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have raised the possibility of using Guard troops for security at the polls. Others used the Guard during primary elections. At times they wore civilian clothes and filled in for poll workers who were absent because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also helped by cleaning polling places or directing traffic. But they must stay out of the polling process.A uniformed military presence at the polls, however, raises worries.Michele Flournoy, a Democrat who is considered a leading candidate to become the first female defense secretary if Joe Biden wins, said the Guard should be used only if police are overwhelmed. But she warned that using Guard troops at the polls could “be very intimidating to voters. ... I hope we don’t get there as a nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/specter-of-election-chaos-raises-questions-on-military-role/story-4eciD0NoPNssycimLb7bXM.html
10-10-2020||World||Whitmer kidnapping bid: 6 men belonging to militia group Wolverine Watchmen face domestic terrorism charges||Six men arrested on suspicion of taking part in a plot by armed extremists to kidnap Michigan’s governor have been arraigned on domestic terrorism and weapons charges, while a seventh awaits extradition from South Carolina, authorities said on Friday.All seven, described by prosecutors as members or associates of an anti-government militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen, were taken into custody late on Wednesday as part of a joint state-federal investigation.They are accused of conspiring to abduct Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has clashed sharply with Republican US President Donald Trump over her COVID-19 public health orders.Prosecutors say the men also sought to single out law enforcement officers for intimidation, made threats of violence to incite civil unrest, and trained for an operation to storm the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing and take government officials hostage.“Clearly this was not just talk,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a CBS News interview on Friday. “These were many overt actions. And so we thought it was time to move in before anybody lost their lives.”Nessel said the governor was informed of the investigation and briefed on developments over the past couple of months.“At times, she and her family had been moved around as a result of activities that law enforcement was aware of,” Nessel added.$10 million bondEach of the seven men named in criminal complaints filed by Nessel’s office is charged with providing material support for terrorist acts and possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony - both punishable by up to 20 years in prison.Two of them - Pete Musico, 46, and Joseph Morrison, 26 - were additionally charged with belonging to a criminal gang and with committing a threat of terrorism. At their arraignment on Thursday, Musico and Morrison were each ordered to remain jailed on a $10 million cash bond, the attorney general’s office said in a statement.Bond for each of the four others was set at $250,000. Michigan prosecutors are working to extradite the seventh defendant from South Carolina, where he was arrested, the statement said. He, too, is charged with gang membership.Various additional pretrial court proceedings were set for later this month, but no mention was made of any pleas being entered.In addition to the seven suspects held on state charges, six men were arrested on federal charges of conspiring to kidnap the governor, for which they could face life in prison if convicted.Michigan, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race, became a focus of agitation earlier this year by Trump and his supporters, including various militia groups, who opposed strict stay-at-home orders imposed by Whitmer to curb the spread of the coronavirus.At least three of the defendants charged by the state were among hundreds of protesters, many carrying weapons, who entered the Michigan capitol on April 30 as state lawmakers debated Whitmer’s request to extend her emergency public health authority. Photos show all three men were armed.Both Whitmer and Nessel accused Trump of inflammatory rhetoric that they said has fostered a climate of racism and political extremism. Trump lashed back by calling Whitmer the “lockdown queen” while denying he was encouraging violence or racism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whitmer-kidnapping-bid-6-men-belonging-to-militia-group-wolverine-watchmen-arraigned-on-domestic-terrorism-charges/story-KL0FJJAOIMReyekXxXcbCI.html

It is also home to a large Canadian-owned mining operation.Military checkpoints were put up overnight around capital Bishkek and armoured personnel carriers were spotted in the city after President Sooronbai Jeenbekov ordered troops to deploy and re-establish order amid flare-ups of violence.The parliament planned to gather in the presidential residence on the outskirts of Bishkek, after its own offices were ransacked by protesters who seized key government buildings on Tuesday.Russia, which exerts significant influence on Kyrgyzstan, this week described the situation as “chaos”. More than 1,200 people have been injured and one person has been killed in street clashes since protests erupted on Monday.It was unclear which candidates the legislature would consider for premiership, although deputy speaker Aida Kasymaliyeva urged MPs to reconsider the nomination of opposition politician Sadyr Zhaparov, saying that voting him in would only divide the country further.Zhaparov’s supporters clashed with followers of a few other parties on Friday which nominated their own candidate, Omurbek Babanov. Several people were wounded including a politician nominated to serve as Babanov’s deputy.The opposition is divided between 11 parties which represent clan interests in a country that has already seen two presidents toppled by popular revolts since 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kyrgyz-parliament-set-to-meet-discuss-new-government-amid-unrest/story-osJxUhxaN9kUg2OWLriMpI.html

The foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group - the US, Japan, India and Australia - met in Tokyo on Tuesday in what was their first in-person talks since the coronavirus pandemic began. The meeting took place in the backdrop of China’s aggressive military behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, South China Sea and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Also Read: ‘Tide’s begun to turn’: Pompeo says US, India partners in fight against China “The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo told The Guy Benson Show in an interview on Friday after his return from Tokyo wherein he attended the second Quad ministerial with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia. “I was with my foreign minister counterparts from India, Australia, and Japan – a format that we call the Quad, four big democracies, four powerful economies, four nations, each of whom has real risk associated with the threats imposed – attempting to be imposed by the Chinese Communist Party. And they see it in their home countries too,” he said. Pompeo met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Tokyo on Tuesday and they underscored the need to work together to advance, peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. He described his meeting with Jaishankar as “productive.” “They see, the people of their (Quad) nations understanding that we all slept on this for too long. For decades, the West allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us.  The previous administration bent a knee, too often allowed China to steal our intellectual properties and the millions of jobs that came along with it. They see that in their country too,” he said in the interview.Also Read: PLA at its doors, India looks at new security rule to punch Chinese firms In another interview with Larry O’Connor, Pompeo said in his meetings with his counterparts from Japan, India and Australia, they began to develop a set of understandings and policies that can jointly take these countries to work to present a true resistance to the threats that the Chinese Communist Party poses to each of these nations. “They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight,” he said. “But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India, the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north,” he said. India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May that has significantly strained the bilateral ties. Both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake in the last week of August. “Whether it’s the Australians who did the simple thing of saying the Chinese screwed this deal up with the virus, and we’d like to understand what happened and said we ought to have a full investigation, and in exchange for that, the Chinese Communist Party began to extort, coerce, bully the Australians,” Pompeo said. Every one of these countries has seen this, he said, adding that people in each of these countries now understand the Chinese Communist Party presents a threat to them. “The world has awakened. The tide’s begun to turn. And the United States under President Trump’s leadership has now built out a coalition that will push back against the threat and maintain good order, the rule of law, and the basic civic decency that comes from democracies controlling the world and not authoritarian regimes,” Pompeo said. In his third-interview to Fox News, Pompeo said that the US under Trump administration has begun to build out all the edifice of the structure and the allies and the coalition to push back against China. “We aim to protect the American people from the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses,” he said. Referring to his Quad ministerial meeting, Pompeo said that the three other countries Japan, India, and Australia were building out a coalition, build partners and allies around the world who understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party in the same way that “we do so that they can protect jobs here at home”. “Look, they’ve stacked 60,000 soldiers against the Indians in the north. When the Australians had the temerity to ask for an investigation of the Wuhan virus and where it began, something that we know a lot about, the Chinese Communist Party threatened them. They bullied them,” Pompeo told Fox News. “We need partners and friends. They’ll certainly try to react. But what the Chinese Communist Party had become accustomed to, frankly, for an awfully long time was watching America bend a knee, watching us turn the other cheek and appease them,” he said. “That only encouraged their bad behaviour, their malign activity. Our push back – they understand we’re serious about it. They’ve watched that we’re going to confront them and impose costs upon them. I am confident that this activity, over time, will change the nature of what the Chinese Communist Party tries to do to harm America,” Pompeo said. India is expanding bilateral cooperation with Japan, the US and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deployed-60k-soldiers-on-india-s-border-says-pompeo-hitting-out-at-beijing-s-bad-behaviour/story-2Hv5DsBusvmLcdxNsnhosI.html

Pierluigi Maccalli and Nicola Chiacchio, and prominent Malian politician Soumaila Cisse this week, days after the Malian government freed nearly 200 Islamic militants in an apparent prisoner exchange.Stoeckli, a Christian missionary, and at least four further foreign hostages were also held by JNIM and its associates. The fate of the others wasn’t immediately known.The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it was trying to find out more about the circumstances of the killing and the whereabouts of her remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-says-swiss-hostage-in-mali-has-been-killed/story-0wUz2JGb71tr4HudqDwaSM.html

The Republic of China, which was in large font in the current passport, has been replaced with an emblem in the new one.According to Focus Taiwan, the country’s foreign minister Joseph Wu said that the change in design has been intended to reflect the difference between China and Taiwan. The Chinese passport has ‘The People’s Republic of China’ engraved in it. Wu said, people often mistake Taiwanese citizens for Chinese citizens due to the passport.The opposition party Kuomintang has accused the Tsai Ing-wen led government of trying to remove the official name of Taiwan - the Republic of China - from its records. Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) believe the efforts have been made to rule out misidentification.These changes come amid rising military tensions with China. Speaking on the occasion of Taiwan National Day, president Tsai Ing-wen said her country wants meaningful dialogue with China.“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” Tsai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-national-day-new-passport-design-asserts-independent-identity/story-0GhwWmWaWMtfzanoAF27lN.html

Xi said he was “greatly pleased” with the achievements that North Korea had made in recent years by engaging with foreign countries in the face of hardships and challenges, KCNA reported.After years of cool relations during which China joined the United States and other nations in imposing sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, Xi and Kim met five times in 2018 and 2019. The North Korean diplomatic offensive included Kim meeting with US President Donald Trump.While North Korea says it has had no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, strict border closures and other measures it imposed to prevent an outbreak have further strained its economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intend-to-successfully-develop-china-korea-relations-xi-jinping-to-kim-jong-un/story-mpeEyiigr2qHVl6FB6LFPO.html

The detainees’ plight has grabbed international attention, with human rights groups raising concern as their families said they were denied access to independent lawyers, and aired suspicion that Hong Kong authorities helped in China’s arrests. Accused of crimes tied to anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, the group is being detained in China’s southern city of Shenzhen after authorities intercepted their boat and accused them of illegal border crossing. Police arrested four men and five women suspected of arranging transport for the fugitives, said Hong Kong police official Ho Chun-tung.“One direction of the investigation is whether they helped others to flee,” said Ho, a superintendent with the force’s organised crime and triad bureau, adding that he did not rule out the possibility of more arrests.He dismissed the relatives’ accusations that police in the Asian financial hub played a role in the arrests in China. “The arrests on the mainland had nothing to do with the Hong Kong police,” Ho added. Police also seized HK$500,000 ($64,500) in cash, computers, mobile phones, and documents related to the purchase of a boat. People began fleeing Hong Kong for self-ruled Taiwan from the early months of the protests, most of them legally, by air, but some by fishing boat, activists in Taipei who helped Hong Kong citizens get visas have told Reuters. Hong Kong authorities have said those detained are to be represented by mainland lawyers of their choice, albeit from a list provided by Chinese authorities.Their families have been offered “needed and feasible” assistance, which will continue, the authorities have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nine-arrested-on-suspicion-of-helping-12-flee-hong-kong-for-taiwan/story-OrzFFbF96ZnDH3tFCYkLsI.html

10-10-2020||World||North Korea flaunts advanced weapons during military parade||Nuclear-armed North Korea appears to have held a giant military parade early Saturday, Seoul said, with Pyongyang’s latest and most advanced weapons expected to have been on show in the coronavirus-barricaded country’s capital.The widely anticipated display is part of commemorations of the 75th anniversary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party.Such events typically feature thousands of troops goose-stepping through Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square, named for North Korea’s founder, under the gaze of his grandson Kim Jong Un, the third member of the family to rule the country.A cavalcade of progressively larger armoured vehicles and tanks usually follows, culminating with whatever missiles Pyongyang wants to highlight.They are keenly watched by observers for clues to its weapons development.“Signs of a military parade -- involving equipment and people on a large scale -- were detected at Kim Il Sung Square early this morning,” Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.South Korean and US intelligence agencies were “closely tracking the event”, they added.The parade is part of commemorations marking 75 years since the founding of Kim’s ruling party, an anniversary that comes during a difficult year for North Korea as the coronavirus pandemic and recent storms add pressure to the heavily sanctioned country. Pyongyang closed its borders eight months ago to try to protect itself from the virus, which first emerged in neighbouring China, and has yet to confirm a single case.Last month, troops from the North shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who had drifted into its waters, apparently as a precaution against the disease, prompting fury in Seoul and a rare apology from Kim.‘Big step forward’The North is widely believed to have continued to develop its arsenal -- which it says it needs to protect itself from a US invasion -- throughout nuclear negotiations with Washington, deadlocked since the collapse of a summit in Hanoi early last year.Analysts expected a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) or an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland to appear -- maybe even one with multiple re-entry vehicle capabilities that could allow it to evade US defence systems.The anniversary of the Workers’ Party means North Korea “has a political and strategic need to do something bigger”, said Sung-yoon Lee, a Korean studies professor at Tufts University in the United States.Showcasing its most advanced weapons “will signal a big step forward in Pyongyang’s credible threat capabilities”, he said.But unlike on many previous occasions, no international media were allowed in to watch the parade, and with many foreign embassies in Pyongyang closing their doors in the face of coronavirus restrictions, few outside observers were left in the city.Foreigners were not welcome at the anniversary commemorations, according to the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, which posted a message from the authorities on its Facebook page urging diplomats and other international representatives not to “approach or take photos” of the venues.State broadcaster KCTV did not show any early-morning parade live, and had not carried footage of it by mid-afternoon.But specialist service NK News cited multiple sources saying they had heard sounds of aircraft flying by, drones and heavy machinery during the early hours of Saturday morning.The North has usually held its parades in the morning and generally streams them in real time or near-live, although the last two, both in 2018, were shown either later that day or the next morning.Former US government North Korea analyst Rachel Lee cautioned against interpreting the decision not broadcast it live “without knowing what was said and shown during the parade”.Masks and missiles?At the end of December, Kim threatened to demonstrate a “new strategic weapon”, but analysts say Pyongyang will still tread carefully to avoid jeopardising its chances with Washington ahead of next month’s presidential election.Showing off its strategic weapons in a military parade “would be consistent with what Kim Jong Un promised”, said analyst Lee, while “not provoking the United States as much as a test-launch of a strategic weapon”.But Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest warned that if thousands of people were involved, it could turn into a “deadly superspreader-like event” unless “extreme precautions” were used.The impoverished nation’s crumbling health system would struggle to cope with a major virus outbreak, and he added that such protective measures seemed “pretty unlikely”.“Clearly, masks and missiles don’t mix.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-north-korea-military-parade-reports-say-pyonyang-held-giant-military-parade-flaunted-advanced-weapons/story-qfAqHSp082T12pjAwmZ5bM.html

But when it does, workers can chose to work from home permanently with their manager’s approval, although they will have to give up their office space.“The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged all of us to think, live and work in new ways,” human resources head Kathleen Hogan said in a note to employees obtained by The Verge.“We will offer as much flexibility as possible to support individual work styles, while balancing business needs and ensuring we live our culture.”In a public blog post later in the day, Hogan said the company views employees spending less than 50 percent of their time working from home as “standard,” but wasn’t abandoning office work entirely.“We are not committing to having every employee work from anywhere, as we believe there is value in employees being together in the workplace,” Hogan wrote.The Verge reported some employees won’t be eligible for remote-work arrangements, such as those who work in Microsoft’s labs or train other employees. In its memo, the company co-founded by Bill Gates said it is possible for its workers to relocate across the United States or perhaps overseas, The Verge said.Those that relocate may see their salaries change depending on where they go, and while the company will cover expenses for employees’ home offices, it won’t cover relocation expenses.As of the end of June, Microsoft employed 163,000 people, 96,000 of them in the US, according to a securities filing.Some major tech firms have already allowed permanent work-from-home arrangements including Facebook, whose boss Mark Zuckerberg said half of the social network’s staff could be permanently working remotely within five to 10 years.cs/ft||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-to-let-employees-work-from-home-permanently-report/story-qmQO4oRvj8Fz6JY1Xvd4cL.html

The purpose of the exercise was “to boost their tactical capability”, the ministry said in a statement, without giving more details on the geographical location of the drills. The three vessels will stop at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam over the weekend to replenish supplies, the statement said.The ministry could not be immediately reached for further comment.Nearly all of the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea are claimed by China, which has established military outposts on artificial islands in the area. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the sea.The United States has accused China of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit the area’s extensive oil and gas reserves.China’s state-backed Global Times newspaper, noting the latest Japanese drills, said on Saturday that the frequent conducting of military activities in the South China Sea is not conducive to the security and stability of the area, and is firmly opposed by China.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has always kept a high level of alert, defending China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests, said the newspaper, which is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party.The Global Times said Japanese warships had recently carried out activities in the South China Sea, with a helicopter aircraft carrier spotted on satellite on Sept. 5.On Friday, a Chinese military spokesperson said the U.S. destroyer John McCain had entered waters around the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea without China’s permission, and urged the United States to stop “such provocative actions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-begins-anti-submarine-exercise-in-south-china-sea-with-three-vessels/story-SnmuOecg8ddJb3edfro5LI.html
10-10-2020||World||Hit by Covid-19, thousands of mink dead in the United States||The United States is worst-hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak with over seven million cases. And now, there are reports that the disease has killed thousands of mink.According to CNN, ranchers in Utah and Wisconsin have lost almost 10,000 mink, the naimals known for their silky fur.A recent study done by researches at University of California (UCLA), numerous animals may be vulnerable to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.The study, published in Scientific Reports, reports evidence that 26 animals regularly in contact with people may be susceptible to infection. The researchers investigated how the spike protein from Sars-CoV-2 could interact with the ACE2 protein it attaches to when it infects people.Binding to the protein enables the virus to gain entry into host cells; while it is possible the virus might be able to infect animals via another pathway, it is unlikely based on current evidence that the virus could infect an animal if it cannot form a stable binding complex with ACE2.“The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to re-infect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms,” said lead author of the study, Professor Christine Orengo.CNN reported that reports of virus spreading in mink first appeared in August, after some farm workers fell ill. It quoted health experts in Utah as saying that the transmission happened from humans to animals.Similar cases have been reported from farms in other countries too. Denmark is culling around 1 million mink after finding further coronavirus infections among the animals at farms that breed them for their fur, authorities said.The Nordic country is the world’s largest producer of mink and had previously culled animals on farms hit by infections, but outbreaks have persisted.In May, Spain ordered the culling of all 93,000 mink at a farm to prevent human contagion after finding that most of the mink there were infected with the coronavirus.The Netherlands reported a similar outbreak and undertook a cull after two people were reported to have been infected by mink, though such cases of animal-to-human transmission are believed to be extremely rare.The UCLA study found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hit-by-covid-19-thousands-of-mink-dead-in-the-united-states/story-kh7yNb3XFaeSLuDKx2YxhP.html
10-10-2020||World||More restrictions, warnings to be imposed on misleading tweets: Twitter||Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the US election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.Twitter said in a blog post that, from next week, users will get a prompt pointing them to credible information before they can retweet content that has been labeled as misleading. It said it would add more warnings and restrictions on tweets with misleading information labels from US political figures like candidates and campaigns, as well as US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers or that get “significant engagement.”Twitter, which recently told Reuters it was testing how to make its labeling more obvious and direct, said people will have to tap through warnings to see these tweets. Users can also only ‘quote tweet’ this content, as likes, retweets and replies will be turned off.Twitter says it has labeled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by US President Donald Trump. Twitter also said it would label tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate.The company announced several temporary steps to slow amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the US election week, global users pressing “retweet” will be directed first to the “quote tweet” button to encourage people to add their own commentary. It will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing “liked by” recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.Twitter’s decision to hit the brakes on automated recommendations contrasts with the approach at Facebook Inc , which is amping up promotion of its groups product despite concerns about extremism in those spaces.Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the Nov. 3 vote.Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud. On Wednesday, Facebook said it would ban calls for poll watching using “militarized language.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-restrictions-warnings-to-be-imposed-on-misleading-tweets-twitter/story-eBgQpRoK7z8OJQvH9s26BL.html
10-10-2020||World||US, AstraZeneca strike deal for Covid-19 antibody treatment touted by Trump||The US government has awarded $486 million to AstraZeneca Plc to develop and secure supplies of up to 100,000 doses of Covid-19 antibody treatment, a similar class of drug that was used in treating President Donald Trump.The agreement, under the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, is for developing a monoclonal antibody cocktail that can prevent Covid-19, especially in high-risk population like those over 80 years old, the US Department of Health and Human Services said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe treatment has come under the spotlight after Trump was treated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ antibody drug last week. The president has also released a video on Twitter touting its benefits.In a call earlier on Friday, a top US health official said the government was expecting to provide more than 1 million free doses of antibody treatments to Covid-19 patients, similar to the one that was administered to Trump.Regeneron and Eli Lilly have both applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorizations of their antibody treatments. AstraZeneca said it was planning to supply up to 100,000 doses starting toward the end of 2020 and that the US government could acquire up to an additional one million doses in 2021 under a separate agreement.Regeneron signed a $450 million deal in July to sell Operation Warp Speed enough doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2, to treat around 300,000 people.Eli Lilly said on Friday it had not signed an agreement with Operation Warp Speed. AstraZeneca plans to evaluate the treatment, AZD7442, which is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, in two studies. One trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the experimental treatment to prevent infection for up to 12 months in about 5,000 participants, while the second will evaluate post-exposure preventative and pre-emptive treatment in roughly 1,100 participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-astrazeneca-strike-deal-for-covid-19-antibody-treatment-touted-by-trump/story-sfsEzmLy3TPlBcicL3JycO.html
10-10-2020||World||‘Willing to work together as long as Beijing is ready to resolve antagonisms’: Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen||Taiwan wants to have “meaningful dialogue” with China on an equal basis, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Saturday, extending an olive branch at a time of heightened military tension with Beijing, which claims the island as sovereign Chinese territory.Democratic Taiwan has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up air force activity near the island in the past few weeks, including crossing the Taiwan Strait’s sensitive mid line that normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone.China says it is responding to “collusion” between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the self-governed island. Beijing views this a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China. Speaking at National Day celebrations, Tsai described the situation in the Taiwan Strait as “quite tense.” This, along with disputes in the South China Sea, a China-India border conflict and China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, showed democracy and peace in the region were facing big challenges, she said.If Beijing can heed Taiwan’s voice and jointly facilitate reconciliation and peaceful dialogue, regional tension can surely be resolved, she added.“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” Tsai said.There was no immediate reaction from China, which cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after she first won office.Tsai said she was committed to maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait, but that this was the responsibility of both sides.Still, she has made strengthening Taiwan’s armed forces a priority, and said she would keep pushing this, upholding the principle of neither seeking war nor fearing it.“Our commitment to our sovereignty and democratic values will not change, but we will also maintain strategic flexibility and be responsive to changes,” she said, without elaborating.The United States has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so they can become a “porcupine”, hard for China to attack. Washington, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/willing-to-work-together-as-long-as-beijing-is-ready-to-resolve-antagonisms-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen/story-y9ZQD8RUUBjNWMz60EGGbJ.html

It was a worldwide record reported by the world’s top health body. The confirmed daily high of 350,766 cases surpasses by nearly 12,000 a record set earlier this week. The total number Covid-19 infection has now reached to 36,785,758, as per the figures published by the John Hopkins University. While more than a million others have succumbed to the disease.In a recently held conference by the WHO’s emergencies chief, Dr Michael Ryan said that according to the world body’s “best estimates”, one in 10 people worldwide may have been infected from Covid-19.While the United States still remains the worst-hit country, Europe added more than 109,000 cases alone to the daily high of Friday.Here is the list of top five countries worst-affected by the Covid-19:US-7,660,123More than 7.6 million people in the United States have been infected with the deadly Covid-19, including the country’s President Donald Trump. Among the worst affected regions of the US is the Midwestern side where weather is the coldest. As the country is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 several states have been registering a record number of daily cases, prompting authorities to impose various restrictions to curb the spread.India- 6,906,151 India is the second country to be badly hit by the spread of the coronavirus disease. It is recording more than 70,00 new cases daily for the past few days. Before this, the number of daily cases used to hover around 90,000. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat are some of the states which are reporting the major chunk of the total tally.Brazil- 5,055,888 While the number of daily infections and fatalities have gone down, Brazil is still among the top five worst affected nations. The country surpassed the 5 million mark on Wednesday night and is verging on 150,000 deaths, according to the tally from Johns Hopkins University.At its height, Brazil was registering more than 45,000 cases and 1,000 deaths per day. Now, the numbers have dropped to about 27,000 cases and 700 deaths daily.Russia- 1,265,572 Among the list of countries witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 infection, Russia posted a record number of new Covid-19 cases on Friday. There were 12,126 new cases in the past day, breaking the previous record of 11,656 on May 11, according to data from the government’s National Virus Response Center.The resurgence in infections has come after schools reopened September 1.Colombia-894,300 Fifth country to be on the list of nations with the highest number of cases, Colombia has more than 8.9 million cases while over 27,400 others have succumbed to the disease.The country removed curbing measures and resumed economic activities with safety protocols earlier in September. However, restrictions on events and large crowds still continue.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-five-countries-with-highest-number-of-covid-19-infections/story-ULo2YkhXUolXbwxlEY9s9L.html

The tide’s begun to turn. And the United States under President Trump’s leadership has now built out a coalition that will push back against the threat,” he said.Following the Tokyo meeting, Pompeo will travel shortly to New Delhi with Defense Secretary Mark Esper for annual talks with their Indian counterparts.Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun will also travel to India next week to prepare the meeting, the State Department said.Tensions have soared between India and China since violent hand-to-hand fighting in the Himalayan region of Ladakh in June that left 20 Indian troops dead.China has acknowledged suffering casualties but has not revealed any figures.Citing national security grounds, New Delhi has since banned dozens of Chinese apps including TikTok, the blockbuster video-sharing platform which had counted on India as its largest overseas market.Despite wide concerns about China, India has historically shied away from formal alliances with outside powers under its doctrine of “strategic autonomy.”Asked at the conservative Heritage Foundation about tensions with China, India’s ambassador to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, stressed that the Asian powers had historic linkages and welcomed each other’s scholars.US-India ties have been rapidly growing and “this relationship has a much wider perspective than simply China,” Sandhu said.But he said he expected India and the United States to discuss boosting defense ties during the visit by Pompeo and Esper.“I would underline that there is a great further potential for our defense cooperation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tide-s-begun-to-turn-pompeo-says-us-india-partners-in-fight-against-china/story-qjKoSrOYSk283MqrC2RzcJ.html

The ceasefire begins at 12 p.m. Lavrov, who mediated the negotiations in Moscow, announced the ceasefire at 3 a.m.(midnight GMT) after 10 hours of talks with his Armenian and Azeri counterparts. He also said Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to start talks on the settlement of the conflict.Russia’s top diplomat added that International Red Cross Committee would act as an intermediary in the humanitarian operation.He did not provide details on the talks but said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Minsk Group would mediate.Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azeri counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov did not speak to reporters.The mountain enclave belongs to Azerbaijan under international law but broke away in a war as the Soviet Union collapsed and is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.The renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.The clashes have also increased concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.Azerbaijan said on Friday that 31 Azeri civilians had been killed and 168 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed information about military casualties. Nagorno-Karabakh said 376 of its military personnel and 22 civilians had been killed since the beginning of the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-and-azerbaijan-agree-to-ceasefire-says-russia-s-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov/story-uQoYahAgiPf6FXCc2D1MKO.html
10-10-2020||World||Pakistan has no extradition treaty with US, says Supreme Court||Pakistan has no actual extradition treaty with the US, the country’s Supreme Court said on Friday while hearing a case of an American national of Pakistani origin accused of planning a bomb attack in New York in 2016. A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Mushir Alam, challenged the extradition of Talha Haroon to the US till a final decision in the case. The Additional Attorney General told the court that there was an extradition treaty between Pakistan and the US, asserting that America had extradited two suspects, Farid Tawakal and Farooq Tawakal, to Pakistan in 2008, The Express Tribune reported. An official from the foreign affairs ministry said Pakistan had adopted a bilateral agreement signed between the US and the UK in 1932. Justice Qazi Amin inquired if Pakistan had unilaterally adopted the agreement. “It is not correct to say that all states are equal,” he added. The judge noted that the court had to see if there was any legal justification for the extradition of the accused to the US. “There is virtually no extradition treaty with the US,” he said. In response, the Additional Attorney General said that there was an agreement through which the accused were exchanged. He said that Haroon was accused of plotting an attack while living in the US. “Talha Haroon is also a US citizen,” he said, adding that the suspect was arrested in 2016. Justice Munib noted that the agreement that was being pointed out was a pre-partition one. Justice Amin asked how could a pre-partition agreement be a binding on Pakistan, and told the Additional Attorney General if the agreement he was showing included the crime of terrorism. The counsel for the accused said that Pakistan enacted a law in 1972 to extradite the accused. Justice Munib said that according to the documents it was unclear that the accused was in America at the time of the attack. He said Haroon was accused of funding, not terrorism. He asked the Foreign Office officials to be fully prepared at the next hearing. The counsel for the Haroon said his client had been in jail for four and a half years and should be granted bail. The apex court rejected the plea bail of the accused. It also extended the stay order on Haroon’s extradition to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-no-extradition-treaty-with-us-says-supreme-court/story-gYxtKtW4tr7SzyS8P6uNXK.html
10-10-2020||World||Hambantota port: Sri Lankan prez rejects concerns of getting caught in Chinese ‘debt trap’||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday rejected concerns that China has lured Sri Lanka into a “debt trap” by financing the strategic southern port of and said the project has a vast potential for generating income and employment opportunities.Rajapaksa said this after holding talks with a high-powered Chinese delegation led by ruling Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi.Yang, China’s former foreign minister, is the first top ranking Chinese official to travel to the South Asian region since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.The visit comes amid the island nation struggling to boost its foreign reserves after its economy was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.During the high-level talks, the two sides agreed to resume talks on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and expedite work on the proposed Hambantota industrial zone.Yang also assured that China will firmly stand with Sri Lanka to protect its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity at international fora, including the UN Human Rights Council and continue to assist the country in its development activities.Rajapaksa expressed satisfaction over the current state of Sino-Sri Lanka relations and said China has been a long-standing friend who supported Sri Lanka irrespective of the government in power.“China extensively supported us to defeat terrorism. Bilateral relations reached a higher level following the end of the armed conflict,” he said, referring to the nearly 30-year bloody conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which was fighting for a separate homeland in Northeastern Sri Lanka.“China contributed to a number of large-scale infrastructure development projects. Hambantota Port, the Port City project, Southern Expressway are some of them,” he said.Rajapaksa said that constructing a port in Hambantota was an idea of Sri Lanka and not China’s.“We were convinced that it would be a project with a vast potential for generating income and employment opportunities. China offered to fund it. Many geo-political analysis interprets this project as a ‘debt trap’ set up by China to gain control over Sri Lankan affairs. I want to prove that it is not the case and that this large-scale project will help improve the living standards of the people,” the president said.China is one of the biggest investors in various infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. But there has been criticism, both locally and internationally, and growing concerns that China has lured Sri Lanka into a debt trap.The previous Maithripala Sirisena government handed over Hambantota port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years’ lease as a debt swap amounting to USD 1.2 billion.The Chinese delegation’s visit assumes significance as Sri Lanka is expecting to receive the second tranche of a USD 1.2 billion syndicated Chinese loan. The island nation received the first trance of USD 500 million in March.The Sri Lankan government had said that the anticipated Panda (Chinese) bonds and the syndicated Chinese loan will strengthen the country’s balance of payments in the backdrop of the country’s credit rating downgrade by Moody’s last week.Credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded Lanka’s sovereign credit rating by two notches, saying the South Asian nation would be hard-pressed to secure funding to service its huge foreign debt.Sri Lanka was pushed down from “B2” (high credit risk) to “Caa1” (very high credit risk), as the coronavirus pandemic compounded the economic woes of the country.Sri Lanka’s economy, especially the tourism sector, has been hit hard since last year - initially by the Easter Sunday attacks, which killed over 250 people and later by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hambantota-port-sri-lankan-prez-rejects-concerns-of-getting-caught-in-chinese-debt-trap/story-ODvP2H3zj5HpGH2j9RLS9M.html
10-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un set to show off nuclear advances in message to Trump||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is expected to hold his biggest military parade in at least two years and show off a nuclear arsenal that poses one of the most daunting security challenges for the winner of the U.S. presidential election.The event -- part of festivities Saturday to mark the 75th anniversary the Workers’ Party of Korea -- could showcase the “new strategic weapon” Kim pledged to unveil at the start of the year. Any missiles designed to hit American targets would underscore how North Korea remains a nuclear threat to the U.S. as President Donald Trump prepares to defend his record against Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election.South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook told parliament Wednesday in Seoul that Pyongyang was preparing for a “military show of force involving its strategic weapons.” While satellite imagery has showed North Korea mustering troops and equipment for months for a big parade, when the event will happen and how much of the secretive state will choose to share with the outside world remains unclear.Here are five things to watch:1. Newer, Better ICBMOne of the most alarming items North Korea might roll out is an intercontinental ballistic missile that features solid-fuel technology. Such a weapon would be quicker to launch than Kim’s current liquid-fuel models -- giving the U.S. less time to destroy it on the pad or prepare to intercept it in the air.Although North Korea hasn’t fired off an ICBM since November 2017, it last year conducted a long-burn test of a new engine and debuted an assortment of shorter-range, solid-fueled rockets. The tips of the missile may also show whether Kim has developed the capability to put multiple warheads on a single rocket. Such achievements would deal the biggest blow yet to Trump’s assertion that his unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 had made sure North Korea was “no longer a nuclear threat.”Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said North Korea has often unveiled strategic weapons systems on big ruling party milestones. “The 75th anniversary this weekend may be an opportune time for North Korea to reveal a new ICBM,” he said.2. Missile TrucksOne of the least flashy but most crucial parts of North Korea’s nuclear program are transporter erector launchers, or TELs. These are mobile launchpads that can be hidden in places like caves and under bridges and deployed quickly in an attack.With enough TELs, North Korea can demonstrate its ability to launch a first strike and still have enough in reserve for a second volley. Kim has tried to build more TELs at home and break his long reliance on truck imports from places like China. The more axles North Korea can put on a TEL, the bigger missiles it can launch. The more trucks it has with tank tracks, the more places it can send them.3. Submarine MissilesNorth Korea has also been developing a new missile designed to be launched from a submarine, a necessary step to making Kim’s fleet a credible nuclear threat. A year ago, it launched a solid-fuel Pukguksong-3 missile from an underwater platform, demonstrating an estimated maximum range of about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles).This is the most-advanced solid-fuel missile that Kim’s regime has launched and if the Pukguksong-3 rolls by an a TEL, it would represent a new strategic weapon that could deliver a nuclear warhead to all of South Korea and most of Japan.4. Diplomatic MessagingWhile such parades are chiefly intended to stoke national pride and reaffirm support for the Kim regime, they can also provide a platform to send diplomatic messages his adversaries. Kim may give a speech, or leave the bombastic rhetoric to his generals or state-run media.Such statements will be watched for direct threats to Japan, South Korea and, of course, the U.S. North Korea has in recent months indicated that Kim expects more from Washington than a good relationship with Trump, and right before the U.S. election would be a good time to drive that home. Kim has been pushing for a nuclear deal that would get him relief from international sanctions without giving up too much of his weapons program.5. Expanding ArsenalThe parade may also show of Kim’s growing arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles. The regime has test-launched more than 30 of them since 2019. These include the nuclear-capable, hypersonic KN-23 that can strike all of South Korea -- including U.S. forces stationed south of Seoul -- within two minutes. He has also launched KN-25 short-range missiles designed to be fired in rapid succession from a single launcher and overwhelm interceptors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-set-to-show-off-nuclear-advances-in-message-to-trump/story-KwBIMuUquNT4YPHnbFOByM.html
10-10-2020||World||White House ups coronavirus aid offer, resumes talks with Nancy Pelosi||The White House is boosting its offer in up-and-down Covid-19 aid talks Friday in hopes of an agreement before Election Day, even as President Donald Trump’s most powerful GOP ally in the Senate said Congress is unlikely to deliver relief by then.Trump on Friday took to Twitter to declare: “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!” A top economic adviser said the Trump team was upping its offer in advance of a Friday conversation between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two spoke for more than 30 minutes Friday afternoon, said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill.Also Read: White House increases fiscal-stimulus offer to $1.8 trillionA GOP aide familiar with the new offer said it is about $1.8 trillion, with a key state and local fiscal relief component moving from $250 billion to at least $300 billion. The White House says its most recent prior offer was about $1.6 trillion. The aide requested anonymity because the negotiations are private.“I would like to see a bigger stimulus package than either the Democrats or Republicans are offering,” Trump said on Rush Limbaugh’s radio show Friday. Earlier this week, Trump lambasted Democrats for their demands on an aid bill.Pelosi’s most recent public offer was about $2.2 trillion, though that included a business tax increase that Republicans won’t go for.But GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told an audience in Kentucky that he doesn’t see a deal coming together soon out of a “murky” situation in which the participants in the negotiations are elbowing for political advantage.“I’d like to see us rise above that like we did in March and April but I think it’s unlikely in the next three weeks,” McConnell said. McConnell said later that “the first item of priority of the Senate is the Supreme Court,” suggesting there isn’t time to both process a Covid relief bill and the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the election.He spoke after Trump apparently performed an about-face, empowering Mnuchin to resume negotiations with Pelosi, D-Calif., on a larger, comprehensive coronavirus relief package despite calling off the talks just days before.Also Read: Dems move bill seeking removal of Trump’s powers on medical groundsWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday that “developments are positive” and that “the bid and the offer have narrowed” in advance of a the telephone conversation later Friday between Pelosi and Mnuchin.McConnell remains a skeptic that a deal can come together — and he has issued private warnings that many Senate Republicans will oppose a deal in the range that Pelosi is seeking.“We do need another rescue package,” McConnell said. “But the proximity to the election and the differences about what is need at this particular juncture are pretty vast.”Later Friday, during an appearance in Tompkinsville, Kentucky, McConnell said, “I don’t know whether we’ll get another (virus relief) package or not.”McConnell’s remarks capped a tumultuous week in which Trump sent conflicting signals and made unworkable demands. On Tuesday, he ordered an end to the weekslong talks after being told that few Republicans in Congress would end up voting for a possible Pelosi-Mnuchin deal.After taking blowback for that decision, Trump sought to revive the negotiations Thursday. Yet even as Mnuchin was reengaging with Pelosi, staffers in the White House — working under chief of staff Mark Meadows, a key negotiator — were issuing demands for a smaller package stuffed with Trump’s priorities.All this comes as Trump is sliding in the polls and is sidelined by his Covid-19 infection. The White House is short-staffed and dealing with infections among its employees. And the president and Pelosi are attacking each other’s mental health.That the talks were headed nowhere was an open secret among close observers in Washington, but both sides had been reluctant to declare them dead until Trump did so Tuesday, making himself a magnet for blame. The talks are still unlikely to produce results in the near term because even if there was a breakthrough, it could take weeks to process.McConnell says he is open to resuming the negotiations in a post-election lame-duck session, but that prospect is murky as well, depending on the results.On Friday, Pelosi issued a downbeat assessment in a letter to her colleagues but expressed some optimism in an appearance on MSNBC.“I do hope that we’ll have an agreement soon,” Pelosi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-ups-coronavirus-aid-offer-resumes-talks-with-nancy-pelosi/story-kIU3qGDT6RvKNysKTwHduO.html
10-10-2020||World||‘No new answers’, says WHO as Covid-19 continues to surge across world||The World Health Organization has announced a new daily record high in coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, with more than 350,000 infections reported to the UN health agency on Friday.The new daily high of 350,766 cases surpasses a record set earlier this week by nearly 12,000. That tally includes more than 109,000 cases from Europe alone.In a press briefing on Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan acknowledged that even as Covid-19 continues to surge across the world, “there are no new answers.”He said that although the agency wants countries to avoid the punishing lockdowns that have devastated economies, governments must ensure the most vulnerable people are protected and numerous measures must be taken.“The majority of people in the world are still susceptible to this disease,” Ryan warned. He said countries should focus not just on restrictive measures, but also on bolstering their surveillance systems, testing, contact tracing and ensuring populations are engaged.As the virus continues to surge across Europe and elsewhere, Ryan acknowledged that restrictive measures might be warranted at some point. British scientists reported this week that the Covid-19 outbreak is doubling every few weeks, French hospitals are running out of ICU beds, Germany may enlist the army to help contain its outbreak and Spain declared a state of emergency in Madrid as coronavirus cases soar.Ryan said lockdowns “may be unavoidable where the disease has got out of control again, but we shouldn’t accept that in every country, the return of cases should be seen with an immediate return of the need for lockdown restrictions.”Globally, more than 36 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported, including more than 1 million deaths.Experts say the tally far underestimates the real number of cases and Ryan said on Monday that the WHO’s “best estimates” were that one in 10 people worldwide — or roughly 760 million people — may have been infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-global-cases-hit-daily-record-trump-backs-big-aid/story-2Egalwt6eL3wFjrL0DOFML.html
10-10-2020||World||Police defend arrests of slain Black teen’s family||Police on Friday defended the arrests of family members of a Black teen killed by a suburban Milwaukee officer, saying they were driving recklessly during a protest and refused officers’ demands to leave their vehicles.Alvin Cole’s mother, Tracy Cole, and his sisters, Taleavia and Tristiana Cole, were arrested Thursday night during the demonstration in downtown Wauwatosa, their attorney, Kimberley Motley, said.Demonstrators have gathered in Wauwatosa for two straight nights to protest prosecutors’ decision not to charge Officer Joseph Mensah in the 17-year-old’s death. Mensah, who is Black, shot Cole after a foot chase outside a Wauwatosa mall in February.Motley said Friday that Tracy Cole, 48, was treated at a hospital for injuries on her arm and forehead. She initially complained that her arm might be broken, but Motley clarified during a news conference Friday that it was not. Tristiana Cole was also hospitalized but authorities have not said why. Motley tweeted that both were later released.Motley said the family was protesting peacefully and police dragged them from their vehicles and arrested them for no reason. No family members have been cited or charged, she said.“We all deserve better,” she said. “And we’re entitled to better under the law of the United States.”Wauwatosa police said officers encountered a group of vehicles after the 7 p.m. curfew. The vehicles were traveling across all lanes of traffic and officers used spike strips to stop them and protect other drivers, the police said in a Friday statement. Most of the people in the cars were arrested without incident but some refused to get out and were forcibly removed from their vehicles, police said.Police later said the Cole family was among those arrested and that Tracy and Tristiana Cole reported “minor injuries” and were taken to a hospital. The police did not offer any details on their injuries.Motley said in a text to The Associated Press that the police account is untrue and is a “pathetic attempt to justify the abuse and unlawful arrest of members of the Cole family.” If the police version of events was true, she said, the family would have been cited or charged.“Since when do people get dragged and beaten up for a traffic violation,” she said in the text. “This is America. Shame on them.”The police statement said investigators were reviewing the incident and that citations and charges would follow.Cole was the third person Mensah has killed on the job since he became a Wauwatosa officer in 2015. He shot Antonio Gonzales in 2015 after police said Gonzales refused to drop a sword. A year later, Mensah shot Jay Anderson Jr. in a car parked in a park after hours. Mensah said he saw a gun on the passenger seat and thought Anderson was reaching for it. He was cleared of wrongdoing in each case.The city’s police commission suspended Mensah in July and asked former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic to review the Cole case with an eye toward possible discipline. Biskupic’s report Wednesday recommended Mensah be fired, saying the risk of a fourth shooting is too great.Hours later Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, who is white, cleared Mensah of any criminal wrongdoing in Cole’s death. Chisholm’s report noted that officers said Cole pointed a gun at officers and refused to drop it. Chisholm said Mensah could successfully argue he fired in self-defense.Motley has vowed to file a civil rights lawsuit against Mensah.The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd gasped that he couldn’t breathe.The mostly peaceful protests in Wauwatosa have turned violent at times, with demonstrators breaking windows and looting at least one store, and National Guard troops patrolling the city. Public pressure has mounted on the Wauwatosa police commission to fire Mensah quickly.“Helicopters are circling above us, the National Guard is deployed on our streets, a curfew is preventing us from walking outside in our own yards, businesses are boarded up, there’s broken glass on our streets, families are marching and mourning the loss of their loved ones, police officers are at risk and none of us know what tomorrow will bring,” Milwaukee County Supervisor Shawn Rolland, who represents parts of Wauwatosa, said in a statement. “If this commission can accelerate its deliberative work, our people, businesses and neighborhoods can begin to heal faster.”A decision on discipline isn’t expected until at least November.A Facebook livestream that captured only audio of Tracy Cole was made by a third daughter. She could be heard screaming in pain as she was being arrested, saying police injured her arm, hit her in the head and used a stun gun on her.“I’m Mrs. Cole, Alvin’s mother,” she screamed repeatedly as officers pulled her out of her car.“I can’t believe y’all did this to me. Y’all killed my son,” she yelled at the officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-defend-arrests-of-slain-black-teen-s-family/story-Qsjp3TPoEQLSx2mcHg0K9N.html
10-10-2020||World||Hurricane Delta makes landfall in southwestern Louisiana||Hurricane Delta crashed onshore Friday in southwestern Louisiana as a Category 2 storm, compounding misery along a path of destruction left by Hurricane Laura only six weeks earlier.The center of the hurricane made landfall about 6 p.m. near the town of Creole with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph), pushing a storm surge that could reach up to 11 feet (3.4 meters), the National Hurricane Center said.As the 10th named storm to strike the continental US this year, Delta’s arrival snapped a century-old record.People in south Louisiana steeled themselves as Delta delivered driving rain, powerful winds and rising water to a part of the state still recovering from a deadly catastrophic hurricane six weeks ago. Power outages in Louisiana and neighbouring Texas soared past 203,000 homes and businesses Friday shortly after the storm came ashore, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.The Hurricane Center said wind gusts in Lake Arthur, Louisiana, reached 96 mph (154 kph) as Delta made landfall. Storm surge reached 8 feet (2.4 meters) east of Cameron, a sparely populated coastal community devastated by 2005′s Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike in 2008.Also read | ‘It’s a madhouse!’: Tourists pile into Cancun airport after hurricane hitsIn the city of Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta made landfall, rain pelted the tarp-covered roofs of buildings that Hurricane Laura battered when it barreled through in late August and killed at least 27 people in the state.“It’s devastating and it’s emotional for the citizenry,” Mayor Nic Hunter said as he prepared to ride out the storm in downtown Lake Charles.Winds picked up Friday evening in inland areas such as Lafayette, where occasionally strong gusts buffeted trees and sheets of rain were falling. Many parishes and towns implemented curfews Friday until Saturday morning to encourage people to stay off the roads during the worst of the storm.Dawn Trosclair checked into a hotel Friday, worried about trees falling on her home in Lafayette.“No other storm really threatened us,” Trosclair said as she watched the gusting winds. “Laura was far enough away and the winds were going to be mild enough here where we didn’t leave.”Laura damaged about 95% of the homes and buildings in Lake Charles, while up to 8,000 residents — 10% of the population — remain displaced, the mayor said. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other leftover debris lined the city’s largely vacant streets Friday, arousing concern they could cause more damage and deaths when the new storm strikes.“We just got lights back on like two weeks ago and then evacuating again? It’s extremely hard,” said Roslyn Kennedy. She was among a handful of evacuees at the Burton Coliseum in Lake Charles, waiting to be transported, again, to safer destinations.Delta was the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season and became the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental US As the 10th named storm to hit the continental US this year, it surpassed a record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.As the fourth hurricane or tropical storm to hit Louisiana in a year, Delta also tied a 2002 record, Klotzbach said.The storm triggered hurricane warnings stretching from High Island, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana.Earlier Friday, it had sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph), putting it at Category 3 strength. Though the storm weakened as it approached land, officials cautioned that it remained dangerous.“The fact that it’s weakening should not cause anyone to lose focus or lose vigilance, because this is still a very strong storm,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said during a news conference.Some residents were staying put, despite the danger. Ernest Jack remained in his Lake Charles house, one of those with a blue-tarped roof. He had gathered food, plenty of water and had covered his windows to protect against flying debris during Delta.“I just didn’t want to leave. I stayed during Hurricane Laura, too. I just put it in the Lord’s hands,” Jack said, pointing skyward.Delta, the latest in a recent flurry of rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricanes that scientists largely blame on global warming, appeared destined to set records at landfall.Concern wasn’t limited to the Lake Charles and Cameron Parish areas, where Laura came ashore in late August. Further east, in Acadiana region towns like New Iberia and Abbeville, people took the storm seriously.“You can always get another house, another car, but not another life,” said Hilton Stroder as he and his wife, Terry, boarded up their Abbeville home Thursday night with plans to head to their son’s house further east.This week marked the sixth time of the current season that Louisiana has been threatened by tropical storms or hurricanes. One, Tropical Storm Marco, fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip, and others veered elsewhere, but Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.New Orleans, to the east, was expected to escape Delta’s worst. But tropical storm-force winds were still likely in the city Friday, and local officials said they were preparing for the possibility of tornadoes.In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency, as did his counterpart Edwards in Louisiana. Forecasters said southern Mississippi could see heavy rain and flash flooding.The hurricane was expected to weaken rapidly over land. Forecasters predicted Delta would be downgraded to a tropical storm late Friday. The storm’s projected path showed it moving into northern Mississippi on Saturday and then into the Tennessee Valley as a tropical depression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-makes-landfall-in-southwestern-louisiana/story-6aWGmTdxkOifgmkQE3UB0L.html

10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to hold first rally since Covid-19 illness in Florida on Monday||US President Donald Trump will give a public speech at the White House on Saturday for the first time since testing positive for Covid-19, and will also hold a Florida rally next week in an attempt to relaunch his stumbling reelection campaign with only 25 days to go.Knocked off the campaign trail by his hospitalization for three nights last week, the president is in the midst of a frenetic bid to catch up with surging Democratic challenger Joe Biden.On Friday, during an extended media blitz, he falsely claimed that Covid-19 now has a cure.He also revealed that he’d been told he was near death at the worst of his bout with the virus, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans and severely dented his chances of winning a second term on November 3.Saturday’s speech, which a senior administration official said would be on Trump’s favored theme of “law and order,” will give him a chance to dispel lingering doubts about his health. The crowd will be on the South Lawn of the White House, while the president will stand up on the balcony, the official said, confirming US media reports.And on Monday, Trump will take another big step by holding a rally in Sanford, in the crucial electoral state of Florida, his campaign said.The events come despite continued questions over how sick Trump was last week and how complete his recovery is now, with White House officials refusing to answer basic queries including the date on which the president first contracted the virus and whether he has tested negative since.- ‘Better than a vaccine’ -On Friday, Trump gave a marathon interview to right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh in which he said the experimental Regeneron antibody cocktail that he took as part of therapeutic treatment was “a cure.”It’s “a total game changer” and “better than a vaccine,” he said.In fact, there is no cure and still no approved vaccine for the coronavirus.Trump repeatedly asserted that he feels fine and he has been backed up by statements from the presidential physician, Sean Conley.But in his Limbaugh interview, Trump suggested for the first time that he had been close to death, had it not been for the therapeutic drugs.“I’m talking to you today because of it. I could have been a bad victim,” he said, referring to friends of his who had died from Covid-19.Trump said that doctors told him afterward, “you were going into a very bad phase.” “You know what that means,” said the president.According to Conley, Trump is now fit for a “safe return to public engagement” from Saturday.- Battle for attention -Trump has tried to fill the gap left by his enforced absence from the campaign trail by making back-to-back appearances on friendly media outlets.He twice spoke at length on Fox on Thursday and was due back on Fox’s Tucker Carlson Tonight show late Friday, appearing from the White House where he was to undergo what the network described as an on-air “medical evaluation,” conducted remotely by Fox contributor Doctor Marc Siegel.Biden, however, is already picking up the pace of travel, with a stop in Nevada on Friday after going to Arizona on Thursday.Polls show Biden leads heavily in key demographics including women and the elderly, prompting analysts to talk increasingly of a possible landslide victory.Trump’s biggest liability -- overwhelming public dissatisfaction over his handling of the coronavirus crisis -- has returned as the headline issue of the campaign thanks to the president’s own infection.Adding to the pressure, congressional Democrats who control the House of Representatives unveiled plans for a commission to investigate a president’s physical and mental fitness for the job -- a move clearly meant to jab at Trump.The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said it was time to examine Trump’s “disassociation from reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-hold-first-rally-since-covid-illness-in-florida-on-monday/story-WvhWkyGS4ZM5aPqo4l1u2L.html
10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says experimental drugs may have saved him from coronavirus attack||President Donald Trump said Friday he could have become very ill and might not have recovered from Covid-19 without experimental drugs, a far worse outlook than what his doctors were telling the American people.“I was asking the doctors today ... and I said, ‘How bad was I?’ They said: ‘You could have been very bad. You were going into a very bad phase,’“ Trump told Rush Limbaugh during his radio show.“It looked like it was going to be a big deal and you know what that means, right? That means bad because I’ve lost five people,” Trump added, referring to acquaintances who have died.Trump said that after contracting the virus, he was “not in the greatest of shape.” He added that “I might not have recovered at all” without treatment with experimental drugs.Trump’s comments on the seriousness of his case of coronavirus contrast with generally upbeat public statements about his condition that his doctors released after his diagnosis and while he was hospitalized.The White House said Trump’s hospitalization at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which began October 2, was precautionary and his symptoms were mild.On October 3, Trump’s physician gave a televised briefing and painted a sunny picture of the president’s situation, emphasizing that he was still working, walking on his own and not laboring to breathe. But Dr. Sean Conley notably refused to provide some specific details, including repeatedly sidestepping questions about whether the president had at any point received supplemental oxygen. It was later learned that Trump had received oxygen before he was taken to Walter Reed.Trump’s comments tracked most closely with an update provided by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after his hospitalization. Meadows offered few details, but said the president’s initial situation had been “very concerning” and, though his health was improving, the following 48 hours would be critical.Trump credited his recovery to an experimental antibody drug made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. “It was primarily this one drug,” Trump said. “It just wiped out the virus. It wiped it out.”The drug is not a cure, but experimental antibody treatments like the one Trump was given are among the most promising therapies being tested for treating and preventing coronavirus infections. The antibody drugs, which aim to help the immune system clear the virus, are still in testing. Their safety and effectiveness are not yet known and there is no way for the president or his doctors to know whether the drug had any effect in his case.Trump is among fewer than 10 people who have been able to access the drug under “compassionate use” rules without enrolling in a study. He said he is “bugging” the Food and Drug Administration to quickly authorize emergency use of the drugs more broadly.Trump said that if the antibody drugs made by Regeneron as well as Eli Lilly succeed in clinical trials, they would constitute a “cure.”“It’s a cure and I’m talking to you today because of it,” Trump said. “And, you know, because I think I could have been a ... bad victim. I fit certain categories that aren’t so great. ... I’m telling you this is a total game-changer.”The White House did not respond to questions regarding the discrepancies between Trump’s account of his condition and the weekend updates given by his doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-experimental-drugs-may-have-saved-him-from-coronavirus-attack/story-KFVjLTeRHlVaX4MJd2kbEK.html
10-10-2020||World||Anthony Fauci calls Donald Trump’s White House ceremony a ‘super-spreader event’||Anthony Fauci, the US’s top infectious-disease expert, said that a gathering in the White House Rose Garden last month was a “super-spreader event” for the novel coronavirus.President Donald Trump held a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden on Sept. 26 to honor Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. While the White House had a testing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and attendees mingled and sat in close proximity to one another both indoors and outdoors.Subsequently, the president and several top staffers, as well as senators and military officials, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.“The data speak for themselves,” Fauci said in an interview Friday with CBS News Radio. “We had a super-spreader event in the White House. And it was in a situation where people were crowded together, were not wearing masks. So the data speaks for themselves.”Fauci said in the interview that people who are infected with the coronavirus but aren’t yet showing symptoms can transmit the pathogen to others, which makes the case for wearing face coverings.Asymptomatic individuals “are a substantial part of the people that actually transmit infections to other people,” Fauci said in the CBS interview. “So the better part of the recommendation would be everybody wear a mask, literally universally.”Trump was hospitalized last week after testing positive, and was given several experimental therapies, including Gilead Sciences Inc. antiviral remdesivir, the steroid dexamethasone and an antibody cocktail made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Trump said he intends to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Regeneron drug, which hasn’t yet been cleared in any form by US regulators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-calls-donald-trump-s-white-house-ceremony-a-super-spreader-event/story-A0fBMiZEvdO8WdBOqCpDyM.html
10-10-2020||World||Why won’t White House say when Trump last tested negative||It is a basic, crucial question and one the White House refuses to answer: When was President Donald Trump’s last negative test for the coronavirus before he tested positive last week?“Yeah, I’m not going to give you a detailed readout with timestamps every time the president’s tested,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters last weekend.“I can’t reveal that at this time,” echoed Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications. “Doctors would like to keep it private.”“I don’t want to go backwards,” said Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician.The answer could help fill in vital details about the course of the president’s illness as well as when he may have been contagious and whom else he may have exposed. And the White House refusal to answer makes it hard not to wonder what they’re hiding, given other details they’ve shared.“At this point it’s just so strange that they’re unwilling to give us the information,” said Michael Joseph Mina, a physician and professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s school of public health. “It makes people start thinking things like, ‘Was the president the super-spreader?’... If there was no nefarious activity going on, then they should have no problem answering this question.”The information is also key to tracking who else may have been exposed to the virus so their contacts can be traced to prevent new clusters of infection.“Then you can get an idea, potentially, of when he was infected, how long his incubation period was, and also then evaluate who may have been exposed to him over that time frame,” said Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the clinical virology laboratory at Stanford Health Care. While there is considerable variability between cases, he said, Trump was most likely infectious several days before he tested positive — a period during which he traveled and had close contact with dozens of people.Senior White House staff and those who are in direct contact with the president are tested for the virus daily. The White House originally gave the impression that Trump, too, was tested every day, with McEnany claiming in July that Trump was “the most tested man in America” and tested “multiple times a day.” But Trump contradicted her, saying, “I do probably on average a test every two days, three days.”The current White House line is that Trump is tested “regularly.”Here’s what is known: On Wednesday, Sept. 30, during a trip to Minnesota for a fundraiser and rally, one of the president’s closest aides, Hope Hicks, began feeling ill. She isolated herself aboard Air Force Once during the trip home, but the White House appears to have taken no further action.The next morning, Hicks was again tested for the virus. This time, the results came back positive, just as the president was about to leave for a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. A frantic effort was made to swap out staff who had been in close contact with Hicks, including McEnany. But Trump, who had also been with Hicks, nonetheless boarded Marine One, along with other White House staff still in the dark about Hicks’ diagnosis.After returning home from Bedminster, Trump was administered a rapid test, followed by a more accurate confirming test, which takes several hours to process. Both came back positive.“Safe to say, his first positive test was upon return or at least after Bedminster,” McEnany said.But had Trump been tested before he made that trip to court donors in New Jersey after Hicks fell in?Had he been tested before he traveled to Minnesota?What about the previous day, before his first debate against Democrat Joe Biden in Cleveland? The Cleveland Clinic, which co-hosted the event, required that all attendees be tested in advance. Campaigns had to “certify” that their candidates and traveling staff had tested negative within 72 hours. “Each campaign complied with this requirement,” the clinic said in a statement.White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern, however, refused Friday to confirm that was the case in an appearance on MSNBC.“The president’s doesn’t check all of his HIPAA rights at the door just when he becomes president,” Morgenstern said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which was written to prevent doctors and others who bill for insurance coverage from disclosing a person’s medical information without their consent.Was Trump tested Monday, Sept. 28, before he held a photo op with a truck on the South Lawn and a Rose Garden press conference to trumpet coronavirus test efforts? What about before a debate prep session with his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who have both since tested positive?What about Sept. 27, when he visited his golf course in Sterling, Virginia, held a late afternoon news conference in the White House briefing room, and held an evening reception for Gold Star families on the White House state floor? Adm. Charles W. Ray, the vice commandant of the Coast Guard, who was in attendance, has since tested positive, forcing the nation’s top military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, into self-quarantine.What about Sept. 26, before he held a Rose Garden ceremony announcing his next pick for the Supreme Court, complete with closed-door receptions where few wore masks? Numerous attendees have since tested positive following the suspected “super-spreader” event.Could Trump have been contagious that day? Could he have been the spreader?Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist and department chairman at the Yale School of Public Health, noted that a small proportion of people infected contribute to the majority of infection, with about 20% of people responsible for 80% of transmission, studies show.While it’s unclear if Trump did indeed spread it, Ko said, “trying to identify people and when they could be infectious is important, especially when they are in contact with a lot of other people.”Added Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, “There is concern that he continued to engage in public activities after his initial positive test, which is deeply worrisome and frankly unethical.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-won-t-white-house-say-when-trump-last-tested-negative/story-MIG1EHOFDlcTsUz35Cg7ZO.html
10-10-2020||World||Twitter seeks to limit spread of misinformation before vote||Twitter Inc. announced a handful of product changes intended to make it harder for users to spread misinformation on the service in the final weeks of the US presidential campaign.Some of the alterations are related to Twitter’s retweet feature, which lets users share another person’s post to their own followers, and is the fastest way for a tweet to go viral. If someone tries to retweet a post that has been labeled as false, Twitter will show “a prompt pointing them to credible information about the topic,” the company said Friday. It will also put more misleading tweets behind a warning screen, forcing users to click in order to see the original post.Twitter will also prompt users to “quote tweet” a post before retweeting it -- asking them to “add their own commentary” to the message instead of just passing it along.“Though this adds some extra friction and an extra step for those who simply want to retweet, we hope it will encourage everyone to not only consider why they are amplifying a Tweet, but also increase the likelihood that people add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation,” the San Francisco-based company wrote in a blog post.Twitter, like rival Facebook Inc., is preparing for a contentious US presidential election on Nov. 3 in which results are likely to be delayed, and experts fear misinformation will run rampant online. Unlike Facebook, Twitter doesn’t have a large fact-checking operation, and only verifies tweets in particular categories, including election- and Covid-related misinformation. The company has drawn praise and criticism from different sides of the political spectrum for its decision to fact-check posts from President Donald Trump about mail-in voting and the coronavirus.Twitter doesn’t remove inaccurate tweets unless they pose an immediate risk or harm to users or violate another one of the company’s rules, like promoting hate speech or harassment. This approach to leaving misinformation up, but with a label, is why the company is trying more creative methods to keep people from sharing misinformation more widely.It’s also trying to prevent the spread of misinformation caused by its own software. The company says it will stop inserting popular posts into users’ feeds from people they don’t follow.“This will likely slow down how quickly tweets from accounts and topics you don’t follow can reach you, which we believe is a worthwhile sacrifice to encourage more thoughtful and explicit amplification,” the company said in the blog. Twitter will also only surface trends for people if the trend includes additional context.Twitter already announced a handful of other policies intended to curb confusion around election night. Twitter and Facebook, for example, will forbid candidates from claiming victory before official results are available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-seeks-to-limit-spread-of-misinformation-before-vote/story-SlfFPqr4z6DruvhtEK7FAO.html
10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump got ‘unusual’ payments from Vegas hotel in 2016: NYT Report||Donald Trump received $21 million in “highly unusual” payments from a Nevada hotel in 2016 as his presidential campaign was struggling for cash, the New York Times reported.Tax records recently obtained by the newspaper show a series of transactions that flowed to the president from a hotel he owns in Las Vegas with casino mogul Phil Ruffin, at a time his campaign had as little as $1.3 million in the bank, according to the report published on Friday. The Times said experts characterized the payments as unusual.The documents don’t show if the money ultimately went to the campaign, but the payments could violate tax or campaign finance laws, the newspaper said.The finding is the latest published by the New York Times based on more than two decades of Trump’s tax data. The Times reported Sept. 27 that Trump has aggressively used tax deductions to offset income and paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.“This is yet another politically-motivated hit piece inaccurately smearing a standard business deal,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement responding to the Times article. “During his years as a successful businessman, Donald Trump was long-time partners with Phil Ruffin and earned whatever payments he received.”The Trump Organization and the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment.The New York Times said the the bulk of the $21 million went through a company called Trump Las Vegas Sales and Marketing that had no employees or clear business purpose. Trump contributed $10 million to his campaign in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, which has raised questions about where the candidate, who’d been tight on cash, got the money, the newspaper said.Trump‘s re-election effort ended August with $325 million, about $141 million less than Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee had. Neither campaign has released figures on their September financial position, but Biden topped the record $364.5 million his campaign raised in August.Biden started September with a $466 million mountain of cash to take on Trump, completely reversing the Republican’s financial advantage in just four months. In April, Biden had about $98 million in the bank compared to $255 million for the incumbent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-got-unusual-payments-from-vegas-hotel-in-2016-nyt-report/story-0kW5Jqw6s8vWsUA2DtXydJ.html
10-10-2020||World||New daily record as Covid-19 cases hit more than 350,000: WHO||The World Health Organization has announced a new daily record high in coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, with more than 350, 000 infections reported to the UN health agency on Friday.The new daily high of 350,766 cases surpasses a record set earlier this week by nearly 12,000. That tally includes more than 109,000 cases from Europe alone.In a press briefing on Friday, the WHO emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, acknowledged that even as COVID-19 continues to surge across the world, “there are no new answers.”He said that although the agency wants countries to avoid the punishing lockdowns that have devastated economies, governments must ensure the most vulnerable people are protected and that numerous measures must be taken.“The majority of people in the world are still susceptible to this disease,” Ryan warned. He said countries should focus not just on restrictive measures, but on bolstering their surveillance systems, testing, contact tracing and ensuring populations are engaged.As the virus continues to surge across Europe and elsewhere, he acknowledged that restrictive measures might be warranted at some point. British scientists reported this week that the COVID-19 outbreak is doubling every few weeks, French hospitals are running out of ICU beds and Spain declared a state of emergency in Madrid as coronavirus cases soar.Ryan said lockdowns “may be unavoidable where the disease has got out of control again, but we shouldn’t accept that in every country, the return of cases should be seen with an immediate return of the need for lockdown restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-reports-new-daily-high-in-covid-19-cases-as-global-tally-hits-more-than-350-000/story-i3ERJ83SlmBVIZzKwtuxxM.html
10-10-2020||World||Airbus delivers most jets since pandemic aided by E-delivery||Airbus SE delivered more aircraft in September than any month this year, a victory in the European planemaker’s battle to keep factories running and revenue flowing amid a prolonged downturn in air travel.The tally of 57 jets, mostly single-aisle with a handful of long-range aircraft, compared with 39 handovers recorded in August, according to a statement Friday. Still, Airbus saw no new orders and three cancellations -- a reminder of the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that’s shown little sign of letting up.The month’s figures marked progress on a number of fronts for the planemaker, which has struggled to maintain jetliner deliveries as its airline customers seek to defer orders to protect their own cash reserves. September saw the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer whittle down its backlog of finished aircraft, delivering nine of the larger, wide-body planes for which demand has all but dried up.The previous high for the year was 49 in July. Airbus’s e-delivery option has accounted for around 100 handovers so far, according to a person familiar with the matter. The system allows customers to delegate some essential checks to the manufacturer’s own engineers, avoiding unnecessary travel and delays related to restrictions.Chinese carriers, including Air China Ltd., China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp., took possession of 18 jets during September. Delta Air Lines Inc. accepted two A350-900 and one A330-900 wide-bodies, along with an A321ceo.Airbus and its US rival Boeing Co. have been working with cash-strapped customers to address commitments for aircraft made long before the pandemic arrived. Some airlines have decided to accept planes they don’t need, gaining concessions elsewhere and avoiding forfeiture of earlier progress payments.Wide-Bodies, JobsIn an illustration of how challenging the current environment is, Airbus announced its first wide-body mandate in almost six months in late September -- for a single tanker-jet. The order wasn’t included in the September figures because it isn’t finalized.In normal times, Airbus and Boeing would have racked up dozens of orders for hundreds of planes over the summer. Boeing, which hasn’t yet announced September figures, released forecasts earlier this week predicting a sharp contraction in jetliner sales over the next decade.Airbus slashed its production-rate targets in April and Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said this week they would stay 40% lower through 2020 and 2021. The company still has a significant backlog of undelivered jets, raising questions over whether it may need to cut production further.The company, which is due to release its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29, has also been stepping up warnings about jobs.

10-10-2020||World||VP debate: Kamala Harris, Mike Pence clash over handling of Covid-19 pandemic||Democratic Senator Kamala Harris cemented her place in US history on Wednesday as the first woman of colour and the first Indian-American person to participate in a vice-presidential debate.Republican vice-president Mike Pence, the incumbent Harris is seeking to unseat, sought to live up to the expectations of defending President Donald Trump and his administration’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 211,000 Americans.Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last month’s acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump that had devolved into name-calling.As a stark reminder of the times we are living in, Harris and Pence were separated by plexiglass barriers in an auditorium where guests had to wear face coverings, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Social distancing norms were enforced far more rigorously than in the opening presidential debate, at which Trump’s guests, including his family members, hadn’t worn face coverings.“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris said, landing the first punch of the night, referring to the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic.“I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,” said Pence, defending the American president and himself as head of the White House task force, appointed by Trump, to lead the fight against the worst public health crisis in over a century.With at least 211,000 dead and over 7.5 million infected with the coronavirus in the US, and Trump, the first lady and a growing number of people in their circle testing positive for Covid-19, the pandemic was the top issue at the vice-presidential debate. Harris and Pence also clashed over climate change, trade war with China, economy, racism, healthcare, Supreme Court, women’s right to abortion, and religion.As the running mate of Biden who was leading in national polls, Harris was expected to play it safe and not hand the Trump campaign a lifeline. And she did just that, overlooking several opportunities to attack Pence, much to the disappointment of many supporters who had expected to see flashes of her prosecutorial skills.“The debate was civil and constructive as compared to the presidential debate,” said M R Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, a leading Indian-American advocacy group. “Kamala and Pence delivered their positions passionately and we now have 27 days to decide.”Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican running for Lt Governor in Virginia, a state that used to be Republican but has widely come to be considered Democratic lately, said, “VP Pence clearly distinguished himself by highlighting the exemplary job done for the American people by President Trump and his administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vp-debate-kamala-harris-mike-pence-clash-over-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-EfoNVdLmlxfmALI8mBApTL.html

Why is the chief minister quiet over the (incidents of) crimes against women?”He said the security cover of the chief minister was further strengthened on the lines of the Prime Minister’s security.The proposal to the effect was approved through a state cabinet decision.“The upgrade will be recorded in the green book also. PM’s security management details are registered in the blue book. After studying the blue book, the UP CM’s green book was reviewed. Ever since this chief minister has come, there have been regular reviews in his security,” Akhilesh Yadav said.The SP chief said: “But if, in 2020, there is so much threat to the CM’s security, then imagine what kind of fear the people of the state must be living under?”Quoting NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) figures, Akhilesh said according to the 2019 report, UP recorded a 12% increase in cases of crime against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.Citing the NCRB report, he also said a total of 59,853 cases of crimes against women were filed, of which there were 272 cases of rape of minor girls. The state recorded a total of 3,065 cases of rape, he said, quoting NCRB figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-chief-akhilesh-yadav-takes-a-swipe-at-up-cm-adityanath-s-security-upgrade/story-cVTIRL0JZfvTdl4DHK3SgM.html

There are reports of organising community work on October 19 and 20. Also read: Hathras gang rape case to be probed by CBI, Centre issues notification“Since any activities within the disputed interstate border can result in law and order problems, it is requested to kindly intervene and issue necessary instructions to the concerned district administration for the immediate and indefinite stoppage of the proposed construction,” the letter read.No comment from Tripura government is available on the issue.Located in Kanchanpur sub-division of North district of Tripura, Phuldungsei village has a population of over 600.Kanchanpur sub-divisional magistrate Chandni Chandran in August informed her higher officials that 130 people of the village, who have ration cards of Tripura, were included in Mizoram’s voters’ list. Chandran stressed on demarcating the exact boundary between the two neighbouring states incorporating the entire village in Tripura. Shortly after it, the state government ordered a probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-govt-seeks-stoppage-of-all-activities-at-disputed-tripura-mizoram-interstate-border/story-K8fEaFBkqrZftvrq4pNItL.html

The mental stress coupled with the dehydration brought about by standing for hours in a hot and humid weather may have taken a toll,” said a source close to the family.After the cremation, Union minister and senior BJP leader Giriraj Singh told reporters, “Paswans death marks the end of an era. He must have been the last surviving political leader with decades of parliamentary experience. His popularity can be gauged from the fact that all central ministers from Bihar are present here. I can also see representatives from various political parties.” “He is one of the few luminaries who stoutly defended the Mandal Commission when its recommendations were implemented by the VP Singh government, and rebuffed detractors when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s well- intentioned quota for economically weaker sections was being opposed,” Singh said.“We are all with the bereaved family in this hour of grief,” he added.Onlookers remarked that it needs an “ajaat shatru” (one with no enemies) like Ram Vilas Paswan to evoke such tenderness from someone known for his acerbity, that too at a time when his party is not happy with the political line taken by the successor -- Chirag.

He was the consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet.Paras, an LJP MP, has also made a plea for bestowing Bharat Ratna on his elder brother.Bihar minister and senior BJP leader Prem Kumar also sought Bharat Ratna for Paswan.“I support the demand for conferring Bharat Ratna on Ramvilas Paswan for his works to bring Dalits and those hailing from the deprived sections of the society into the mainstream,” Prem Kumar tweeted.Ramvilas Paswan had shot to national fame after winning the 1977 Lok Sabha election from Hajipur seat with a record margin of votes on Janata Party ticket. Since then, he represented the seat for eight times.Born on July 5, 1946 in a poor Dalit family in Saharbanni village of Bihar’s Khagaria district, Paswan had started his political journey with a win in the state Assembly election from Alauli on Samyukta Socialist Party ticket in 1969.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bihar-cm-jitan-ram-manjhi-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-ram-vilas-paswan/story-IBusrnjWMdAJLq6p2vGCEI.html

A senior official who is part of the multi-agency probe said Customs got the clearance and the warrant in this connection was handed over to jail authorities. In its application, Customs said the investigation was at a crucial stage and probe agencies needed their prolonged custody. An accused charged with COFEPOSA can be kept in preventive custody up to a year without trial. The Customs slapped the provision after Suresh obtained bail in two cases. But she remained in jail as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had booked her under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Usually, COFEPOSA is invoked on habitual offenders who pose a threat to the country’s economy. At least 30 people were arrested in connection with the case which surfaced after the recovery of 30 kg gold from a consignment that came to the UAE consulate in the state capital in July camouflaged as diplomatic luggage. This is the first time UAPA was invoked in a smuggling case in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-customs-invokes-cofeposa-on-two-prime-accused/story-uGJTkUeop2P3JgSiwfV4tM.html

10-10-2020||India||Sabarimala Temple to open for devotees on Oct 16 after lockdown to curb Covid-19||After lockdown, the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala is preparing to open for the first time on October 16 for a five-day monthly pooja, the Travancore Devasom Board (TDB) which runs the hill shrine said. There will be strict restrictions for pilgrims-- only registered devotees will be allowed and a maximum of 250 of them will be permitted in a single day. All pilgrims will have to carry Covid-19 negative certificates obtained 48 hours before reaching Pambha, the base camp, and those arriving without certificates will have to undergo a test and wait for its results, said the TDB adding virtual queue registration will begin from Saturday night. Bathing in Pamba River will not be allowed and nobody will be permitted to stay on the hilltop. The TDB has also set up a small hospital for those who test positive for the viral infection. Confusion still persists on masks with doctors having warned that a mask will cause trouble for devotees when they scale steep heights and it may disturb their breathing process. From base camp Pambha, devotees will have to trek five km to reach the hilltop and some of the stretches are really steep. Despite setting up oxygen parlours every year, many pilgrims die due to heart failure. Last year, 30 pilgrims died due to heart-related ailments. The TDB said the High Court-appointed body will be approached to get more clarity on masks. The temple was closed for devotees on March 18, a week before the first lockdown was put into place. In June there were plans to open the shrine but it was deferred after many organizations and the tantri (chief priest) of the temple opposed it. One of the richest temples in the country, Sabarimala revenue is usually used to fund smaller temples and for salaries of employees of the Travancore Devasom Board (TDB). The closure of the temple had invited enough trouble for TDB and its 3,500-odd employees. “We will closely monitor the situation. Based on the five-day opening we will take a decision on the annual pilgrimage season starting in November. We will raise the number of pilgrims based on the feedback we get now,” TDB chairman N Vasu said. During the last pilgrimage season-- October 2019 to January 2020-- the aggregate revenue of the temple was Rs 263. 57 crore. Aravana payasam-- a black kheer made of rice, jaggery, ghee and cardamom-- forms 60 per cent of the temple revenue. Pilgrims from five South Indian states throng the temple and it is often considered the largest seasonal pilgrimage after Mecca. At the peak of the season, at least 5 to 8 lakh people visit the shrine on a day. The temple had witnessed large-scale unrest in 2018 after the Supreme Court lifted the age-old tradition of barring women in the reproductive age. A larger bench of the court is hearing the issue now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-temple-to-open-for-devotees-on-oct-16-after-lockdown-to-curb-covid-19/story-2sCZZEJGUNCp3YjZPK7g9H.html

A draft notification has been issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in this regard. “The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has issued a draft notification...seeking comments and suggestions for amendment to Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 for facilitating the issuance of International Driving Permit (IDP) for citizens whose IDP has expired while they are abroad,” MoRTH said in a statement.  It said that it has come to its notice that in certain cases for the citizens who are travelling abroad and in a foreign country, the IDP gets expired and there is no mechanism for its renewal while abroad. “The proposal is to amend the CMVR 1989 to facilitate such citizens. The citizens can apply through the Indian Embassy / Mission Abroad portals and the applications would then move to the VAHAN for being considered by the respective RTOs (regional transport offices),” the statement said. The proposal also includes removal of the conditions of a medical certificate and a valid visa at the time of making the request for the IDP in the country. “Further, there are certain countries where the visa is on arrival and in such cases the visa was not available when applying for the IDP in India before travel,” the statement said.

The festive season is also a time when people across socioeconomic sectors seek to earn and sometimes it is the only time, they are able to make money for the entire year.An idol maker in Maharashtra said sales have dropped by 50%, according to news agency ANI. “Restrictions placed on the height of the idols are leading to a lower generation of income. Customers are also less this year. Sales have gone down by almost 50%,” the idol maker said.Gujarat also has disallowed Garba during Navratri. The popular folk dance of Gujarat is performed with passion among the citizens during the festival. It has also imposed restrictions on the number of people visiting the pandal and has also introduced a time limit on the prayers. On October 25, chief minister Vijay Rupani released a statement saying, “The nine-day traditional state-level Navratri festival, organised by the state government every year will not be celebrated in the larger public interest due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation this year.”The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned the Delhi government and instructed them to speak to community leaders to ensure that during the Durga Puja, Dussehra and Chhath are celebrated in a low-key fashion. Several puja committees in New Delhi, which has garnered attention over the past few years for its Durga Puja marquees, have said they will hold low key celebrations this year.Tamal Rakshit, an executive committee member of the Durga Puja committee in Chittaranjan Park’s B-Block, pointed out that community celebrations are a huge risk and coronavirus disease cases may see a spike following the festivities. “Community celebrations involve immense risk for both the organisers and the devotees. No matter how much prepared the organisers are, the situation can get out of hand in multiple ways. We have to be scientific here. We have decided to keep the celebrations low-key with no idols and cultural programme,” Rakshit told HT.However, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that Covid-19 should not dampen the festival spirit and that the pandemic should be put in lockdown. The eastern state has issued guidelines for social distancing and has already cancelled the Vijaya Dashami carnival in order to stop the spread of Covid-19.Idol makers in Kolkata’s potter colony, Kumartuli, have taken precautions to ensure that the area which has been relatively free of coronavirus disease continues to remain so. But some of them pointed out to other issues.Sujit Paul, an office-bearer of Mritshilpo Sanskriti Samiti (KMSS), a body that represents the idol makers, while speaking to PTI pointed out to the lack of labourers this year. “Many labourers from districts, who had gone home during the lockdown, did not return amid safety concerns. The artisans, this time, have received 40% fewer orders when compared to the year before. But their hands are full owing to the dearth of labourers,” Paul said.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan after speaking with activists from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has also lifted restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loss-of-income-fear-of-spike-in-covid-19-cases-as-india-heads-towards-festive-season/story-ECRf8onBLq303NQkPabnGO.html

The Prime Minister will roll out physical copies of Aadhaar-like cards that will be the property titles of the villagers’ homes and the surrounding areas they own as opposed to cultivated land.2. They will be able to use the cards as financial assets for loans and the move will also help keep a record of properties in villages. No such system currently exists.3. For now, the property cards will be distributed across 763 villages, including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and 2 from Karnataka, according to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).4. Following the virtual launch by PM Modi on October 11, where Union minister for panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar will also be present, state governments will physically handover the cards to the villagers.5. Beneficiaries from all the states, except Maharashtra, will receive the copies of the title deeds within a day but it will take a month’s time for the western state to distribute them. There will be a time lag in Maharashtra because has a system of recovering the nominal cost of these cards.6. Local representatives of the revenue department and representatives of other allied departments will prepare a record of ownership in the presence of the inhabitants. A detailed arrangement has also been set up for on the spot settlement of disputes, according to people familiar with the development.7. The objective of this scheme is to provide an integrated asset verification solution for rural India, they added on condition of anonymity.

10-10-2020||India||Reforms alone can’t raise farm growth, Bihar example shows||Bihar’s agricultural reforms of 2006, which saw the state liberalise agricultural trade by abolishing state-regulated markets, resulted in better prices for produce such as rice, wheat and maize, but the changes also brought greater price volatility, ultimately hurting farm growth, a study has suggested. The reforms did not result in any significant private investment in new market infrastructure and a missing floor price due to the government’s withdrawal from the sector continued to put farmers at a disadvantage, the study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) said in their ongoing research project “Agricultural Diagnostic for Bihar State of India”. The findings of the study come in the wake of Parliament enacting three controversial farm reforms that aim to liberalise the agricultural sector, including ending local monopolies of state-run wholesale markets -- known as agriculture produce market committees or APMCs -- by opening them up to private competition. Also Read: BJP’s CEC to meet today to discuss candidate list for Bihar pollsThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pushed the three bills -- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 – in Parliament last month despite protests by farmers’ outfits and opposition leaders who demanded greater scrutiny of the laws. Big farmers’ groups, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say the Centre’s farm reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system and that deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. Bihar was one of the earliest states to scrap the APMC system. This changeover did not benefit the farm sector to the extent it should have, and it serves as a cautionary tale for the rest of the country in doing away with regulations without the right incentives for private investment in agriculture, economists have said. Also Read: The economic arguments in favour of the three farm bills: All you need to knowBihar is one of the fastest growing states in India, with its gross state domestic product, or GSDP, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12.14% between 2011-12 and 2016-17. The share of agriculture in the state’s GSDP is about 23%, higher than the national average of 14%, which means that the farm sector generates more income as a proportion of the overall income in Bihar than it does in the country as a whole. The reforms don’t appear to have improved Bihar’s agricultural growth. Farm growth in the state averaged 2.04%, lower than the all-India average of 3.12% in the period between 2001-02 to 2016-17. “This happened despite a stable political environment, improvement in investment on rural infrastructure and reforms in agricultural marketing,” said Elumalai Kannan and Sanjib Pohit, authoris of the NCAER study.. The post-reforms period, when compared to the pre-reforms period, does show an increase in the average wholesale prices of major crops such as paddy, wheat, and maize. The average price of paddy increased by 126%, wheat by 66%, and maize by 81%, the authors said. However, analysis showed that a simultaneous increase in volatility of prices affected the “stability of farmers’ income”, ultimately affecting farmers’ ability to invest and diversify. This instability in prices of farm produce, the authors note, could be a reason for Bihar’s lower agricultural growth. Price volatility refers to price fluctuations of a commodity. Maize is a major crop in the state. In the pre-reform period (2002-06), the price volatility of maize (as calculated by a statistical measure known as ‘coefficient of variation’) stood at 11.2%. This went up to 24.9% in the post-reform period (2007-16). Similarly, price volatility had gone up significantly for also paddy and wheat. A knock-on effect of the lockdown has resulted in maize prices crashing to Rs 1,000-1,300 per quintal, against a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,850, this year. An analysis by Jaipur-based Chaudhury Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (CCSNIAM) conducted in 2011-12, along with the NCAER study quoted above, unanimously state that after APMC market yards were abolished in the state, there has been scant private investment in new markets. This has led to “low market density”, meaning farmers often lack secure market channels within easy reach. The studies have called for a public-private partnership for developing wholesale markets. One reason why the reforms did not pay off for Bihar is the lack of enabling policies. The state needed to have incentive mechanisms, such as tax concessions, to attract private investment in the creation of agricultural markets, cold storage and warehousing facilities, economists said. The withdrawal of the government has meant that there is no assured floor price in the form of MSP. “Farmers are left to the mercy of traders who unscrupulously fix a lower price for agricultural produce that they buy. Inadequate market facilities and institutional arrangements are responsible for low price realisation and instability in prices,” the NCAER study has noted. The latest countrywide farm reforms, therefore, are no silver bullet. “The expectation with these reforms is, once you allow markets to determine both production and prices and what to produce, it will help farmers with better price discovery. That’s the assumption,” said NR Bhanumurthy, the vice-chancellor of the Bengaluru BR Ambedkar School of Economics. Bhanumurthy said the opening up of state-run APMC markets to private competition alone won’t work if it is not accompanied by other factors, such as an efficient crop insurance, expansion of food processing, storage infrastructure and better market information systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reforms-alone-can-t-raise-farm-growth-bihar-example-shows/story-MpXftOn8Jbq7mw7dkJyOrN.html

The World Food Programme (WFP) was honoured for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict. The Rome-based organisation has been feeding people in some of the world’s most dangerous and precarious places, with the coronavirus pandemic seen pushing millions more into hunger.“Through its actions to address poverty, hunger and malnutrition, whether they arise due to conflict or natural disasters, the WFP is bringing help to the most vulnerable and needy. It brings peace and comfort where often there is only desperation,” the Dalai Lama said.“The Nobel Committee’s honouring of WFP is also a reminder to all of us of our responsibility to do what we can to narrow the gap between rich and poor,” he said. He also expressed his gratitude to members of the WFP for their tremendous humanitarian work.“As the current global health crisis reminds us, threats to the whole human family have to be addressed by us all, since we all want to be happy and free from suffering. “Hunger and poverty can only be eliminated on the basis of international cooperation. As a firm believer in the oneness of humanity, it is my fervent hope that the award of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Programme will inspire an intensification of efforts to ensure that nobody is left to die of hunger anywhere,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wfp-s-nobel-win-reminder-of-everyone-s-responsibility-to-narrow-gap-between-rich-and-poor-dalai-lama/story-UsSpBggCBCNZHAatVa6qJO.html

He said the “third dimension” threats like drones may take precedence in the near future and the Army needs to plan for them now. “Both hard kill and soft kill counter-drone solutions, including swarm technology, are the need of the hour,” Saini noted. He was addressing the webinar titled “Force Protection India 2020” during which various issues pertaining to requirements for armed forces’ protection were discussed. “Among other threats, drones and UAVs stand out in their innovative employment and destructive potential,” Saini mentioned. He said a large number of the Army’s troops are deployed in extremely high altitude areas where the temperature touches -50 degrees celsius but India is still importing cold-weather clothing and equipment for them due to “lack of viable indigenous solutions”. “A collaborative effort needs to be put in this field to fulfil our vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he added. Saini said the Indian Army has evolved considerably in terms of modern arms, ammunition, protection, kitting and clothing but there is still much scope for innovation. “There is a requirement to focus on night-vision goggles, combat helmets, bulletproof jackets, light portable communication sets and many more,” he added. The Army vice chief said the threat from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is here to stay as it seems to be gaining traction as a favoured tool among terrorists and anti-national elements. “The threat (from the IEDs) is sophisticated and can be used while avoiding direct contact. It ends up causing both physical and psychological trauma and seriously impairs own readiness, by forcing us to commit scarce resources for our own protection,” he stated. Technological innovation is key to combating the threat from the IEDs, Saini said. “A combination of robotics, artificial intelligence and big data analysis could provide a possible answer,” he added. Security of defence establishments and vital installations across the country is another key area where the Army has focused its efforts in the past few years, as these present lucrative and high profile targets, he said. “Though the industry has stepped up to the challenge (of providing security to defence establishments), the solutions provided, however, lack innovation and integration,” Saini mentioned. He added that the effort in this field must be to ensure a reduction in manpower commitment by integrating physical and electronic surveillance and incorporating automation and innovation in perimeter fencing, intrusion detection systems, etc. Saini said the Army’s deployment footprint extends across the length and breadth of the country and across varying terrains and the sheer magnitude of its requirements presents a golden opportunity to the industry, scientists and entrepreneurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-stand-out-among-other-threats-in-their-destructive-potential-army-vice-chief/story-Mcqm42NlTGvCc3wjQGOiWJ.html

Punishment will be given to officials who fail to file an FIR in relation to cognizable offences, it further said.Also Read: Hathras crime scene to be recreated to find ‘missing links’; victim’s kin to be presentIn case of statement, written or verbal, made by the person related to the person’s cause of death, the government ordered state authorities to take it as “relevant fact.”It further remineded Supreme Court’s January 7 verdict in Purshottam Chopra vs State case, in which the apex court had said that dying declaration that sastisfies all judicial scruitny cannot be discarded merely because it was not recorded by a Magistarte or it lacked police officer’s attastation.“However, even with stringent provisions in law and several capacity building measures undertaken, any failure of police to adhere to these mandatory requirements may not augur well for the delivery of criminal justice in the country, especially in the context of women safety,” it said.The advisory comes ahead of the Monday hearing of the lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on the 19-year-old’s alleged rape and her rushed cremation at night. The Supreme Court too is hearing a petition on the woman’s death. At a hearing last week, a bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde described the alleged gang-rape and murder of the Dalit woman as a “horrible” and “extraordinary” incident.

10-10-2020||India||Combination of antiviral drugs shows ‘no superior outcome’ for Covid treatment: Firm||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on Friday announced that a combination of antiviral drugs Umifenovir and Favipiravir did not show any superior outcome in treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients hospitalised with moderate symptoms during clinical trials.“…this combination study was yet another effort on our part to examine new treatment options to combat the health crisis. These latest findings confirm that the addition of Umifenovir does not show any incremental benefit in clinical outcomes. Thus Favipiravir therapy along with supportive care remains a suitable and effective choice for mild to moderate Covid-19 infection,” said Monika Tandon, senior vice president and head, clinical development, global specialty, branded portfolio, Glenmark.Also Read: Top five countries with highest number of Covid-19 infectionsIn May, the company had received approval from India’s drug regulator, the drugs controller general of India (DCGI), to conduct phase 3 clinical trials in the country using a combination of antiviral drugs Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a potential Covid-19 treatment strategy. The successful Favipiravir monotherapy trial earlier this year had led the company to receive ‘Emergency Use Authorisation’ for Favipiravir to treat Covid-19 patients.The two antiviral drugs work differently. While Favipiravir is known to inhibit virus replication, thus killing the virus, Umifenovir does not allow the virus to enter the cell as it impedes the viral attachment to cells, therefore acting as a viral entry inhibitor, making it an ideal combination for effective tackling of high viral loads in patients during early stage of disease.“This second study, titled the FAITH trial, evaluated the possible superiority of the combination’s efficacy against Favipiravir monotherapy. As per the results that Glenmark today presented to the regulator, the study showed no superior clinical outcomes with the addition of Umifenovir,” said the company in a statement.Also Read: Active cases in India fall to nearly 13% of total Covid-19 caseload: How it happenedThe FAITH study enrolled a total of 158 hospitalised patients with moderate symptoms of Covid-19 in India.The study’s primary end point (clinical outcome measured) was the time taken from randomisation to clinical cure, defined as the resolution of baseline clinical signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection and at least a 2-point improvement on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement, within a time frame of 28 days.“Median time to clinical cure improved by only 1 day (7 as compared to 8) in patients who received the two antiviral combination, which was not statistically significant and did not justify adding two antiviral agents,” the statement further read.Favipiravir is an oral antiviral drug approved in Japan since 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections. Umifenovir is another oral antiviral drug licensed for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B infections in Russia and China. Additionally it exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system and induces interferon production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/combination-of-antiviral-drugs-shows-no-superior-outcome-for-covid-treatment-firm/story-CS4ySHTJj37EhPZoKKP7jJ.html

The prototype is expected to achieve a height of 26000 feet and endurance of 18 hours by 2020 end.Rustom-2 is capable of carrying different combinations of payloads depending on the mission objectives including synthetic aperture radar, electronic intelligence systems and situational awareness systems. It has a satellite communication link to relay situation in the battle theatre on real time basis. “ The Rustom-2 had one hour of fuel left after eight hours of test flying at Challakere aeronautical test range in Chitradurga district of Karanataka and had achieved the test flight ceiling,” said a senior official.Also Read: India test-fires Rudram 1, its first anti-radiation missile to kill enemy radarsWhile the DRDO expects Rustom-2 surveillance drone to match the specifications of the Israeli Heron unmanned aerial vehicle used by the Indian Air Force and Navy, it has revitalized its drone program with a new mission head and objectives. The push to Rustom-2 program was given after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) tried to occupy Indian territory in Ladakh on the basis of a 1959 cartographical claim on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The PLA has Wing Loong II armed drones in its arsenal and has even given four of them to Pakistan to protect the CPEC corridor and Gwadar port.Although the Rustom-2 will have to undergo test and user trials before inducted in the Indian military, the Ministry of Defence is currently negotiating with Israeli Aerospace Industry (IAI) to not only upgrade the existing fleet of Heron drone but also arm them with air to surface missile and laser guided bombs.According to South Block officials, the technical upgradation and arming of Heron drone is at contract negotiating committee level after being cleared by the Defence Acquisition Committee (DAC). The project will be cleared at the level of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS).Also Read: PLA at its doors, India looks at new security rule to punch Chinese firmsThe Heron upgrade involves installing a satellite communication link so that there is no time gap in relaying situation on ground as well as installing hard points on the wings for missiles and laser guided bombs. While the Israelis have kept their armed drone program under cover, the Heron has a proven weaponized version.Besides, India has also decided to go in for American MQ 9B armed drone instead of Sea Guardian surveillance drone with cost and numbers being worked out. Clearly, the future belongs to stand-off weapons and India this time will not miss the bus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-s-rustom-2-drone-flight-tested-india-goes-for-armed-heron-uavs/story-CZ5jd9tRo6Ph2jcq2HOpmM.html
10-10-2020||India||TRP manipulation case: What has happened so far||Several television news channels were accused of tampering with television rating points (TRPs) by the Mumbai Police on Thursday. The police claimed they busted a TRP manipulation racket following a probe initiated after a complaint by TV viewership measurement agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC).“Republic TV and two other local Mumbai channels have been found guilty of manipulating the crucial data,” said Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.TRP, a tool to judge which TV programmes are viewed the most, indicates the popularity of a particular channel.Here is a look at all that has happened in the case:• Rating agency Hansa Services Private Limited, a contractor of BARC, which functions under Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) filed a complaint with the Mumbai police, alleging that some TV channels were manipulating their TRPs.• The complainant firm said that the manipulated TRP ratings resulted in miscalculated targeted audience for the advertisers, which in turn resulted into losses of hundreds of crores of rupees because of the manipulated statistics of TRP.• Two TV channel owners were arrested by the Mumbai police and directors promoters of the third channel - Republic TV - were investigated. • Chief financial officer (CFO) of Republic TV, Shiva Sundaram, the founder, chairman and managing director of Madison World, Sam Balsara, and the CEO of IPG Mediabrands, Shashi Sinha were called by the police for questioning in the case on Friday. Sinha and Balsara, both top media planners and buyers, have likely been called as experts.• A former executive for Hansa Research, responsible for running BARC’s audience measurement service, was arrested on Thursday, police said. Rs 20 lakh were recovered from his residence. Three others, including two owners of small local channels, were also arrested.• Upon interrogation, the arrested revealed that they were paid by certain channels to distribute Rs 400 to Rs 500 for per month to households for keeping their channels on throughout the day.• “People not familiar with English were also found staring at the television sets with the English channels on,” the Mumbai police commissioner said.• Republic TV has, however, issued a statement saying, “Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh has made false allegations against Republic TV because we questioned him in the Sushant Singh Rajput case investigation.” Owner Arnab Goswami also said he will take legal action against Singh.• It also showed on its channel a copy of the FIR that names India Today TV and not Republic TV. According to the channel, it was being targeted for its pursuit of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-manipulation-case-what-has-happened-so-far/story-mHPvLCRd6SfAa38SuAc8KM.html
10-10-2020||India||‘Not possible to extend loan moratorium period, may vitiate overall credit discipline’: RBI to Supreme Court||The country’s banking regulator - Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - has filed fresh affidavit in the Supreme Court in the loan moratorium case.In the affidavit, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that it is not possible to give more relief to sector affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The banking regulator has also said that it is not possible to extend the moratorium period beyond six months.The RBI said that a long moratorium exceeding six months “may result in vitiating the overall credit discipline which will have a debilitating impact on the process of credit creation in the economy”. The RBI further said that the move can “increase the risks of delinquencies post resumption of scheduled payments” and “exacerbate the repayment pressures for the borrowers”.On Monday, the top court had told the government that its response did not contain “necessary details” and asked the Centre and the RBI to place on record the K V Kamath committee recommendations on debt restructuring in view of Covid-19 related stress on various sectors as well as the notifications and circulars issued so far on loan moratorium.The apex court’s direction came after the finance ministry filed an affidavit on October 2 saying that it has decided to waive compound interest (interest on interest) charged on loans of up to Rs two crore for a six-month moratorium period announced due to the pandemic from individual borrowers as well as medium and small industries.On a plea by various other sectors like real estate, the government told the Supreme Court that it is not possible to give additional relief apart from what has already been announced.On sector-specific reliefs, RBI said, real estate and power sectors were already stressed prior to the pandemic on account of various other factors. It said that “travails of real sector cannot be solved through banking regulations” as the banking regulations of RBI cannot substitute the redressal of structural problems of the real sector.Even on the demand by certain petitioners seeking resolution of their loans overdue beyond 30 days as on March 1, 2020, the RBI said, “An account which was impacted by pandemic as well as had a pre-existing 10 financial has a different risk profile as compared to an account without pre-existing stress and to treat both borrowers on equal footing would be gross suspension of economic sensibilities.”The other major issue raised by various petitioners against the moratorium circulars was that these are not automatically available to all borrowers but contingent on the discretion of the lenders. The RBI said, “In this context, it is submitted that the Reserve Bank has only provided an enabling mechanism for the lenders to permit the moratorium, without the same being treated as restructuring of the terms of the loan contract for regulatory purposes.”The RBI’s response came after the Supreme Court asked the government to consider giving relief to other classes of borrowers. The court is expected to deal with these issues next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-possible-to-extend-loan-moratorium-period-may-vitiate-overall-credit-discipline-rbi-to-supreme-court/story-odkisgZL95R5G4zrtG8NIM.html

10-10-2020||India||The economic arguments in favour of the three farm bills: All you need to know||Last week, the President of India gave his ascent to the three farm bills, namely, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 (FPTC), the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 (FAPAFS), and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The opposition and farmers’ organisations continue to protest against these laws. While politics will take its own course, it is useful to examine the economic rationale of the arguments being given to justify these bills. The arguments, broadly speaking, are twofold. One, the bills give greater freedom to farmers to sell their produce. They will abolish intermediaries, or at least some levels of intermediaries between farmers and buyers. This will ensure that the farmer gets a bigger share of the price paid by the consumer and will, therefore, improve agricultural incomes. Two, the clamour for incorporating Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) into the law is a pursuit of vested interests as only a handful of farmers enjoy the benefits of MSP-based procurement in the country today. The agricultural practices in Green Revolution regions of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, where MSP was the cornerstone, have prevented reforms and these changes will lead to a creative destruction in agriculture.Unfair exchange is not the basic reason for predicament of Indian farmers The argument that these bills will remove intermediaries, and therefore make farmers well-off, assumes that an unfair exchange is the biggest problem facing India’s farmers. But Inflation data shows that retail and wholesale prices for important food items, cereals, pulses, vegetables and fruits, move in tandem. This means farmgate prices are not completely divorced from the prices prevailing in retail markets, and intermediaries do pass on profits or losses in food markets to farmers. What could be a bigger problem for farmers is the large volatility in prices of crops such as pulses and vegetables. Cereals, where the MSP regime is in place for rice and wheat (over one-third of the total rice and wheat production is procured by the government), face the lowest price volatility. This is exactly why farmers keep demanding MSP-based procurement for all crops. The main reason for the agrarian crisis is that agriculture employs far too many people to be remunerative. At least 40% of India’s workforce is employed in agriculture, even though it generates less than 15% of the country’s GDP. The current set of reforms does nothing to address this basic income-employment asymmetry in agriculture.  That Indian agriculture, including the green revolution states, have a lot of inefficiencies is well known. Some of these inefficiencies, such as overexploitation of groundwater, have emerged as a serious threat to sustainability of farming itself. MSP-based procurement of rice in states like Punjab has contributed to the sustainability crisis of agriculture. But there is more to this. Agriculture is essentially an unviable exercise in India Farming, even at MSP prices has not been always viable in India. The government claims that MSPs provide a guaranteed return of at least 50% over the cost of production for farmers. The cost measure used by the government to calculate this mark-up is A2+FL. It includes the cost incurred on hired labour, imputed family labour, seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, irrigation charges, interest on working capital, land revenue, depreciation on farm buildings and implements and rent paid for leased-in land. Farmers’ organisations have been demanding for a long time that MSPs should provide a 50% return over the C2 measure of cost, which includes rental value of own land and interest on fixed capital in addition. Logically speaking, C2 includes the opportunity cost of being in farming. A farmer could choose to rent his land and utilise his fixed capital for other income instead of using it for farming. A comparison of MSPs for rice and wheat with these two cost measures shows that they do not cover the entire C2. Since cost measures are released with a time lag, this comparison cannot be made for recent years. The natural question to ask his why do farmers still continue farming even if the best-case scenario—procurement over MSP—is not remunerative enough? This otherwise counter-intuitive question of why seemingly unviable economic activities continue is a recurring theme in political economy. It is not necessary that the cost heads for imputed family labour or rental value of land are actually paid out by the farmer during the production process. While such a squeeze might keep farming economically viable in terms of actual payables and receivables, it does entail the farmer embracing poverty of sorts. While most people associate poverty lines with predefined income levels, such as the popular $1/day poverty line of the World Bank, classical political economists have other views. A 2011 World Bank blog by Martin Ravallion quotes Adam Smith’s concept of relative poverty from the Wealth of Nations. “A linen shirt … is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct.”, Smith wrote. It is not very difficult to envisage farmers not being able to afford goods and services, which are seen essential for leading a dignified life in today’s age and age. Government policy has not helped There are two ways to improve farm incomes—either increase yields, or prices. Both of these face policy apathy. India lags behind countries such as the US and China in terms of yields even for cereals. This gap has been increasing overtime. Yet, India spends much less on agricultural research and development than China. According to data from the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), spending on agricultural research in China was 0.62% of its value added in agriculture, while this number was just 0.3% for India. These numbers are for 2013, the latest period for which data is available in the FAO database. The numbers are unlikely to have changed for India. The total expenditure (revised estimates) of Department of Research and Education under Ministry of Agriculture was 0.24% of the value added in agriculture. Policy intervention on prices often takes the shape of depriving farmers of any windfall gains from higher prices, while no support is available when prices crash. Even MSPs for rice and wheat have been growing at a slower pace in the past few years. The way forward The future of Indian agriculture cannot be salvaged by simply allowing greater freedom to farmers. Agriculture can have a better future only when the excess workforce employed in farming moves to the non-farm sector and there is a greater demand for agricultural products as incomes increase. Because the majority of Indians cannot even afford a decent food basket, many commentators have reached a wrong conclusion that Indian agriculture is facing a problem of plenty. Also, India’s policymakers need to realise that agriculture is heavily supported by governments in most countries. As has been pointed out by Ashok Gulati in an Indian Express article published on September 28, producer support to farming in India as a share of total farm receipts is negative, something which goes against the stereotype of agriculture being heavily subsidised. Promises of future gains from deregulation can hardly be a substitute for budgetary support for Indian farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-economic-arguments-in-favour-of-the-three-farm-bills-all-you-need-to-know/story-o83I0wXRIqKATqspyQ9VqO.html

It comprises merely 12.94 per cent of the total caseload, the ministry said on Friday.The declining trend of the percentage of active cases is commensurately supported by the rising percentage of recovered cases. Recoveries in India have exceeded new cases for three continuous weeks, it said.The country had 8.97 lakh active cases on September 9, the ministry said.A total of 59,06,069 people have recovered from Covid-19 in the country so far and recoveries exceed active cases of infection by 50,12,477, it further said.This is the result of collaborative action by states and union territories under the Centre’s strategy of comprehensive testing, tracking, quick hospitalisation and adherence to the standard treatment protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across public and private hospitals and for home isolation cases.The higher number of recoveries has aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 85.52 per cent, according to the health ministry.Meanwhile, with a spike of 70,496 new cases and 964 fatalities, India’s Covid-19 count reached 69,06,152 on Friday.Maharashtra continues to be the worst-affected state as it reported 12,134 new cases of the infection and 302 deaths. The total cases in the state rose to 15,06,018, according to health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-cases-in-india-fall-to-nearly-13-of-total-covid-19-caseload-how-it-happened/story-cttNgpqlft1LK3qKonpCrO.html
10-10-2020||India||He worked to pay off his debts, says kin of migrant worker who died due to Covid-19||A few hours before Prafulla Behera succumbed to Covid-19 infection in the quarantine centre of Ganjam’s Dhunkapada gram panchayat, he had spoken to his wife, Rita, complaining to her of sustained nausea and fever. The 39-year-old who hailed from Madhipali village had been employed in a spinning mill in the textile manufacturing hub of Surat, Gujarat since he was 14.Earlier this year, he was one among the thousands of migrant workers who returned to the home state of Odisha from Surat. On May 6, Behera was housed in a quarantine centre, as per the protocol that many states were following with respect to the returnees. If no symptoms appeared in 28 days, he would have been able to go home.“On May 8 afternoon, he was about to have his lunch at the quarantine centre when he spoke to me complaining of difficulties in breathing. He never had diabetes or any other health issues. He said he was not feeling well at all since the morning but would try to eat lunch. After a meal, he was going to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance for fever and breathlessness. But before he could eat his lunch, he died,” said Rita (30).Behera was the first migrant worker in Odisha to succumb to Covid-19. The officials at the quarantine centre refused to hand over his body to the family as he had yet to be tested for Covid-19. Two days later, his body was cremated by the local officials after his result was positive. His family could not attend the cremation.Rita and her three daughters — Sonali (12), Rupali (9), Asha(5) — are unable to come to terms with the loss of Behera. Her youngest daughter Payal turns one next month.“Though his factory had shut down in April, he used to tell me things would be back to normal and he would start working soon. He had last come home when Payal was born in November last year. He was planning to come home this November. Soon after he arrived, he was taken to the quarantine centre,” Rita said. She was not allowed to meet her husband after he had returned to Ganjam in a Shramik Special train.Rita is uneducated and has no income; the couple did not have much saved up. The administration provided ₹12000 cash assistance after Behera’s death.“He did not even have a bank account of his own. We had four daughters while trying to get a son. All the money he earned went into repaying the loans we took to build our house and for the marriage of his sisters. He became debt-free a month before his death. When he was working in Surat, he used to send to us money through people from our village. The only bank account we have in our home is in the name of my second daughter opened by the ASHA worker when she was born,” said Rita.“My only regret is that he could have been saved had they taken him to the hospital on time,” Behera’s older brother, Pravin, a migrant worker in Maharashtra, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/he-worked-to-pay-off-his-debts-says-kin-of-migrant-worker-who-died-due-to-covid-19/story-cFnmlBzJxGa2YwMW9u4FRP.html

The new rule, which will apply to all special trains being run, comes into effect from October 10.The pre-Covid system of preparing the second reservation chart 30 minutes before the departure of the train, which was not being followed for the last few months, has been restored by the railways. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, time of preparation of the second reservation chart was shifted to two hours before the scheduled time of train departure.The first chart is prepared at least four hours before the scheduled departure of the train. “As per request of Zonal Railways for ensuring convenience of rail passengers, the matter has been examined and it has been decided that the second reservation chart shall be prepared at least 30 minutes before scheduled/rescheduled time of departure of train,” a statement issued by the Indian Railways said.“Accordingly, ticket booking facility, both online and on PRS ticket counters, shall be available, before preparation of second chart. CRIS will make necessary modifications in the software accordingly so as to restore this provision with effect from October 10,” it added.All passenger trains services were suspended due to the imposition of the nationwide lockdown from March 25, but the railways has resumed services in a staggered manner from May 1.Recently, zones got approval for 39 new special trains. “These services will be introduced as special services from an early convenient date,” said the Ministry of Railways. This announcement was made a week after railway board chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav said that Indian Railways plans to run more than 200 trains during the festive season between October 15 and November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/booking-cancellation-of-rail-tickets-allowed-till-5-minutes-before-departure-from-today/story-mvDtEHViPVJkbrn4cFe7kN.html

The defence ministry referred the matter in September 2020 to the chief labour commissioner, ministry of labour and employment to initiate conciliation in the matter.The decision of the federations to go on a strike was widely criticised as the Indian military is locked in a border dispute with China in the Ladakh. The OFB controls 41 ordnance factories engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.“It was agreed by the representatives of the federations and officials of the ministry of defence that, during the pendency of on-going conciliation proceedings, the ministry will abide by the provisions of Section 33(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 which stipulates that the employer cannot alter the conditions of service of the employees till the conclusion of conciliation proceedings. However, it will not affect government’s decision to corporatise OFB,” the spokesperson said.The government last month announced the setting up of an empowered group of ministers (EGoM) under defence minister Rajnath Singh to oversee the corporatisation of the OFB, which is expected to be completed in a one-year timeframe.The EGoM will oversee and guide the board’s corporatisation with the process covering transition support and the redeployment plan of workforce while safeguarding their wages and retirement benefits. The workforce of the factories controlled by the board stands at more than 80,000 people who are against the corporatisation move. The government has asked various unions and associations of the OFB to convey their suggestions and concerns about the move to the EGoM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ofb-workers-bodies-call-off-upcoming-nationwide-strike/story-8bOYZbfoJ6LV0W4zlUNdyL.html

Edited excerpts:In March 2019, you made a strong speech against the BJP. You were also given three seats to contest the Lok Sabha polls by the Mahagathbandhan. What led to the change of heart? In 2014, when I returned to Bihar from Mumbai, where I had gone to work as an 18-year-old, I came back for [Narendra] Modi ji. I worked closely with Amit Shah, who was the party president and campaigned hard for the BJP because I had faith in Modi ji. Read HT’s full coverage on Bihar Assembly elections here. I ran a social organisation then, and campaigned for the NDA in the 2014 and 2015 Bihar polls. But then I had concerns that community, the Nishads, were not being given the benefit of reservation, so I quit. Also read | ‘From chappal to chapatti roller’: Bihar polls and surprising party symbolsIn 2018, I formed a political party and aligned with the NDA. But a political party’s work is to contest elections, and since I could not join the NDA, I went with the Mahagathbandhan. Even though I was not completely happy with the decision, I went with the flow. I was assured by Tejashwi Yadav that we will be given 25 seats to contest in the Bihar assembly polls, and the deputy chief minister’s post. At the last minute, he announced that the VIP party will get only two seats. It was then that I decided to walk out of the Mahagathbandhan. Tejashwi stabbed me in the back, and Amit Shah offered me a balm, so I went back to NDA. So the only reason you walked out was Tejashwi not keeping his word ? Tejashwi got the party as inheritance. His father Lalu Prasad is a big leader, but he lacks experience and he lacks discipline. And despite their Lok Sabha performance, we stayed with them and helped them, even when other old allies left. Our party has a vote bank of about 14% to 15% among the most backward communities. But he had different ideas; after reneging on his promise, he thought we will branch out on our own and benefit the RJD by cutting into the vote share of the NDA.

I have worked closely with Amit Shah during the 2015 election, he supports me in my work. I am thankful to the PM, to party president JP Nadda, and to the home minister who took me back and offered me 11 seats as against the two that the Mahagathbandhan offered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-stabbed-me-in-the-back-shah-offered-me-a-balm-vip-chief-mukesh-sahni/story-SIv0fnwcWKUqYsKHiMrktN.html

A video of the incident went viral on social media. In his dying testimony, the priest named six people for setting him on fire, the police said. They added that three acres of land is under the temple’s ownership but Meena wanted to encroach some of it.“We registered a case for attempt to murder against five people; now the charge will be converted to that of murder,” Karauli superintendent of police Mridul Kachawa said.On Friday, the death of the priest escalated into a political row. State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Satish Poonia announced the formation of a three-member fact-finding committee. Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra, national secretary Alka Gurjar and former general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha Jitendra Meena are part of the panel.Rajya Sabha MP Kirodi Lal Meena said in a tweet that the incident was an example of the poor law and order situation in the state.Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje said in a tweet that the killing could not be condemned enough. “We cannot express enough grief over it,” she said.Brahmin organisations gave a memorandum to chief minister Ashok Gehlot through the district administration to demand immediate arrest of the accused and a government job to one member of the family of the priest.Gehlot wrote on Twitter: “The murder of Babulal Vaishnav in Sapotara, Karauli, is extremely unfortunate and condemnable; civil society has no place for such acts. The state government is with the bereaved family in this sad time. The main accused has been arrested and action continues. The culprits shall not be spared.” The Congress party’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi said: “I have spoken to the DGP; family will be provided security and their demands will be discussed.” He said he would write a letter to the chief minister to demand strict action against land encroachers.Vaishnav’s family brought the body to the village for cremation on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-dies-after-house-set-afire-over-land-row/story-mShfSatwQPp28XIsGrm2kN.html
10-10-2020||India||Killed 25 ‘traitors’ in Bastar, Maoists claim in statement||Maoists have killed 25 tribal people in Chhattisgarh’s insurgency-hit Bijapur district for allegedly being part of a covert police operation and acting as police informers, a leader of the banned group said in a statement confirmed by police officials, who said some of the killings may have been carried out in the last week of September.Bastar police inspector general P Sundar Raj said on Friday the killings showed the frustration of the insurgents as anti-Maoist sentiment was building up in the tribal areas and their movement was nearing an end. “They have lost the public support due to their own misdeeds and their leadership is now totally clueless and directionless,” he said. In a statement sent to the media on Thursday and reviewed by HT, a spokesperson for the Maoists, identified only as Vikalp, called the 25 tribal people “traitors” and said that a “people’s court” punished them after obtaining “clear evidence” in Bijapur’s Gangaluru area. He added that those killed by the insurgents included 12 secret agents, five covert operatives and eight police informers.The statement did not specify exactly when or how the killings were carried out. However, police in Telangana’s Bhadradri Kothagudem district bordering Chhattisgarh said they received intelligence inputs that the Maoists killed 16 villagers in the last week of September. The Maoists also abducted a few other villagers and took them into the forests of Bijapur and may have killed them later, said a Telangana police official who did not wish to be identified.Vikalp said one of the secret agents working for the police turned out to be senior Maoist leader Vijja. “Our inquiries revealed that Vijja had been acting as a police agent for the last two years and was entrusted with the responsibility of harming the central committee of the Maoist party. He had provided crucial information about the party meetings to the police four times,” he said.Last week, Modium Vijja alias Bhadru, 39 — allegedly responsible for the killing of civilians in Bijapur — was shot dead by his own subordinates, police had said. Vijja was wanted by the police and carried a cash reward of ₹800,000 for his capture.The recent killings by Maoists have raised concerns among police officials in the region. “Maoists want to create an environment of fear among villagers which can help them increase recruitment,” an IPS officer posted in one of seven districts of Bastar region had told HT last month when reports of a spike in killings emerged. The Maoist statement also referred to the central government’s ‘Operation Samadhan’ that was launched in 2017 to completely eliminate insurgency in the region by 2022, and claimed that the police had opened bank accounts for the slain tribal people who were helping the Indian authorities.(With inputs from Ritesh Mishra in Raipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/killed-25-traitors-in-bastar-maoists-claim-in-statement/story-8VN7Q2p6ihmgHdsseIvRiK.html
10-10-2020||India||NDA’s Cabinet has no non-BJP minister now||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is India’s largest political grouping on paper, but with the demise of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Thursday and the Shiromani Akali Dal’s exit from it last month, all berths in the Union Cabinet are occupied by the Bharatiya Janata Party. There is only one non-BJP minister in the entire 51-member strong union council of ministers: Republican Part of India (Athawale) chief Ramdas Athawle (the minister of state for social justice and empowerment).This is the first time since 1977 that a coalition government at the Centre has all Cabinet ministers from one party.The BJP-led pan-India alliance of 24 political parties gave three slots in the Cabinet to allies when it returned with a thumping majority in 2019. Anant Geete from Shiv Sena was named heavy industries minister, Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal was food processing minister, and Ramvilas Paswan had the consumer affairs, food and public distribution portfolio. Also read | Ram Vilas Paswan: A man who bridged political divisionsLast year, Geete resigned from the Cabinet after the Shiv Sena dumped the BJP to go with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party to form the Maharashtra government. Last month, an angry Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the NDA protesting the three new farm laws. And Lok Janshakti Party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan died after prolonged illness on Thursday.Nitish Kumar’s JD (U), which returned to the NDA fold after a brief separation in 2014, and which, with 15 MPs, is the second biggest constituent of the alliance after the BJP, decided to stay out of the Cabinet or the council of ministers after it realised that it would not get the two Cabinet posts it wanted. The BJP won 303 seats of the NDA’s 343 in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The BJP’s national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the party “has always respected its allies and their valuable contribution cannot be undermined”. “The NDA and the BJP are driven by national interest, which at times is in variance with local politics that drives the regional parties. Shiv Sena parted ways even though they contested elections with us in Maharashtra. In Bihar, we have sacrificed on many occasions and have given a lion’s share to our ally, the JD(U). We will always respect the views of our allies but not at the cost of compromising national interest,” he said.Also read | Bihar assembly election: With Ram Vilas no more, test for Chirag to consolidate LJPIn the first Narendra Modi government (2014-19), five of the BJP’s alliance partners were inducted in the council of ministers with Paswan, Geete and Badal in the Cabinet. The BJP won 282 seats of the NDA’s 336 in that election. The year 2014 was the first time a party had a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha since 1984. Rahul Verma, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said the composition of the Cabinet today reflects the changing nature of the NDA. “The BJP leadership believes that smaller allies have reaped the benefits of Modi’s popularity but haven’t been able to mobilise their own votes. So the BJP is sidelining them in ministerial appointments, decision-making, which then creates deeper insecurity among these smaller parties.” He also said that the Cabinet also only had a handful of mass leaders, who could be even considered pan-state or pan-community leaders. Modi’s predecessor, Dr Manmohan Singh, who was the first non-Nehru-Gandhi Prime Minister to complete two successive terms, also saw a similar loss of allies. After his first term (2004 to 2009) , Paswan and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Yadav left the alliance due to disputes over seat distribution in Bihar for the national election. In the second term, Singh took more hits as the DMK and the Trinamool Congress quit the United Progressive Alliance. The Congress was left with Sharad Pawar’s NCP, its staunch ally, towards the end of its term. The vacancies in the Union council of ministers have triggered speculations about the first Cabinet reshuffle of second Modi government. The entry of JD(U) in the union council of ministers is overdue, and Chirag Paswan might be considered for a portfolio after his father’s demise, though there may be some hiccups because his party has not aligned with the NDA for the upcoming Bihar polls. Also read: Union minister Harsimrat Kaur resigns, BJP runs into trouble with old ally“The BJP has a transactional understanding of coalition politics; no programmatic agreement, no ideological basis, only whether the relationship is profitable or not. They think allies are needed, or join a coalition only if either has to gain something — if the BJP’s winnability is high, allies will come; and if low, they will not. Since 2014, the NDA has existed in name only,” said political commentator Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-s-cabinet-has-no-non-bjp-minister-now/story-wNmW7u8054JaMPt0yFVhzH.html
10-10-2020||India||Media ethics, web safety on parliamentary panel’s radar||A committee of Indian Parliament will, for the first time, debate on issues such as ethical standards in media coverage and preventing the misuse of social media platforms, both pertinent but controversial themes with the government and the Opposition believing that they are at the receiving end of lapses in the two areas.If nothing, the topics suggest that proceedings of the Standing Committee on Information Technology led by the Congress’s Shashi Tharoor will prove interesting and fractious.The panel has listed a total of 21 subjects for review in this financial year after its reconstitution last month: ethical standards in media coverage; safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms including special emphasis on women security in the digital space; review of the cybersecurity scenario in India; and a review of the functioning and outreach of Doordarshan channels, among other topics. Standing committees are multi-party panels of Parliament constituted every year to review functioning and issues related to various ministries. While their reports are not binding upon the government, they provide key inputs to policymakers and ensure parliamentary oversight of important areas.The topic on ethical standards in media coverage comes at a time when there has been some criticism of media coverage — particularly news channels, for its reporting of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case — and when a programme aired on Sudarshan TV was barred by the Supreme Court after it found its content objectionable to Muslims.On Thursday, while hearing a petition seeking action against TV channels for allegedly disseminating fake news about the Tablighi Jamaat, which became a Covid-19 hot spot in late March, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde remarked: “Freedom of speech is one of the most abused freedoms of recent times.”The topic also comes up at a time when government believes that there are false narratives against it and the Opposition believes that the government gets far more positive press than it deserves. Earlier this week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has “captured” several institutions, including the media, and contended: “If the press and institutions are free, this government will not last for long.” Some of these issues, however, might trigger political divisions in the panel that is no stranger to furious disputes and partisan arguments. Last year, this panel even resorted to voting to decide if it could discuss the WhatsApp snooping case. This year, panel chairman Shashi Tharoor faced the BJP’s ire after he had announced that Facebook would be summoned to depose after The Wall Street Journal reported how Ankhi Das, Facebook’s top lobbyist in India, told colleagues that action against politicians from Modi’s party would damage the company’s business prospects. The BJP leaders took objection to Tharoor’s announcement and linked it to the Congress party’s stand on the issue. The rift widened to such an extent that BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, a member of the panel, wrote to Speaker Om Birla asking for Tharoor’s removal as chairman. That wasn’t to be, and when the panel was reconstituted, Tharoor was still its head.Most importantly, the panel will also seek to have oversight on issues related to citizens’ data security and privacy.Former parliamentary affairs secretary Afzal Amanullah said: “The Standing Committee on IT is an appropriate forum to discuss the ethical issues about media, and privacy issues especially in the context of women. People are extremely concerned about the way some media and social media have been used for vilification of women and propagation of a certain kind of news.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-ethics-web-safety-on-panel-s-radar/story-GmpATN9hW378UV5FHJZYmN.html
10-10-2020||India||Other states not doing enough to cut air pollution, says Delhi govt||Environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday said even though the AAP government is going all out to lead the battle against bad air quality, the neighbouring states are not doing enough despite contributing to air pollution every winter in a major way, and at a time when the situation is becoming dangerous amid the Covid pandemic. Rai’s comments came even as instances of crop stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab are rising, and smoke from the fields is travelling to the city, adding to its pollution load. The air quality index (AQI) in the capital touched the poor category for the first time this season on Wednesday. On Friday, Delhi’s air quality remained in the “poor category” for the third day with the AQI recorded at 202, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4 pm bulletin . A day before, the AQI was 208. The index enters the ‘poor zone’ between 201 and 300 . “The neighbouring states have not been taking stringent action against stubble burning, which is on the rise even this year when the situation is becoming more dangerous with the Covid-19 pandemic,” Rai said, adding all that Delhi government wants is cooperation from the states because they have to come together to fight pollution. He said the Delhi government has been repeatedly requesting the Centre and the states to curb stubble burning by adopting the bio-decomposer technology developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, which Delhi is already experimenting. “The decomposer can be an effective solution to stubble burning for both Haryana and Punjab and will help Delhi get rid of the smoke from farm fires that make the city a gas chamber every year,” Rai told HT. Reacting to Rai’s comments, PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg denied the charge that Punjab is soft on farm fires, saying the state has already fined 460 erring farmers. “Delhi has made it a habit of blaming Punjab for its poor AQI, which has no link with Punjab farm fires. As for the numbers, it is early harvest and there has been a slight increase in the number of farm fires as compared to the corresponding period last year. Out of 1,900-odd satellite images so far, half have not even been found to be farm fires”, said Garg. Haryana chief secretary, Vijai Vardhan said the state government is monitoring active fire locations twice a day using satellite imagery followed by an on-ground check in every village of paddy-growing districts. “We have appointed nodal officers for every village to get the satellite imagery of active fire locations to verify cases of stubble burning. Agriculture department officials have been empowered to get first information reports lodged against offenders,’’ the chief secretary said. On Friday, Gopal Rai inspected demolition and construction work at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) auditorium and Pragati Maidan and said he found violation of anti-dust measures. Warning of penalties, he said the demolition work would be stopped at FICCI if anti-smog guns were not installed. “Out of 39 major construction sites identified inside Delhi, only six sites have not installed anti-smog guns, one of them is FICCI,” he said in a statement on Friday, adding they found debris lying uncovered on Friday. Despite repeated calls and comments, deputy director (Media) of FICCI Anurag Mankhand did not comment at the time of writing this story.“We instructed them to cover the open debris immediately and not to start working until an anti-smog gun is installed. The person or agency responsible for not following guidelines will be fined as per rules. A notice will be sent to the person/agency concerned,” he said. Earlier this week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had launched a mega action plan as a part of which a ‘green war room’ was set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor steps being taken to bring down pollution levels. To prevent dust pollution, the Delhi government has issued detailed guidelines for small to large construction sites regarding the sprinkling of water, covering of material, movement of vehicles and debris, etc. “Delhi government has made detailed norms for the construction sites and directed all the agencies to follow these norms. Wherever construction work is being done, instructions have been given to follow the given norms. It has been made mandatory to install green parks at all construction sites,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/other-states-not-doing-enough-to-cut-air-pollution-says-delhi-govt/story-chRstlRe0qVvnPcAwNVYDJ.html
10-10-2020||India||Resident doctors of Hindu Rao threaten indefinite strike over pending salaries||Around 250 resident doctors working at North Corporation-run Hindu Rao hospital have threatened to go on a complete strike from Sunday onwards after not receiving their salaries in over 110 days.The doctors, according to a letter submitted by the resident doctors’ association, said they will withdraw from all Covid-related services that they provide if their pending wage dues are not cleared in the next 48 hours. The nursing staff at the hospital too said they will join the doctors in their strike.Hindu Rao hospital is the biggest municipal hospital in Delhi and was designated as a dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility in mid-June during the first surge in cases in Delhi. The hospital has 343 beds and around 250 resident doctors and 350 nursing staff that cater to patients .The resident doctors of the hospital have been observing on a partial ‘pen-down’ strike for three hours daily since September 20 in order to draw attention to their plight.Earlier in June, the Delhi high court had d irected the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to pay the salaries of resident doctors (both juniors and seniors) in six hospitals of the civic body after taking note of newspaper reports about the doctors not having received their salaries since March. In Friday’s letter — addressed to the hospital’s medical superintendent — the resident doctors’ association equated non-payment of wage dues to “penal servitude” and “psychologically and physically distressing”. “Why should doctors and nurses, who are at the forefront of Covid-19 fight, have to go on a strike to ensure that their basic right of getting paid every month is protected. It cannot just be cause the MCD does not have any funds. The corporation generates hundred of crores in taxes every month; do you know how much they need to pay the doctors and nurses in all hospitals and dispensaries run by the north corporation? Just 13 crores,” said Dr Abhinav Sardana, president of the Hindu Rao resident doctors’ association. Although, Friday’s letter states that the doctors would go on a strike from Saturday onwards, the administration has requested them to wait till Sunday at least. “I received the letter of intimation on Friday at 9am and that gives us 48 hours, so the strike will be Sunday onwards. The issue is purely a matter for the headquarters to solve. You have to ask them what is being done,” said Dr Anu Kapoor, medical superintendent Hindu Rao hospital, when asked about the strike threat. The doctors said that they have been facing problems in even buying basic essentials like food items, paying rent, and have trouble getting or paying their EMIs for loans. “I know a person whose husband has been out of job since the lockdown started. She now doesn’t even have enough money to feed her children. Some others have even kicked out of their rented accommodations for defaulting on rent. It is anyway difficult for a doctor working in a Covid-19 hospital to get an accommodation. Even the banks have started refusing loans to us because they ask for payslips of the last few months, and we do not have that,” said Dr Sardana. Sardana added that at present the doctors did not have enough to pay for medicines if they contracted the virus. “If I get sick tomorrow, I will not even have enough to pay for the medicines. The government does not provide us any health cover. And, the schemes by the chief minister and the Prime Minister give compensation only after a healthcare worker has died from Covid-19,” said Dr Sardana. The consultants of the hospital, and others run by the corporation, claimed that they too had not been paid since June. “The last time doctors from Kasturba Hospital went on strike for 15 to 20 days, we were paid a month’s salary for June. We have not been paid since then. But the consultants will not be joining the strike for now,” said Dr Maruti Sinha, secretary of the MCD doctors’ association. “The Supreme Court had taken suo moto congnizance of the matter and the health ministry had said non-payment of salary is an offence under the IPC. But we still do not know who will enforce these directives and against whom action would be taken,” she said. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that he visited the hospital and met the doctors. “I had a discussion with the doctors and have assured them to find a solution at the earliest. I requested them to withdraw the strike, as it is a Covid-dedicated hospital and may have an adverse impact. We will be meeting again tomorrow on the issue.”AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said it was shameful that the BJP is not paying the salaries of doctors “The BJP-ruled MCDs are corrupt and incompetent. In the past five years, the AAP government’s revenue has doubled but in MCDs, only the incomes of councillors have increased,” he said.The BJP hit back, with Praveen Shankar Kapoor, spokesperson, Delhi BJP saying that it is the Arvind Kejriwal government’s denial of constitutional funds to municipal bodies which is responsible for this situation.“As for Bhardwaj saying municipal bodies in other states are doing better, yes that is true. Situation isn’t bad in other cities because there the state government gives constitutional funds to them,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resident-doctors-of-hindu-rao-threaten-indefinite-strike-over-pending-salaries/story-SsnFqlt6YfWemzbkfeaBYK.html
10-10-2020||India||Protests over Stan Swamy arrest in Bhima Koregaon case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 83-year-old activist Father Stan Swamy from Ranchi in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence, officials said on Friday, a move that triggered protests days after Swamy said students and activist were being put “in jail because they have expressed their dissent”.Investigators said that speeches made at an Elgar Parishad event, which was allegedly funded by Maoists, aggravated caste clashes that broke out near Bhima Koregaon village on January 1, 2018. One person died in the clashes that also sparked widespread protests by Dalit groups.An NIA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Swamy was arrested in connection with the violence near Pune. A special NIA court in Mumbai remanded Swamy in judicial custody till October 23 as the probe agency did not seek his remand. He was questioned twice earlier by Pune Police and NIA and was detained from his residence on Thursday evening and placed under arrest later for alleged links with the banned CPI (Maoist), the official said.In a video, which was shot two days before his arrest, Swamy said that he has never been to Bhima Koregaon, “for which I am being made an accused”. “Now they want me to go to Mumbai, which I have said that I won’t go,” he said, referring to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “The Jharkhand state government has given a directive that during the lockdown the elderly people above the age of 65 should not appear in public and if the investigating agency wants to interrogate me, it can do it through video-conferencing,” he said.“...what is happening to me is not something unique happening to me alone, it is a broader process taking place all over the country. We all are aware how prominent intellectuals, lawyers, writers, poets, activists, student leaders are all put in jail because they have expressed their dissent or raised questions about the ruling powers of India,” Swamy said in the video. He said he is part of “the process” and in a way happy to be so because he is not a silent spectator and is part of the game. “I am ready to pay the price whatever be it,” Swamy said.The NIA official said that literature, propaganda material of the CPI (Maoist) and documents related to communications for furthering the group’s programmes were seized from Swamy’s possession.The activist is the 16th person to be arrested in the case, in which people have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Bhima Koregaon case was taken over by the NIA on January 24 this year.In a statement, about 2,000 activists from across the country condemned the arrest of the 83-year-old and said the move was an attack on all those working for human and constitutional rights in Jharkhand.“We, the undersigned, strongly condemn the arrest of Jharkhand’s Stan Swamy by the NIA in the Bhima-Koregaon case on the evening of 8 October 2020. Stan Swamy, 84 years old, is a valued and public-spiritedness citizen who has worked for Adivasi rights since decades in Jharkhand,” the statement, released by the Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch, a body of civil society groups in the state, said.The statement, signed by economist Jean Drèze, Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar, lawyer Rebecca John and activist Aruna Roy among others termed the case as “baseless fabrication” by the government.“The central government, in the guise of the Bhima Koregaon case, is trying to build a false narrative of a national Maoist conspiracy against these activists. The main objective of the case is to target and harass activists who work for the rights of Adivasis, Dalits and the marginalised and raise questions against the anti-people policies of the government,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-over-stan-swamy-arrest-in-bhima-koregaon-case/story-SkhsKDYYuKDDedaWNBKfsJ.html
10-10-2020||India||Jyotiraditya Scindia hits out at Opposition over ‘baseless charges’||Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia hit out at his political rivals on Friday, saying that a recent controversy over a piece of land in possession with the Scindia trust was ancestral property and that leaders from Congress should instead explain how “they have become new maharajas”.The MP made the remarks while interacting with journalists in Gwalior as political campaigning intensifies in the run-up to the November 3 bypolls to 28 assembly constituencies.  “The Congress leaders who have become new Maharajas (royals) are making allegations about land which is with my family for 300 years. If it is wrong to be born into such a family, then I admit my mistake,” Scindia said. Congress leaders have been levelling allegations against Scindia since he quit the party and joined the BJP, including allegations about land in possession of Scindia trust. Scindia said: “To me politics is a means to serve people... I have visited the constituencies in the past five months even after being affected with Covid-19 infection, to ensure development. The BJP’s 15-year rule was followed by Congress’s misrule in 15 months. Now, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and I are working together for progress and development of the state including Gwalior-Chambal region.” Of the 28 seats up for the bypolls, 16 fall in the Gwalior-Chambal region —Scindia’s home turf, which the Congress party swept in the assembly elections under his leadership. Scindia joined the BJP in March along with several loyalists, many of whom are up for election now as BJP candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scindia-hits-out-at-oppn-over-baseless-charges/story-UIm0VKVxpHyggpGIRcnvEK.html
10-10-2020||India||Karti Chidambaram asks House panel to probe TRP case||Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Friday wrote to the chairperson of the parliamentary Standing Committee on information technology, Shashi Tharoor, urging him look into reports suggesting manipulation in TRP ratings of news channels. Karti requested Tharoor to take up the issue and call officials of the Union information and broadcasting ministry to seek clarification and suggest remedial measures. The panel may have a detailed discussion on the issue, people aware of the matter said. In his letter, Karti said the recent issue surrounding TRP of television channels has cast doubts on the legitimacy and reliability of the system. “TRPs produce essential data on television audiences in India and have become the primary basis for advertising decisions. Government advertising expenditure depends on this system, but public spending should not be based on flawed data,” he said. The letter came a day after Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh claimed that at least three channels, including Republic TV, had manipulated TRPs. “There is a need for further understanding this situation. In light of this, it is important that the standing committee take up this issue,” Karti said. “Therefore, I request you to call before the Committee concerned officials of the responsible ministry, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, to seek necessary clarification on the current situation and remedial measures,” he added. Karti’s party colleague and former Union I&B minister Manish Tewari echoed similar sentiments. He said the entire paradigm of TRP has vitiated the broadcasting industry, especially the news media, and it should be seriously taken up by Parliament and the government. Republic has denied the charges and said it will sue Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karti-asks-house-panel-to-probe-trp-case/story-OZidlEzPP181H5HuVdw5YM.html
